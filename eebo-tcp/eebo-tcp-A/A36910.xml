            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>High Court</hi> forbad all Introductory <hi>Prefaces</hi> and <hi>Addresses,</hi> because they hated Affected Ornaments, and what was not <hi>to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> in their Discourses. VVe are as willing to follow 'em as possible; and the Subject of this Book being Abstracts, it wou'd be very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable to make a Tedious Preface to it: VVe shall only tell the Reader, what he is to expect from this VVork, and then leave it to its sate.</p>
            <p>The Catalogue whereof it is compos'd, was made by our Bookseller, and a stranger to our <hi>Society,</hi> and was publisht to the VVorld before we ever saw it, or had the least notice of the Design. The Collections being not <hi>over regular,</hi> neither as to the sorting them; nor (which is worse) as to the Subject Matter it self: However, the Design appeared so serviceable to the Age, that <hi>Subscriptions</hi> came very plentifully in; and the whole was put out to be Translated.</p>
            <p>VVhen it came to be Revis'd by our <hi>Society,</hi> and some of us had engag'd to VVrite the <hi>Essay,</hi> and an <hi>Original Treatise on the Masore and punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the Hebrew Text,</hi> we found the VVork very dangerous and difficult, especially in these particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Several things in Divinity were taken out of the Republick of Letters, which pass'd through the hands of the French Divines, and where there were such Doctrines laid down, as we thought very unsafe to publish in a Protestant Nation; where 'tis impossible not to find some who are weak and unsetled in our Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Most of the Fathers that were promis'd, had met with the same fate, and were so much Iesuitiz'd, that we knew no more of 'em but the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the rest was what the Papal Interest was pleas'd to make 'em speak.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> There were several Titles of Books in our Booksellers Catalogue, which were found in the Catalogues of the <hi>Universal Bibliotheque, Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal des Scavans,</hi> &amp;c. which those Authors themselves had barely set down, and not made any Abstract of 'em; So that 'twas impossible to Translate what was not, those Authors having forgot them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103507:4"/>VVe have undertaken to redress these Mischiefs, and we hope in such a Method, as the Age may rather be a gainer by the disappointment.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> As to the first, we have prevail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d with our Bookseller, contrary to his Interest, to expunge 'em entirely, and to make a better Catalogue in their Room, as it was easie enough to do, in so fair a Field of Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, amongst <hi>40</hi> or <hi>50</hi> Volumes, which he had to choose out of.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> As to the Second, VVe have consider'd the Learned <hi>Dupin's</hi> VVorks, which are here translated; as also <hi>Dr. Cave's Lives of the Fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs;</hi> which, with those <hi>Fathers</hi> that were not Corrupted in these Translations, do altogether remedy that Evil, and give a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Account of what we found so miserably mangled and corrupted by the Iesuits beyond Sea.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> VVe cou'd have no remedy, but to choose out other Subjects, which we hope have exceeded those few that were thus promis'd, and we dare venture the Iudgment of the severest Criticks upon it.</p>
            <p>In fine the Reader is not at all a loser in the Exchange, either in the Number or Quality of Books; for, as they may be assured we had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in expunging some, and putting in others, which we cou'd yet wish had been more; so we shou'd hardly put in worse than those we took out; having, perhaps, as much Iudgment in Books, as the first Single Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, and our Bookseller— But, to do our Bookseller Iustice in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, we shall acquaint the World, that he very readily offer'd to add <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en Sheets more, than the Proposals, for the same Money, to wit, <hi>130,</hi> instead of <hi>120;</hi> and this after he had receiv'd a deal of Subscription-Money, because he wou'd have the Work Compleat and Perfect, and lay more than a Common Obligation upon his Subscribers; perhaps there has not been another such an Instance to be found amongst those of his Calling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Bookseller</hi> has been extreamly harass'd about a Speedy Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which, above all Men, he has least deserv'd; for there's no body more diligent, in his Employ, than himself, as every body of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance will acknowledge. There were Six Presses at work; Mr. <hi>Rush-worth's Collections</hi> were in the Press at the same time; and there were <hi>Six Weeks Frost</hi> which hindred the Printers; therefore no Reasonable Person can suppose our Bookseller careless<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Affair, or responsible for things out of his Power.</p>
            <p>We have also to Advertise, that the Author of the <hi>Hebrew Punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,</hi> has retir'd into the Countrey, where his necessary business will take up a great part of his time; yet whatever Letters, Objections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall be sent to him about his Performance, if they be directed to our Bookseller, they will come to his hands, and he will, notwithstanding his business, set apart so much time as to maintain what he has advanc'd, and to Answer all Objections whatever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103507:4"/>The Reader is to expect one other Inconvenience, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most impossible to be avoided; in having to do with six Presses, the Abstracts are not exactly placed, <hi>Dupin's</hi> Works being divided, one Volume in one place, and another in another; but the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will rectifie that Error, only in one place the Printer has through a Mistake broken off in the midst of <hi>Bishop Ushers</hi> Works, <hi>p. 37.</hi> and began another Subject, and what shou'd have follow'd is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to <hi>page 65.</hi> which the Reader is desir'd to Correct, and make a note of Reference with his Pen. <hi>And also instead of</hi> The <hi>(the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction word in page 316) should be</hi> Apostolici.</p>
            <p>He that translated above an hundred of these Sheets, is a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> a Stranger to us; and tho' we have revis'd all, we cou'd not possibly give the Style a new Air and turn, unless we had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wholly alter'd it, which wou'd have been so much labour, that we had better to have translated all over again; However this we can say for the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that its greatest Fault is, <hi>that it keeps too n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ar the</hi> Original which the severest searcher after Truth will not be sorry to find, for there's less Error in such a Translation, than in one where an affected profuse Liberty is assumed.</p>
            <p>And after all, we can't promise that in this hasty Review, we have been rigid enough in our Examination, only we hope there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very Material, and if so, a few small defects may easily be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd by the Ingenious, when they reflect of what great Vse this <hi>YOUNG STUDENTS LIBRARY</hi> will be to the World, of which we shall now speak a word or two.</p>
            <p>This Book is a <hi>kind of a Common Theatre</hi> where every person may Act, or take such Part as pleases him best, and what he does not like, he may pass over, assuring himself that every ones Iudgment not being like his, another may choose what he mislikes, and so every one may be pleas'd in their Turns.</p>
            <p>A Book of this Nature (provided every one follows the Rule just now laid down) will solve the Common Complaint of Authors, viz. <hi>that it's impossible to please every Body,</hi> for there's scarce any one that can't find some Subjects here very agreeable to his Iudgment, which, if it alters, may be refurnisht, either by something new, or perhaps by the very same things that displeas'd before. Only here's one Inconvenience depends upon this Variety, <hi>to wit,</hi> The unsetling people in their Iudgments and Perswasions: To such we answer, That what we here offer to the VVorld, is rather a History of Books, than a Method for people to fix their Iudgments by. Here are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Subjects, and some such as are diversely treated of, but this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not the profit of the Reader, since 'tis universally granted, that Diversity and Opposition shew the way to Truth: It wou'd be an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Task to Comment upon every good Thing, that we find abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our Hand, or to expect that we shou'd censure what we find disagreeable to our Iudgments: 'tis enough to expunge such things in <hi>Divinity</hi> where Fundamentals are attaque'd by <hi>Libe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These Treatises are not only pleasant as to their Variety, but use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for their Brevity, there being the Substance and Value of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Part of a good Library, brought within the Compass of this one Volume; which as it will spare much Labour, a man being able to peruse here more of an Author in half an hour, than in half a day in the Author himself, so it will save a great deal of Expences, to such as wou'd be Master of the Knowledge of many Books, by laying out a little Mony, the performances of the Author (and Quality if known) being here Epitomiz'd, and such as wou'd see more than o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>That there can be no Convenience without its Inconvenience we are satisfi'd, and it may be alledg'd that <hi>Compendia sunt Dispendia,</hi> but that this is an Error, we dare appeal to the Encouragements that the <hi>Journal des Scavans,</hi> the <hi>Republique des Lettres</hi> and the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selle Bibliotheque, &amp;c.</hi> (out of which these Abstracts are Translated) have met with, from all the Men of Letters beyond Sea. So that it must first be shewed, that what has been so universally approved by the Ingenious in other Nations, shou'd not also meet with the same Success here amongst us, when Translated into <hi>English,</hi> which to doubt wou'd be to question the Capacity, Spirit and penetrating <hi>Genius</hi> of our Nation.</p>
            <p>In fine, We hope the Iudicious Reader, will also pardon the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>AN ESSAY Upon all sorts of LEARNING, Written by the Athenian Society:</head>
                  <head>Of Learning in General.</head>
                  <p>HAppiness is the end of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Intelligent Being, for this we Court whatever appears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to us, some seek it in Riches and Preferments, some in Gratifying their senses, but the Wise Man pursues it in such refin'd speculations as are most becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dignity of his Nature. He that knows most comes nearest to the perfection of his Maker, and who can transcribe a fairer Copy than he that imitates the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wisdom?</p>
                  <p>'Tis the first question in Philosophy, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a thing be or exist</hi>? because 'twoud be a fruitless Labour to search into the Nature of that which has no Being, but the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal consent of Humanity about the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries after Wisdom resolves this first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. And it won't be altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to examine here the reasons of these Inquiries. That which puts in for prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence amongst the rest, is the Analogy betwixt the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi> the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Mind and Science.</p>
                  <p>The spirit of man is continually upon the Wing, Visiting every Element and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (more or less) the Treasuries of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Storing up from thence what his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination dictates, and if he fails in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation he makes a second Choice and so on.</p>
                  <p>Nor does this different Genius of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons lessen the truth of our Maxim, as to the Analogy betwixt the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Science</hi> but rather confirm it, for tho' some chuse <hi>Evil</hi> or <hi>Ignorance,</hi> 'tis under the notion of <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Science</hi>; for to pursue Evil as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is impossible, 'tis a rape upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Will, and to Chuse <hi>Ign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rance</hi> as <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> is a Contradiction, for when a Man chuses to be ignorant of such a Science, 'tis because he wou'd discover some other good in the absence of it; Nay even in self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction where the <hi>Wretched</hi> promise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves an Ignorance of all their Evils 'tis not so much to avoid their Evils as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover some unknown rest in their Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being. So unaccountably desirous is Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind of new discoveries (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves) <hi>the happy are weary of pleasure, and even seek out misery for a Change,</hi> and we must believe him a Schismatic from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, that disclaims a Propriety in some sort of Knowledge and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>Twou'd be a tedious and unprofitable task to make a particular Survey of the infinite variety and different application of Humane Studies, and 'tis an unhappy truth, that for the most part the Body comes in for a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger share than the Mind, the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this are postpon'd to the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that; because appearances have brib'd so many Judgments from making a strict examination, and amongst those few that pretend to enquiries, how small a number can perfect the attempt without prejudices. Hence it is that true Honour is baffled and outrival'd by dress, challenges Pageantry and Gay Retinues. True nobility is the effect of a Pious and Learned Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; A noble Custom of the Mind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises an happy Harvest of a flourishing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, it fixes Crowns by Counsel, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents and resolves the Riddles of Plots and Insurrections, it procures the Love of wise Men, and the reverence of Fools, settles a reputation that outbraves the ruines of Age, the Revolutions of Empires; in short it teaches us to be Happy; since it's a friend to both the Mind and Body, and secures an interest in both Worlds. A Doctor of the Civil Law who had more Estate than Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, had the honour of Knighthood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon him by <hi>Sigismund</hi> the Emperor, whereupon he began to value himself more, and his old acquaintance less, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror hearing of it, and meeting him at the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> he publickly accosted him in these words, — <hi>Fool who preferrest
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:103507:6"/>
Knighthood before Learning, the gingles of fame before the true worth of the Mind, I can coin a thousand Knights in one Day, but not one Doctor in a thousand years</hi>; Who can be proud of his debts, or any advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which are not the effects of his own Merit, but of Nature or Providence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ridiculous and attracting a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter blemish than an Hereditary Estate can compensate? Wou'd a Gentleman deserve his Name and the gifts of Nature, his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy must be the Laws of Nations, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Common-Wealths, the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of such as by their own virtue have ennobled mean Families and other such tasks as Learning and Knowledge may sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest to him. How many feeble Families are degenerated into contempt and baseness for want of such a Study, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now are, and have been always mean and contemptible for being haters of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal Truants from the School of Learning and Vertue.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> whose observations have deservedly Characteriz'd him a wise Man, tells us, <hi>That Learning is the perfection of Reason, the only Note of distinction between Men and Beasts, delivering the Mind from Wilderness and Barbarism, It is Religions Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid the great Honour and Accomplishment of a Person or Nation, the most Vniversal and useful Interest that God vouchsafeth to the Sons of Men. Cato's distich</hi> deserves the Study of more than School-boys.</p>

                     <p>'Tis a good argument that's that Truth, <hi>which has Happiness annext to it,</hi> that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of Scripture are such, is evident from the Atheists own principles, and therefore to be embrac'd by 'em, whether of Divine Institution or not. But we thus prove it of Divine Institution; It is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd unto us, and since it is deliver'd, it must be either, by <hi>God, Good spirits,</hi> or <hi>bad ones, good Men</hi> or <hi>bad Men,</hi> or by <hi>Persons distracted,</hi> which properly come under nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denomination; if by <hi>God,</hi> 'tis true, if by <hi>good Spirits</hi> they being not prejudic'd by <hi>Passion, Interest, Ignorance, &amp;c.</hi> and acting dependantly, it must also be true, <hi>ill Spirits</hi> could not give it, for <hi>Satan</hi> can't be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against <hi>Satan,</hi> or act against his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest with destroying his Kingdom; but why speak we of Spirits, since their very essence is deny'd? which also secures that point to us, for what has not a Being, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not impose upon the World, that neither good nor bad Men could deliver it of their own minds is plain, <hi>since nothing can act beyond its power,</hi> but 'tis beyond the light of Nature or acquir'd Reason, to Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and deliver such mysterious Truths as humane reason an't prey into, as the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of God,</hi> the <hi>Trinity in Vnity, &amp;c.</hi> nor could it be the issue of any <hi>distracted brain,</hi> or accidental fortuitous discovery spoken without thinking, since the effects of all promises and threatnings are so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and pertinent, and as certainly come to pass, for as far as any one ever yet try'd, whereas had they been of humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they wou'd like <hi>Fortune-telling</hi> or the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Astrology,</hi> sometimes hit, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times miss, Besides had Men been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, they wou'd have had the fate of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writings, <hi>been lost,</hi> or barbarous, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated or refin'd in the succession of so long a tract of time, and in going through so many hands, Friends and Enemies, Fools and Wise; in short, should all Mankind joyn their different sentiments and every rational Person amongst 'em give in their answers to this question, <hi>suppose this Sacred Wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A Happiness, worthy the Dignity and Nature of Mankind, in short, such a Happiness as <hi>Man</hi> was Created for, unless he himself frustrate his own End. I have already made a short Comparison of the Sacred Writ with other moral Writings, which appear but mean in respect of it. Not that I wou'd deny a due value to others, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Divinity Books as Comments upon the Bible, and distinct Treatises, whose Subject in general, is to remove all Obstructions of human Happiness, as Prejudices, Error, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to prepare the Mind for a search after Truth. In order to this great End it will not be amiss to subjoyn this following Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, which will be of great use to such as love this Study.</p>

                     <p>HISTORY has been call'd, by a great Man, <hi>Speculum Mundi:</hi> The Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glass of the World; It gives the best prospect into Humane Affairs, and makes us familiar with the remotest Regions: by this we safely sit in our Closets, and view the horrid Devastations of Countreys, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, Changes and Ruptures of Common-Wealths; The Reverse of Fortunes, the Religions, Politicks and Governments of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations; by this we may consult what practices have Establish'd Kingdoms, what Laws have render'd any particular Nation more Safe, happy and Civiliz'd than its Neighbours; and, what has Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Weakness and Overthrow of Bodies-Politick, and what has Facilitated its Rise and Settlement; and, in a Prospect of the whole, a New Scheme may be drawn, for future Ages to act by.</p>

                     <p>Wisdom got by Experience is usually ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Expensive, Tedious and Uncertain; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Experiences confirm ones Knowledge, and a Man's Life is too little to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in every Case; But if he finds e'm faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done to his hands, the labour is sav'd, and he may grow wise at the expence of other Mens Studies. It was <hi>Thales</hi> that said of History, <hi>Nil Mortem à vita differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>; because the Life of the Deceased de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the remembrance of the Living. Mr. <hi>Brathwait,</hi> in his Nursery for Gentry, says; <hi>Wou'd you be enabled for Company? no better Medium than Knowledge in History.</hi> It wou'd be a dispraise to advance an Elogy upon this Study, which reconciles all times but futurity, renders all the spatious Globe of the Inhabited World common and familiar to a Man that never Travelled: We may see all <hi>Asia, Africa</hi> and <hi>America</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; all the Confederate Countreys in ones <hi>Closet:</hi> Encompass the World with <hi>Drake</hi>; make New Discoveries with <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus</hi>; Visit the Grand Seignior in the <hi>Seraglio</hi>; Converse with <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi>; Consult with <hi>Alexander, Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey:</hi> In a word, whatever Humanity has done that's Noble, Great and Surprizing, either by Action, or Suffering, may, by us, be done over again in the Theory; and if we have Souls capable of Transcribing the bravest Copies, we may meet Instances worth our Emulation. History is, as by some, called the <hi>World's Recorder</hi>; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Lord <hi>Montague,</hi> we must confess, <hi>That no wise Man can be an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd Statist, that was not frequent in Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Another tells us, <hi>That to be acquainted with History, purchases more wisdom than the Strictest Rules of Policy; for that the first do furnish us with Instances as well as Rules, and, as it were, personates the Rule, drawing out more into full proportion:</hi> History best suits the Solidest Heads; Whence we find, that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> made it his Comment. We read, that King <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> by Reading <hi>Livy,</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand of Sicily,</hi> by Reading <hi>Quintus Curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> recovered their Health, when all the Physical Doses they took prov'd ineffectual; but, whether 'tis Friendly to the Body or not, 'tis not our business to determine: Sure we are, that 'tis Friendly to the Mind, cultivates and informs it in what is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to its Nature, we mean Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, therein imitating its Divine Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
                     <p>History is the most admirable foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Politicks; by this may be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that's necessary for a Kingdoms Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Peace; the Stratagems of War; an account of the Management of the deepest Plots and Contrivances, and the carrying on such Measures for every Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affair, whether in respect to Enemies or Allies, as the deepest Heads have ever yet practis'd. And, as History is so useful to such as are intrusted with the Charge of Common-wealths, so 'tis not less necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Settling and Establishment of the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> We find a Great part of the World Worship Inanimate Beings; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sacrifice to Devils, others propagate a Worship made up of the most ridiculous Fables, as the <hi>Turks,</hi> &amp;c. and many that profess the Christian Religion, are so far degenerated from the Native Simplicity and Purity of it, as that 'tis now another thing.</p>
                     <p>A Reasonable Creature, born into the World, and finding in himself a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Adoration of some <hi>Vnknown Being,</hi> can't forbear an Enquiry into Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but when he finds so many Religions, so great a Diversity of Divine Worship, and every Party willing to believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Right, and condemning all the rest of Mankind that are not of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: This is enough to surprize such a Person; but, at the same time, he will make this necessary Consequence, after a little thought and application of Mind: <hi>Certain I am that there's a God; and, as certain, that this God ought to be Worshipped after such a manner, as is most Suitable to his Nature, and the quality of the Worshipper: as to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it's too fine and Spiritual to be pleas'd with any Adoration but what is Spiritual; and as for Man, the Creature that is to pay this Homage and Adoration, he is a Reasonable Being; and therefore it's also Necessary, that the Worship he pays, be the most reasonable and perfect that his Nature will admit of.</hi> Now a Man needs not go out of himself to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult what Reason is; he has no more to do, than to see, what Religion is most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his Reason, and most worthy the Dignity of his Nature (we speak here of unprejudic'd persons.) And then History will inform him what has been practis'd; and shew him, that Christianity is the most noble, sincere, and pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the World: but, in this we refer

                     <p>There only remains to inform our <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> That 'tis not onely <hi>Books,</hi> but <hi>Maps, Monuments, Bass-Reliefs, Medals,</hi> and all Antient Descriptions, that mightily strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and confirm History; therefore 'twou'd be very useful to read such Authors, as have treated upon <hi>Medals,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <head>Philosophy.</head>
                     <p>PHILOSOPHY may be consider'd under these two Heads, <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral:</hi> The first of which, by Reason of the strange Alterations that have been made in it, may be again Subdivided into <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>Experimental.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Speculative</hi> Philosophy was mostly the Study of the Antients; not that they were without some little of the Practick and Demonstration, especially in <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It wou'd be too long to run through the several Orders and Practices of the Eastern Philosophers, where we may properly say Mankind took its Original, that is, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the ways of Living with safety, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and delight. The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Assyrians</hi> made some small progress before the Eastern parts, but it was so dark, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious and hieroglyphical, and so confin'd to a certain sort of Men, that the VVorld was but little the better for it; but for a fuller Account of the Manner of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, the different Sects that patroniz'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> VVe refer you to the Abstract of <hi>Stanlyes Lives of the Philosophers,</hi> which you shall find in this Book; Our chief design in this Essay being to shew the Usefulness of it, and the readiest way to attain it.</p>
                     <p>But, first, we must consider, the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we have made of <hi>Speculative</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental,</hi> and, as much as possible, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the first, for an indefatigable and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Search into Natural Experiments, they being only the Certain, Sure Method to gather a true Body of Philosophy; for the Antient Way of clapping up an entire building of Sciences, upon pure Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, may make indeed an <hi>Admirable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,</hi>
                        <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:103507:8"/>
but the Materials are such as can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise no lasting one. Hence 'twas that our ever Famous <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY</hi> that Great Enfranchizer of Experimental Truth and Knowledge assum'd the <hi>Motto Nullius in Verba.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great <hi>Vse</hi> then of Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, whose true Origine depends upon <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,</hi> is manifold, one can scarce think of any Affair in a practical Life, any Imploy, Profession or Business whatever but may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great Advantages from it: Nor is the Usefulness of it in the private Government of mens Minds less than its Advantages in respect of their publick Practices.</p>
                     <p>This is very apparent, if we consider that our Mind has a great dependance upon our Body's. Hence the Poets wish had a happy Conjunction in't <hi>Mens sana in Corpore sano</hi>; the least disturbance to the Body, incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the Mind from a free and easie Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, an unfortunate Blow, sometimes, wholly takes away the Use of Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, and on the contrary, a healthful and sound Body facilitates the Labours of the Mind: Now, no Man can be so insensible, as not to see the vast <hi>Usefulness</hi> of this Science to the Body, and how properly 'tis call'd <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philosophy,</hi> not to mention the great Delight and Satisfaction the Mind receives in Theory of it, either by Converse or Reading.</p>
                     <p>But when we come to Practice, all the World agrees in a common Suffrage. All the Mechanick Arts acknowledge the Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, both in new Inventions and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of what things are already found out: Merchandize, the main Sinew of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Politick,</hi> ows its great Assistance to the Invention of the Compass, and if Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement were given, no doubt but the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of finding out a Longitude at Sea might make this universal Correspondence of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more safe, speedy, and by consequence more Advantagious, we being very well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that such a Task is not impossible. But Experiments are not only confin'd to the Sea abroad; All domestick Affairs have a very great share in this Study, and the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits accrewing from it, as Instruments for the Help and greater Perfection of the Senses than former Ages knew of, <hi>viz. Microscopes, Otocoustions, &amp;c.</hi> Engines and Devices for the speedier making of all Manufactures. Now Methods of Improving Lands, restoring the Barrenness of Soyl, Management of Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture. The bettering of Corn, Fruit, &amp;c. in short for the greatest Advantages of a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Life, which <hi>Adams</hi> Transgression has subjected his Posterity to.</p>
                     <p>As to Moral Philosophy, the well gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Mens Lives and Manners, it has been a Subject very nobly treated on by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Seneca, Epicurus, Epictetus,</hi> and several of the Antient Philosophers. 'Tis a faint Essay to Christianity, and those Precepts that have been laid down by those Great Men; are so far both beyond the Knowledge and Practice of most Christians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we doubt not but at the day of Judgment, they will condemn them. We might add more, and say, we doubt not but that they may easily be sav'd, and share of as great Degrees of Glory as many Christians, <hi>Ro.</hi> 2.14. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with <hi>v.</hi> 12. shews that <hi>Heathens</hi> have a Law of Nature, which dictates the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, Justice, Temperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that they shall be judg'd (neither by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Christianity, or Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but) by this Law, and if they sin against it, they shall perish by it, Now 'tis plain, that the <hi>Antithesis</hi> holds, that if they act agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to it, they shall be saved by it: Nor will that Text exclude 'em that says, <hi>There's no name under Heaven given, whereby we may be saved, but by the Name of the Lord Iesus.</hi> For it's a plain Consequence, that if they believe on God, they also believe virtually in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who is of the same Essence or one God with his Father, that this virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Belief is that which will save Men, and not the bare Nominal Letters that make up the Name of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> is plain from the different Sounds and Expressions in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nations: Besides, if we believe on <hi>Emanuel, Shiloh, &amp;c.</hi> 'tis the same thing; and this is yet plainer, when we consider that some good Christians born deaf and dumb, have by outward Signs and Motions receiv'd a very fair <hi>Idea</hi> or virtual Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and have liv'd and dy'd without ever hearing of the Name. Lastly, without this virtual Power, all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren wou'd certainly be damn'd, whether bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd or not, which the Christian Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet believ'd since it was a Church: But to leave this Digression, the Advantage and Use of Moral Philosophy can't want a high Recommendation, when we see it gives so lively a Prospect, of all those Virtues and Qualifications that Christianity sets in a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Light. That 'tis a fair <hi>Prodromus</hi> to Christianity, and prepares the Mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> did the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Iews</hi> to Receive Christ. The Morals of <hi>Seneca</hi> say, <hi>qui poenitet peccâsse penè est in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocens, he that repents of having done an ill thing, is not guilty of it:</hi> And thus the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Oracles,</hi> he that <hi>confesseth and forsaketh his sins shall find Mercy.</hi> It wou'd be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to bring all the Parallels we find be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Morals of the <hi>Wise Heathens</hi> and the Precepts of Christianity, 'tis in part done in the following Pages, whither we refer the Reader, as also to this following Catalogue for his Improvement in Natural and Moral Philosophy.</p>

                     <head>LAW.</head>
                     <p>THis is a very fair Subject, and those that cannot find some <hi>Encomium</hi> upon it, are either very ingrateful, or very stupid to be insensible of the Protection of their Persons, Estates, Liberties every day, for if there was no Justice for the oppressed, no Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for <hi>Murder, Violence, Theft, &amp;c.</hi> no Person cou'd promise himself one days Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from such Evils.</p>
                     <p>If we shou'd go to the Original of Laws, 'tis very probable that People were civiliz'd and reduc'd from their <hi>Barbarity</hi> by little and little, and made their Laws according to the Incommodities of their Crimes, yet Vice being prolifick, and restrain'd in a few Particulars, wou'd still find out more ways of Action, and exert it self in new Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, till they were also provided against. I know not what to attribute it to, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a common, or an extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that some Countries have been happier than others under very irregular Laws, for Instance, <hi>Sparta</hi> had many strange Laws, and some even contrary to good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as the Toleration of Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet none of its Neighbours flourisht like it for a very considerable time. Perhaps the Reason was, that being all made by one Man, they had a sort of natural Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon one another, and one preserv'd the other, like a piece of Building, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd by one Person, when as we see Streets and Towns, which are the <hi>Projection</hi> of many Heads, so irregular and independant, as if they had been the Design of Chance or unreasonable Creatures. However 'twas, we are certain, that these Laws were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very wisely contriv'd, if we consider the Principles of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the <hi>Legislator.</hi> Now if natural Policy could make that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more happy than its Neighbours, what may we expect from Christian Laws, which besides their own <hi>Simplicity and Purity,</hi> back'd by the Advantages which they have taken out of the Records of the <hi>Iewish State,</hi> have also the Presidents of all Common-wealths, out of which they may choose what has been most Advantagious, and avoid what has been any ways pernicious, and from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together lay down an exact Model for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, very just, reasonable and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence Happy.</p>
                     <p>Now to give ones self up to this Study of Equity, and distributive Justice, as 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry necessary for the <hi>Subject,</hi> so 'tis very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and profitable for the <hi>Undertaker.</hi> How can we be ignorant of the Honour of the Law? when we find God Almighty himself a <hi>Legislator,</hi> the very first Instituter of Laws. My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> in his Reports says, that <hi>they</hi> (viz. Reports) <hi>Open the Windows of the Law, shewing the Beauty of it in the great Reason it stands on; breaking the Shell of difficult Cases, so that the Kernel slips into ones hands.</hi> Another, <hi>Pleadings are the most honourable, laudable and profitable things in the Law.</hi> Perhaps the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Custom of the <hi>Athenians</hi> might be grounded upon this: For they put their Young Gentlemen to prefer <hi>Cases</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the People, or pleading for the Poor. To be well Read in the Law, is not only a very great Ornament to Gentlemen, but also a very necessary Qualification, since those that have Estates shou'd know how to defend and keep 'em, left by unwariness and want of Knowledge in those Matters, they ruine themselves and Families; besides such Gentlemen may be great Helps to their poor Neighbours and Tenants, by reconciling their Differences, and helping to right the Innocent against the Oppressor.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis not only Gentlemen, but all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatever that have any Concern in the World, are oblig'd to know the Law, at least in some measure in order to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their Affairs, as Contracts, Bonds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this Obligation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the weight of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the nature of their Imploy.</p>
                     <p>Besides all this, persons may possibly act so as to bring themselves under the Censure of the Law (perhaps sometimes the severest) for want of the little knowledge of it; wherefore 'tis very necessary for all young Persons to frequent the <hi>Sessions,</hi> and the <hi>Bar,</hi> for instruction; whereby they may be able to defend themselves against their own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and the malice of others. In short the use of Law can't be question'd by any Person who want not the use of his Reason. Since without it we should only be proper company for Wolves and Bears, I mean he that had the longest Sword wou'd command the shorter, tho' even this same Tyranny that wou'd exalt a man above his fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wou'd also set him in so slippery a place that envy wou'd certainly find him out, and make him despicable by some means or other, to the meanest wretch he cou'd tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon, whereas on the contrary Justice and Truth settle a State, and make not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     <p>THis Practice is only of present use to such as are not well, but since no man is exempt or priviledg'd from sickness and death, every one carrying his death about him, which will be sometimes exerting its self in little Essays of Mortality, I mean in Distempers and Irregularities of that frame of Nature, which it will one day wholly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and lay in Ashes, since I say every one is subject, one time or other, to disorders and Maladies in his Body, (for a Body can't be destroyed before it be disordered) 'tis a plain consequence that all have occasion some time or other to repair the decays of Nature by Physick and Surgery. To ask a sick man whether he wou'd be well, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable ridicule; Nature has plac'd in every Being an abhorrence of destruction, and this abhorrence necessarily puts the assaulted upon all possible means of defending it self; Why do we eat when hungry, drink when thirsty, sleep when weary, but to repair the defects of Nature; and if 'tis impossible not to desire this, 'tis much more impossible not to see the ends of these defects, I mean Death.</p>
                     <p>As man was first made out of the dust, so he has almost Universal Remedies from the Earth whence he was taken; out of Herbs, Roots, Minerals, &amp;c. are made such Compositions, as cure Wounds, Bruises and other distempers; for finding their old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance man in the Application, they by a kind of Natural friendship and cognation, with mans Body, joyn with him against the Efforts of the distemper. The Earth is our common Mother as to our Bodies, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture succours her Children.</p>
                     <p>A skilful Physician does, as we may say, cooperate with God Almighty and is a means to preserve what he Creates, If we search the Sacred Writ, we find the use of Physicians recommended, and only censur'd where they are prefer'd to God, as if they were not subordinate, and of the number of those Means which God has ordained to preserve humane life, but purely indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, acting like God himself. We also find <hi>Luke</hi> a Physician, a familiar of St. <hi>Pauls.</hi> If we consult profane History, we meet with no Nation without some whose whole Study and Employ is Physick: and some have been so very expert in this Art, that they have boasted they cou'd make themselves immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, but their failure has experienc'd the contrary; Tho we are very well satisfied that there is no set time or limited period under the common course of Nature, to wit, 70 or 80 years, but that (ordinarily) reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be used to lengthen a mans Life till then, or violences suffer'd to shorten it before, for there have never yet been any reasons produced by the most Learned main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers

                     <p>Chymistry &amp; Alchimy especially the first, have made no small additions to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of this Study, indeed the last pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mostly to the separation and alteration of Metals has very ill luck in some of its pretences, tho' in most vain and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant search it has casually made many other useful discoveries, and seems to be calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Moral of a Fable we meet with in <hi>Aesop,</hi> only 'tis subsequent to it. 'Tis the fable of the Husband-man, who dying, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd to his Son a vast Treasure of Gold, hid in his Vineyard, but the certain place where it lay he had wholly forgot. The Son diligently searcheth, turns over every place throughout the whole Vineyard, but finds nothing worthy of his vast toil. Yet this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour accidentally had good effect on the Vines, by the product of a very plentiful Harvest the following year. <note place="margin">Ld. <hi>Bacon.</hi>

                     <p>TO Number, is one of the Prerogatives that a Reasonable Creature has over Beasts. 'Tis said, Wisdom II. <hi>God made all things in Number, Weight and Measure.</hi> Number is a most sensible Exemplar of the Deity, of whom you can't conceive so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perfections, but you may yet add more. This is onely peculiar to it, that we know the least Number, <hi>viz.</hi> 2. (for 1 is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Origine of Numbers) but we can find no Number so great, that may not be made yet greater; for if a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Figures were writ down, and under them a Thousand more, and multiplyed the one by the other, the product wou'd be more than the Sands of the Sea, which multiply'd again into its self, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us'd after the same manner, and so on, the number wou'd soon amount to such a Total, as wou'd take up an Age to tell the length of it in words; even though a Man never slept, but always spoke. The Antient Philosophers might well compare the Essences of things to Number, since a Number is a Compleat Total, and if it lose any the least part of it self, 'tis no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the same Number. Indeed we can't hold with the Antient <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> and <hi>Platonists,</hi> that all things are Compos'd of Number, even the Soul of Man; but we are certain, the proportions resulting from 'em, are such, as may claim an Agreeable Converse with our Reason.</p>

The Latins divide the Poets into four Orders, or Classes, Epic or Heroic, <hi>Iambographers,</hi> or Writers of <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bics, Tragaedians</hi> and <hi>Lyricks.</hi> The chief of the first are <hi>Homer</hi> among the Greeks, and <hi>Virgil</hi> among the Latins, in the next <hi>Archilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> in the third <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides,</hi> in the last, <hi>Pindar</hi> among the Greeks, and <hi>Horace</hi> among the Latins <hi>Horace</hi> makes another Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of them, making six Classes of them in his Art of <hi>Poetry; Heroics, Elegiacs, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics, lambics, Tragaedians, Comedians.</hi> But these divisions regarding only the subject, or kind of Verse, does not sufficiently distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betwixt the Poets.

Upon a Judicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, any one will conclude, there are but Three Orders of Poets, that is, <hi>Epic, Comic</hi> and <hi>Tragick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Poetry is a kind of Painting, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents the Mind, as that does the Body; nay, it is excellent, in the describing the Body too, and all the Actions of Human Life, as well as all the beauties of Nature, in a Lively Description. Poetry was at first the Foundation of Religion, and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity among the Grecians; the first Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy the World was blest with, was in Verse, it had that influence on the Minds of Men, then fallen from their Primitive Reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the VVildest Barbarity, that, it soon brought them to Civility, and to know the Dictates of Reason from that of fancy, and the ungovern'd Sense, Appetite, without respect to Justice, being the onely rule of Men, till <hi>Orpheus</hi> (if we believe the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thologists</hi>) by the Harmony of his Verse, redeemed them from that slavery. The Judicious Mr. <hi>Rimer</hi> is of opinion (with a great deal of Reason) that Tragedy was at first the Liturgy of the <hi>Athenians.</hi> So that in the first Ages of the World, Verse was so far esteemed, as not to be consecrated even to the Honour of the Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and it was with no little reluctance the Priests suffered the Poets to direct it to a meaner use. But whatever was the Origin of it, we are sure it was always in Esteem with the greatest and most flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations, as <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Twou'd be to repeat that which is known to every one, to tell the value the <hi>Athenians</hi> had for it; since Mr. <hi>Rimer</hi> tells us, that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laid out more in the Representations of their Plays, than in their most Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive VVars. <hi>Alexander</hi> was so great an Admirer of it, that he envy'd the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of dead <hi>Achilles,</hi> for being prais'd by the Pen of <hi>Homer.</hi> And <hi>Augustus,</hi> (in whose time <hi>Rome</hi> was most Flourishing) made <hi>Virgil</hi> his Companion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though born of mean Parents; and no Nation that has flourished in Poetry, ever held up its head after the decay of that.</p>
                     <p>But, to pass from the Praise to the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Poetry; we advise the Candidates for the Lawrel, that they first consider the difficulty of being a good Poet, since un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they rise to a Perfection in their kind, they reap but Infamy, by exposing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as ambitious of a thing they cou'd not attain, Mediocrity (as we have said) being intolerable in Poetry, however excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable in other affairs. They must also consider, that to arrive to an Excellence, they must take the right method (suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing they have, by Nature, a good Fund) first they must think, and weigh with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their Friends of Judgment, what their Talent is; for, one may be able to Write a VVitty, and Extraordinary Song, who wou'd be dull in a VVork of a greater Fatigue: Mr. <hi>VValer</hi> got a reputation, not by VVriting Much, but VVell; and his little short Copies of Verses are preferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in our opinion, to the Voluminous Poems of some others, who wou'd have their Performances swell into a Bulk, and deserve the Name of <hi>VVorks,</hi> for their Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, not Intrinsick Value. We are pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty confident, it wou'd not have been for the disreputation of Sir <hi>VVilliam Davenant,</hi>
                        <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:103507:11"/>
it wou'd not have for the Disreputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>William Davenant,</hi> if the World had never seen any thing of his, but his <hi>Gondibert,</hi> and the much more Excellent <hi>Shakespear</hi> wou'd not have been less admir'd, if an abundance of these things which are Printed for his, were omitted, Mr. <hi>Cowly</hi> is of this Opinion we are sure; therefore our Advice is to a young Poet, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ambitious of writing much, a little Gold is worth a great heap of Lead, let him often make tryal of what his Should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are able to bear, before he launches into the Ocean of the Criticks, let him often Correct and Consult his Judicious Friend; 'tis <hi>Horace</hi> his Advice to the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soes.</hi> To be a perfect Poet, a Man must be a general Schollar, skilld both in the Tongues and Sciences, must be perfect in History and Moral Philosophy, the latter of which is absolutely necessary, to give him an insight into the Nature of the Passions, to move which is his chief Aim and Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor can he draw a virtuous Character, unless he know what is the just Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. A Poet is to represent Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, at least the nobler Part, which he can never do, if he be not throughly skill'd in knowledge of it. Being thus qualifi'd, Diligence and Exercise will furnish you with Facility, in your Compositions, and Reading the best Authors and <hi>Criticks,</hi> as <hi>Casaubon, Scaliger, &amp;c.</hi> and for our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish way of Writing (Plays we mean) Mr. <hi>Rimers</hi> Translations of, Rapine and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the <hi>Plays of the last Age,</hi> Mr. <hi>Drydens</hi> Essay on Dramatick Poesie, and most of his Prefaces, <hi>L' Abbe Hedelius</hi> whole Art of the Stage, My Lord <hi>Roscom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Translation of</hi> Horace, his <hi>Art of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> &amp;c. 'twill be absolutely necessary for your perusal. Any farther particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections here wou'd be too long a Task for his place, since 'tis the business of these several Treatises we mention, to perfect an Artist in this Kind: We shall only therefore here place the <hi>Chief</hi> of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin and English Poets, which are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd with great Care and Regard.</p>

                     <p>PAinting is in that Esteem with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious of this Age, that it may seem superfluous to trouble the Reader with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to encrease it, by setting before them the Value the Antients put upon Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of this Nature: we will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Transcribe from <hi>Pliny,</hi> the vast Sums of Mony which were given by the Kings and Princes of <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> for Picture of the Prime Masters; and indeed the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we find in <hi>Pliny,</hi> wou'd seem almost incredible, if it were not that we ev'ry day see those of our Modern Masters in that Art sold for 1000, or 1500 Pounds apiece. Nor is it necessary to repeat what we have formerly advanc'd concerning the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of it, that being so very Obscure, that the most that can be said, or gathered from Authors, amounts only to a <hi>Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> Nor will it be much to our purpose, to enumerate the several Excellent Pieces this Art produc'd, when it Flourish'd in <hi>Greece,</hi> tho' we confess it is not altogether unfit to be known to such as have any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to apply themselves to this Noble Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: which may be said to surpass the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sence it self, by which we judge of it: for it perswades the Eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Evidence of themselves, that there is a Substance more than really there is, raising a Flat, to a bulky Round, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Figure: Nay, presents the Eye with a Prospect of Miles in the Compass of a Hand, and that so lively, that with a great deal of satisfaction, we dwell upon the View as if we were satish'd there was more than
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:103507:12"/>
a flat, thin Superficies that entertain'd us; a great Master disputing in a Treatise of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Statuary, which was to be prefer'd, gives it to Painting; because a Statue has the Dimensions and Bulk of a Man, but a Picture deceives the Eye, and makes that appear round, which is plain and flat. Stone at most can give but the Features and Proportion, but Picture gives also the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. There are some that will have the Moderns far Excel the Antients in both. They compare the Statue of <hi>Daphne</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> of <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> with the <hi>Grecian Venus</hi> now at <hi>Florence,</hi> the Grand Duke having given above thirty thousand Pounds for it, tho' by stealth got from <hi>Rome,</hi> they tell you that the <hi>Venus</hi> of the <hi>Grecians</hi> has Admirable Proportion, but 'tis still Stone, there is a stiffness, which shews it still to be an Image without Life; but the <hi>Daphne</hi> of <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> appears to be Flesh and Blood; her Breast sinking under the Fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Apollo,</hi> when he lays his Hand there. These same Gentlemen will have it, that our Moderns far Excel the Antients in Picture; nay, some have been so grosly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as to pretend the <hi>Grecians</hi> were meer Blockheads, to any of our Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Artists, much more to <hi>Raphael, Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, Titian, Rubens, &amp;c.</hi> That a House or Sign Painter, with us Excell'd <hi>Apelles</hi> that drew the Mistress of <hi>Alexander</hi>; and <hi>Alexander</hi> himself. Tho' we can never be of their Opinion, since we are sensible that 'tis built on a wrong Bottom; because the Paintings of <hi>Greece</hi> are lost, they therefore conclude, from a Daubing found in a Cave, that they were such Bunglers, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, was rather the performance of some of the grosser and more ignorant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the World, when all Sciences were forgot, and <hi>Europe</hi> drown'd in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Darkness and Barbarity. For tho' some alledge against the Testimony of <hi>Pliny,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he took too much of his Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story upon trust, yet we can never admit that enough to invalidate his Account of things, which requir'd no more than the Eye to judge of, being things that he daily convers'd with in <hi>Rome,</hi> which he abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares, when he tells us the Pictures he mentions, were extant in his time in the Temples of that City. The disadvantage the Antients have is, that we have our Pieces still extant, but theirs all lost. Painting is an Art, that is not to be learn'd by those Methods that other Arts are, for Books will afford very little help. The Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Master, and a timely beginning, are absolutely necessary, for if you once get an ill habit, and a vicious way of Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'twill scarce ever be possible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it. The most gainful Painting in this Nation, is drawing to the Life, which to be a Master in, requires many years Practice. As 'tis said of Poetry, <hi>Poet a nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur non sit,</hi> so I may in some measure say of Painting, that he that will expect to be a Master, must have a <hi>Genius</hi> naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to it, else so near a kin 'tis to Poetry, he will be but an indifferent Man at it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' with this difference, that a Painter that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, may live by his Trade, and have his Pieces hung in the Company of the best; yet <hi>Mediocribus esse poetis non dii, non homines, non concessêre Columnae.</hi> But if a Gentleman has a mind for his Diversion, to apply himself to Painting, Landskips, and Perspective, are the most proper for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the first being to be learn'd in a years time, to such a degree of Perfection (if the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple have a <hi>Genius</hi> for Painting) that he wou'd be able to live by it, and by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence enough for any Gentlemans Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There are Books which Treat of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Drawing, one of the best of which is <hi>Sandersons,</hi> we have formerly seen a Book under the Name of <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> on the same Subject. There's an Account of <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting lately publish'd in</hi> fol. Dedicated to their Majesties, <hi>Mr.</hi> Writes <hi>Account of my Lord</hi> Castlemains <hi>Embassy to</hi> Rome, <hi>Ars pictoria in fol.</hi> But instead of relying altogether on Books, we refer you to the Choicest Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of Picture you can meet with at Auctions, which you may imitate.</p>

Angles; of points that are the Bounds of Lines, as Lines are of a <hi>Superficies,</hi> and a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies</hi> of a Body; of Circles, Diameters, Segments, greater and lesser; of four square Figures, many square Figures; Of Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, their several Lines; of Parallel Lines either Circular or Right, or any other Form where the Lines are Equidistant. Of Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and letting fall Perpendiculars; of drawing parallel Lines; of dividing Lines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two or more equal or unequal Parts. Of cuting any Number of Parts from any Right Line given. Of finding out all the Chords. Lines of a Circle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of having the Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Circle, to find out the Center, and consequently the whole, adding several Circles into one. Of Substracting lesser Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles out of greater; in short, all the Doctrine of Triangles too long to be here enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Knowledge of all this I say, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary in most, if not all our Mechanicks. A Joyner can't so much as cut out a Round Table, unless he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a Circle; or a Carpenter square a piece of Timber, unless he know by the Rule of square Figures, when his Work is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd. The Watch and Clock-makers wou'd be at a loss, if it were not for this Science: But if we ascend higher, no Builder can raise a Fabrick without Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, or rather, not regularly design one, the manual Operators in our common Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, very seldom being Proficients in any Rule but that of Wood, or Brass, or Iron, which serves them instead of Geometrical Problems; but if you come to the Nobler Structures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what can any man do to the making of Pillars, Arches? to omit the rest of the Ornaments of Building, and the Proportions and Beauty of the Design, without Geometry? Nay, the Trade and Strength of the Nation depend on this, as Navigation and Gunnery, which are never to be perfectly understood without it; to these I may add Fortification, which has its Dependance on this Science, as also Dyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Musick, Astronomy, Surveying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Twou'd be needless to say any more of the Advantages of <hi>Geometry,</hi> here being enough to fire the Mind of any ingenious Student, to a diligent enquiry into it.</p>
                     <p>'Twas the Beauty of Proportions, the Curiosity of Demonstrations, the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Depth of this Study, that forc'd the Ingenious Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> to this Exstatick Expression in his <hi>Apollonius,</hi> O <gap reason="foreign">

Geometry has no Limits, since by the only Power of Human Wit, one may find out an infinite number of Theorems.

                        <hi>MOnsieur Cassini</hi> and several Ingenious <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> are now in search after a Method to find out <hi>Longitudes</hi> at Sea, which if once accomplish'd, this Art will then arise to its utmost Perfection; The Load-stone and Compass, which is an Admirable Invention, and so Advantagious to Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation has not a little Contributed towards it: This points the way to the skilful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner, when all other Helps fail him. To whom we owe the Invention we are at loss: Dr. <hi>Gilbert</hi> our Countryman, who hath written a large <hi>Latin Treatise</hi> upon this Stone, is of Opinion that <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> brought the Invention of its Use from the <hi>Chinese, Osorus</hi> attributes it to <hi>Gama, Goropius Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> thinks his Countrymen the <hi>Germans</hi> deserve it, in as much as the thirty two Points upon the Compass, borrow the name from the <hi>Dutch</hi> in all Languages, <hi>Blondus</hi> will have its Origine from <hi>Campania</hi> in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> in the Year 1300. Who ever found it out, <hi>We</hi> are sensible of the Use of it, since by it we may safely venture into the Main Ocean and sail the nearest way to any place, whereas the first Sailers were fain to coast it along, not venturing out of sight of the shore.</p>
                     <p>Navigation may deservedly be placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the greatest Benefits in this World; 'Tis this that enriches Nations with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, supports Kingdoms and Empires, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes Commodities, which in their own Countreys are but of little Value, for such as are of great Use and Worth abroad, by this an universal Correspondence may be held, and the most remote Regions may participate in Traffick, may make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection into one anothers Laws and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, Trades, Inventions, and what not? There's no moral Good but the Knowledge of it may by this means be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the universal Race of <hi>Adam</hi>; Besides all this, there's new Discoveries have been, and yet may be made. For such Colonies as either suffer by multitude of Inhabitants, or lie under the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a barren Soyl, an unwholsome Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to remove into. In short, since Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge conduces to a mans Happiness, and the more we know, the nearer we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach our Original State in Paradice; this of Navigation and Travel give very fair <hi>Opportunities</hi> towards it, and if so, we need add no more about the Usefulness of Navigation, since from what we have said, it appears that Riches and Learning do in a great measure depend upon it, especially the first, which of it self is a sufficient spur to most men.

                     <p>TIme is the greatest Treasure in this World, that a Mortal can be intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. We are not only Probationers for Eternity by the help of Time, but even the little Interests of this World are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd by the means of it. 'Tis this which views the Revolutions of Kingdoms, the Rise of Common wealths; 'tis by this that we have opportunities put into our hands of advancing our Families, of gaining Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; in short, of procuring whatever Man has occasion for, in order to his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
                     <p>The Learned <hi>Descartes,</hi> in his <hi>Method,</hi> where he Abridges the Precepts of Logick into Four Heads, lays down this as his <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> viz. <hi>To divide every one of these diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties he was to examine into as many parcels as cou'd be, and as was requisite the better to resolve them.</hi> This <hi>Rule</hi> is equally applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our present Subject, only 'tis of les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Concern, the last being the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; and, if once lost, all the Knowledg of Men can never effect its redemption. How necessary is it then, to divide that of so great value into little parcels, that we may be sensible of their stealing away, and not squander it away by whole-sale?</p>
                     <p>To divide time by Dials; Clocks, Watches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a faint Imitation of God-Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who has constituted Seasons, has divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Year into Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, and our Life into Days and Nights.</p>
                     <p>It must be a pleasant, as well as profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Divertisement, to be so well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Calculations of the Motions of Heavenly Bodies, as to make Horologes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any side of an House, under any Latitude, Declination, <hi>&amp;c.—Mellesius</hi> is said to be the first who found out the Proportion and Reason of Shadows— The <hi>Caldeans</hi> first divided the day into Twelve hours— The <hi>Egyptians</hi> had a hand in this Science, and call'd the Sun <hi>Horus,</hi> which, by its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, limits the time of every hour— An Hundred years before <hi>Cicero</hi>'s time, we find that Clocks and Dials were used at <hi>Rome</hi>; for the Parasite in <hi>Comedy</hi> envy'd the Clocks, <hi>Optans ut suus cuique venter sit Horologium,</hi> wishing, that every ones own Belly might be their Clock, which indeed was pleasant enough. There's no further occasion of describing the Great Use and Conveniency of <hi>Dialling,</hi> since we find it every where, and in every Nation; though in some, we read, that they Measure their Hours by Devices in Water, which yet shews the necessity of doing it some way; for it wou'd be nonsence to believe all the World wou'd Conspire in any one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary thing, which Interest and Utility did not prompt 'em to.</p>

                     <p>MOST of the Treatises which are in these two Volumes, have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared only in English; many of the Learned beyond Sea look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as Pieces perfectly new. This Work hath been translated out of English into Latine. First, as to the Preface; tho' it be not <hi>Lightfoot</hi>'s, because it treats of the principal Subjects upon which <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath written, yet we shall mention it, since there is to be found in it very curious Remarks. Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> speaks there, first of the Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Chronology, and shews us that it may be very serviceable to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sacred History. He brings for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample this passage, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.1. where it is said, that <hi>in the</hi> 36<hi>th year of the Reign of</hi> Asa, Baasha <hi>King of</hi> Israel <hi>went up against</hi> Judah. We must not understand this date from the time in which <hi>Asa</hi> began to Reign, since <hi>Baasha</hi> ascended to the Throne of <hi>Israel,</hi> but the third year of the Reign of <hi>Asa,</hi> and Reigned but 24 years, that is to say, to the 27th year of King <hi>Asa</hi>'s Reign, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.33. The same numbers are found in all the Antient Interpreters; so that it is not very likely that any fault should have slipped herein. If we consult Chronology, it tells us, that the year in which <hi>Baasha</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> made War against <hi>Iudah,</hi> was the 36th from the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Ten Tribes; so that by the Reign of <hi>Asa</hi> must be understood, <hi>That the Reign of</hi> Judah <hi>took its beginning from the time that</hi> Jeroboam <hi>dismembred the Ten Tribes.</hi> 'Tis thus that <hi>Lightfoot</hi> interprets it, <hi>p.</hi> 80. from <hi>his Harmony of the Old Testament.</hi> See also <hi>p.</hi> 81. and 87. It's also remarked, that these two passages of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> to wit, the 2d of <hi>Chron.</hi> 27.2. where it is said, That King <hi>Achaias</hi> was 42 years old when he began to Reign; and <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 9. where <hi>Iehoiachim</hi> in the beginning of his Reign, is said to be eight years old, ought to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated otherwise, if we suppose that there is no fault in the present Hebrew, because it is contrary to Chronology. But in the <hi>Antient Version</hi> the first passage is 20, or 22. and in the 2d 18. which makes us believe that there may be a fault in our Hebrew Copies. You may see what <hi>Lightfoot</hi> saith of <hi>Achaias</hi> in the preceding Discourses of his <hi>Harmony of the Evangelists.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> maintains against <hi>Grotius,</hi> that the ordinary manner of reading that passage, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.8. is better than the corrections that <hi>Grotius</hi> would have made. It is 65 in the Hebrew, and in all other Translations; and <hi>Grotius</hi> pretends that it ought to be read 6 and 5, that is to say, eleven. The Author of this Preface shews upon what (he thought) <hi>Grotius</hi> built this Conjecture, and fell into an Error contradistinct to the <hi>the true Chronology of the Kingdom of</hi> Israel. He send the Reader back again to the Computation of <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> who removes all the difficulty.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not, that he was of the Opinion of <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> who believed there was no fault in the Hebrew Text; he thought that it was better to follow the <hi>Samaritan Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch</hi> way of reading, and the Translation of the Seventy, than that of the Hebrew Text, which saith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.40. that the time that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> abode in <hi>Egypt</hi> was 430 years, whereas they continued no more than 210 years. But it is in the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan Pentateuch, and in the Septuagint ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Manuscript of <hi>Alexandria, that the time of abode which the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>and their Fathers made in</hi> Egypt <hi>and in the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>was</hi> 430 <hi>years,</hi> which agrees exactly with Chronology. After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spoken something of the necessity that there is to study Sacred Geography for the better understanding of the Scripture, he passes to the Original Text and Antient Translations. He shews <hi>first</hi> by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, that the consent of all the Antient Translations with the Hebrew and Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Texts, proves that those places which may be suspected, have not been corrupted, and that when all the Translations agree with either of these Texts, it is something very considerable in favour of them to whom they are found conformable. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> He shews that by the same consent one may find divers faults in the Hebrew Texts at this day. <hi>As our Hebrew Copies</hi> (saith he) <hi>are without doubt those which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Antient Originals best, and which ought to be preferred to all others; it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless be a sign of obstinacy and superstition to believe that there is no considerable fault</hi> which may be corrected by means of the Translations. There are many examples in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103507:15"/>
other Authors, as in the Epistles of St. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> of which <hi>Vsher Primate of Ireland,</hi> hath corrected divers places by means of the Antient Latine Translations of these Epistles. Afterwards he brings for example that of <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.6. and 145.14. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.14. where one ought according to him correct the Hebrew Text by the Antient Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to which he also adds <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.22. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 11. which the Reader may examine if he finds it to his purpose.</p>
                     <p>These mistakes concern the Consonants of the Hebrew Tongue. Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that there are also some slipt in amongst the Vowels, although he would not approve all the examples the Learned have brought thereon. Thus there is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him <hi>Psalms</hi> the 11. and 9. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, Thou shalt feed them. He also brings <hi>Hosea</hi> 13.14. and <hi>Amos</hi> 9. and 13. The sense of this last pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage is extreamly different, according to their manner of reading and pointing, who followed the Massorites, from the sense that the <hi>Septuagint</hi> gives it. According to the first it must be translated, <hi>So that they shall possess the rest of</hi> Idumea; and according to the last which St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath followed, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.16. <hi>So that the Rest of men shall seek the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Author afterwards saith, that the pointing at this day is not always conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Analogy of the Hebrew Tongue, which appears by many <hi>Anomalies,</hi> of which the Massore says nothing, and by divers proper Names which are better written in the old Translations.</p>
                     <p>The Antient Versions furnish us likewise with divers significations of some words, which without that, would be perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us. We are extreamly confirmed in this thought, when the same words in our neighbouring Tongue have all these signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, as in the <hi>Syriack, Arabick</hi> and <hi>Ethiopick Languages, &amp;c.</hi> which have much affinity with that of the Hebrews. But he marks nevertheless that we must not too much confide in this manner of finding out the signification of some Hebrew words by the means of the neighbouring Tongues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that divers accidents happen too long to enumerate, <hi>as when a word changes its sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification with another People, by losing its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient sound, and acquiring something new, and unknown from the Language whence it was first taken.</hi> For example, the English word <hi>to Try,</hi> is without doubt the same as the French, <hi>Trier,</hi> nevertheless it has a signification which hath no agreement with that of the French word, <hi>to make a Tryal</hi> or <hi>a Proof of.</hi> So to <hi>Crack,</hi> which comes from <hi>Craquer,</hi> signifies in English to <hi>Boast</hi>: To <hi>Lett</hi> in English signifies both to <hi>Permit</hi> and to <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> but the Dutch word <hi>Letten,</hi> or as they now speak, <hi>Beletten,</hi> which is the same, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to <hi>Hinder.</hi> So we cannot altogether trust to the Conjectures of some Learned men upon the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Tsagnir,</hi> which is found, <hi>Micah</hi> 5.2. They believe there, that the Hebrew signifies <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Little,</hi> at the same time, because it hath two significations in the <hi>Arabick</hi>: It's true that they have founded it upon this, that the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty</hi> have translated <hi>Little</hi> in this place of <hi>Micah</hi> and St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> which is <hi>not Little.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> comes afterwards to the use that may be made of the writings of the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> and 'tis in this that <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath excelled. <hi>As first,</hi> from the knowledge of the customs and opinions of the Jews, which altho sometimes very extravagant, we may notwithstanding afford us some bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It may serve to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the History of Jesus Christ, for it appears by that, that there was one Jesus which had Disciples who lived in such a time, and such a place, who did and said divers things; That there was such places, such opinions, such customs, such ceremonies. It's found in the writings of the most ancient Jews, the same stile and same manner of speaking are seen in the Evangelists, and very often the same thoughts the same Parables and the same Proverbs. Our Author brings from thence some examples that have never been observed before. There is to be found in the <hi>Thalmud</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> an ancient Tradition of the Jews: It saith, <hi>that in the time of the Messia there shall be an extream Impudence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That the Father shall be ill treated by his Son, and the Daughter should rise up against her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Daughter-in-law against her Mother-in-law, and a mans Enemies shall be those of his own House,</hi> &amp;c. By that we see that our Lord according to this ancient Doctrine of the Jews made it known that he was the Messia, when he said, <hi>That he was come to separate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Son and the Father, the Daughter and the Mother, and the Daughter-in-law and the Mother-in-law, and that a mans Enemies should be those of his own House.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> after that marks the places of the <hi>Thalmud</hi> where there is mention made of Jesus Christ. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The reading of the Rabbies is use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to convince the Jews at this day, that they ought to understand <hi>Him</hi> to be the <hi>Messia,</hi> from many passages of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which they endeavour to interpret otherwise, tho their Fathers understood it as we do. From thence he brings a great many examples. It is said in an ancient <hi>Iewish Book</hi> which is called <hi>Pelicta,</hi> that God had a Dialogue with the Messia in these Terms: God began to make a <hi>Covenant with the Messiah, speaking thus to him: Those which have sinned are unknown to thee, and will impose upon thee a Yoak of Iron, by which they will render thee like to a Heifer, almost blind with excess of labour, and at last they shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy thee: because of their iniquity thy Tongue shall cleave to the Roof of thy Mouth. And wilt thou suffer this? The Messia. It may be that these griefs and afflictions shall endure but for a time. God. I am fully resolved that thou shalt suffer it a whole week of years, but if thou
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103507:15"/>
consent not thereto, I shall not impose these suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings upon thee. The Messia. I willingly submit my self on condition that one Israelite may not perish, but that they may all be saved, those that live and dye in my Time, those that are hidden under the Earth, and which are dead since</hi> Adam, <hi>even the Children which died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were born, or that are come into the World afore their time; in a word, all that have been created until now, and which shall be hence forth.</hi> Altho there is much extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance here, we it may nevertheless disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver through all these fictions, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Jews have not always promised them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a <hi>Triumphant Messia,</hi> and such as should peaceably enjoy the advantages which the Jews of our times attribute to him. It is plain 'twas believed that the Sufferings of the <hi>Messia</hi> should be a means to expiate the sins of <hi>Israel.</hi> 'Tis this which the same Author assures us of, in terms ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear, which Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> relates. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Much use may be drawn from the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> because therein are found opinions, customs and manners of speaking, which were used amongst the Jews in the time of our Lord, as he shews by some examples never before produced; thus, <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath composed all the second Volume of his works upon this Subject: Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> believes that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to an opinion of the Jews, when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the Women to have their heads cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Devotion, because of the Angels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and 20. and he cites thereupon a place of the Babylonish <hi>Thalmud</hi> and some passages of two or three other Rabbies, from whence it appeareth <hi>that the Iews thought the Angels had much curiosity to know what passed amongst men, and particularly in anything of great importance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After all these remarks we find a little abridgment of the Life of <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> where as occasion serves, there are divers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections intermixed, which we shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion briefly. The thoughts of <hi>Monsieur Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> are there refuted, touching the abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>new Polyglot,</hi> which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in his Criticks, and touching the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentickness of the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> &amp;c. He also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes the Interpretation that <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath given in the Epistle to the Corinthians just before cited. For altho Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> had a great esteem for <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not obliged to receive all his opinions or defend whatsoever he hath said. He saith he is not of the same Opinion with our Author, who believed that the least point of the Bible is a Divine Institution, and that all therein is mysterious even unto the least irregularities. Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> Criticises on two or three remarks of <hi>Lightfoot</hi> upon the Rabbies, founded upon the faults of the Copier, which he explains after a mysterious manner.</p>
                     <p>As the Life of <hi>Lightfoot</hi> composed by Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> was too short, Mr. <hi>Stryp</hi> hath joined thereto another more large, which is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a collection of divers things concerning the person and writings of our Author. Therein we see the manner of his Study and Employ, with the esteem they had of him in <hi>England</hi> and elsewhere, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> those who love to know the least particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the lives of great men, will here find what will both divert and instruct 'em. There is an account in his Life of some of the reasons of the controversies between the Divines assembled at <hi>Westminster,</hi> who had undertaken to reform, during the Civil Wars, what they called <hi>Errours in the Church of</hi> England. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> opposeth stifly some of their opinions, as may be seen in the third Article of the Collection that is added to his Life. We shall find in the eighth <hi>a List of his Works, which have not been finished,</hi> which were mostly concerning the History of the Hebrews, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of some Book of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. One part is in English and the other in Latin. He hath even given himself the trouble to write all the Texts of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists and to dispose them into an harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious method. It is offered to any Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller that will Print it. In what respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Harmony</hi> we may advertise the Publick that Mr. <hi>Toignard</hi> hath promised to publish it at the end of his, wherein shall soon be seen the method which he hath made use of in a place of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> where he compares the <hi>Iudaick Antiquities</hi> with the <hi>Books of the Iewish Wars.</hi> This last <hi>Harmony</hi> is now in the Press and will soon appear abroad. Before we consider the works set forth by <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> we cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear speaking of the loss that hath been sustained in a <hi>Map of Palestine,</hi> which he had effected with much care, and traced with his own hand. 'Tis a loss doubtless very great to such as desire to be instructed in the <hi>Sacred Geography,</hi> because there is no Card of <hi>Iudea</hi> left, that can satisfie those who are but indifferently versed in this kind of learning. We have nevertheless endeavoured to supply this loss received by that of <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> working therein upon his Ideas, and in giving a Map of those places whereof this Author makes mention in his <hi>Geographical Remarks,</hi> and which have been placed according to his observations. But altho many faults are in this Map cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected which are found in all others, we shall yet find it a trouble, to persuade our selves, that the notions of <hi>Lightfoot</hi> could be followed to such perfection as what he had done himself.</p>
                     <p>The first Work that we meet with in this Volume, is <hi>an Harmonious and Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical disposition of the Text of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The Sacred Writers are so little ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the order of Time, and those who have collected them into a Body, had so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard to Chronology, that the Jews form thereupon a constant explication of the Holy History, to wit, that in Holy Writ there's <hi>no before nor after.</hi> Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor proposeth to himself to remedy this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of Method, in making an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Holy History, and placing every event where it ought to be in his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103507:16"/>
Judgment. He hath added in the Margin the year of the World, and that of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature or Reign of those who governed <hi>Israel,</hi> and he hath taken care to mark the <hi>precise</hi> date of all the events whereof he could have had any certain knowledge. Those that he hath placed by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture have no date. In the Margin he hath added the reason why he hath there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted these places, without undertaking to refute the reasons of those who place them elsewhere, lest he should make his volume too large. He hath only proposed his opinion upon the difficulties that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselves, and leaves them to be judged by the Reader. His opinions are often very new, as will be easily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged if they compare what he saith, with what is to be found in other Interpreters. As for the rest he confesseth what he hath written is but an Essay, and advertises the Reader that he ought not to expect it very exact.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Text of <hi>Genesis</hi> Chronologically disposed, reaches to <hi>p.</hi> 22. and <hi>Lightfoot</hi> ends the History of this Book by a Citation from the first of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> which he believed ought immediately to follow the death of <hi>Ioseph.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.21, 22.23. In this place are to be found the years of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and the years of <hi>Promise</hi> joyned with those of the <hi>World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Books of <hi>Exodus, Leviticus</hi> and <hi>Numbers</hi> joyn'd together, continue the holy History, <hi>p.</hi> 38. where the Establishment is seen of the half Tribe of <hi>Manasseh</hi> on that side <hi>Iordan.</hi> There are only two places of two other Books inserted amongst those of <hi>Moses. Lightfoot</hi> believes that the 88th and 89th <hi>Psalms</hi> were composed by <hi>Heman</hi> and <hi>Ethan</hi> Sons of <hi>Zerach,</hi> which lived, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, in the time that the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> oppressed the <hi>Israelites</hi> with excessive Labour and Taxes. The Author thinks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that <hi>Iob</hi> lived in the same time, and that he was the Grand Son of <hi>Nahor, Abraham</hi>'s Brother, and that <hi>Elihu</hi> one of those which speaks in his Book, and who was his near Kinsman, is the Author of this work. This he asserts in <hi>p.</hi> 24.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Afterwards comes <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Abridgment of the Books of <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Iudges.</hi> The History of <hi>Ruth</hi> is inserted between the time of <hi>Ehud</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah.</hi> The Author takes notice but of one word in <hi>chap.</hi> 3. and 13. <hi>v.</hi> that has an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary point, and but of one other in the 19th chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> of the same nature. Our Author seeks there the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> continues his Chronological Abridgement of the <hi>Sacred History,</hi> by some Texts of the Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and of <hi>Kings</hi> put together, according as the order of events requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Here are also many Psalms, with the occasions and most difficult passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the <hi>Canticles</hi> explained, after the manner of our Author, that is to say, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the method of the Rabbins, who only guessed at many things in ancient History. Whereof see an example in <hi>C.</hi> 58. about the explication of <hi>Psalm</hi> 58.35. but as neither the time nor the Authors of all the Psalms are not known, <hi>Lightfoot</hi> could not range them in Chronological order. Which has obliged him to place the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> after the the 35<hi>th</hi> chapter of the 1<hi>st</hi> Book of <hi>Chronicles.</hi> In this place he makes divers reflections upon the gathering together of these Sacred Songs, <hi>Ps.</hi> 71. He tells us the Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and the <hi>Song of Songs,</hi> was written when <hi>Solomon</hi> had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the buildings he had undertaken. He believes that the <hi>Song of Songs</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by this Prince upon his Marrying the King of <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Daughter, who (that being a very hot Country) was Brown, as it is <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.5, 6. but his chief end was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Spiritual Marriage of Jesus Christ with his Church, under the sensible Type of his own with an <hi>Egyptian.</hi> As for the <hi>Ecclesiastes, Lightfoot</hi> places it much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and thinks it a work, that he composed in the time of his Repentance; see <hi>Pag.</hi> 26. from this place the Books of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> are Printed in Columns, so that one may see at first view the conformity and difference which is between them, as there is in this History many Chronologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal difficulties, so <hi>Lightfoot</hi> is more exact to mark the years of every Prince.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Being come to the Reign of <hi>Vzziah,</hi> whom the Scripture also calls <hi>Azarias,</hi> he saith, that before that time there always had been some Prophets, but that none of them had left his Prophecies in writing. And according to him, 'twas in this time that the Prophets begun to write. On this occasion he describes the order and end of the Prophecies of <hi>Hosea, Ioel, Amos, Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah</hi> and <hi>Ionas</hi>; he maintains that the first occasion of the Prophecies of <hi>Hosea,</hi> was the death of <hi>Zacharias</hi> Son of <hi>Barachia.</hi> As all that this Prophet saith cannot relate to one time only, so he here mentions but the four first Chapters, the others are each in their place. He hath observed the same order in regard to the rest who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied in divers times. Those, according to his Judgment, whose Predictions have been delivered in the same time, are insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed entire in the places where <hi>Lightfoot</hi> speaks of what happened at that time, as <hi>Nahum, Zephaniah, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Book of <hi>Esdras</hi> immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the first of <hi>Chronicles.</hi> It was then that <hi>Cyrus</hi> published his Edict, by which he permitted the Jews to return to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; for tho' <hi>Darius</hi> of <hi>Media,</hi> or <hi>Astyages,</hi> as the Greeks call him, lived at that time, it was made in the name of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> makes divers remarks upon this <hi>Darius</hi> of <hi>Media,</hi> to <hi>p.</hi> 113. in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 5th Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi>; and to <hi>p.</hi> 136. he speaks of several things during the Reign of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the Succession of the Kings of <hi>Persia. Lightfoot</hi> inserts the History of <hi>Esdras</hi> after the 4th Chapter of <hi>Esdras.</hi> He believes the <hi>Assuerus</hi> mentioned
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103507:16"/>
in this History was also called <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and that he was called <hi>Assuerus,</hi> from the name of one of his Predecessors, which is spoken of in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.1. to wit, the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whom the Greeks called, according to <hi>Lightfoot, Astyages.</hi> He makes this <hi>Assuerus</hi> immediately to follow <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Malachy</hi> end this work, and the Spirit of Prophecy having ceased among the Jews, the Books that they have since made, have not had the same Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as those that preceded them. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> explains here the difficult Chronologies that he meets with in his way.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Harmony of the Old Testament is followed with some remarks upon, <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> and <hi>Exodus</hi>; the first are entituled <hi>Paucae ac novellae observationes super librum Geneseos, quarum pleraeque certae, caeterae probabiles sunt; omnes autem innoxiae, ac raro antea auditae.</hi> It is a Collection of divers Rabbinical Remarks, or like in subtilty to those of the <hi>Rabbins</hi>: They conjecture at many things according to the custom of these ingenious Doctors; for example, <hi>That the first natural Day in the Climat of the Garden of</hi> Eden, <hi>was thirty six hours long, even as the day whereof mention is made in the</hi> 10<hi>th Chapter of</hi> Joshua; <hi>That the Moon and some Stars were created before the Sun: That it was at the full before the Sun ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, which then augmented its Light; but that the Earth hindering the sight thereof, it appeared not to</hi> Adam <hi>till six days after, who saw it in its first quarter after that the Promise had cleared the darkness of the Fall: That the clean Beasts were created in each kind to the number seven, whereof three pairs were destined to the propagation of their kind, and the seventh to be sacrificed by</hi> Adam <hi>after he had sinned; but that there was but one pair of each kind of unclean Animals,</hi> &amp;c. His Remarks upon <hi>Exodus</hi> bear this Title; <hi>Manipulus spicilegio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum è libro Exodi, ubi solutio probabilis scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum quorundam manifestorum, &amp; explanatio difficiliorum textuum, qui hoc libro occurrunt, antea ab aliis raro exhibitae.</hi> These Remarks keep much of the subtilty of the preceding ones; therein is nevertheless seen a method a little more conform to that which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of the holy Scripture commonly follow. Every Section contains particular Remarks which have no connexion one with the other; and there are 59 Questions, which we cannot undertake to make an exact Extract of. We shall only bring two or three of them, by which you may judge of the rest. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> believes that the 88<hi>th and</hi> 89<hi>th Psalms</hi> are the most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Works that remain amongst us, and are made by <hi>Heman</hi> and <hi>Ethan</hi> Sons of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach,</hi> as hath already been remarked, who lived in the time of the Egyptian Slavery. He makes answer to those who oppose him therein, that <hi>Ethan</hi> speaks of <hi>David.</hi> (1.) That this might be a Spirit of Prophecy, as 'tis spoken of <hi>Samuel</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 99. which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews believe to be of <hi>Moses.</hi> (2.) That Prophet having left some Writings, they have been polished and augmented by others, who had also the gift of Prophecy, according as certain things present, past, or to come, required it. This will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear (saith <hi>Lightfoot</hi>) if we compare the 18th <hi>Psalm</hi> with the first of <hi>Sam. chap.</hi> 22. <hi>Obadiah</hi> with <hi>Ieremiah, c.</hi> 49. <hi>v.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Chron. c.</hi> 16. with <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. &amp; 105. 2 <hi>Pet. c.</hi> 2. with the Epistle of St. <hi>Iude.</hi> He believes that this piece of <hi>Ethan</hi> hath likewise been po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in <hi>David</hi>'s time, and that several times the name of <hi>David</hi> was then inserted, from Section the 30th, unto the end. Our Author endeavours to describe the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle and Priestly Habits. In giving the measure of all the parts of the Tabernacle, he speaks of the heighth of the Altar for the Burnt-offerings, which was three Cubits. He saith, that if every Cubit had been three foot, no man could serve at the Altar which had not been nine Cubits in heighth. He therefore reduces a Cubit to a Foot and half, so that the height of the Altar was but four feet and an half. According to <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,</hi> this is the measure that was observed in the Dimensions of the Temple. As to the rest, he remarks with care the mystical significations of each part of the Sacred Building, in the 48th Section. Speaking of the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> he confutes the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of those who believed that God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to the Questions that were made him in causing a certain brightness to appear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stones of the Breast-plate. He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that they proposed first to the Priest what they desired to know, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Priest consulted the Oracle of God, or in drawing near to the Ark, when that might be done, or even without the Ark, provided that he was cloathed with the Ephod and Breast-plate which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. After these Treatises there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>p.</hi> 195. whereof the Title is, <hi>Erubhim, sive Miscellanea Christiana &amp; Iudaica aliaque, relaxandis animis, &amp; otio discutiendo conscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi> It's one of the first Works of <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> and a mixture of divers Remarks on the <hi>prophane Authors,</hi> and upon the <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> but the greatest part of it concerns the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Books. Every Chapter is like a work apart, which hath no connexion with the others, so that we cannot undertake to give here an abridgment of all that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The Author saith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. the reason for which God called <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel Son of Man,</hi> was because this manner of speaking was much more common to the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Hebrews,</hi> than to say simply <hi>a Man.</hi> In the 19th and 20th Chapters he compares some passages of the Rabbins to some of the New Testament. He believes that even the Rabbins have taken thence divers places, and that 'tis not at all surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, if the Jews, who lived amongst the Christians, and who had often heard them speak of the New Testament, shou'd retain something thereof, and added it to their own Writings. But if it was so, many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations of our Author would not be of great use, as may be seen in the Extract of the second Volume. He says in <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103507:17"/>
that he believes the <hi>Seventy Interpreters</hi> translated the Old Testament into Greek in spight of the Jews, and that it is for this reason that there is nothing in this <hi>Version</hi> but what is wandering and uncertain, and that there are many additions, changes and faults. He brings some examples, of which some are drawn from some words, that the <hi>Seventy</hi> have pointed contrary to the Masso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.11. and <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5.8. <hi>id.</hi> 7. and 11.7. <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.7. Tho our Author believes that the Vowels of the Hebrews are of Divine Institution in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that they are found at this day, he saith, every thing is a fault that agreeth not in the <hi>Seventy.</hi> He had even undertaken a work in which he would recollect all the Errours which he thought he saw in this Translation.

                           <hi>Pag</hi> 117.</note> This work we speak of, is a Product of our Authors younger years. There is another of his more mature Age. <hi>'Tis a Harmony of the four Evangelists, as also of the Old Testament,</hi> divided into three parts. This is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Author: 1. He disposeth the Text of the Evangelists according to the order of times, to which he joyns a literal Interpretation of the most difficult words and phrases. 2. He giveth the Reason of this disposition. 3. He expoundeth the principal difficulties of the Text, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the agreement that is between the sacred Writers. You may find before the first part of the preceding Discourses, that our Author gives an Abridgment of Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy drawn out of Holy Writ, from the Creation to the Birth of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> He therein expoundeth, by the by, divers Chronological difficulties of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He believeth Jesus Christ was born in the year of the World 3928.</p>
                     <p>The first part of this Harmony compriseth what we find in the Gospels, before the Baptism of our Lord, and what St. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith of the <hi>Word.</hi> There is a Kalender in <hi>p.</hi> 260. whereby you may discern the order that was among the Priestly Families, as to what regarded the service of the Temple, the time in which each entred into service, the Sections or Portions of Scripture that were read each Sabbath day, so that in the circuit of one year, the whole Law was read. As the Author in the Title of the work promiseth to shew the Harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the New Testament and the Old, so he expoundeth in their places the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which have foretold the coming of the Messia, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. in <hi>p.</hi> 287. This first part endeth with an exposition of what the Evangelists say, touching the Baptism of Jesus Christ, and of his Genealogies, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates it.</p>
                     <p>The second comprises what happened since the Baptism of our Lord, to the first Passover that he celebrated. Here we find a very large exposition of our Saviours Temptation, especially upon these words of St. <hi>Matthew, that</hi> 
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">p. 371.</note> 
                        <hi>the Devil shewed Iesus Christ all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Earth, and their Glory.</hi> 
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">p. 390.</note> There is a digression some pages lower, touching Baptism, where the Author makes divers remarks, (1.) Upon the practice of Baptism with the Jews, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist Preached amongst them. (2.) Upon the custom of Baptizing Infants, which was in use in that time. He relates the passages of the <hi>Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud</hi> and of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> whereby it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Jews did Baptize their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. This Rabbin in his Treatise <hi>of Slaves,</hi> saith, <hi>that if an Israelite find a Child and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize him in the name of a Proselyte (<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>) he is a Proselyte from that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> but he assureth us of another thing elsewhere, which is not so conformable to the use of Christians, to wit, <hi>if a Woman with Child was Baptized, and received into the number of Proselytes, it was thought needless to Baptize the Child.</hi> 
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">p. 410.</note> As to the Pots of <hi>Cana,</hi> the Water of which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> changed into Wine, <hi>Lightfoot</hi> takes occasion from thence to enumerate all the Vessels of the Hebrews, whereof mention is made in Scripture, and tells what they severally contain'd.</p>
                     <p>The third part of the Harmony of the Gospels comprehends the space of one year which passed from the first Passover that our Saviour celebrated after his Baptism, to the second. As to these words of Jesus Christ in St. <hi>Iohn, If any man be not born a second time, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, Lightfoot</hi> makes a long digression touching the sense of these words, <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> or the Kingdom of Heaven. He immediately remarks that the Jews in the <hi>Thalmud,</hi> take them in a very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary sense, that is to say, for the rigorous observation of their Ceremonies, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that of the Tradition of <hi>Phylacteries. Rabbin Gamaliel</hi> being Married, did upon the very night of his Nuptials rehearse what

was written upon his Phylacteries, upon which (says the <hi>Thalmud</hi>) his Disciples spoke thus to him: <hi>Have you not taught us, that a Bridegroom is not obliged to mention his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries?</hi> and that he answered them: <hi>far be it from me to be so complaisant to you, as to quit one only hour the yoak of the Kingdom.</hi> After that <hi>Lightfoot</hi> sheweth, that thereby (in our Saviours time) was understood the State of the Jewish Church under the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia. In fine, he largely sheweth the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent signification, these words had in the Mouth of the Carnal Jews, and in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours.

                        <hi>And</hi> John <hi>Baptized at</hi> Enon <hi>near</hi> Salim, our Author makes sundry remarks upon <hi>Enon</hi> and <hi>Salim</hi>; he believes these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were in <hi>Galilee.</hi> Afterwards he examines these 2 Questions, to wit, <hi>what Ceremonies the Iews used in their Baptism? and how far St.</hi> John <hi>the Baptist hath imitated them?</hi> When a Proselyte was received, he was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately asked, <hi>if it was not through some hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane consideration, that he would embrace Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism, as through fear, desire of Riches, or love to some fair Israelitish Woman?</hi> If he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>it was not,</hi> then the difficulty of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the Law, was represented to him, and the Punishment it inflicted upon Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours: But for fear of discouraging him, he was also told of the rewards promised in the Law, they declared to him, that <hi>tho Israel was seen miserable in this World, yet God had prepared for it a felicity, that he kept concealed, and which they should enjoy in obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Law; that if God did not render</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>happy in this Life, it was to the end only to keep it from Pride; but that the other Nations should everlastingly perish, how happy soever they for the present seemed to be.</hi> They added, that <hi>if he Repented that he had offered himself to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the number of the Proselytes, he was permitted to withdraw.</hi> If he still declared he was in the same Mind, <hi>they Circumcised him, and when he was cured, he was brought to some Water, wherein he presently entered up to the Neck. Whilst he kept himself in this posture, the three inferiour Iudges of the place rehearsed to him divers Precepts of the Law, after which he plunged himself over Head and Ears, and came out a very little while after. If 'twas a Woman that was to be baptized, she was by Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men put into the Water; the Iudges held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at a sufficient distance from the place where she plunged her self, and she turned her back as soon as ever she came out of the Water.</hi>

                     <p>In expounding St. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.14. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> makes an ample digression concerning the Synagogues, wherein he treateth of their antiquity and establishment; of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues after the Captivity; of the days in which men went to them, of the conductors of the Synagogues, and of their Preachers. He believeth that in this the Christian Churches have imitated sundry customs of the Jews; and that is it which others have evinced in whole Treatises.</p>
                     <p>A passage of the same Evangelist, <hi>viz. C.</hi> 5.17. gives our Author an occasion, to insert in his Harmony, a small Treatise of the different conditions that were found amongst the Jews, of the divers Orders of their Doctors, of the fundaments of their Religion in the time of our Saviour, of the different Sects, and particularly of the Sadduces and Pharisees. But all this is only an Abridgment of some parts of a greater work, that our Author proposed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to make, as may be seen in Section 1. of the Collection of the remarkable things concerning his Life.</p>
                     <p>For the better understanding of divers passages both of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we must of necessity have some idea of the manner of the structure of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and of its different parts. Therefore <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath undertaken to give us an exact description of this sumptuous Building, particularly such as it was in the time of our Saviour. We see a Draught of it at the beginning of this Treatise, that the Author himself had traced. As this Treatise had not been Printed till now, but in English, the Latin version made of it will appear a work altogether now to those that understand not the English Tongue. This same reason, (besides the delight it may be to all men to know how this Temple was made, whereof the Scriptures speak so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageously) engageth us to give a small description thereof, according to the Ideas of our Author.</p>
                     <p>The Top of the Hill of <hi>Moriah</hi> whereon the Temple was Builded, was at the first somewhat narrow, but by little and little it was made larger, partly in filling up the Valleys which were about it, and in envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roning it with a strong Wall. Under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple, it made a perfect square of 750 foot Diameter, and of 3000 in circuit. The Wall that environed it on all parts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to those that were in the midst of it, thirty seven foot and an half high, excepting over against the Eastern Gate, where it was but nine foot high, for a reason that <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> produces. On the outside this Wall was prodigiously high, raising it self from the bottom of Valleys which <hi>Moriah</hi> was envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned withal. On the side of the Eastern Gate, it was 600 foot high. It was of white stones, triangular, of 30 foot broad, and of nine high; so solid a structure, that this Wall remained till the destruction of the second Temple.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of the side of the <hi>East,</hi> to consider the exteriour circumference of this magnificent Building, one might see the principal Gate of this circumference, which was called the <hi>Gate of Susan.</hi> The entrance was in heighth 30 foot, and breadth fifteen; but the Ornaments of the Portal were raised 15 foot higher, and reached to both sides a little more than four feet. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove this was to be seen a Picture which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented <hi>Susan,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Media,</hi> which the Jews had caused to be put there, in remembrance of <hi>Esther</hi> and of the feast of <hi>Purim.</hi> That was the reason why it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Gate of <hi>Susan,</hi> tho it was likewise named the <hi>Royal Gate,</hi> because King <hi>Solomon</hi> had built the Wall on that side.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103507:18"/>One being ascended to this Gate, if he turned himself from the side whence he was come, part of the Mount of <hi>Olives</hi> was to be seen on the right hand, separated from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by a deep Valley, called the Valley of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> or of <hi>Tophet,</hi> or of <hi>Ashes.</hi> There it was that the Idolatrous Israelites used to Sacrifice, by an abominable super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, their own Children to <hi>Moloch.</hi> Right against the Gate, was the <hi>Mount of Olives,</hi> where the custom was to Sacrifice a Red Cow. Thither Men went by a way sustain'd by a double Vault, fearing lest the Priest, who was to officiate in this Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, should pollute himself as he went, not knowing it, upon some hidden Grave. On the <hi>Left</hi> appeared the same <hi>Mountain of Olives,</hi> separated from the City on that side, by the Brook and Valley of <hi>Cedron.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Gate of <hi>Susan,</hi> it was not just in the middle of the outward Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>Holy Mountain,</hi> because the Temple was not placed in the midst of the Top, but towards the North, else it could not have been opposite to the Temple, which was built on that si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, because the place of the Altar which the Fire from Heaven had marked, and which was on the North, had obliged <hi>Solomon</hi> to frame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the building of the House of God.</p>
                     <p>There were two Gates on the South part of this Wall, which were called the <hi>Gates of Hulda.</hi> People went by these two Gates to the City of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> At the West, on the side of <hi>Millo</hi> and <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> there were four, whereof that which was most North was called <hi>the Gate of the Rising,</hi> or of <hi>Coponius.</hi> By reason of the inequality of the Ground, and of the depth of the Valley which was at the foot of <hi>Moriah, Solomon</hi> had caused the Ground to be raised from his Palace to this Gate, and this rising was gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Trees on both sides. 'Twas that way the Kings went to the Temple. The next Gate was called <hi>Parbar,</hi> and the two others were named <hi>Assuppim.</hi> Within these two Gates was a building of the same name, where part of the Treasures of the Temple were kept.</p>
                     <p>On the North side, there was but one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gate named <hi>Tedi,</hi> or <hi>Tadde.</hi> On this side, the Wall which environed the Holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, was not quite on the verge of the Top, as on the other sides, there remained some space which had been neglected, to the end that <hi>Holy Place</hi> should make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Square. At the corner of this space which looked to the North-east, a Tower was built called <hi>Baris,</hi> which at first was the Mansion of some High Priests, and the place where were kept their Holy Garments; but since, <hi>Herod</hi> rebuilt it otherwise, and nam'd it <hi>the Antonian Tower,</hi> in remembrance of <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> it served to the Roman Soldiers for a Citadel, and he that was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of it, was called the <hi>Captain of the Temple, Act.</hi> 4.1.</p>
                     <p>After this entrance by one of the Gates we mentioned above, as by the Eastern Gate, there were to be seen along the Wall on the right and on the left three ranks of Marble Pillars, holding up a Cieling, which could keep out the Rain and the Sun, and furnish a covered Walk of 365 paces. There were like Porches on the four sides. only that which went along the Southern part of the circumference, had four ranks of Pillars, which formed three Alleys. The Cieling of that of the middle was much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than that of the sides, which was equal in heighth to the Cielings of the three other Porches, and this same Alley was propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably larger than the others. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and polluted persons were suffered to enter into these Porches, and there to walk round about the Temple, as well as in the inward space which these Pillars environed on all sides. Within this space was a long Walk surrounded with a Wall full of holes, so that light came through, by which one might discover all that passed about the Temple. This walk encompass'd the Court of <hi>the Women,</hi> and the ascent to it was by some steps. No Pagan was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enter therein. The Doctors of the <hi>Thalmud</hi> call it <hi>Chel.</hi> 'Twas this which the Jews in the time of <hi>Iosephus</hi> call'd the <hi>second Temple,</hi> whenas they named the <hi>space</hi> enclosed within this little Wall which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded all the <hi>Holy Mountain, The first Temple,</hi> which the Christian Authors call <hi>The Court of the Gentiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the <hi>Court</hi> of the Gentiles, men went up into the second Temple by four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen steps. 'Tis in this space, and in the Northern part of the Court of the Gentiles, where was Situate that which is called pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, the <hi>Temple with its two Courts.</hi> When they entred into the second Temple on the East side, they might see before them the gate and wall of the <hi>Court of the Women,</hi> from whence one might be distant seven or eight paces, and walk covered on all the sides of the Temple. Those that were minded to enter into the Court <hi>of the Women,</hi> might go in by three sides, to wit on the <hi>East</hi> on the <hi>North</hi> and on the <hi>South</hi> and were to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend by three steps, which were before each door. That on the East was more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent than the others, and 'twas for this they called it the <hi>Fair, Act.</hi> 3.2.</p>
                     <p>This Court was also a perfect square of 200 steps or thereabout in length &amp; breadth and which on the <hi>West</hi> had the Court of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> It was embellished with Porches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as was that which they called the <hi>Second Temple,</hi> excepting the corners, where were buildings destined for divers uses. In coming in by the gate, whereof we now spake, on the right hand was seen <hi>The House for Wood,</hi> whereinto was put the provision of Wood requisit for the Altar, and where the Priests that were polluted by some accident sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated that which was worm-eaten from the other; for it was thought unlawfull to put worm-eaten Wood upon the Altar. On the left hand was <hi>the House of the Nazarites</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a building where those that had accomplished their Vow of <hi>Nazaritism,</hi> and would return to their Ancient manner of Life, boiled the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103507:18"/>
flesh that remained of their offering. At the Corner which looked to the <hi>South-West</hi> was seen <hi>the House of Oil,</hi> wherein the Oil was kept which they stood in need of for the use of the Temple. Over against that, at the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite Corner which points to the <hi>North-West,</hi> was <hi>the House of the Leprous,</hi> where were kept enclosed those that presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be purified from the Leprosie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these different buildings were four Gates opposite to one another there was an Entrance from the <hi>Court of the Gentiles</hi> into that <hi>of the Women</hi> by three Gates, which were at the <hi>East, South</hi> and <hi>North</hi>; that which was at the <hi>West</hi> was for to pass from the <hi>Court of the Women</hi> into that <hi>of Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They ascended to this Gate of the Court of <hi>Israel</hi> by fifteen steps for the ground of this was higher by ten foot than that of the Women. This gate was called <hi>the Gate of Nicanor. Iosephus</hi> saith it was of brass, and that twenty men could scarcely open it. Amongst the Presages that preceded the ruin of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> one of them that most surprised, was that which happened to this Gate, which being well locked and bolted with great barrs of brass, opened of it self one night and no man meddled with it. The Court of <hi>Israel</hi> was imbellished within with a Porch which extended all round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Temple and which was supported by a rank of Marble Pillars, except in places where there was some building, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing it self within side, did hinder the continuation thereof. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully sought after the names and usages of these different buildings, and of the gates that were between both: But it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice here to remark that men entred into the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> by <hi>six gates</hi>; besides those we have named. There were on the <hi>North</hi> three, on the <hi>South</hi> three. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two were on the <hi>East,</hi> opposite to the <hi>Altar of Burnt offerings,</hi> those of the middle were over against the <hi>Holy place,</hi> and the two others over against the <hi>Holiest of all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Court of <hi>Israel</hi> was properly called the space that was betwixt the Pillars of the Porch and the Wall. It was about 16 foot and an half in breadth, and was 140 paces in length. The square space between the Porch and the Frontispiece of the Temple, was called the <hi>Court of the Priests,</hi> whereof the ground was higher by some feet than that of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi> On the right and left of the Gate of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> there were two Pulpits which were equal in height to the Ground of the Court of the Priests, where the Levites which sang the holy song, were accustomed to place themselves. At the corner of the Court up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right as you came in, were to be seen Marble Tables, Pillars, and Buckles of Iron fasten'd to the Pavement; there they Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, slead, and washed the victims. On the other side was the <hi>Altar of Burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi> This Altar was 15 foot high, and that the service might be made therein, there was made a kind of an ascent of stone without stairs, of 48 feet in length. This Altar was squared and was above 36 feet in circuit, but it was much more large at the bottom. At the end of the ascent was a large edge of a foot and a half broad, upon which the Priests ascended to adjust the Wood of the Altar, to lay thereon the Victims, and to rub with Blood the four Horns of the Altar, which extended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the corners of the edge unto the Top.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">c. 34.</note> 
                        <hi>Lightfoot</hi> upon the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Altar, proposes some difficulties, which he thinks cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved without having the Jews recourse to a Miracle. 1. It cannot be comprehended how it was possible to offer in a few days up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so little an Altar, such a prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Victims, such as the Scripture some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times speaketh of, as when it is said that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> offered in 14 days, 22000 <hi>Bullocks and</hi> 26000 <hi>small Cattle,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.63. They must therefore needs have offered more than 1500 Oxen, and above 8000 other Victims a day. Tho' all these Victims were not to be intirely burned, it's yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult to conceive how they could burn the very Fat of their Entrails and Kidneys. 2. The Blood of so many Beasts would make one think that all the Court must be overwhelm'd, and have drawn an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Flies together, and caused a great stink. 3. The Smoak and Scent of so much flesh burnt, should have necessarily stifled those that were about the Altar. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth to the <hi>first</hi> difficulty, that <hi>Solomon</hi> offered not only upon the Altar, but in the middle of the Court, as the History testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it, and that the Fire from Heaven is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more quick than ordinary Fire; to the <hi>second</hi> that by a perpetual Miracle, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a Fly in the Court of the Priests, and that the Blood ran in an instant by subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Chanels which brought it to a sink made for that use: and to the <hi>third,</hi> that by a third Miracle, the Smoak did rise always directly upwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what wind soever there was, so that it did not incommode those who were imployed in the Court.</p>
                     <p>Now to come back to his dimensions, it was about 50 paces in length from the <hi>East</hi> to the <hi>West,</hi> and almost twice as many in breadth. We shall not mark the Basons, nor the other Vessels that were in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our design is only to describe the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal parts of the Building. Those that would be instructed throughly therein, may consult <hi>Lightfoot</hi> himself.</p>
                     <p>On the West of this Court was the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tispiece of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Porch, by which they entred into the Holy place. The Top of the <hi>Holy Mount</hi> was not even, but it extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it self from the <hi>East</hi> to the <hi>West,</hi> the Threshold of the Entry of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Porch was 33 foot higher than that of the <hi>Gate of Susan.</hi> This Frontispiece was 150 foot broad, and 180 high: It was of a new white Marble, after the manner of Jasper, and of a Structure equally fair and solid. The Gate was sixty foot high, and thirty broad, and was all imbellished with Gold, which gave a great lustre, and which appeared very far off. The body of the Temple which was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103507:19"/>
but 100 foot broad, and 150 high was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Porch. It comprehended the <hi>Holy Place,</hi> and the <hi>Holiest of all,</hi> and divers Chambers above and on all sides. Although the Roof of the House was almost flat, the middle was more elevated and formed as a new Stage, higher than the Apartments that were on the North and South. This Top was garnished quite round with a kind of a Rail, as was common for all the Tops of Houses in <hi>Iudea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall stay no longer on this Description. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> can fully furnish the curious where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to satisfie themselves farther about the difference betwixt the Dimensions of the <hi>Temple of Solomon,</hi> of that which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built at the <hi>Return from Captivity,</hi> and of that of <hi>Herod,</hi> their different Uses, Apartments, Places where the Priests and Levites kept Guard at night, the changes of the place where the great <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> were to sit, and the disposition and figure of the Cherubims, and of the Ark, which giveth him an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to expound the manner whereby <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel, Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the mysterious symbol of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God. In fine, we may see here a compleat Treatise of the Temple of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> drawn from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> from <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> and the Doctors of the <hi>Thalmud.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. After, having given an Idea of the Temple, and of all its parts, there remain'd only to instruct us about the Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that was therein perform'd, to make us throughly know the principal Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Jewish Religion. 'Tis this also which <hi>Lightfoot</hi> in his Treatise of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Temple</hi> has done. He begins with the different degrees of Holiness, which the Jews attributed to divers places of <hi>Iudea,</hi> and particularly to the different parts of the Temple, which Holiness was so much the greater, as they drew near the <hi>most Holy Place.</hi> It was permitted to all manner of People to enter into the <hi>Court of the Gentiles,</hi> but there were Pillars at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the second Temple, where was seen written in Hebrew, Greek and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Characters, <hi>That it was lawful to none but the Israelites to enter into this Interiour Circumference.</hi> Thus the second Temple was more holy than the <hi>Court of the Gentiles,</hi> but the Court of the Women was more holy than the second Temple, in that it was permitted to those that were polluted, so that their pollution remained only till night, to enter into this last place; they curst not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the <hi>Court of the Women.</hi> The <hi>Court of Israel</hi> was yet more holy, seeing Women never entred thereinto, but when they went to offer some Sacrifice, and that no person polluted with what pollution soever, dared to set foot thereinto. The Court of the Priests likewise went beyond that of <hi>Israel</hi> in Holiness, seeing no Laick went ever thither, but when he went with an Oblation. It was an easie thing to discern a Laick from a Levite, or from a Priest, by the cloathing, but polluted persons could not be known by any mark, it was left to their own Consciences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nevertheless to strike awe into them, they would say that they had four sorts of punishments to fear, whereof the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were immediately to be inflicted by Divine Vengeance, and the two others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon Man. They called the first <hi>Death by the Hand of Heaven,</hi> that is to say, of God; and the second <hi>Chereth,</hi> or <hi>Cutting off.</hi> The Rabbins seem to distinguish these two sorts of punishment, but 'tis hard to know the difference they put betwixt them. Tho' they said that it was God alone that did send these chastisements, we must not think that as soon as some polluted person entred into a prohibited place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it came to mens knowledge, he was solely left to the Wrath of God; the Judges caused him to be whipt, according to the nature of the Case, or else the People without expecting their Sentence, beat the polluted body so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently sometimes, that he died<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this it was which they called <hi>The Blows of the Rebellion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These were the Precautions that were taken to keep the Temple from being polluted.<note n="(a)" place="margin">

The High Priest. 2. The <hi>Sagan,</hi> who was as his Vicar. 3. The two <hi>Catholikin,</hi> which were the Substitutes of the <hi>Sagan.</hi> 4. The seven <hi>Immarkalin,</hi> who were entrusted with the Keys of the Gates and Treasures. 5. They had under them three <hi>Gizbarin</hi> or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers. 6. The Head of the <hi>Order</hi> of Priests that were upon service. 7. The Heads of each Family that were found in this <hi>Order.</hi> 8. Those that were only Priests. The first five Orders formed a kind of perpetual Council, who took care of what concerned the Temple. There were besides these fifteen <hi>Memonin,</hi> or Commissaries about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things, whereof a part changed every week with the Order of the Priests. The Enumeration thereof may be seen in <hi>p.</hi> 679.</p>

The Consort of Voices was never of less than twelve Men, but that number could be augmented as much as they pleased. As to the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there were Trumpets, Flutes, and three other Instruments that the Hebrews call <hi>Nebel, Kinnor,</hi> and <hi>Tseltsel,</hi> which are hard to compare to any of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Instruments, because they are too Antient for our Inquisition. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses thereupon his Conjectures, and tells us afterwards what <hi>Psalms</hi> were sung on divers Festivals, and after what manner the Instruments were joyned to the Voices.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Subject of the Classes of the Levites, <hi>Lightfoot</hi> informeth us also that there were 24 Classes of Israelites, that were necessitated to go to the Temple each his week, fearing lest there should be some time, the Officiates only present at the Divine Service. They kept themselves in the <hi>Court of Israel,</hi> and represented the whole body of the People.</p>
                     <p>Our Author treateth after that of the Sacrifices and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Jews,<note n="(a)" place="margin">cap. 8.</note> whereof he expoundeth the different sorts, and the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies that were observed in offering them. <note n="(b)" place="margin">cap. 9.</note> But he applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self particularly to describe the common Sacrifice of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening, and all the parts of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine service, wherewith it is accompanied. <note n="(c)" place="margin">cap. 10.</note> They took care not only to observe the Ceremonies prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Law, but to inspire more respect into the People, it was prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to carry into the Temple any stick. to enter therein with Shoes or Feet dusty, to carry Money about one in a Purse. Neither was it permitted to spit upon any place of the <hi>Holy Mountain, if it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to spit, they were to do it in some corner of their cloathes,</hi> saith <hi>Maimonides.</hi> No body was to make any gesture that should in the least restifie the least irreverence, as to wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

No body might sit in the Court of <hi>Israel,</hi> saving the Princes of the House of <hi>David.</hi> They would likewise have taken it for a mark of irreverence, if any one uncovered his Head whilst he prayed to God; and the Priests were so far from taking off their <hi>Tiaras,</hi> that they covered themselves with a vail over that. They imitated in that those that were in some great sorrow, or that feared some fatal accident. But the Apostles esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the Christian Churches a custom quite contrary. Every man that prayeth or that prophesieth, saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> having his Head covered, dishonoureth his Head, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4.</p>

                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">cap. 10.11, 15.</note> After this general descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the service that was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed throughout the year in the Temple, <hi>Lightfoot</hi> treateth very largely on the Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of the Jews. He begins by telling us after what manner they observed the new Moon, and how in a very short time they made known the day it appeared through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Iudea.</hi> It was done by the means of Fires that were lighted successively upon a vast number of Hills, or by Messengers, which was not extreamly certain, and gave much trouble, whereas if the Jews had known a little of Astronomy, a Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or an Almanack would have spared them all this labour, and would more sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have marked the new Moons.</p>
                     <p>After this are seen the differences that the Jews put betwixt the Passover celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and those that have been cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated since that time: The manner how they took away all the Leaven that was found in their Houses: Which was done the morning and afternoon of the day of the Passover, before they Sacrificed the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb: The precise time of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molation: The number of persons that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociated to eat it together, and the manner it was offered in the Temple. No body till now has so exactly described all these circumstances, and we may further say that neither <hi>Buxtorf</hi> nor <hi>Cappel</hi> who have had a dispute upon this Subject, have with so much clearness spoken of it as our Author; The Ceremonies the Jews observed in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Passover, <hi>Ch.</hi> 13. are of much use to Illustrate what the Evangelists say of the last Passover of our Lord, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Original of the Institution of the Eucharist. This it was that obliged us to give here an abridgment of what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor saith; in which those that doubt may find the proofs.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They did not begin to eat till night, whence the Evangelists say, <hi>that the night being come our Saviour</hi> sate at meat <hi>with his Disciples.</hi> They did not eat much before this meal, or else they fasted, that they might with more appetite eat the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They neither did properly sit, nor altogether lye down, but stretched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the beds which were about the Table, so that they held themselves half risen upon the left Elbow. This was the ordinary posture of the Romans, as may be yet seen in their ancient Monuments, but the Rabbins do seek herein for a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and say men put themselves into this posture to note that they were free, because slaves were used to eat standing. They call this Posture at Table <hi>Iesibba,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Thus in process of time they changed this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, tho the Law had commanded them, to eat the Passover standing, and in haste, with their staf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in their hand, and their shooes on their feet, as if they were begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a journey. Our Saviour, that did not so much regard the Letter as the Sense of the Law, accommodated himself to this custom of his time, and it is by this that <hi>Lightfoot</hi> expoundeth these words of the Gospel of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> one of them that Jesus loved lean'd upon his Bosom, <hi>ch.</hi> 13.23. Jesus Christ
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103507:20"/>
was in the posture we have observ'd; so that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> who was in like manner lying near him, was almost in his Bosom, because Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ could not lift his right Arm to make use thereof, but in a way that it should seem to embrace this Disciple that he loved. Thence it cometh that to speak softly to Jesus Christ, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> needed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to turn his Head backwards and lean it upon the breast of our Saviour, this he did when <hi>Peter</hi> made him a Sign to enquire of Jesus, <hi>who was he that was to betray him: lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> saith the Evangelist, <hi>upon the Breast of Iesus, he said, Lord who is it? ver.</hi> 25.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As soon as he was lain after this manner, one of the company gave thanks, and each drank a Glass of Wine with Water. There could not be less Wine than the 16th part of a Hin. That was the <hi>first cup.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. After having drunk each washed his Hands in plunging them into the Water. They thought themselves obliged to take notice of all the Ceremonies, and to say for example; <hi>This Night is different from all others, in which we wash but once, but in this we wash us twice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Paschal Lamb was serv'd in with unleaven'd bread, and a Dish of bitter Herbs. They might be green or dry, but they were not to be boiled or salted. Besides that, other food was added, that there should be enough to fill them. They had particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Dish that they called <hi>Charoseth,</hi> which was a Ragoot composed of Figs, Dates, and Raisins with a little Vinegar. All that mingled and kneaded together, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the <hi>Bricks</hi> that their Fathers had made in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. He that rehearsed the <hi>Haggadah,</hi> or the Paschal Prayers, took a few bitter Herbs, and then putting his hand into another dish, he put thereto at least the bigness of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live of some other food, and every one did the like. He did that for to excite curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for to oblige those that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to be attentive to all the ceremony. 'Tis upon this occasion that our Lord said, that he <hi>who put his hand in the dish with him would betray him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. A little after all the Dishes were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away, and every one drank a <hi>second time,</hi> and then it was that he who rehearsed the <hi>Haggadah</hi> related the deliverance from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and the institution of the Passover. The dishes were after that put upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and all the Guests drank a <hi>second time,</hi> after that they returned thanks many times.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. They also washed their hands again, and he that served took two unleavened Cakes, broke one in the middle, put it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other that was whole, and gave thanks. It was the order constantly kept on this occasion, whereas on other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they gave thanks before they brake Bread, as it appeareth in divers places of the Gospels.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Hitherto they eat but bread and herbs, but after these ceremonies he that officiated gave God Thanks in this wise. <hi>Blessed be thou O Lord our God, Eternal King, who hast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sanctified us by the Precepts, and hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to eat Sacrifices.</hi> Then they ate of a Sacrifice, if they had offered any a few days before, or of some other food, if they had no Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. After a second Thanksgiving like the first, except that it ended with these words, <hi>and who hast commanded us to eat the Paschal Lamb,</hi> they ate this Lamb, and every one was obliged to eat at least the bigness of an Olive.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. After they had eaten the Paschal Lamb, he that officiated washed his hands three times, and gave thanks upon the <hi>third Cup</hi> that he then drank. This was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Cup of Thanksgiving, because as they drank it, they gave thanks to end the Meal. Hence it is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it the Cup of Blessing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. because it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the occasion of the Cup of Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jews, that Jesus Christ instituted his Eucharist. All were obliged to drink this Cup of Benediction, and the two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ones. The very Children them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were not exempted.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. In fine a little while after, they drank a fourth Cup, which was called the Cup of <hi>Hallel,</hi> because that after they had drank it, they would sing the <hi>Hallel,</hi> which was a Song composed of six Psalms, which are from the 113 to the 118th. This Song was yet followed with a Benediction.</p>
                     <p>In the sequel with the same exactness is found the description of what was done the second day of the Paschal week, the manner how they gathered, and offered the Omer of the <hi>first fruits</hi> of the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Pentecost</hi>; of the Ceremonies of the <hi>day of Expiation,</hi> and of the Feast of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles. Lightfoot</hi> addeth a word of the Festivals of the Trumpets and of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</p>

                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">cap. 17.</note> He endeth this Treatise by describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some other parts of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick service. He shews the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how the Kings read a section of the Law, the first day of the feast of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles: the ceremonies with which they sacrificed the Red Cow: The examination of a Woman whom her Husband suspected to have committed Adultery: the Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Leprous: the oblation of the first fruits: and the manner how they provided Wood for the Altar.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. There remaineth in this Volume but three little Treatises, whereof it will be sufficient to mark the Titles, because they contain nothing particular. The first is of the Descent of Jesus Christ into Hell, which the Author understandeth to be the time that the Soul of Jesus Christ remained in Heaven, for according to him <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which hath been translated Hell in the Creed, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signifieth the place, where the Souls of the wicked are, as well as the receptacle of the Righteous. The second is a Latine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon made at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in 1652. where <hi>Lightfoot</hi> took his Degree of Doctor. The Text is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>He that loveth not the Lord Iesus let him be</hi> Anathema-Maran-atha.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103507:20"/>
The third is a Dispute of Divinity publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the same occasion, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of these two Theses. (1.) <hi>That after the Canon of Scripture hath been perfected, we ought to expect no new Revelations.</hi> (2.) <hi>That the personal Election of particular persons is founded upon the Scripture.</hi> He only proposes this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Thesis, without proving it, as he doth the first.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The second Volume of <hi>Lightfoot</hi> principally consisteth in his <hi>Horae Hebraicae &amp; Thalmudicae,</hi> upon the Evangelists, the <hi>Acts,</hi> and some places of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and upon all the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> As the Author hath composed these Works in Latine, and as they have already been Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> so we shall say nothing of them.</p>
                     <p>We only must speak a word or two of a Treatise that is before this Volume, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Harmonia Chronica, &amp;c. A Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Harmony and Order of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; where is methodically disposed the Text of the four Evangelists; as also the Times of the History of the Apostles; the Order of the Epistles, and Times of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> The Text is cleared by literal Remarks, and Deductions from the <hi>Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> upon the most difficult places. To that hath been added a Discourse of the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and of the State of the Jews after this accident.</p>
                     <p>This Work differs from the Harmony of the Evangelists, which the Author publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ten years before, which we spoke of in the Extract of the first Volume. 1. In that here is found the Time in which the Epistles have been written, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> is much briefer in this Work, where he makes not an exact Commentary. 3. He there intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces more Rabbinism. 4. He more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observes the Years and Times of every thing.</p>
                     <p>There is a Preface that sheweth the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's design, and the profit of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Jews for the Exposition of the New Testament, which is proved by a pretty long Commentary upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. The Author testifieth that he had made these Notes upon the Gospels, to serve for an Exposition to the four Evangelists; the whole Text he had disposed into Columns, in a Method of Harmony, but that he found no opportunity of Printing them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lightfoot</hi> extreamly differeth from the Sentiment of several Interpreters of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> He believeth that God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to St. <hi>Iohn</hi> that which immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the last things that <hi>Daniel</hi> foretold. This Prophet had marked the Ruine of the four Monarchies, which he said would be succeeded by the Reign of the <hi>Messia,</hi> and it is with the Reign of the <hi>Messia</hi> that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> begins. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> believeth that he had these Visions about the 12th year of <hi>Nero,</hi> a long time before the Ruine of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> In the three first Chapters he marketh the State of the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> such as it was in his time: But from the 4th Chapter he begins to speak of the time to come, and foretels the Ruine of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and divers misfortunes of the Roman Empire, to Chapter 8. From the 9th to the end, St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> according to our Author, hath respect to Times more distant, and in this <hi>Lightfoot</hi> is conform enough to the common Sentiments of Protestant Interpreters, only he speaks in terms a little more general, than others commonly do. He carefully discovers, according to his custom, all the allusions that are found in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> to the Ceremonies and Sentiments of the Jews.</p>
                     <p>The Treatise that is added to the end contains an Abridgment of the History of the Jews from the third year of <hi>Nero,</hi> to the first of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and the state of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin,</hi> of the Schools, and of the learned amongst the Jews after the Ruine of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> He speaks of the Hereticks of the first Ages, which came out from amongst the Jews. He defends this Nation against those that accuse it to have corrupted the Old Testament. He endeth with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Jews which according to him may be yet expected, provided we Imagin not that the whole Nation shall be converted, but that we only believe that a greater number of 'em may.</p>

                     <p>Dr. <hi>Duport</hi> having renounc'd his Charge of <hi>Professor of the Greek Tongue,</hi> he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended Mr. <hi>Barrow</hi> who had been his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, whereupon he was admitted to Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>read with great applause,</hi> but he could not obtain the place because 'twas thought he was inclin'd to <hi>Arminianism</hi> which was not savoured in <hi>England</hi> during the Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this made him resolv'd to travail. He went to <hi>France,</hi> from thence to <hi>Italy,</hi> where he embarked at <hi>Leghorn</hi> for <hi>Smyrna,</hi> from whence he went to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> there he tarried a year, and we are assured during that time he read the works of the most famous <hi>Patriarch</hi> that that City ever had. (We may easily understand it was <hi>St Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> that is here spoken of;) afterwards Mr. <hi>Barrow</hi> embarked for <hi>Venice</hi> from whence, he returned for <hi>England</hi> by the way of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>

                     <p>When <hi>King Charles the second</hi> was restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all the World believed Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> would be preferred, because he had been always firm to the Interests of the <hi>Royalists,</hi> but being disappointed he made this Distich upon his unkind treatment.</p>

God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath Geometry in his thoughts—but thou, O Lord, how great a Geometrician art thou! For tho' this Science has no bounds, yet one may find an infinite number of new Theorems by the only assistance of a humane Capacity. THOV seest all these Truths at one glance without any chain of consequences, and without being wearied with a long search of demonstrations. In other things our Intellect is defective, and it seems that we do think of I do not know what, for want of a perfect assurance: From whence it happens that there are almost as many Opinions as different Persons. But all the World agree in the Truth of Mathematicks, and 'tis in this that the Mind of Man feels its strength, and is perswaded that it can effect something great and wonderful,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This only is able to enflame me with the Love of Thee, and to make me wish with as much ardor as is possible, for that happy day in which my Spirit being delivered from every thing that now perplexes it, shall be assured not only of these Truths, but of an infinite number of others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the trouble of deducing consequences,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>There is without doubt but a very few Men, who amongst those reasons which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce 'em to wish for Heaven, give this, <hi>of expecting the Happiness of a Perfect Knowledge of the Mathematicks there.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Barrow</hi> having wearied himself with these Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, resolved to addict himself only to the study of Divinity: After which the Bishops of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> and <hi>Salisbury</hi> gave him some Benefices, and the King made him <hi>Rector of Trinity Colledge in Cambridge</hi> in the year 1672. The Colledges of the <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of England</hi> are otherwise regulated than those beyond Sea: The charge of the <hi>Master of a Colledge</hi> is much more consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than that of the Rectors of Forreign Academies or Colledges. A few years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mr. <hi>Barrow</hi> was preferred to a more eminent Post, to wit, <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> which is the greatest charge of the University, and after this <hi>Chancellor,</hi> which is not given but to <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>first Quality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Author of the Life of Mr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> informs us how he governed the Colledge with an <hi>Vniversal Applause</hi>; but it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to say, that he there composed divers <hi>Treatises,</hi> and amongst others, that of the Supremacy of the Pope, which is at the end of the first Volume.</p>
                     <p>In fine, he died at <hi>London</hi> the 4th of <hi>March,</hi> the year 1677. and was buried at <hi>Westminster,</hi> where his friends erected a <hi>Marble Monument</hi> without an Epitaph, which is added to the end of <hi>his Life.</hi>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Barrow</hi> in the beginning of his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> says, it seems at first sight, <hi>That it rather contains the Laws of the Iewish State, than their Moral Precepts,</hi> since there's nothing spoke of the manner how we ought to live in regard of our selves as to the <hi>Continency, Sobriety</hi> or <hi>Devotion,</hi> and which we owe towards God, as to <hi>Prayer, Thanksgiving</hi> &amp; <hi>Confession</hi> of sins <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It seems to have a particular respect to the Jews, who were a chosen people, and that God govern'd them after a more peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than other Nations, in giving 'em Laws for every particular thing which was only accommodated to the State of the Israelites, to whom God only made himself known; and that so this Law does not oblige all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in that especial sense wherein it was given by the Holy Ghost. After this he gives divers Reasons for which we yet ought to have the <hi>Decalogue</hi> in the greatest Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to observe it exactly, except the 4th Commandment, which doth not oblige the observation of <hi>Christians</hi> in this, that it is <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> no more than the first <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi> who also were not the less pleasing to God, notwithstanding the testimony of <hi>Iustin</hi> and St. <hi>Ireneus</hi>; but Reason it self dictates that it is necessary to set some time apart in which we may more particularly apply our selves to Divine Service, and in which Servants may rest themselves from Labour; 'tis this the Heathens themselves observed, witness <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Barrow</hi> says nothing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, since there is enough spoken of them by the most able Protestant Divines.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning there is one thing worthy of remark, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Page 543.</note> Besides other Washings which he speaks of, he shews that it was a Custom amongst the Jews, that those who were dedicated to God, were exhorted to repentance for transgressing the Law, and were wash'd, in publick Testimony that they should change their Life. He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this assertion upon the success which the Baptism of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist had, for it wou'd have been, without doubt, rejected as an Innovated Ceremony in a time when the Jews had such an extravagant respect to their own Traditions, that they wou'd have opposed it, if not upheld upon an Antient Custom. If this is so, one might also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that the Lustrations of the Heathens gave birth to this extraordinary Baptism; for 'tis well known, that those who had committed some Crimes, were to be wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by some <hi>publick person,</hi> and even by <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> themselves, whereof we find an infinite number of Examples in the most Antient History of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>

                     <p n="3">III. The third piece which is in this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, is <hi>a Treatise of the Pope's Supremacy, to which is added a Discourse concerning the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church.</hi> There has been already published <hi>in quarto in</hi> 1679. by Dr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> to whom the Author had committed the Care of the Impression at his death; the first Testimony in a small Preface.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103507:22"/>
enough to decide for ever, all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to disswade all wise men of either Party from writing any more upon this Subject.</p>
                     <p>We shall remark in few words the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of his Treatise, to the end that we may have a general Idea of what is contained in it, we have at the first sight a preface, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Author relates the different senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Doctors of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> touching the Authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> which some make Inferiour to that of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, whilst others are of a contrary perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, yet he briefly gives us the History of the <hi>Original, and progress of the Papal Power</hi>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Barrow</hi> having remarked, that all that is said on this Power, can only be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>seven suppositions,</hi> he divides his Work into seven parts, and examines them one after another; these are the suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. (1.) <hi>That St.</hi> Peter <hi>received from Iesus Christ the Preheminence amongst the Apostles, and had given to him an Authority and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Iurisdiction over the rest.</hi> (2.) <hi>That the rights and advantages of this Soveraignty were not personal, but might be transmitted to others, and left to their Successors.</hi> (3.) <hi>That St.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>was the Bishop of</hi> Rome. (4.) <hi>That St.</hi> Peter <hi>continued to be Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>after he had left</hi> Judea <hi>and that he remained so till his death.</hi> (5.) <hi>That 'tis from thence that the priviledges of the Pope do come as Successor to St.</hi> Peter, <hi>to wit Vniversal Iurisdiction over the whole Church of Iesus Christ.</hi> (6.) <hi>That the Popes have effectually enjoy'd this Power, and have exercised it without discontinuations from St.</hi> Peter <hi>till now.</hi> (7.) <hi>That this Power could not be lost, nor be lessened by any means whatsoever.</hi>

It appears too great a vanity for a man that had the Vertue and Humility of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> He supposes it is very probable that the Apostles insisted upon no points of Ceremonies amongst themselves, which should oblige 'em to a certain order, as to precedency in walking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he confesses that one might oppose to this the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of some Fathers, but he maintains, that their Authority is not of so great weight in these things, which are not <hi>essential to Faith,</hi> because that upon these occasions, they followed their own thoughts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, being as much actuated by the dictates of their imaginations, as other-men, altho St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and other <hi>African Doctors</hi> assure us, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had only this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, because that we might learn thereby to keep the Unity of the Church.

                     <p>The Author after this applies himself to shew that the Popes since St. <hi>Peter,</hi> have <hi>not enjoyed without discontinuation this Soveraign Authority,</hi> which they usurp, since <hi>they have not had the power to convocate general Councils, nor to preside there, nor to make Laws, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselves to the Canons of the Councils; and lastly, that they enjoy'd not for many Ages, the other Rights of this Soveraignty.</hi> There is in this Chapter, the <hi>History of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of General Councils,</hi> and the oppositions which have been made divers times against the power of the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p>'Tis this which contains the treaties of the Popes Supremacy, the other follows, to wit, the <hi>Vnity of the Church,</hi> where Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> designs to prove, <hi>that Vnity may well subsist without the necessity of the Christian Churches having a visible head.</hi> He engages to shew that the Unity of the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in this, that all the Christians do agree in Fundamentals, particularly in those which have a necessary connexion with Piety and the Practice of good works, and in this, that they be joined in the bond of mutual chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He afterwards shews in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Christian Churches may root out Heresie and Schism, without the assistance of a Visible Head, and keep at the same time a Conformity of Discipline in things of the highest consequence, even when it cou'd not be established but by Humane Prudence; but he yet maintains that this last Union is possible, in supposing certain things which are not necessary, nor ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apostles, and he gives many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to which he adds divers Examples in Ecclesiastical History, by which one may see he believes it not necessary that there be an Union of Discipline amongst the Churches. Upon this occasion he particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly makes use of the Epistles of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> by which it appears, according to Dr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> that every Bishop lay under a double obligation, whereof one regarded his Flock in particular, the other the whole Church. <hi>By the first,</hi> he was obliged to take care that every thing be done in good order in his Church, and that nothing should be done which was not for Edification, and this should be endeavour'd by taking counsel of his Clergy and his People. <hi>By the second,</hi> he was obliged, when the good of his Flock required it, to confer with other Bishops touching the means of preserving Truth and Peace: But in that time a Bishop knew not what it was to be hindered from acting according to the extent of his Power, by appealing to a Superior Power, to which he was obliged to give an account of the Administration of his Charge. Bishops were then as Princes in their Jurisdictions, but they omitted not to keep a certain Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence, for the preserving an universal Peace. <note n="(d)" place="margin">Ep. 55.</note>

                        </note> A famous Divine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving maintained the Unity of an Ecclesiastical Discipline, so that all the Christian Churches ought to be (according to him) in the nature of a Confederacy, <hi>which submits every Church in particular to an entire body</hi> (if it is permitted so to speak.) Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> believes he is obliged to refute this Tenet, and to that end he hath drawn from his Works twelve proofs of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which that <hi>Divine</hi> has spread in divers places, and which he proposed with great care, altho' after a manner very obscure and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103507:23"/>
intricate. This last Author having object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for instance, to those who believe not, that the Unity of Discipline is necessary, the Article of the Creed, where 'tis said, <hi>I believe in the Holy Catholick or Vniversal Church,</hi> and the Creed of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where 'tis said, <hi>The Holy Catholick and Apostolick Church:</hi> Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> answers to this, that this Article is not in the Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Christian Faith, which is found in St. <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> no more than in the Creed of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>; And (1.) That it was not in the Apostles Creed, which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> makes use of, but that it is added after the Times of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> and St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> against the Heresies and Schisms which sprung up in the <hi>Christian Church.</hi> (2.) That it agrees with the Unity of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in many respects, and that this is not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Unity which is in Question, and which is not decided in the <hi>Creed.</hi> (3) 'Tis fairly supposed, that the Unity which is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the Creed of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> is that of outward Government. (4.) That one might reasonably think that the sense of <hi>this Article</hi> is no other than this, <hi>That we make profession to remain stedfast in the body of Christians, which are scatter'd throughout the whole World, and which received the Faith, the Discipline and the Manner of living Ordained by Iesus Christ and his Apostles, that we are bound to be charitable to all good Christians with which we are ready to Communicate: That we are willing to observe the Laws and Constitutions, and Ioynt-Opinion of the Churches for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Truth, Order and Peace. Lastly, That we renounce all Heretick Doctrines, all scandalous Practices, and all manner of Factions.</hi> (5.) That it appears that this is the sense of this Article, because that he hath put it in the Creed to preserve the Truth, Discipline and Peace of the Church. (6.) That 'tis not reasonable to explain this Article in any manner which agrees not with the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Times</hi> and Primitive Church, for then there was no Union of Discipline amongst Christians like to what has been since.</p>
                     <p>As it was objected to Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> that this opinion favours the Independants, so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he shews the difference between it and that of these Men, after which he draws divers consequences from his own positions, as, That those who separate from the Communion of the Church in which they live (that is established on good foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) are Guilty of Schism, and ought to be Censured by, and excluded from the Communion of all other Churches; and they must not think themselves to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from Error, altho some other Church would receive them, <hi>as a Subject cannot withdraw himself from the obedience of his natural Prince in putting himself under the Protection of another.</hi> This also is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the Apostolick Canons which the antient Church hath observ'd with much Care, as Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> makes appear by many examples.</p>
                     <p>This is according to his opinion a means to extirpate Schisms, and not that which is proposed by the Roman Church, to wit, to <hi>Establish a Political Vnion amongst divers Churches by which they are Subordinate to one only.</hi> Every Church ought to suffer the others to enjoy in peace their Rights and Liberties, and content it self to condemn dangerous errours and factions, and to assist with Counsel the other Churches when they have need thereof.</p>
                     <p>The second Volume contains the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Creed in 34 Sermons upon this Article. <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghost:</hi> The rest being briefly explained, because that the Author has treated of 'em in other places of his Works, marked in a little advertisment which is at the End of his Sermons. These Sermons are not simple explications of the Letter of the Creed. The Author hath explained the Articles as he had occasion, by divers texts of Scripture treating of the matter, that he found therein, and the particular circumstances of each text. He shews first how much doubting is necessary, and on the contrary in the two following, what Faith is Reasonable and Just. In the fourth and fifth he explains Justification by Faith. He afterward proves in four Sermons successively the <hi>existence of a Deity</hi> by the Works of Creation by the order of the Body of Man, consent of all Nations and by supernatural effects. The tenth and two following treat of the Unity of God, of his power and of the creation of the World. In the 13th and to the 20th the Author proves the truth of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> the falseness of Paganism and Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metanism, Imperfection of the Religion of the Jews and the excellency of that of Jesus Christ, whom he shews in four large Sermons to be the true Messia: Afterwards he explains all that is contained in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond article of the Creed. In the two last he shews the Justice and certainty of a day of Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In fine the 34th treats all along of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>The third Volume contains 45 Sermons, which treat mostly of Morals. The three first are upon those texts of the Scripture which command us to do all in the Name of Jesus Christ, and in Imitation of him. The six following shew the Submission which we ought to have to the will of God, and contentment of mind to which the Apostle gives so great praises. The 10th and 11th treat of patience and joy, the 12th and 13th on the study of a mans self, the 14th and 15th of the thoughts of our latter end, the 16th and 17 of the danger of deferring repentance, the 18th and from thence to the 22th of the labours and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of all sorts of persons, of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever condition they may be, the 23d. of the depth of the Judgment of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the four following of the obedience we owe to our spiritual Guide, the 28th and the following to the 31st, of self-love and its different kinds, the 32d and unto the 35th to do nothing but what is honest in the eyes of the world, the three following of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103507:23"/>
goodness of God, and that he is no respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of persons, the 39th and unto the 42th of the Universality of Redemption and the three last of the birth and passion of Jesus Christ and of the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>Besides what we have said of the method of Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> which is that that is at this day observed by the most able Divines of the English Church, 'twill not be amiss to observe that by the application he hath made to the Mathematicks he has formed to himself a habit of writing very exactly, avoiding unuseful digressions and making use of Solid proofs rather than Rhetorical figures, according to the Custom of many Preachers who apply themselves rather to a plausible eloquence than the Solidity of sound reasons. It was thought necessary to give this account, lest the Publick should be displeased with the name of Sermon which was so dreadful, for three Volumes in folio to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing else. Those who have been in <hi>England,</hi> and have had any knowledge of the writings of the Divines of that Country, know the esteem in which our Author is there; but to satisfie in some manner those who understand not English, I shall here give an extract of the 8th Sermon in the 2d. Book where the Author proves <hi>the existence of</hi> God by the Consent of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lactantius</hi> — After having cited many Heathen and Christian Authors against A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism, he brings the testimony of all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Nations, which agree almost in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the belief of a Divinity. <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Populorum atque Gentium in Vna hac re non dissidentium,</hi> this is of great force, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be considered in it self or by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to its Original.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An Antient Philosopher</hi> ranged probable things in this order, <hi>that which seems true to some learn'd persons is in some sort probable, that which appears so to the greatest part or to all the Learned, is most probable, what is believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by most men, both Learned and Ignorant, is yet more likely, but what all men consent to has the greatest probability of truth</hi>; so that one must be very extravagantly obstinate to have the boldness to deny it, there is no man in the World can by his reasons only ballance the constant authority of all men. If any one by a Spirit of contradiction or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise should undertake to prove that Snow is black, as did <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> or maintain motion impossible, as <hi>Zeno</hi> did, or that contradictory assertions may be true at the same time as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> did: That there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no other means to refute such a man, because he hath rejected the most evident principles, and opposes himself to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal consent of Mankind; if he refuses such a concession, all that we can do is to look upon him rather with pity than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. We ought to have very convincing and clear reasons to resist the common suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of all men and accuse them equally of error.</p>
                     <p>To illustrate this still more, or rather to demonstrate the <hi>Thesis</hi> upon which it is founded, it is necessary to cite the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of some Heathen Philosophers which cannot be suspected on this occasion. <hi>The consent of all men</hi> (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>is of very great weight to us, 'tis an argument a thing is true when it appears so to all the World, thus we conclude there is a Divinity, because that all men believe it, there being no Nation however cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted which denies it. Cicero</hi> says, <hi>the same thing in several places, and</hi> observes further <hi>that many Nations had extravagant opinions of the Divinity, yet they all agree in this, that there is one eternal power, on which all men have their dependance. In violent disputes</hi> (saith <hi>Maximus of</hi> Tyre) <hi>in contestations and divers opinions which are amongst men, one may see a Law and Doctrine equally established in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that there is a God which is King and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all men, and that there are many Gods Sons of this Supream Being, which Reign with him</hi> —This is confess'd by the <hi>Greeks and Barbarians,</hi> the Inhabitants of all places both Learn'd and Ignorant. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny like Witnesses and if any <hi>Philosophers</hi> have contradicted this general consent, they are so few in number, that according to the foresaid Author they ought to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as Monsters, as an <hi>Oxe without Horns, and a Fowl without Wings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we should consider the Original of this common Opinion, we should acknowledge it yet more solid, for in fine, this consent can proceed but from one of these four things. Where there is a thought which is the result of a natural Instinct, as the most evident principles of the Sciences and the desire we have to be happy, as <hi>Cicero</hi> 
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                           <hi>De. Nat. Deor Lib.</hi> 1. and 2.</note> and many other <hi>Philosophers</hi> have declared. Where we have a natural disposition to receive this Impression, as our eyes are naturally disposed to see the Light as soon as it appears, as <hi>Iulian</hi> 
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Iulian Heraclit.</hi>
                        </note> himself said. Where some strange reason that presents it self to the minds of men even the grossest and what depends chiefly upon common notions hath produced this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent as <hi>Plutarch</hi> has it. Where, in fine some ancient Tradition that came from the same source, has spread this opinion through all the earth, according to the thoughts of some others. There can be no other way Imagined by which this opinion hath been received amongst all men who are so much inclined to judge diversly of the same thing; now chuse which of these ways you will, our reasons are equally strong and convincing; if it is by the Light of Nature 'twould be as extravagant to deny it as that the most evident principles of all Siences are false. if 'tis said, that 'tis by a natural disposition that men believe there is a God, why should we resist the Instinct of Nature, since the notions thereof never deceive us? If you agree that there is a powerful reason which persuades all men, 'tis renouncing a Common sence to refuse to yield thereunto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:103507:24"/>But if they agree that man received this knowledge from an ancient tradition, as appears more likely, we must seek from whence this tradition is come to us, and who was the Common Master of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The Names of those who were the first founders of a sect are sufficiently known, as are they also who have engaged the World in certain opinions, but of him that invented this, there's neither name nor place to be found, nor time in which he lived, nor the manner whereby it was introduced and spread amongst Men; 'tis this that makes one believe that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this tradition were our first Parents, who as they could not be Ignorant of their Original were obliged without doubt to teach this truth to their children. It is easily conceived that from thence all the World have learnt it. This thought conducts us to another which is of the greatest Importance to the subject we are speaking of, <hi>viz</hi> that all mankind is descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from one man only, or at least a very little number of People that assembled together, from whence appears first that the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men had a beginning, and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we cannot resist the doctrine of the existence of a Deity as an apolitical fiction, for suppose that mankind hath a beginning upon the earth, from whence could he draw his Original but from a Divinity, as we have conceived? what other being could form bodies so admirably as ours, and to have joyn'd to 'em an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence like that of our soul? let us consider also who hath taught the first man there was a God, and how it entred into his mind, that he drew his existence from him, if he that formed him had not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it to him in a sensible manner, and taught him 'twas to him he owed his being only? in a word since they have taught to their posterity, we have no reason to refuse 'em our belief, and we can't Imagin their testimonies less worthy of faith, nor find men who can be instructed in their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal than themselves, nor can we reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably reject a Tradition which is transmitted from 'em to us: This reason we find entire in <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                        </note> Plato. <hi>We must believe those who told us they were of the race of the Gods, since they say they know perfectly from whom they were descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, 'tis impossible to distrust the Children of the Gods altho they should bring no evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of what they declared, and since they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance things only that belong to themselves, 'tis Iust to believe 'em.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus one sees these two truths, <hi>the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Tradition of a Divinity</hi> and the <hi>Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition that all men are come from the same Original,</hi> maintain both. As to the last there are divers Histories and opinions that confirm it, altho' it cannot be better upheld than by the universal belief I just spoke of. Nevertheless 'tis not unuseful to give you some examples.</p>
                     <p>'Tis without doubt by an antient Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (which relates no more, than to the first men as the greatest part of the Heathens have believed) that all mankind drew their Original from the same Parents who receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their being from that divinity in resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of which they were form'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>There are also some Histories which agree with the Sacred Writ; as what the Poets say of the long life of the first men, of the general Corruption of all Mankind, and of the Deluge sent to punish them; several things have been also said of the Divinity of <hi>Hero</hi>'s, which seems to come from the same source. To which may be added divers Customs formerly spread almost thro' the World; as that <hi>of counting by Tens, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Time by Weeks, beginning to reckon from the Night, as being made before the Day.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that men almost always, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Earth, agree <hi>upon the principal Heads of Morality.</hi> It's true that reason might teach such as consulted it, but the greatest part of the World was not well
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103507:24"/>
enough disposed to hearken quietly to the voice of Reason only, and to silence those passions which hinder'd us from understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, if this Voice had not been maintain'd by another more clear and powerful, to wit, that of Tradition. It may also be said there were Barbarous Nations, among which the belief of a Divinity had been stifled by Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Stupidity, and among more learned Nations, as the Greeks, some have been doubtful, and rejected it as a Lie; but it must also be granted, that it has been commonly receiv'd in the East amongst the most Antient People, from whence Colonies have fill'd all the World, as we are taught by the oldest Histories that remain amongst us.</p>
                     <p>It's true also, that to this hath been added a thousand Extravagancies touching the Nature of the Divine Being, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Worship done to him: But 'tis thus that Judaism was corrupted by the Jewish Doctors, and the Christian Religion by that of the Christians which have innovated so many Changes, that it was hardly known for some Ages. Is it not false, say they, that these two Religions came from <hi>Moses</hi> and Jesus Christ? The same thing hath happen'd to the first Tradition; and <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath believ'd that in effect it was thus; his words are too remarkable to be omitted; <hi>The most profound Antiquity hath left to future Ages under hidden Fables the belief that there were Gods, and that the Divinity was displayed in all the Works of Nature—There's added afterwards, That these Fables teach us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the People, and render 'em more obedient to the Laws, for the good of the State, although some say, that the Gods resemble Men, Animals, and other things. If we keep to those things only which were spoke of in the beginning, to wit, that the Gods were the Original of Nature, there would be nothing said that is unworthy of the Divinity. There is some likelihood that the Sciences having been often found out, and as often lost, these Opinions were preserved until now, as the other Doctrines of the Antients. Thus we may distinguish the Opinions of our Fathers from those who lived first upon the Earth.</hi> 'Twould be difficult to make a better proof of a matter of fact; and some have even dared to say, <hi>That in Physicks there is rarely proved an existence of one Cause by a great number of effects, which are so great in number, so divers, so sensible, and so certain.</hi> The harmony which is between the parts of the Universe, which conspire all to the same end, and always keep the same order, shews that this Divinity, known to all Mankind, is one in Number, and the same in Concord, as may be seen in a State between persons of different humours, which live under the same Laws. Thus it appears in the March of an Army which obeys its General, and thus the Order and Regularity, which is seen in a House proves 'twas built by one Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect only: This all the World acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, in spite of the great number of Gods, the Heathens have made, for they themselves confess'd a <hi>Supreme Divinity</hi> to whom all others were to submit themselves, as the Poets even call him, <hi>The Father, the King, the Most High, the Greatest, the Most Excellent of the Gods,</hi> &amp;c.

hath written to several Learned Men of his Time, with some of their Answers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There have been already seen several Abridgments of the Life of <hi>Vsher,</hi> but as those who compos'd them, had not a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory sufficient for the Work, so they have given nothing to the Publick but what was very imperfect. 'Twas this made Dr. <hi>Parr</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to publish what he knew of this Prelate, to whom he was Chaplain thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, from 1642 to 1655 he knew him throughly in that time, and learn'd many circumstances of his Life, which those were Ignorant of, who lived at a greater distance. Dr. <hi>Parr</hi> hath also received much assistance from the Papers of <hi>Vsher</hi> which among others fell into his hands, and from the Conversations that he hath had with Mr. <hi>Tyrrel</hi> his Grandson, a Gentleman of an extraordinary merit.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Primate of Ireland,</hi> was Universally esteem'd during his Life, and his works are still in so great a reputation, that men will not be sorry to see here a little Abridgment of his History.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iames Vsher</hi> was born at <hi>Dublin</hi> the fourth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1580. his Fathers name was <hi>Arnold,</hi> and was one of the six Clerks of the Chancery. The Family of the <hi>Vshers</hi> is very Antient, altho' the right name is not <hi>Vsher</hi> but <hi>Nevil,</hi> but one of the Ancestors of our Archbishop chang'd it into that of <hi>Vsher,</hi> because he was Usher to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who ascended the Throne of <hi>England</hi> 1199. our Prelate had from his Infancy an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary passion for Learning — Two Scotch Gentlemen, who advis'd him in his studies, entertain'd him with much care. The one was nam'd <hi>Iames Fullerton,</hi> the other <hi>Iames Hamilton.</hi> They went into <hi>Ireland</hi> by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to form some agreement with the Protestant Nobility of that Country, intending thereby to assure himself of that Kingdom in case Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> died suddenly. The better to cover their enterprise, and to give no Umbrage to a Queen extreamly suspitious, they set themselves to teach Latin at <hi>Dublin,</hi> where (at that time) 'twas very rare to find persons learn'd in <hi>Humanity. Vsher</hi> having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited very much by them in a little time, seem'd to have a particular inclination to Poetry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he afterwards chang'd into as great a desire of understanding History; that which created this inclination in him, was reading these words of <hi>Cicero, Nescire quid antra quam natus sis acciderit, id est semper esse puerum,</hi> his Annals and his other writings sufficiently shew what progress he had made in this study, whereof he has given sensible proofs in his Infancy.</p>
                     <p>Being in the University of <hi>Dublin</hi> estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd principally by the care of <hi>Henry Vsher</hi> his Uncle <hi>Archbishop of Ardmagh.</hi> He set himself to read the <hi>Fortalitium fidei</hi> of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton,</hi> which made him resolve to apply himself to the reading of the Fathers, to see if this Author had cited them faithfully, he began to put this design in execution at 20 years old, and continued this Study without intermission for 18 years, obliging himself to read every day a certain task.</p>
                     <p>His Father had a mind to divert him from it, and engage him to Study the Law, to which our Prelate had no inclination, but in 1598. he dying soon after, left his Son at Liberty to chuse what manner of life was most pleasing to him; he was the eldest son of the family, and the estate his Father left, was considerable enough to make him apply all his time in Domestick affairs. This made him resolve to put off this trouble, and to remit the Estate to his Brother, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to give to his Sisters what their Father had left them, reserving only to himself what would maintain him in the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with a sufficiency to buy himself some Books. Whilst he was at the University, and but yet 18 years old, he disputed against a Jesuit call'd <hi>Fitz-Symmons,</hi> and overcame him in two conferences, which made this Jesuit afterwards in a Book In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Britannomachia,</hi> call him the most learn'd of those who are not Catholicks, <hi>A-Catholicorum Doctissimum</hi>; he made so great a progress in the first years, that he apply'd himself to Divinity, that his Uncle Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> ordain'd him Priest at the 21 year of his Age. This ordination was not conformable to the Canons, but the extraordinary merit of young <hi>Vsher,</hi> and the necessities of the Church, made him believe it was not necessary to stay till the age mark'd out by the Ecclesiastical Laws of <hi>Ireland.</hi> He preach'd then at <hi>Dublin,</hi> with very great applause, he particularly devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to the controversies, which were between the Protestants and Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, he treated on them so clearly, and with so much solidity, that he confirm'd many wavering Protestants, and prevailed with many Roman Catholicks to embrace the Protestant Faith.</p>
                     <p>But amongst those who rank'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Protestant Churches, there was a great number that were not so sincere as he could have wished them, they did all they could to obtain the publick exercise of the Roman Catholick Religion at <hi>Dublin,</hi> that they might insensibly have had the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to make a profession of their true Sentiments. <hi>Vsher</hi> who believ'd that this toleration wou'd be of a very dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, oppos'd it with all his might, and one day as he Preacht upon this matter with great zeal, he spoke something which then no notice was taken of, but 40 years after it was found to be a true Prophecy, he took his Text upon these words of <hi>Ezek. ch.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>And thou shalt bear the Iniquity of the house of</hi> Judah 40 <hi>days, I have appointed thee a day for a year.</hi> He applied these days to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and said, <hi>that he who reckon'd from this year to</hi> 40. <hi>should find that the Protestants of</hi> Ireland <hi>should bear the Iniquity of those who were for a toleration in these times,</hi> this was in 1601. and 40 years were no sooner expired 1641. but the Irish Catholicks made a bloody Massacre upon the Protestants.</p>
                     <p>He never wholly discontinued to Preach
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103507:25"/>
whilst he was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> altho he was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor of Divinity in that University, but he accustom'd himself to make a Voyage every three years into <hi>England,</hi> where he found a greater variety of Books than in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there he past one part of his time at <hi>Oxford,</hi> another at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and another at <hi>London,</hi> and carefully visited all their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and particular Libraries, he made col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of what Books he there read, and made remarks upon them, with a design to make a work that he had resolved to Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tule A <hi>Theological Bibliotheque,</hi> wherein he had treated very accurately of all the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Antiquities; but the misfortunes of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Civil Wars of <hi>England</hi> hinder'd him from finishing it, he ordered when he died, that it should be put into the hands of Mr. <hi>Laugbaine</hi> Dr. of Divinity, to supply what was wanting, and publish them to the World. This learn'd man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd himself forthwith in this useful work, but he died before he finished it, 1657. There is yet to be seen in the <hi>Bodleyane Bibliotheque,</hi> his Manuscripts which no man dares under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to finish.</p>
                     <p>In 1615. there was a Parliament in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and an assembly of the Clergy, where certain Articles were compos'd touching Religion and Ecclesiastical Discipline. <hi>Vsher</hi> who was the chief in it, caus'd it to be sign'd by the Chancellor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by the Orators of the Assembly of the Bishops and of the Clergy; King <hi>Iames</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of 'em also, altho' there was some difference between these, and the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; some ill dispos'd persons, and it may be Roman Catholicks took occasion from that to spread evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of <hi>Vsher.</hi> They accused him of Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, which was no little <hi>Heresie</hi> in the opinion of the King, they also made use of this artifice, to render those odious who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd the most capable of opposing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress that the <hi>Missionaries of Rome,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed the people knew not what this word signified and wherein <hi>Heresie</hi> consisted, but it was known the King mortally hated <hi>Puritans,</hi> and that was sufficient to make 'em look upon these Puritans as most dangerous Hereticks; <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Eman. Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> pag. 16.</note> 'twas this that obliged an Irish Divine to write to <hi>Vsher,</hi> who was that time in <hi>England,</hi> that it would not be amiss to desire the King to define <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanism,</hi> that all the World might know those who were tainted with this strange Heresie, but <hi>Vsher</hi> had no need to make use of this way to justifie himself, some conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations that he had with the King, setled so good an opinion of him, that the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Meath</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> being vacant the King gave it him immediately, and said also, <hi>that</hi> Usher <hi>was a Bishop that he had made, because that he had appointed him so without being sollicited to it by any person,</hi> this Election was made in 1620.</p>
                     <p>Returning into <hi>Ireland</hi> sometime after, he was oblig'd to discourse some <hi>persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the Roman Religion, to administer to 'em the Oath of Allegiance and Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that they had refused to the Priest, this discourse is inserted in his Life; he remarks the form of this Oath is compos'd of two parts, the one positive, in which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the King is Soveraign in all cases whatsoever, and the other negative, in which they declare they acknowledge no Jurisdiction or Authority of any strange Prince in the estates of the King, he says afterwards in regard of the first part, that the Scripture commands that we submit our selves to the Higher Powers, and that we ought to acknowledge, that the power the Kings have, whatsoever it may be, is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream as they are Kings, upon which he cites this verse of <hi>Martial.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Qui Rex est, Regem, maxime non habeat.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>That one ought well to distinguish the power of the Keys from that of the Sword, and the King of <hi>England</hi> does not exact an acknowledgment of the same power, that is possess'd by the Bishops, but nevertheless the Kings may interest themselves with Ecclesiastical Affairs, in as much as it regards the body, since according to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> 'tis the Magistrates duty to punish Hereticks. For that which regards the second part of the Oath, where it's said, <hi>that we shall not own any strange power, as having any Iurisdiction, Superiority, Preheminence, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical or Temporal in the Kingdom.</hi> He says that if St. <hi>Peter</hi> were still alive, he would willingly own that the King had this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in <hi>Ireland</hi>: and that he us'd the same in regard of all the Apostles, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship was a personal dignity, which the Apostles have not left hereditary to any: but nevertheless, suppose it was so, he sees not why St. <hi>Peter</hi> should leave it to his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, rather than St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who outliv'd all the Apostles; that there was no reason to believe that St. <hi>Peter</hi> shou'd leave the Apostolical Authority to the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> rather than to those of <hi>Antioch,</hi> this last Church being founded before the first.</p>
                     <p>The King writ to <hi>Vsher</hi> to thank him for this Discourse which produced so good effect. He afterwards went into <hi>England</hi> by the King's order, to collect the Antiquities of the Churches of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and publish'd two years after that his Book intituled, <hi>De Primordiis Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Britannicarum.</hi> 'Twas in that time that the King made him Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Winter following he caused to be brought before him the Order for Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Roman Catholicks and the Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> then Deputy for the King in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> convocated and assembled the whole Nation to settle this Affair: But the Bishops call'd by the Primate, oppos'd it with much heat, as may be seen by a Remonstrance sign'd by ten Bishops, besides the Primate, and which is in the 28th page. They also spoke of raising some Forces by the Joynt

consent both of Catholicks and Protestants, to hinder any differences that might arise in the Kingdom; the Protestants refus'd to consent thereto, and wou'd not hearken to discourse the Primate thereupon in the Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> altho' his reasonings were founded upon the principal Maxims of the Government of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by Examples drawn from the Antient and Modern Histories of that Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>During the time our Primate stayed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> after he had performed the Duties of his Charge which he acquitted with extraordinary care, he employed the remaining part of his time to study, the fruits whereof were to be seen in 1631. in the first Latin book which he ever published in Ireland, 'tis his History of <hi>Godescalch</hi> Monk of the Abby of <hi>Orbais</hi> who lived in the beginning of the 6th Age there was soon made a small abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the History of Pelagianism which was then extreamly dispersed through <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi>; when he comes to the History of <hi>Godescalch</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains his Doctrine, and shews by <hi>Flodoard</hi> and other Authors of that time, that those sentiments whereof <hi>Hincmar</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and <hi>Rabanus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Maynce</hi> accused him, and which were condemn'd by their Authority in two Councils, were the same that St. <hi>Remigius</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and the Clergy of his Diocess defended openly: many opinions and odious consequences (according to <hi>Vsher</hi>) were fathered upon <hi>Godescalch,</hi> because that this Monk who maintained the opinions of St <hi>Augustine</hi> about Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination and Grace did not at all understand 'em. <hi>Ioannes Scotus Erygenus</hi> wrote a treatise against him in which are to be found the principal heads of <hi>Vsher,</hi> but <hi>Florus Deacon</hi> of the Church of <hi>Lions</hi> answers it, and censures him in the Name of all the Diocess. <hi>Vsher</hi> gave an abridgment of this Censure, as also of divers other treatises, as that of St <hi>Remigius Pudentius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Troy, Ratramus</hi> Monk of <hi>Corbi,</hi> who writ against <hi>Scotus</hi> for his defence of <hi>Godes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calch,</hi> there had been two Councils which established the doctrine of this Monk, and condemn'd that of <hi>Scotus.</hi> 'Tis true that <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> published a very large Book against these Councils, which he dedicated to <hi>Charles le Chauve,</hi> as <hi>Flodoard</hi> reports, who shews briefly what it is that this Book treats of, but that did not at all hinder St. <hi>Remigius,</hi> and those of his Party, to convocate another Council at <hi>Langres,</hi> where they confirm'd the Doctrine established in the former Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and condemn'd that new one of <hi>Scotus.</hi> These Controversies were still agitated in the <hi>National Council</hi> of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was concluded, altho' <hi>Barancus</hi> and others voted that <hi>Godescalch</hi> should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd there. On the contrary, <hi>Vsher</hi> maintains that in an Assembly which was in a small time after, his Sentiments were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless this wicked <hi>Godescalch</hi> was condemn'd by the Council of <hi>Maynce</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Imprisonment, where he was severely treated, because he would never retract his Errours. There are still <hi>two Confessions of his Faith,</hi> by which one may see there are many things attributed to him which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believ'd; after having made a faithful report of the Sentiments of this <hi>Monk,</hi> and those of his Adversaries, <hi>Vsher</hi> concludes that it were better for men to be silent upon these matters, than to scandalize the weak, in proposing to 'em such Doctrines from which they may draw bad consequences. There has been (adds Mr. <hi>Parr</hi>) and always will be different Opinions upon the great and abstruse Questions of <hi>Predestination and Free Will,</hi> which nevertheless may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated in the same Church, provided those who maintain these divers Opinions, have that Charity for one another which they ought to have: That they condemn them not publickly; That they abstain from mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Calumnies; and that they publish no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives against those who are not of the same Sentiments.</p>
                     <p>To return to the Life of our <hi>Prelate,</hi> who, altho' he took all imaginable care that the Roman Religion should not make any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet it stole in by the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of other Bishops, insomuch that that Party which maintain'd it did sensibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and grow strong. It was this that oblig'd King <hi>Charles</hi> the first to write a Letter to the <hi>Primate of Ireland,</hi> which is to be found in page 38. wherein he authorizes him to write Letters of Exhortation to all the Bishops of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that they shou'd dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their duty better than they had done.</p>
                     <p>About the latter end of the year 1631. <hi>Vsher</hi> makes a Voyage into <hi>England,</hi> where he publish'd a small English Treatise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Antient Religion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of the People which inhabited the North of <hi>Scotland</hi> and of <hi>England</hi>; he shews in this Treatise how it was in respect to the Essential parts, of the same Religion which at present is establish'd in <hi>England,</hi> and which is very forreign to that of the Roman Catholicks. The year following our <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> return'd into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and publish'd a Collection intituled, <hi>Veterum Epistolarum Hibernicarum Sylloge,</hi> whereof the first Pieces were written about the year 1590. and the last about 1180. there one may learn the Ecclesiastical Antiquities of <hi>Ireland.</hi> In 1639. which was seven years after he publish'd his Book intituled, <hi>Britannicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates,</hi> wherein he inserted the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his Sentiments. There are to be found the Antiquities of the most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> since Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was Preached there, that is to say, since a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 20 years after the death of Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>In 1640. <hi>Vsher</hi> makes a Voyage into <hi>England</hi> with his Family, with design to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn very soon into <hi>Ireland,</hi> but the Civil Wars hinder'd him, insomuch that he cou'd never return to his Country again. Tis said, that in the year following, he brought
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103507:26"/>
the King to sign the death of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> but as to this Dr. <hi>Parr</hi> speaks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much in his Justification; he afterwards shews us after what manner he lost all that he had in <hi>Ireland,</hi> except his <hi>Library,</hi> which he brought into <hi>England.</hi> Strangers very much envyed this great man, that his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patriots shou'd offer him divers Places of Retreat. The Heads of the University of <hi>Leiden</hi> soon gave him a considerable Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and offered him the Title of <hi>Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Professor,</hi> if he wou'd come into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> sent him his Medal, and also proffer'd to him a great Pension, with the liberty of professing his Religion in <hi>France,</hi> if he wou'd come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Our <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> thank'd him, and sent him a Present of Irish <hi>Grey-Hounds,</hi> and other Rarities of that Country. Three years after he publish'd a small Treatise intituled, <hi>A Geographical and Historical Research touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Asia Minor, properly so call'd, to wit,</hi> Lydia, <hi>whereof frequent mention is made in the New Testament, and which the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Writers and other Authors call'd</hi> Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulary Asia, or the Diocess of <hi>Asia.</hi> In this Treatise there is a Geographical Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Asia Minor,</hi> and of its different Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, as that of <hi>Caria</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> under which the Romans comprehend <hi>Ionia</hi> and <hi>Aeolia. Vsher</hi> shews there, (1.) That <hi>Asia,</hi> whereof mention is made in the New Testament, and the Seven <hi>Churches</hi> which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> spoke of in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> were included in <hi>Lydia,</hi> that every one of these Cities were the Chief of a small Province, and because of this Division they were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to be the principal Seats of the Bishops of <hi>Asia.</hi> (2.) That the Roman Provinces had not always the same extension, but were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten contracted or enlarg'd for reasons of State; thus the Empire was otherwise divided under <hi>Augustus</hi> than it was under <hi>Constantine,</hi> under whom <hi>Proconsulary Asia</hi> had more narrow bounds than formerly, 'tis remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that under this last Emperor <hi>Proconsula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Asia,</hi> which was govern'd by a <hi>Proconsul</hi> of the Diocess of <hi>Asia,</hi> from whence the Governor was call'd <hi>Vicarius</hi> or <hi>Comes Asiae</hi> or <hi>Dioceseos Asianae</hi>; but this division was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards chang'd under his Successors, and whereas every Province had but one Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, to satisfie the ambition of some Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops 'twas permitted to two of 'em at the same time, to take the Title of <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi> (3.) That under <hi>Constantine Ephesus</hi> was the place where the Governors of <hi>Asia</hi> met to form a kind of Council, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided affairs of importance; and 'twas for this that <hi>Ephesus</hi> was then the only Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of <hi>Proconsulary Asia</hi>: that the Proconsul which was Governor, never submitted to the Authority of the <hi>Praetorian Prefect,</hi> and that there was something so like this in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Government, that the Bishop of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> was not only Metropolitan of <hi>Consulary Asia,</hi> but also the Primate and Head of the Diocess of <hi>Asia.</hi> (4.) That there was a great conformity between the Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Government, in this, that the Bishops of every Province were subject to their Metropolitans, as the Magistrates of every City were to the Governors of the whole Provinces.</p>
                     <p>This was the time wherein <hi>Vsher</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in Greek and Latin the Epistles of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> with those of St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> and St. <hi>Polycarp</hi>; seven years after he added his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix Ignatiana</hi> where he proves that all the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> are not suppositious, and explains many ecclesiastick antiquities, he published the same year his <hi>Syntagma de editione</hi> 70 <hi>Interpretum,</hi> where he proposes a particular Sentiment which he had upon this version; 'tis this, that It contained but the five Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> and that it was lost in the burning of the Library of <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus Philadelphus</hi> and that <hi>Doritheus</hi> a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick Jew made another version of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> and also translated the rest of the Old Testament about 177 years before the birth of Jesus Christ, under the Reign of <hi>Ptolomaeus Philometor</hi> and that the Greek Church preserves this last version instead of that which was made under the Reign of <hi>Ptolomeus Philadelphus</hi>; he also treats in this same work of the different editions of this version which according to him are falsly styled the version of the 70, this Book was published a year after the death of our <hi>Prelate</hi> with another <hi>De Cainane al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero,</hi> or the second <hi>Canaan,</hi> which is found in the version of the 70. and in St. <hi>Luke</hi> between <hi>Sala</hi> and <hi>Arphaxad.</hi> This last work of <hi>Vsher</hi> was the Letter which he wrote to Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     <p>Dr. <hi>Parr</hi> informs us that in the Civil Wars of <hi>England, Vsher</hi> going from <hi>Cardisse</hi> to the Castle of St. <hi>Donates</hi> which belonged to Madam <hi>Stradling,</hi> he was extreamly Ill treated by the Inhabitants of <hi>Glamorganshire</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> they took his Books and Papers from him which he had much ado to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and whereof he lost some which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained remarks upon the <hi>Vaudois</hi> and which shou'd have serv'd to carry on his Book <hi>de Ecclesiarum Christianarum Successione,</hi> where there is wanting the History of more than 200. years, <hi>viz</hi> from <hi>Gregory</hi> the 11th. to <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th. from the year 1371 to 1513, and from thence to the end of the Last Age.</p>
                     <p>Whilst our <hi>Primate</hi> was in <hi>Wales</hi> there was published at <hi>London</hi> without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, three works under his name: (1.) <hi>A Body of Divinity, or the Substance of Christian Religion</hi> (2) <hi>Immanuel, or the Incarnation of the Son of God</hi> (3) <hi>A Catechism Intituled, The Principles of the Christian Religion.</hi> The last being full of faults he corrected it and print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it himself in 1652.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1647. whilst he was at the Countess of <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s in <hi>London,</hi> the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of <hi>Lincolns Inn</hi> chose him for their Preacher, and gave him a lodging and a handsome Pension; whilst he was there he published two Books. (1.) <hi>Diatriba de Romanae Ecclesiae symbolo apostolico vetere, &amp;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103507:27"/>
aliis fidei formulis,</hi> he there treats of the <hi>Creed</hi> which is commonly called the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> and of the different Copys which have been found in the Roman Church, and of <hi>divers forms of the Confession of Faith,</hi> which where proposed to the <hi>Catechumenoi,</hi> and to the Youth of the Eastern and Western Churches.

In fine, he gives the Ephemerides of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> and <hi>Asiatick</hi> year, compar'd with the Julian year, to which he adds the rising and setting of the Stars, and the presages of the change Weather in <hi>Thrace, Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> according to the observations which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Philosophers have left us. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at that time took the <hi>King</hi> Prisoner in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and wou'd have him absolutely abolish Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so that this Prince was obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that that Government should be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended for three years, but the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian party were so eager, that they would have it utterly extirpated; upon this the <hi>Primate of Ireland</hi> propos'd an Expedient, in which he would have had mixed a sort of of Presbyterian and Episcopal Government in lessening the power of the Bishops, and bringing them to be <hi>Moderators</hi> or <hi>Presidents</hi> of the Assemblies of their Province, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whose advice nothing of Importance shou'd be acted, whereupon <hi>Vsher</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd to have been an Enemy to <hi>Hierarchy</hi>; but Dr. <hi>Parr</hi> vindicates him all along.</p>
                     <p>He also informs us that <hi>Vsher</hi> being in the <hi>Countess of Peterboroughs</hi> House, over against <hi>Charing Cross</hi> near <hi>White-hall,</hi> when the <hi>King</hi> was to be beheaded, and being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of the house to see this bloody Tragedy, the good Archbishop fainted away, so that he was forc'd to be carried to bed, where he said, <hi>that God would not forget to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish this wickedness upon the English Nation,</hi> he added <hi>that the Vsurpation of</hi> Cromwel <hi>would soon expire, and that the King would be recall'd, but that he himself should not see it,</hi> we are assured that at another time, he foretold that the Romish Religion should one day be powerful in this Kingdom, and its reign should be <hi>sharp, but short.</hi> 'Tis reported also, that Preaching in a Church at <hi>London,</hi> he declar'd to his Auditors, that a great fire should soon consume a part of the City, and when 'twas asked him how he knew it, he answer'd <hi>'twas a Thought which was so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impress'd upon his mind, that he could not forbear speaking of it.</hi> If that was true our Primate must be of the number of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets who have sometimes foretold what was to come without knowing it.</p>
                     <p>About the middle of the year 1650. he finished the first part of his <hi>Annals to the year of the World</hi> 3828. <hi>unto the Reign of</hi> Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Epiphanes.

The <hi>second part</hi> was published in 1654. it begun at the Reign of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and ended at the <hi>destruction of Ierusalem. Usher</hi> gives there exact accounts of the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> with the times of their Reign, which he hath put together with more care than any <hi>Chronologer</hi> hath done before him. In fine, there is all that can be wished in an Universal History, both for exactness and Judgment.</p>
                     <p>'Twas after the edition of this work that <hi>Cromwell</hi> said, he desired to see him. <hi>Usher</hi> appear'd before him, and the Protector after having received him with great Civility, promised to <hi>make up part of the loss he sustain'd in</hi> Ireland, but he kept not his Word to him, no more than when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him <hi>the Episcopal Clergy should not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested as they had been to that time.</hi> The good Archbishop having obtain'd this promise, in a visit he made to the <hi>Protector,</hi> he was oblig'd to put him in mind of it, by seeing him a second time, where <hi>Cromwell</hi> ingenuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declar'd that he could not give Liberty of Conscience to men who were sworn Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to his Government, and who without intermission endeavour'd to destroy him. When <hi>Vsher</hi> entered this <hi>Vsurpers</hi> Chamber he found him in the hands of a <hi>Surgeon,</hi> who was dressing an <hi>Ulcer</hi> in his Breast — The <hi>Protector</hi> desired the <hi>Archbishop</hi> to sit down, and said he would speak to him as soon as his <hi>Ulcer</hi> was dressed — Whilst the Surgeon was busie about it <hi>Cromwell</hi> said, that if this Ulcer was once cured he should soon have his Health. <hi>Vsher</hi> replied immediately, that <hi>he fear'd there was a more dangerous Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in his Heart which must be cur'd before he could promise himself a perfect health. 'Tis true</hi> (said the Protector) <hi>sighing,</hi> but tho' he seem'd to take this censure of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's in good part, he refus'd to keep his promise to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vsher</hi> liv'd not long after that, falling ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sick on the 20th of <hi>March</hi> of a Pleurisie, but the Physitians knew not his Distemper, so that he died the day following at <hi>Rygate.</hi> in a Countrey House of the Countess of <hi>Peterboroughs</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> he was seventy five years old, he had been fifty five years in Orders, during which time he continually Preach'd, <hi>fourteen years Professor in the Vniversity of</hi> Dublin, <hi>four years Bishop of</hi> Meath, <hi>and one and thirty years Bishop of</hi> Ardmagh, he was the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth Bishop of that City after St. <hi>Patrick.</hi>

                     <p>Dr. <hi>Parr</hi> after that gives us a Character of the <hi>Person, good Works, and Learning of the Archbishop of</hi> Ardmach, <hi>which is not in the Original.</hi> It's said when they open'd his body to embalm him, they found a strange Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane Thick and very Fat, which was like the continuation of the <hi>Omentum,</hi> and extends it self to the upper part of the Stomach, being fasten'd to the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> a little below the <hi>Diaphragma.</hi> 'Twas suppos'd that this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane contributed much to the goodness of his Stomach, that no Diet injured him.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> a Divine, Printed after his death a collection of some English Treatises, Intituled, <hi>the Iudgment of the late Primate,</hi> &amp;c. where he speaks first of the <hi>Spiritual Babylon,</hi> of which 'tis spoken <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18.4. and 2. <hi>The Imposition of hands,</hi> Hebrews 6.2. and of the <hi>words formerly used in the Ordination,</hi> Thirdly, <hi>The Forms of Prayer, which are used in the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It's thought fit to speak of the principal works of this <hi>Celebrated Archbishop,</hi> because that there are many men that knew but a part, and even some but the Titles of 'em; he left many other imperfect writings, which have not yet been Printed, that may be seen in the Catalogue at the end of his Life; he wish'd that they might be publish'd in form of <hi>Miscellanies,</hi> that they may be the better read by the publick —there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Booksellers beyond Sea, that wou'd be glad to Print this work.</p>
                     <p>An Appendix is added to the end of <hi>Vshers</hi> Life, where is a Defence of what he said against Dr. <hi>Heylen,</hi> in a Book Intitul'd <hi>Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondit Petrus,</hi> where he accuses him of being of a contrary opinion to the English Church.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Letters which compose the second part of this Volume, are not all of the same equal importance, there are some of pure Civility, which contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but news, others, where the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop declares he hath sent for and receiv'd certain Books, on which he raiseth queries, the solution of which is not to be seen in this collection; others, wherein he only speaks of particular affairs, and of certain useful things concerning the Ecclesiasticks of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third Letter contains the project of a work of <hi>William Eyre,</hi> a learned Cantabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian; he propos'd to defend the points of antiquity, and the vowels of the Hebrew, against <hi>Ios. Scaliger</hi> who had said that the Masorethes were Invented a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> and to remark all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of reading in the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, to shew that there is no corruption slipt in there, he design'd this in 1607. and 'tis not known whether he accomplish'd it. As to the Old and New Testament, we are sure that <hi>Buxtorf</hi> and <hi>Cappel</hi> have drain'd the subject, and treated more of it than he could, if we may judge by his project.</p>
                     <p>There are ten Letters and eleven opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Vsher</hi> and <hi>Samuel Ward,</hi> upon the <hi>collection and number of the Antient Canons. Vsher</hi> writing to this last in 1608. tells him, that he believes that the first collection of the <hi>English and Greek Canons,</hi> contained only those of the first oecumenical Council and of five Provincial Councils, after which was join'd thereto the Canons of the other oecumenical Councils, as in the sequel. This appears chiefly by these words of <hi>Dionysius Iunior</hi> in the Preface to his Greek Canons dedicated to <hi>Stephen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lones</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia: Regulas Nicaenae synodi &amp; Deinceps omnium Conciliorum, sive quae antea sive quae post modùm usque ad synodum</hi> 150 <hi>Pontificum qui apud Constantinopolin Convene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt sub ordine Numerorum, id est à primo Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulo usque ad</hi> 165. <hi>Sicut habentur in Graeca auctoritate digessimus, cùm sancti Calcedonensis Concilii decreta subdentes, in his Graecorum Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonum finem esse declaramus.

                        <hi>Vsher</hi> doubts if at the same time, they added to this Collection the Councils of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and also that of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> because <hi>Fulgentius Ferandus</hi> cites it not, and 'tis not well known whether they were the Canons of <hi>Ephesus</hi> which are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be collected from <hi>Issidore</hi> being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different from those that are found in the edition of <hi>Tilius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was an Antient Latin version of the Greek Canons before <hi>Dionysius Iunior,</hi> as he witnesses in his Preface, but being in some confusion he reprinted the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new with additions, placing before them the fifty Canons of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103507:28"/>
from the <hi>Greek,</hi> having finished the Canons of the Greeks at the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi>; he there also adds the <hi>Sardick</hi> Canons and those of the Council of <hi>Africk,</hi> which he had not inserted before in the body of the Canons.

                        <hi>Samuel Ward</hi> confirms this opinion of <hi>Vsher</hi> by several reasons; he says that after having throughly considered the thing, he is well perswaded that the first collection of the Canons, of which we spoke, was made in the years 364 and 381 after the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and before that of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>; he brings the same reason as <hi>Vsher</hi> drew from the Preface of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> to which he adds these two proofs. <hi>First,</hi> That in the sixteenth Decree of the Council of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doa,</hi> the Secretary <hi>Constantine</hi> after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read the Canons of <hi>Nice</hi> in a Copy which appear'd, like to that of <hi>Dionysius Iunior</hi>; then he comes to read those of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> as thus, <hi>Synodicon Concilii Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitani.</hi> It seems to be the Title which is before the Canons. Secondly, That in the Title which is before the Canons of <hi>Ancyra, Neccesarea</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies in that of <hi>Maynce</hi> and in many other Latin Editions, those who made the collections, say, that they have first plac'd the Canons of <hi>Nice,</hi> because of the authority that this Oecumenical Council had over the <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials.</hi> The same reason would have made him join the Council of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to that of <hi>Nice,</hi> if the collection had been made after the first Council.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vsher</hi> believ'd that the Edition of <hi>Crab,</hi> of <hi>Colon,</hi> contain'd not so much as that of <hi>Maynce,</hi> but <hi>Ward</hi> sends him an Index, by which he may see the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Our Archbishop at the desire of some of his friends explains his opinion, <hi>whether the benefits of the death of Iesus Christ be extend-to all,</hi> in the 22 and 23 Letters. He says that two extremities are to be avoided therein, the first carried too far the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the satisfaction of Jesus Christ, as if by that God was on his side, actually recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, and really discharg'd all men of their sins; so that if men were not satisfied of the Fruits of the death of Jesus Christ, 'twas because they had not Faith; from hence it follows that God forgave men their sins, and Justified them before they had Faith. <hi>The other</hi> on the contrary has too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd the satisfaction of Jesus Christ, as if no body had any part therein, but those who were elected before the Creation of the World, altho the Evangelist command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one to believe that Jesus Christ died for him; from whence it follows, that men in Conscience should be oblig'd to tell a lye, and that they were commanded to embrace those merits which belong not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 'em.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vsher</hi> says, that in these two extremities there are <hi>inevitable absurdities,</hi> if he should attribute the first to some Antient Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, he thinks he should not wrong 'em, but he is well assured that none in this Age has maintain'd this opinion, which infers a sensible contradiction, nor is the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop alone in his opinion, almost all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church,</hi> the greatest part of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the Reform'd, the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> &amp;c. maintain it. We ought to distinguish between the satisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered absolutely, and the application that God hath made thereby to every particular Person. The first was once done, says he, for all men, and the second is always doing. The satisfaction of Jesus Christ hath put men in an estate of obtaining pardon for their sins, but in the particular application that God thereby makes, he grants them actual pardon. <hi>Vsher</hi> confirms and explains this thought by divers passages of Scripture and divers examples; but as these subjects have been more largely treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of since that time, <note n="*" place="margin">He writ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the 49th Letter directed to the famous <hi>Seldinus,</hi> he proves by <hi>Walafridus Strabo,</hi> that in the beginning of Christianity, they put themselves to little trouble to what place soever they were oblig'd to go, they assembled together to pray to God, altho' the use had been since to turn to the <hi>East.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this collection is found some Letters of an English Merchant, call'd <hi>Thomas Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes,</hi> who liv'd at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and sent to our Bishop many Books of that Country, and among others a <hi>Samaritane Pentateuch,</hi> the first that was ever seen in <hi>Europe,</hi> in the 81 Letter he says, he had learnt of a Jew, that

the Samaritanes pronounce the name of God <hi>Iehova</hi> quite otherwise than we read it, to wit, <hi>Iebueh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One <hi>Ralph Skinner</hi> a Learn'd English man dedicates a Treatise of <hi>Maimonides</hi> translated into English, to our Archbishop, and his Epistle Dedicatory makes this the one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth and second of this collection; he shews there the error of this Jewish Doctor, and the use that may be drawn from the reading of his Works, he reduced his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to six errors. He believ'd, First,
<q>That the Stars and Celestial Spheres were living <hi>Beings.</hi> Secondly, That God never Repented but once, <hi>viz.</hi> in the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the first Temple, he made the Just perish with the Wicked. Thirdly, That the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was Eternal. Fourthly, That Man hath a free Will to do Good or Evil. Fifthly, That those Promises which God hath made by the Prophets are Temporal, which should be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd upon the Earth, when the Messia should come. Sixthly, That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Iudah</hi> was given to the Posterity of <hi>Iechonias</hi> after his Repentance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Salathiel</hi> was the Son of <hi>Neri.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Provided that they take care of these six Errors (says <hi>Skinner</hi>) there may be drawn six considerable advantages from the reading of <hi>Maimonides.</hi> First, We may profit from his <hi>Hebraical Speeches.</hi> Secondly, He teaches divers Sentences of the Jewish Doctors. <hi>Skinner</hi> hath marked these two things in the Treatise he dedicated to <hi>Vsher</hi> in placing 'em in the Margin or marking 'em with an Index (3) we may find in <hi>Maimonides</hi> the expressions and Maxims of the <hi>Thalmud</hi> which serve to explain divers manners of speaking in the new Testament. (4.) Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the Antients, otherwise explain'd after an uncommon manner. (5.) The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Laws of the Jews, and the punishments inflicted for every crime. (6.) The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Rabbins, touching the Judaical Religion.</p>
                     <p>First <hi>Skinner</hi> gives divers examples of the third use that may be made of the works of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> we will relate three or four by which the rest may be judg'd of. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> says, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 74. <hi>I heard the number of those that were Sealed; there was one hundred forty four thousand Sealed, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> of all the Tribes of the Children of Israel.</hi> This manner of speaking is often found in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as also much used in the stile of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins; witness this passage of <hi>Maimonides</hi> in his Treatise of Repentance, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.
<q>As he examines the Justice and Iniquity of man, at the day of his death, even so he weighs the Iniquity and Justice of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in the first day of the same year, he that is found just is seal'd for Life, and the Wicked for Destruction, but as for those who are between these two estates they are sent back to be judg'd in the day of expiation, if they repent they are seal'd for life, if they continu'd in impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, death was to be their inevitable reward.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. St. <hi>Paul</hi> cites a passage of Scripture to the same purpose, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith he, Awake ye that sleep; Arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.</hi> They unprofitably plague themselves to seek this passage in the Scripture, for there it is not: In vain they look for it in <hi>Isaiah</hi>; the 26.19. the 60. and 18. or in the <hi>Apocriphal</hi> pieces which are attributed to <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> from whence the Christians might insert it. <hi>Skinner</hi> tells us that St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes this allusion from a custom of the Jews which <hi>Maimonides</hi> mentions, and paraphrases the words which he finds amongst the Jews upon this occasion. <hi>'Twas the Custom</hi> (<hi>saith Maimonides</hi> in the same treatise Chap. 3. <hi>Section four</hi>) <hi>to sound a trumpet the first day of the year after which the publick Cryer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced these words Awake, Awake you that sleep. Altho this Custom of sounding the trumpet was commanded by the Law,</hi> Levit. 23.24. <hi>he observes another thing from these Words of the publick Cryer? 'twas as much as if he shou'd say, you that sleep awake from your Drouziness, you that perpetually sigh cast away your Grief, examine your, works return to your duty by repentance, and remember who 'tis that created you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly our Lord in speaking of the Sin against the Holy Ghost tells us that it <hi>shall neither be forgiven in this World, nor in that which is to come, Matt</hi> 12.32. The Rabbins have also a manner of speaking very like this, <hi>there is a Sin which is punish'd in this World (saith Maimonides)</hi> in the same Book, Chap. 6. Section 189. <hi>and not in the world to come, there is a sin also which shall be punished hereafter and not now, and one that shall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in both,</hi> thus our Lord hath said, that those shall be punished in this Life and the other, that should blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, and 'tis this which has happen'd to the Jews, who attributed to the Devil the Miracles of our Saviour, they suffered a thousand evils in this Life by the Tyranny of the Romans, and dying in impenitence they are delivered to the pains of the next, which they have merited thereby.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Jesus Christ forbids his Disciples to Swear, he commands they shall be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to say, yes, yes, no, no, <hi>'tis or 'tis not,</hi> Mat. 5.32.
<q>
                           <hi>Maimonides</hi> also says, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce that is between the wise is full of truth and fidelity, they answer <hi>No</hi> to that which is not, and <hi>Yes</hi> to what is.</q>
                        <hi>Lightfoot</hi> cites this last passage in his remarks of the <hi>Thalmudists</hi> upon St. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In <hi>Pec. c.</hi> 5 § 13.</note> but he hath not observ'd the others. <hi>Skinner</hi> farther shews some passages of the Rabbins in the four following Letters, but as there is nothing very considerable, so I shall tarry no longer upon 'em.</p>
                     <p>A little before <hi>Vsher</hi> had finished his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Godeschalch,</hi> of which I have spoken. <hi>S. Ward</hi> Dr. in Divinity, wrote to him in a Letter dated <hi>May</hi> 25. 1630. That he had encouragement to wish this History would be more famous and correct than any thing of the same nature then extant. He adds to that, that he doubted not but that there

were Semipelagians or Divines of <hi>Marseille,</hi> who first placed the <hi>Predestinarians</hi> in the Catalogue of Hereticks, he found therein nothing that surpriz'd him, but that the <hi>Predestinarians</hi> were first call'd <hi>those Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks who were not of the opinion of St.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine: thus Divines have always done the like. <hi>Ward</hi> believes that 'tis <hi>Arnobius,</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of a commentary upon the Psalms, who first treated of the Heresie of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> about Predestination <note n="*" place="margin">

Altho' <hi>Ward</hi> found not these names in any Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> he easily persuades himself, it may be because that two Bishops of <hi>Africa,</hi> both call'd <hi>Rusticus</hi> sign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d the Synodical Letter to <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the First, where they condemn'd <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> and <hi>Celestius.</hi> It is the 90th Letter amongst the Epistles of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and was written in the year 416. Two years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> was held<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the preceding Councils were confirm'd; 'twas compos'd of 217 Bishops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amongst which was St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> but there was but 24 who sign'd 'em, and among their names was found <hi>Laurentius Iositanus.</hi> Besides, <hi>Erasmus</hi> in the sixth Age, hath remark'd in this <hi>Arnobius</hi> many Latin words which were very much in use in <hi>Africk</hi> in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>'s time.</p>
                     <p>This is the reason which <hi>Ward</hi> brings to prove that in the time of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> a Divine who dedicated a Book to two <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Bishops,</hi> had the boldness to accuse his Doctrine of Heresie. Nevertheless he finds not that this <hi>Arnobius</hi> was censured for it. 'Tis not that <hi>Ward</hi> approves his Sentiments or the name that he hath given to those of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> but on the contrary, he speaks of it with Indignation.</p>
                     <p>He adds that <hi>Arnobius</hi> was followed in that by <hi>Tiro Prosper,</hi> who must be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from <hi>Prosper Aquitanus,</hi> a disciple of St. <hi>Augustine. Ward</hi> found these words in <note n="(a)" place="margin">In the <hi>Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit</hi> Colledge.</note> a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of this first Author, the 24th year of <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius. Praedestinatorum haeresis quae ab Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustino accepisse initium dicitur, his Temporibus Serpere exorsa. The Heresie of the Predestinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which as 'tis said hath taken its birth from St.</hi> Augustine, <hi>begun to spread in this time.</hi> After him <hi>Fausius</hi> and <hi>Gennadius</hi> have given this ill name to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and particularly the last, altho' <hi>Sigebert</hi> (adds <hi>Ward</hi>) says that the opinion of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination was produced from the ill Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of some places of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> from whence they draw these false consequences. Nevertheless it seems that these of <hi>Marseille</hi> and some <hi>Africans</hi> in the time of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> maintained this opinion of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinarians (as <hi>Sigebert</hi> relates) was drawn from St. <hi>Austine</hi> by mistaken Inferences, as it appears by the objections of <hi>Prosper</hi> and <hi>Hillary</hi> proposed to him, which have been related by others.</p>
                     <p>There is in 162 and 163. Letters, some fragments of a discourse of the same <hi>Ward</hi> with <hi>William Bidell</hi> Bishop of <hi>Kill-more</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> touching the efficacy of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and particularly that of Baptism, and in the 205 Letter, the opinion of <hi>Vsher</hi> concerning the Sabbath, which he believed to have been observed from the beginning of the World, which made some enquiry among the Heathens, of which the greatest part look'd upon the seventh day as Sacred, which he proves by many passages after <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matius</hi> and <hi>Rivet, &amp;c.</hi> He shews afterwards in what manner the Apostles consecrated the Sabbath, particularly by this passage of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> to the Magnesians: <hi>Non amplius sabbatizantes, sed secundum Dominicam Viven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in qua &amp; vita nostra orta est.</hi> But this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath been more largely treated upon by others, and <hi>Vsher</hi> confesses when he read the Fathers, he collected nothing upon this subject, because he thought there was never any controversie about it, produced amongst the Divines.</p>
                     <p>Those that desire to understand all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Characters of the Saxons, may find an Alphabet thereof in the 253 Letter from Dr. <hi>Longbain,</hi> as also divers Letters that treated by the by of Chronological questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Astronomy, but as there is nothing compleat or very considerable upon these abstruse matters, upon which few persons will give themselves any trouble, 'twas thought unnecessary to make any extract thereof.</p>
                     <p>I shall say but one word of the 267 Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, addressed to <hi>Lewis Cappel,</hi> where our Archbishop takes against him, the part of <hi>Arnold Boat</hi>; the difference that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two Learned men may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to these two heads: <hi>First, Boat</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there was very little variety of reading in the Old Testament, as the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Chelib</hi> and of the Eastern and Western Copies, and that these varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were not to be found but by the means of the <hi>Massore</hi> and from the Hebrew Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts. <hi>Cappel</hi> on the contrary maintains, that the number of these varieties are very great, that they may be collected from many ancient Copies, and particularly that of the Septuagint, although much corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Archbishop says also that we can't have such assurance upon this version, where there are many prodigious faults, and so very many differences that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors connot be made use of but as an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal very corrupt, even without speaking of the errors produced by malice; but there is no Book of the Scripture where they are so far from the Original as that of <hi>Iob,</hi> which by the Authority of <hi>Origen</hi> and St. <hi>Ierome,</hi>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:103507:29"/>
is proved that these Interpreters have cut off a great number of verses. <hi>Vsher</hi> maintains after St. <hi>Ierome</hi> that they added and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed several passages: He says 'twas occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by malice, to keep from the Greeks the knowledge of the Sacred Oracles, having shewn in some places that they were very capable of translating it well, had they been Inclin'd thereto, as in the Book of <hi>Ezek.</hi> where they are much more conform to our Hebrew than in the other Books of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture according to the works of St. <note n="*" place="margin">In prolog. in <hi>Ezek.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Ierome:</hi> These Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Vsher</hi> are not to be wondered at, when we consider what hath been said of his opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Author of the Translation of the 70. Secondly, <hi>Boat</hi> and <hi>Vsher</hi> believed that they began to work at <hi>Massore</hi> immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the time of <hi>Esdras,</hi> whereas <hi>Cappel</hi> maintains that it was not so much as thought on, till 600 years after Christ—<hi>Vsher</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to maintain his Sentiment by a proof drawn from the <hi>Gemare of Babylon.</hi> Which makes mention of Certain Scribes who counted all the Letters of the Law, and mark'd that <hi>Vau</hi> which is in the word <hi>Gachon, Levit.</hi> 11.24 is exactly in the middle in regard of the number of the Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On which occasion <hi>Usher</hi> speaks of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and tho he confess'd to <hi>Cappel</hi> that <hi>Philo</hi> did not know the Hebrew, he agrees not with the Jewish Historian who had written his History in Hebrew, as himself saith, and who drew it from the Original Hebrew, <hi>Vsher</hi> says nevertheless, that he hath not done it faithfully.
<q>As <hi>Ierome Xavier</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite saith, 'tis not long since he gave the History of the Evangelists to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> which he hath adjusted as himself pleas'd, <hi>Ioseph</hi> gave formerly to the Greeks the History of the Old Testament, changing therein, and adding thereto many things drawn from the Apocriphal Books. 'Tis thus that he says <hi>Solomon</hi> Reigned 80. years in stead of 40. and that he says <hi>David Left for the use of</hi> the Temple 100000 talents of Silver instead of 1000000 He adds to the Text an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Moses</hi> Age, from three years of the War he made with the Ethiopians, and of <hi>Tharbis</hi> son of the Ethiopian King, which conceived a great love for him, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vsher</hi> speaks also of the <hi>Samaritan Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch</hi> from whence he brings 5. or 6: Copies first into <hi>Europe</hi>: He believes that it was corrupted by one <hi>Dosthes</hi> or <hi>Dositheus</hi> which in the time of the Apostles was suppos'd to pass for the <hi>Messia</hi> amongst the <hi>Samaritans</hi>—this is founded upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of St. <note n="*" place="margin">

He afterwards brings some passages in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan Pentateuch,</hi> where he maintains that the numbers or the words were chang'd, he even believes that Hebrew was intermix'd with the Greek Septuagint: If that were true, we ought not to be surpriz'd to find that this translation is more conform to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan text</hi> than the Hebrew. <hi>Vsher</hi> also pretends that there is not more variety of reading any where than in the <hi>Greek Version.</hi>

<q>If it is a thing that may be avoided or not? If it cannot be avoided, there is no hurt in committing it. If man can avoid it, he may be without Sin.

                     <p>In the same time <hi>Pelagius</hi> that was at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> published divers pieces where he expounded more at length his Sentiments, <note n="(a)" place="margin">p. 125.</note> and where he particularly granted that no man excepting Jesus Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had ever been without sin, it did not follow that that was impossible. He affirm'd, that he disputed not of the Fact, but of the Possibility; and that yet it was not possible, but by the Grace or the Assistance of God. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath undertaken to refute one of these pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Pelagius</hi> in his Book <hi>of Nature and Grace.</hi> He accuseth him on the one side, of confounding the Graces that God gives us in Creation with those by which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates us; and on the other side to say that God gives his Graces, according to merit, and that these Graces are but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but it shall be seen in the sequel how <hi>Pelagius</hi> expounded his Opinion.</p>
                     <p>Three years after that <hi>Celestius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at <hi>Carthage,</hi> his Master was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> of holding the same opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Iohn Bishop</hi> of this City, called an Assembly of some Priests to examine <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> and to see if really he held the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were attributed to him. For to know what was done in <hi>Africk</hi> against <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius.</hi> Into this Assembly were called three Latine Priests <hi>Avitus, Vitalis,</hi> and <hi>Oros.</hi> This last was then at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> studying, as he saith himself, <note n="(b)" place="margin">

Whilst he was in <hi>Africk,</hi> in the time of the Condemnation of <hi>Celestius,</hi> he related to this Assembly at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> with what zeal those of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> had condemned that Heretick, and said that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> had made a Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and had besides in a Letter written into <hi>Sicily,</hi> refuted the questions of <hi>Celestius.</hi> Having this Letter about him he offered to read it, and did so, at the entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Assembly.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>After this reading the Bishop <hi>Iohn</hi> desired that <hi>Pelagius</hi> should be introduced. It was permitted by connivance, saith <hi>Orose,</hi> whether for the respect they had for the Bishop, or that it was believed fit that this Prelate should refute him in his presence. He was asked if he acknowledged to have taught, what <hi>Augustine</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hippona</hi> had refuted. He instantly answered <hi>who is this</hi> Augustine? and as all cryed out; <hi>that a man, who blasphemed against a Bishop, by the mouth of whom, the Lord had kept an Vnion in all</hi> Africk, <hi>ought not only to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished from this Assembly, but from all the Church</hi>; John ordered him to sit in the midst of the Catholick Priests, tho' a Laick, and guilty of Heresie. After that he said to him, <hi>'Tis I that am</hi> Augustine, that acting in the name of this offended Bishop, can more freely pardon <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and appease enraged Minds. We then said to him, continueth <hi>Orose, If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present here the person of</hi> Augustine, <hi>follow his Opinions.</hi> He replied by asking us, if we believed that what was read was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some other or against <hi>Pelagius?</hi> If
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103507:31"/>
it be against <hi>Pelagius,</hi> added he, what have you to propose against him? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, by the permission of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> had told me, he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained man could be without sin, and could easily observe the Commandments of God, if he pleased. <hi>Pelagius</hi> confessed it was his opinion. Thereupon I said this that 'twas that which the Bishops of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> had condemned in <hi>Celestius,</hi> which <hi>Augustine</hi> declared in his writings to be a horrible Doctrine, and that which <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> had rejected in his Epistle to <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>esi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> and which he refuted in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues that he then composed. But the Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> without hearing any thing of all that, would have us to bring parties before him against <hi>Pelagius. We are not,</hi> answered We, <hi>the Accusers of this man, but we declare unto you what the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and our Fathers have judged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed touching this Heresie, that a Laick pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisheth now, lest he should trouble you, the Church, into the bosom of which we are come.</hi> Then to engage us in some sort to declare our selves parties, he begun to instruct us, in what the Lord saith to <hi>Abraham, Walk before me and be thou upright</hi>; and what is said of <hi>Zacharia</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, that both of them were just before God, and walked bamleless in all the Commandments of the Lord.</hi> Many amongst us knew that that was a remark of <hi>Origen</hi>; and I answered him; <hi>We are Children of the Catholick Church. Exact not from us, O Father, that we should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to raise our selves into Doctors, above the Doctors, nor into Iudges, above the Iudges. Our Fathers whose Conduct is approved by the Vniversal Church, and in whose Communion you rejoice to see us, have declared these Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims damnable. It's just that we should obey their decrees: Why do you ask the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, what they think after having learned the Sentiments of their Fathers?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Bishop said after, that if <hi>Pelagius</hi> maintain'd that man could be without sin, without the help of God it would be a damnable Doctrine, but that he did not exclude the help of God, and asked what we had to say to that? If he denied the necessity of this assistance? We answered <hi>Anathema</hi> to those that did deny it; and we cryed out that he was a Latin Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, that we were Latins, that he was to be judged by Latins, and that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most an impudence in him to pretend to judge thereof, seeing we were not Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers. As he said that I was the only wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and that I was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, some of the Company thought themselves obliged to say, that the same Person could not be Heretick, Advocate and Judge at the same time. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion was that <hi>Pelagius</hi> should be sent to the Judgment of <hi>Innocent</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that in the mean time <hi>Pelagius</hi> should be silenc'd.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Thus it was that this Assembly ended, where <hi>Pelagius</hi> that knew but the Latine, spoke by an Interpreter to the Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> who could only speak Greek. There was held a Synod at <hi>Diospolis</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestina,</hi> towards the end of the same year CCCCXV. where were fourteen Bishops. <hi>Eros</hi> and <hi>Lazare</hi> Bishops of the <hi>Gauls</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Euloge</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> an accusation in writing against <hi>Pelagius,</hi> but they could not be at this Synod, because one of them fell sick by the way. <hi>Pelagius</hi> appeared and answered to all the heads of the accusation that were proposed against him, so that the Council declared him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and even approved his Doctrine, according the Interpretations he gave it. Here is in brief, what all was reduced into.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                        </note> 
                        <hi>Pelagius</hi> was accused of maintaining these Propositions. I. <hi>That none can be without Sin without knowing the Law?</hi> He answered, he meant nothing else by that, but that the Law was a means to avoid Sin, and not that this knowledge was solely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to avoid Sin.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>That all men are led by their own will.</hi> He confessed this Proposition in saying, that although Man hath his Free-will, when he chooseth the Good, it is by the help of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>That in the day of Iudgment, God will not pardon the Wicked and Sinners.</hi> It is, saith <hi>Pelagius,</hi> the Doctrine of the Gospel.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>That Evil comes not only in Thought.</hi> To which he protested he had only said, that Christians ought to endeavour to have no ill thoughts.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. <hi>That the Kingdom of Heaven is promised in the Old Testament.</hi> He maintain'd it out of <hi>Daniel</hi> c. 7.18.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. <hi>That Man can be without Sin if he will. Pelagius</hi> said that he had proved that 'twas possible by the Grace of God, but that he never had taught that any man had lived without Sin, from his Childhood to his Old-age. He also denied the having maintain'd some other maxims whereof he was accused. He was thereupon asked if he anathematised not those that were of that opinion? <hi>I do anathematize them,</hi> said he, <hi>as Fools, but not as Hereticks, for they are ignorant of what they affirm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">VII. He was accused of maintaining some things that were condemned at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> which have been before related, and besides it, <hi>that a Child can be saved without Baptism.</hi> He denied that he had taught any thing in the manner they related it, and particularly that he had ever said, those that have lived before Jesus Christ were without Sin.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. <hi>In fine,</hi> some places were proposed to him, that were said to be drawn from the Books of <hi>Celestius,</hi> but he told them he could not answer for what another had written, and that he condemn'd such as maintain'd any Propositions of that Nature. There was amongst others this Proposition, <hi>That Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which repent obtain forgiveness of their Sins, not by the Grace and Mercy of God, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Deserts and Repentance.</hi> It may be that was only a consequence, which was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103507:31"/>
drawn from the Sentiments of <hi>Celestius,</hi> for in all this controversie each Party hath mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attributed to themselves the advantage of consequences either well or ill drawn, as express opinions. Besides this, these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions that <hi>Eros</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> had drawn from the Books of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Celestius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from the sequel of the discourse, might form a contrary sense to what they intended in their Books.</p>
                     <p>The Council having approved of all these answers, declared him worthy of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Catholick Church. But the Enemies of <hi>Pelagius</hi> accused him of having hidden his true Sentiments, and of deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Grecian Bishops to whom he spake but by an Intrepreter. St. <hi>Augustin</hi> saith, that the answers of <hi>Pelagius</hi> were Orthodox, <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                           <hi>De gest. Pal.</hi> Syn. c. 1. and 2.</note> as the Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had understood them, and not as <hi>Pelagius</hi> understood them. But those that have not so ill an opinion of <hi>Pelagius</hi> as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi> had, observe that he knew not the Greek, and could of himself have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of the Sentiments of the Greek Church upon this matter. If he had been capable, say they, of reading these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, he would have found that they speak no otherwise than <hi>Pelagius</hi> does, <note n="(b)" place="margin">

                     <p>Before the acts of this Council had been published, <hi>Pelagius</hi> writ to one of his friends that his sentiments had been there approved of, &amp; made his Letter publick. He also made a kind of an Apology in the year CCCCXVI. for this Council, which he sent to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> who having received no Letter from <hi>Palestine</hi>

The Bishop was accused to have excited this Tumult, but there was no time to call him to account, because he died that very year. St. <hi>Ierome</hi> also having offended the Bishops of <hi>Palestine</hi> in despising their Assembly, thought he could not better secure himself than in getting the friendship of those of <hi>Africk,</hi> tho' they were not at all of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, being of the <hi>Semi-Pelagians,</hi> whereof we shall speak in the sequel of this History. Therefore he writ to St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in these terms.
I have resolved to love you, to honour you, to respect you, and to admire you, and to defend what you say, as if it were my self that had said it,<q>

                        </note> acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged six sorts of Grace.</p>
                     <p>First, 'Tis a Grace of God, according to <hi>Pelagius,</hi> to have a Soul reasonable and free, that is to say, that can obey, or not obey God without being invincibly determined to the one or to the other. <hi>Pelagius</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that all men were born in this state, so that if they applied themselves to evil, it was not by an invincible necessity, but in abu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing of their liberty: St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in the first place saith, that we ought not to call that Grace, which after this manner we receive from God by Creation, but only that which we receive from him by vertue of our Redemption. But that is only a dispute of words. St. <hi>Augustin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied moreover, that men were born in any other state than in an absolute and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able determination of doing ill, and said it was impossible for them to do any good, without an immediate assistance from God, which he gave but to some men, and that those who had this aid were unavoidably carried to good. Thus although he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of free-will; he gave to these words a new sense, seeing liberty according to him, is no other than a simple <hi>Spontaneity,</hi> and includes not the power of not doing what we do. The difference only that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween St. <hi>Augustin</hi> and <hi>Pelagius,</hi> is that the first believed, that since the sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> his Posterity had been so much corrupted, that they came into the World with inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to evil, which necessitated them to it, that if God had design'd them to Salvation, it was necessary that in every good action, he assisted them with his particular Grace, that would unavoidably carry them to good, and that those he was not willing to give Grace unto were damned; God by a Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that we comprehend not, design'd that Mankind should be born in an unavoidable necessity of offending him, and to be after that tormented by eternal punishments, without delivering from this sad necessity, but a very small number of persons to whom he gives an invincible Grace. St. <hi>Augustin</hi> believed that that was rendering to God the Glory that is due to him. <hi>Pelagius</hi> on the contrary thought God had not permitted the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> to make so great a disorder in the World, that those who were descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, were not in a necessity of obeying, or not obeying the Law of God, which hath given to them the power of avoiding evil and doing good; so that it was but by their fault alone that they were damned, not being compell'd to crimes, and everlasting unhappinesses by an unavoidable necessity. Having received of God the Free-Will, it was not needful that God intervened in each action. <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Vsher</hi> p. 141.</note> 
                        <hi>To be able to do good,</hi> saith
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103507:32"/>
Pelagius, <hi>cometh from God which hath given it to his Creature, but to be willing to do good, and to be Vertuous, depend upon man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second Grace that <hi>Pelagius</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged is the remission of past sins, which God granteth to those that leave them off. <hi>Pelagius</hi> anathematised in the Council of <hi>Diospolis,</hi> whosoever should dare to say that God had any regard on this occasion to merit. St. <hi>Augustin</hi> complaining that <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> contenting himself to acknowledge that God forgiveth us graciously our past sins, granted not that he aideth us in the non-commission for the future. But <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> maintained that this pardon served us as well for the future, to carry us to our duty, because we cannot apply our selves to serve God after having offended him, but in the persuasion that he will pardon us what's past graciously. He said likewise that afterwards, in respect of the sins that were committed in the very time of Repentance, that is to say, in the state of Regeneration, they were forgiven us in consideration of our good works by which we also obtain'd glory. And it is in this sense that he maintain'd Grace was given according to merits, that is to say, according to our good actions. As Children before the use of Reason commit no sin, so this Grace regardeth them not.</p>
                     <p>The third Grace according to <hi>Pelagius,</hi> is <hi>the Law,</hi> by which he understands the Preaching of the Gospel, and the example of Jesus Christ, that those who have lived under the old institution had not. He said that this Grace was altogether necessary, to live conformable to Christianity.</p>
                     <p>The fourth sort of Grace is an interiour illumination of our mind, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> expressed in this wise, <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                        <hi>I maintain that Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not only in the Law, but in the assistance of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But God aideth us by his Doctrine and by his Revelation, in opening the Eyes of our Mind, in shewing us things to come, to hinder the present from making too dead an impression, in discovering to us the Ambushes of the Devil, in illuminating us by the divers and ineffable gifts of his Celestial Grace. Doth it seem to you,</hi> saith Pelagius, <hi>that those that speak thus, deny the Grace of God? Do they not acknowledge rather the Free-Will and the Grace of God altogether?</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi> accuseth <hi>Pelagius</hi> in this, not for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing simply denied Grace, but for denying its necessity; and for having said that God gave it not but to the end that Free Will should be the easier carried to good. This Grace according to <hi>Pelagius,</hi> produced not infallibly and by it self the will of doing well, and good works, but induced only to will more easily.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is the Grace of Baptism, by which, according to him, although Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren receive not the pardon of sins that they have not committed, being, according to <hi>Pelagius,</hi> altogether innocent, they enter into a better condition, which consisteth in that they are thereby adopted by God, and become Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven. St. <hi>Augustin</hi> on the contrary affirm'd that Children being born sinners, Baptism doth confer upon them the Remission of sins, and sanctifieth them by a Grace that God hath applied thereto.</p>
                     <p>The sixth Grace finally consisteth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Pelagius,</hi> in eternal Life, and in bestowing the Kingdom of Heaven. He is accused of having distinguished these two things, and of having said that without the Revelation of the Gospel <hi>Life Eternal</hi> could be obtained, but that God did not give <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> but to those that were Baptized. According to <hi>Pelagius</hi> this Grace was given as the effect of merit, (to wit,) that of a good Life. It is hard to know wherein this distinction consisteth, of Eternal Life, and of the Kingdom of Heaven, and to reconcile it with the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation that was made against <hi>Pelagius</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Kingdom of Heaven was promised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Testament. St. <hi>Augustin</hi> said by this last Article was to be understood the legal covenant, that it promised not Eternal Life; but if that were all that was meant by the Books of the Old Testament, it was true that it was promised, tho' there was no mention made of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> this phrase of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There never was a dispute more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate than this, because each of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties finding themselves pressed by some ill consequence, endeavour'd to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by terms, to which they gave a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sense, from what they had in the mouth of the Adversaries. The word <hi>Grace,</hi> in that of <hi>Pelagius</hi> signifieth not the same thing as in that of the Bishop of <hi>Hippo</hi>: and this latter gave the name of <hi>Liberty</hi> to a thing that was not commonly so called. In short many men believe that if we take the pains to examine the principal words that have been made use of in this controversie, and the Ideas that have been applied to 'em, it will be found that almost none of these Ideas are distinct, so that when the word is spoken to which it is applied, we may perfectly know what is meant by it. There are also accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them some of these words to which there hath been no Idea absolutely applied, so that in some places of this dispute the two parties do very nigh the same thing that a <hi>French</hi> man and an <hi>Arabian</hi> would, that should know their natural tongue only, and speak by turns the lowdest they could, and sometimes both at once without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing each other, and then each should boast to have conquered his Adversary.</p>
                     <p>This was chiefly what the opinions of <hi>Pelagius</hi> consisted in, and those of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries touching Grace. As to the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it seemeth <hi>Pelagius</hi> hath believed that there were two sorts the one to Grace, and the other to Glory. God hath resolved according to his Judgment to call certain persons to the knowledge of the Gospel, that they might the more easily arrive at everlasting happiness. This was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination of Grace. He after that hath resolved to save those that he foresaw would
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103507:32"/>
persevere until the end in making good use on these favours. This is the Predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to Glory, which is founded upon me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; whereas the other is purely of Grace. St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in disputing against <hi>Pelagius,</hi> hath confounded, <note n="(a)" place="margin">p. 614. ibid.</note> as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Petau</hi> believes, these two Predestinations, and made thereof but one; because ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his opinion all those, that have received the necessary means to attain Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation do infallibly arrive at it. 'Twas that made him exclaim so strongly against those that maintain'd Predestination, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to works, as if the Predestination to Grace was in question, whereas they meant but the Predestination to Glory.</p>
                     <p>The year after the Council of <hi>Dios<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> being <hi>Anno</hi> 415. there were in <hi>Africk</hi> held two Councils upon the same matter the one at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the other at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leve. Aurelius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> presided in the first, where were LXVII. Bishops more met together also. They had not as yet received in <hi>Africk</hi> the Acts of <hi>Diospolis</hi>; but <hi>Eros</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> had written what had passed therein, and had sent their Letters, by <hi>Orosius</hi> who was returned from <hi>Palestine</hi> to <hi>Africk.</hi> It was resolved on the hearing this Relation to anathematize the opinions of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> to hinder them from spreading any further, and to anathematize him after, with his Disciple <hi>Celestius,</hi> in case they did not absolutely renounce these Errours. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they sent the Acts of the Council to Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> to engage him to condemn the same opinions. The Council of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leve</hi> consisting of LXI. Bishops, in which <hi>Silvanus</hi> Primate of <hi>Numidia</hi> presided, did the same thing as that of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Besides the Synodal Letters of these two Councils, <hi>Innocent</hi> received particular ones from some Bishops of <hi>Africk,</hi> among which St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> was one. The design of these Letters was the same as of the preceding ones; the design being to incline <hi>Innocent</hi> to condemn the Doctrine attributed to <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and to cite him before himself to examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he continued to maintain the same. They insinuated that they might accomplish their end, that it might be, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> had deceived the Bishops of <hi>Palestine,</hi> tho' they cou'd not positively affirm that the Churches of <hi>Africk,</hi> might not be joined to those of the <hi>East. Innocent</hi> answered the year following (ccccxvii) to the two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and to the Bishop that had written to him in particular. He said he believed that <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Celestius</hi> did deserve to be excommunicated, and that the former could not be purged at <hi>Diospolis,</hi> but by Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by obscure expressions. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless having received no new assurances from that Country, and not knowing well how things had passed there; he saith, he can neither approve nor disapprove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Bishops of <hi>Palestine.</hi> He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise excuseth himself in regard of citing <hi>Pelagius</hi> upon the distance of the places. This Bishop writ these Letters at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year, and died a little after, for the tenth of <hi>March,</hi> in the Martyrology of <hi>Beda</hi> is marked for the day of his death.</p>

                     <p>THe principal difficulties, which Roman Catholicks raise against Protestants consists in these two things; that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion is new, and that it was not remitted from the Apostles unto us; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they pretend theirs is that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and hath suffered no Interruption, from their time unto ours. <hi>Iohn Iuel</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> hath undertaken, in his <hi>Apology for the Church of</hi> England, to shew on the contrary, that the opinions of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants are conformable to those of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the six first Ages: <hi>Vsher</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to answer the above cited difficulties, in shewing that from the sixth Age unto the Reformation, to wit, during 900 years, there have always been Churches in the <hi>West</hi> who have received the same Doctrines with the Protestants. To that end he thought he ought to give the History of the Tenets, and conduct of the Popes with those who have opposed their Usurpations, during these nine Ages; without mixing any thing of his own; being contented to cite only the proper terms of the Authors, who have spoken of those times, for fear he should be accused of turning things after a more favourable manner for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants. This History had once appeared im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect enough, but now very much corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and enlarg'd in this Edition, and therefore we shall give a compleat Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof. We shall not however stay to relate what the Author saith as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the thousand years, during which the Devil was to be bound, and the time in which he was to be set free. As there are as many different Sentiments as Interpreters upon this opinion; and that there are but simple conjectures brought, which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise subject to a thousand difficulties; 1. Those who have a mind to be instructed therein may consult the Commentaries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apocalypse. At what year soever men relate the beginning of the thousand years, whether it be from the Birth of our Saviour, or from his Death, and his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or finally from the ruine of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> our Author equally draws his advantage as will be seen in the sequel. It shall suffice to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103507:33"/>
say that he divides his work into three parts, whereof the first goeth from the seventh Age to the eleventh, in which <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the seventh arrived to the Pontificate: The second should have gone to Mccclxx, but the Author could not continue it but to Mccxl. The third reaches to the past Age. So this work is far from being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and we know not what those meant, who had the care of this Edition, in putting in the Latin Title, <hi>Opus integrum,</hi> unless these words signifie only, that there have been inserted, in divers places, additions which the Author had made.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For to conceive well the change; which happened by little and little in the Christian Church, we must begin at the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, and consider the State in which it was for the first six Ages. <hi>Hegesippus</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us that during the Life of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Hereticks scarcely durst appear, but that as soon as these Holy men were dead, a great number of them were seen openly to oppose the truth. In that time divers Philosophers attacked the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with so much the more boldness that the Christians were destitute of Persons who could refute the Pagan Religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Christianity with sufficient eloquence. This is what <hi>Lactantius</hi> testifies in these words; <hi>Si qui sorte literatorum ad eam contule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, defensioni ejus (veritatis) non suffece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> And a little lower, after having na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Minucius Faelix, Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian, quia defuerunt apud nostros idonei, peritique Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctores, qui vehementer, qui acriter errores pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licos redarguerent, qui causam omnem verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ornate copioseque desenderent; provocavit quosdam hac ipsa penuria ut auderent scribere contra ignotam sibi veritatem.</hi> This scarcity of able men made many Hereticks to slip in amongst the Christians, and easily sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the weak and ignorant who were in a very great number. But as soon as there were Christian Emperours, the corruption was much greater; pleasures began to be introduced into the Christian Church, and amongst Ecclesiasticks there appear'd En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Divisions. And because Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were rich and considerable they made use of all manner of means to attain Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks, and when they came to it, they assum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d a Tyrannical Authority. These disorders always encreased, until they came to a great head, as <hi>Vsher</hi> shews is too evident by many passages of famous Authors, who have left us frightful Characters of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their Ages.</p>
                     <p>It encreased particularly in the time of <hi>Boniface</hi> III. who came to the Chair in Dcvi. and who obtained of the Emperor <hi>Phocas</hi> the title of Ecumenick Bishop and Chief of the Church. The Historians of that time describe this <hi>Phocas,</hi> as the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedest man in his Age, and <hi>Cedrenus</hi> saith that a holy Monk having asked of God se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, why he had made <hi>Phocas</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour? a voice from Heaven at last an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him. <hi>Because I have found none worse,</hi> This History true, or false, marks, the horrour People had for the memory of <hi>Phocas. Vsher</hi> believes that it was then that Antichrist came into the World, and that he was during some Ages but in his Childhood. <hi>Boniface,</hi> according to him, contributed not a little to the establishing and extending his Empire. Yet there were Assemblies held, and couragious Persons found, that opposed the progresses of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Tenets, who have much contributed to the Grandeur of the Ecclesiasticks in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and Popes in particular, amongst which our Author seeks for Antichrist, as most part of the Protestants do.</p>
                     <p>A Council composed of cccxxxviii. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops condemned in the year Dccliv. at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the worship of Images, and gave this reason for their proceeding;<q> that there is but one Image, instituted by Jesus Christ, to wit, the Bread and Wine of the Eucharist, which represent his Body and Blood.</q>
Although the second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> opposed it, and re-established the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Images in Dcclxxxvii. These Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons were rejected in the <hi>West</hi> by the Churches of great <hi>Britain,</hi> as our Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop shews by divers English Authors.

But it is not the custom of Popes to learn Religion from any one. <hi>Adrian</hi> had no respect to the remonstrances of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> whom he endeavoured even to refute; the Images were adored at <hi>Rome</hi> as much then as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and his Successors did as much as he.

at the end of the tenth Age, seeing it was thought strange that a Cardinal, sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> blessed a Chappel in the Diocess of <hi>Tours,</hi> without the permission of the Bishop of that City. There are also remarkable words of <hi>Arnulph</hi> Bishop of <hi>Orleance,</hi> in a Council of <hi>Rheims,</hi> held in DCCCCXCII. where he saith, speaking of the Pope: <hi>If he is destitute of Charity, and pufft up only with his Knowledge, he is the Antichrist,</hi> who is seated in the Temple of God, and who shews himself as if he was a God. <hi>But if he has neither Charity, nor Wisdom, he is in the Temple of God as a Statue, or as an Idol, from whom an answer can be no more expected, than from a Marble. Si caritate destituitur, solaque scientiâ inslatur &amp; extollitur.</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christus est in Templo Dei sedens, &amp; se o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendens tanquam sit Deus. <hi>Si autem cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate fundatur, nec scientia erigitur, in Templo Dei tanquam Statua, tanquam Idolum est, à quo responsa petere, marmora consulere est.</hi> If this principle of <hi>Arnulph</hi> is true, it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite the Defendors of Popes discover by what wonder they are all full of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Learning, altho' they appear in our eyes either Ignorant, or Proud, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vsher</hi> then sheweth, how that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of Transubstantiation was much resisted, which began to be introduced in the ninth Age. He rangeth among the Defenders of the spiritual presence, <hi>Rabanus Maurus, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram, Iohn Scot Erigene,</hi> and several others, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we may consult Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> and <hi>Claude</hi> in their dispute upon the perpetuity of the Faith of the Church concerning the Eucharist, and concerning <hi>Bertram,</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular his Work intituled: <hi>Ratramne,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, <hi>Bertram the Priest, of the Body and Blood of the Lord, printed in Latin and French, with an Advertisement wherein in shewn that this Author is a witness not suspicious of the Faith of the Church in the ninth Age,</hi> at <hi>Roan</hi> in 12. But the efforts that a great number of Learned men made against the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, which were introducing in that time, were unprofitable. Whereas those Tenets were too advantageous to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> not to maintain them with all their might. It lacked but one thing only, which was to diminish the power of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, to whom they were submitted until then. It worked powerfully therein, and begun by publishing Suppositious pieces, in vertue of which the Popes pretended that the Soveraignty of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> belonged to them, and that they had an universal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction over all the Bishops of the World; to that purpose tended the false <hi>Donation of</hi> Constantine <hi>to Pope</hi> Sylvester, and the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles attributed to the first Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which <hi>Blondel</hi> and several other learned men have shewn the falshood.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding the manners of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Monks, and Clergy were in the utmost corruption, and a horrible account is given us of the depravation of the tenth Age, drawn as well from the writings of modern Catholicks, as from the Authors of that time. The conduct of the whole Clergy, from the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> with the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Priests and Monks, was so far from the duties which the Gospel prescribes us, that there have been few Ages, whilst Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope continued in Paganism more corrupt, than that was. This is so known, that it's needless to make a further stop thereat, and those who would be instructed throughly in it may only consult <hi>Vsher</hi> and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors whom he cites.</p>
                     <p>The eleventh Age is in like manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and they assure us that the year M. after the Birth of our Lord, was afflicted with divers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prodigies, besides War, the Plague and Famine which ravaged Europe a long-time, as it appears by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of divers Authors, which may be read in <hi>Vsher.</hi> In that time they reckoned amongst Prodigies, the Comets and Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and the Historians, a little while after, describe them to us in such frightful terms, as, if we never had seen any, we should trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for fear, in reading what they say thereof. But when once one hath a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded imagination, nothing ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is seen, all is great and wonderful; and we see even that which never was, such as was perhaps the Dragon whereof <hi>Glaber Rodolphus</hi> speaks in his 11. book <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>The Saturday night before Christmasday, was seen in the Air,</hi> saith he, <hi>a surprizing Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, a frightful Dragon, which was all Shining with Light, and which went from the North to the South.</hi> The evils of that time and the reports of these prodigies, true or false, made it to be believed that the time was come in which Antichrist was to appear, after that the Dragon should be untied. This was probably enough grounded upon what is said in the Apocalypse, that the Dragon was to be chained during a thousand years, and then let loose. These thousand years were reckoned, from the Birth of our Lord, by which the Devil had begun to lose his Power, until that time. This cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation was not new, seeing it is found conformable to that of St. <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Chrisostome.</hi> It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without doubt more just and better grounded, so that they expected from day to day the coming of Antichrist and end of the World. Many People made a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to undertake any considerable business, and even of re-establishing the Churches which were destroyed, fearing they should work for Antichrist. Lastly when they saw it did not come, they were perswaded that they did not well understand the Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y, and went about rebuilding the Churches, and to live as before. <hi>Richard Victorinus</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who upon the relation of <hi>Iohn Major</hi> his Compatriot is the first who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that the Holy Virgin was exempted from Original Sin, saith in his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon the <hi>xx. Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypse, that as to the Letter the thousand years were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready accomplished a long time since, but that it could not be known when Antichrist would come, nor when the Serpent would be unloos'd.</hi> Thus

it is that the Interpreters of Prophecies which they understand not, never miss of a back door to escape at, when the event sheweth that they are mistaken. There is a great likelihood that our age will furnish us with some examples of this truth. As it's desired, in great evils, to know if they shall last long, those who of late have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to a great many Protestant Churches, have made a great many to covet a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the time to come, some thought they foresaw it in the obscurity of the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the Apocalypse, and have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told it with sufficient boldness, tho' they agree not amongst themselves, no more than those who undertook to do the same thing the eleventh and twelfth age.</p>

                        <hi>Glaber Rodolph</hi> saith, that in effect the Devil was let loose in 1000, because one <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> who taught Grammar at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and some others had essayed in that time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish Paganism, But this event appears too inconsiderable, to apply unto him what is said in the Apocalypse of the Dragon, who was to be loos'd. Also our Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop believes that Antichrist was not to be be looked for out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was enough at liberty, whilst in the Pontifical Chair sate a Magician, such as was <hi>Sylvester</hi> II. if the Authors of that time may be believed, and whilst great errours were brought into the Church; as the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power of Popes, Transubstantiation, and Prayers for the Dead. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd that <hi>Berengarius, Wickliff</hi> and his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, have maintained that from that time this Prophecy of the Apocalypse begun to be accomplished. There have been not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding some who have believed, that the thousand years were to begin at the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension of our Lord, as <hi>Iohn Purvey</hi> saith, and <hi>Wickliff</hi> seems not far from this thought in a place of his <hi>Trialogue,</hi> which <hi>Vsher</hi> cites. Some persons had already been of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the time of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> as he testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in his <hi>City of God,</hi> l. XVIII. <hi>c.</hi> 53. But these people speak with more precaution than the others, for they did not positively say that the World would end 1000 years after the Ascension of Jesus Christ, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>that it might be,</hi> that there were but a thousand years from this term, unto his last coming, <hi>annos mille ab Ascensione Domini us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ad ultimum ejus adventum compleri posse.</hi> One of the new Interpreters of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse hath said the same, with much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that <hi>the present Persecution</hi> may <hi>end in three years and a half. God,</hi> if he will, saith he elsewhere, can <hi>reckon the three years and half of the death of the Witnesses, from the Revocation of the Edict of</hi> Nants.</p>
                     <p>To return to our Author, he remarks that the same prodigies have been related of the year MXXXIII. and the same evils, as of the year M. There was also towards that time a Mortality and Famine, and Signs from Heaven appeared, to wit, Eclipses and Comets, besides, Earthquakes that were in divers places. And that there should nothing be wanting of what had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the beginning of this Age, one <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulph</hi> a Monk of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> testified he had seen in <hi>Hungary</hi> a Dragon suspended in the air, and altogether like the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention is made in <hi>Iob.</hi> It came also out of the <hi>North,</hi> and after having appeared sometime as unmoveable, he began to fly with an extraordinary swiftness, and went amongst the Clouds whisling horribly, where he raised Lightnings and Thunders, for more than 24 hours. Notwithstanding ignorance and superstition encreased from day to day. A Bishop of <hi>France,</hi> at the relation of <hi>Sigebert,</hi> would fain make people believe that he had received Letters from the third Heaven, wherein all men were ordered on Friday to live upon Bread and Water, to bear no Arms, to recall nothing, by way of Justice, what had been taken away by violence, and not to pursue the Murderers. Heaven pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Salvation to those who should live thus, not having need of any other peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence but to abstain from flesh on Fridays. There were Bishops so simple or superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to believe, and impose those new Laws upon many under pain of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and of being deprived of Burial, if they died in the refusal thereof. In this time likewise were discovered many Relicks of Martyrs, which had been unknown in former Ages. <hi>Glaber</hi> relates that an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor sold in divers places of <hi>France</hi> Bones of dead Folks, which he had gathered in some Church yards, for Relicks of Saints, that afterwards did an infinite number of Miracles, and which much benefited the Churches in which they were placed. Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he should be suspected, and that men would desire to know whence this inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible fund of Relicks came, he stay'd not in one place, and changed his name when he changed his Habitation. He gave amongst others to the Inhabitants of the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Tarantoise</hi> a Martyr, to whom he gave the name of <hi>Iust,</hi> and who did, as 'tis said, so great a number of Miracles, that the sick were carried from all parts to be cured, and that the Saints were sorry if they had not some disease whereby they might have an opportunity to be cured by him: <hi>Poenitet insuper si non est sibi morbus quo curari se poscat. Glaber</hi> attributes these Miracles to the Devil, and mightily censures the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of that Country, for not having put a stop to such extravagances of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>The Pope who ascended the Apostolick See in the year MXXXIII. was <hi>Bennet</hi> IX. whom <hi>Glaber</hi> accuseth of all manner of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities, and Cardinal <hi>Baino</hi> of Idolatry and Magick. This Pope coming to the Chair at the age of XII years, lived eleven years only, but he committed so many crimes that he was driven from <hi>Rome,</hi> and was forced to sell his dignity, whereof not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he would not be deprived af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, so that there were at <hi>Rome</hi> three Popes at once, <hi>Bennet, Sylvester</hi> and <hi>Gregory.</hi> The disorders of that time are too known to make any stop at them, it will suffice to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103507:34"/>
say that the memory of this <hi>Benet,</hi> was in so great a detestation, that there ran a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that his Soul had been sent after his death into the body of a Monster, which was shap'd like a Bear, and which had the Ears and Tail of an Ass, where he was to stay till the day of Judgment, that he would be sent without remission into Hell.</p>
                     <p>It was at the beginning of this Age, as our Author sheweth, that the dignity of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals begun to be considerable, but it came not to the height till they only had the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of choosing Popes; since they have been equalled to Kings, and have carried their Pride so far, that <hi>Nicholas de Cleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Bajeux,</hi> who lived in the year MCCCCXVI. describes them in these terms.
<q>The Pride of Cardinals, who sit at the side of the Pope, is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive, their words are so fierce, and their ways so insolent, that if a Painter would make a Picture of Pride, he could not better do it than in Painting a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: <hi>Cardinalium qui Papae assident spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, verba tumulentia, gestus taminsolentes, ut si artifex quisque vellet superbiae simula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>It hath been seen that according to our Author, the term at which the Devil was let loose, expired a thousand years after the Birth, or after the passion of our Lord. He afterwards says that if men will take the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of these thousand years, from the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> it may be said with as much likelihood, that they are in effect expired in MLXXIII. that the Monk <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand</hi> ascended the Apostolical See, and Governed the Church with the utmost Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, under the name of <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. The unheard excesses which this Pope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, made the honest men of that time to say, according to the relation of <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> in his Chronicle, upon the year MLXXXVIII. that the Reign of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ then begun, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the Apostles. <hi>Waltram Bishop of Naumbourg,</hi> or the Author of the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for the <hi>Vnity of the Church,</hi> saith in these terms.
<q>That is seemed then that the Devil was come out of Prison; whereas it is written in the Apocalypse, he went forth to seduce the Nations, and to engage 'em to War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
The Church of <hi>Liege,</hi> in its answer to <hi>Paschal</hi> II. saith as much, as well as divers other Authors cited by <hi>Vsher,</hi> who describe <hi>Hildebrand</hi> as the most wicked of all men. He was accused of Witchcraft in a Synod held in MLXXX. and several Catholick Writers have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declared the same thing, which gives occasion to our Archbishop of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of the man of sin, that he was to come <hi>accompanied with the work of Satan, and with deceiving Miracles.</hi> And also what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where of some Impostors, who were to come in the latter times, and which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes by two remarkable characters, which is, <hi>that they would interdict Marriage, and order the abstaining from Meats, which God hath created to be eaten with thanksgiving.</hi> In effect <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. did 'em both in two Synods assembled the sixth year of his Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, wherein he prohibited the Marriage of Priests, and the use of Flesh on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days. <hi>Sigebert de Gemblou</hi> and <hi>Lambert de Schafnabourg,</hi> have written at large the murmurs and disorders which these prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions caused.
<q>Priests said particularly, that it was unjust to constrain men to live like Angels, and that in stopping the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary course of Nature, the bridle was let loose to Fornication and Impurity. They added that if the Pope grew obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in his Sentiment, they would rather quit the Priesthood than Marriage, and that <hi>Gregory</hi> who despised men, should take the care of providing himself with Angels to govern the Church.</q>
These good men without doubt spake with much sincerity, and it may be if those, who have endeavoured to blacken the conduct of the Reformers, in that they have introduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the Marriage of Priests, would let nature speak, they would not say less. But it is a great unhappiness, and a great prejudice at the same time against the deluders of Virginity, to live in a Church, whereof they are constrained to defend all the Sentiments, unless they would dishonour and destroy themselves.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the Authors of the time of <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand,</hi> and those who have written since, give him several times the name of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and it cannot be denied, at least, but that it is he who hath established the excessive authority of Popes, and who the first durst to maintain that they have the power of deposing Kings, and to change what they please in the Canons. It is no more than may be seen in the <hi>Decretals</hi> of the Edition of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof <hi>Vsher</hi> cites divers scandalous articles. He also gives the History of the quarrels which this Pope had with the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates all the evil that hath been said of the first. And with this he ends the first part of his work, which was to have extended to the time in which the Devil hath been let loose.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. As it is in the Apocalypse, that a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years being past, the Dragon was to be <hi>unloos'd for a little time, Vsher</hi> begins his second part by the explication of this place, and remarks that according to the maxim of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> nothing being called great or little, but by relation to another thing, the time in which the Dragon was to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chain'd should be short, in comparison of the time during which he had ravaged the World, before he had been put in Chains.</p>
                     <p>Roman Catholicks demand of Protestants, where the Church was then, if the Pope was Antichrist? <hi>Vsher</hi> answers that the Church was then in the state, in which some Antients, and divers Catholick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have said that it would be under the Reign of Antichrist. St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in his XX Letter, which is directed to <hi>Hesychius,</hi>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:103507:35"/>
saith that <hi>the Church appear'd not, because of the excessive cruelty of the Persecutors. Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siam non apparituram, impiis tunc Persecutori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ultra modum saevientibus.</hi> Several anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern Authors, have spoken to the same effect: <hi>Vsher</hi> takes occasion from hence to make a parallel of the State of the Churches, which followed the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> in the times that the <hi>Arians</hi> were the strongest, with that wherein the <hi>West</hi> was found in these corrupt Ages. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> reproached others with their small Number, and their Poverty, as it appears by these words of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianza: Where are those who upbraid us with our Poverty, who say that the greatest Number forms the Church, and who jeer the smalness of our Flock?</hi> But as there lived in the Roman Empire several People who were not <hi>Arians, Vsher</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that under the Government of the Pope there was a pretty great number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who were not of these opinions.</p>
                     <p>To shew that he doth not advance a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conjecture, he gives the History of the Original Opinions of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who have rejected several of the Sentiments of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But he speaks more of them in the sequel, as being a place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he should properly speak of them, which obligeth us to pass to the <hi>vii. Chapter,</hi> and afterwards we will return to the <hi>Vaudois.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vsher</hi> divides the time, during which the Dragon hath been delivered from his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, into three Periods; the first reacheth to the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> III. The second un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Gregory</hi> XI. And the third unto <hi>Leo</hi> X. The first comprehends two Ages, taking it's beginning from the year 1000. The State the Western Church hath been in during the first of these two Ages, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints that the Authors of that time made against Corruptions, which were equally seen in the Ecclesiasticks and People. There have been no less complaints made of the Disorders of the twelfth Age, as is plain in our Author, who relates a great number thereof, amongst which is this famous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stich of <hi>Hildebert Bishop of Mans,</hi> who saith in speaking of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                        <q>
                           <l>Vrbs foelix, si vel Dominis Vrbs illa careret!</l>
                           <l>Vel Dominis esset turpe carere fide!</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Happy City, if it had no Masters! or if those who possess it believed it a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to want Faith.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Popes took great care in that Age to have paid to them from <hi>England</hi> a kind of Tribute, that they called St. <hi>Peters</hi> pence, which <hi>Alexander</hi> II. in a Letter written to <hi>William the Norman</hi> saith, had been paid by the English, ever since they had embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Christianity. It appears by this Letter, that the English sent this Money at first to <hi>Rome,</hi> only thro' Liberality; but this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality becoming a Necessity, because the Kings commanded absolutely to do it, the Authors of those times looked upon it as a Tribute. Therefore <hi>Bertold of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> who lived towards the latter end of the eleventh Age, saith that it was then that the Prophecy of the Apocalypse was accomplished; which saith, <hi>That no Person could sell, or buy, without having the Mark or Name of the Beast, or the Number of its Name.</hi> The Reason of this is, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Relation of this Author, in his <hi>Appendix</hi> of <hi>Hermannus Contractus</hi> towards the year Mlxxxiv. <hi>William</hi> the first King of <hi>England</hi> rendred his whole Kingdom Tributary to the Pope, and suffered none to sell or buy, but such as submitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Apostolick See, that is to say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he paid the <hi>Rome-scot</hi> or penny of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Notwithstanding this same <hi>William</hi> refused to swear an Oath of Fealty to <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand,</hi> and punished Bishops and other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks, who had offended him, as he thought fit, without having any regard to the Prayers and Exhortations of this Pope. Some other Kings of <hi>England</hi> resisted the Popes likewise with the same vigour, and we have proofs that the opinions of <hi>Rome</hi> were not yet spread every where. Here is one that is pretty remarkable, which is that <hi>Frederick Barbarousse</hi> being gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy Land to fight the Infidels in Mclxxxix. <hi>Niaetas Choniates</hi> observes, that the <hi>Germans</hi> were welcomed by the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, because the adoration of the Images of Saints was equally prohibited with the</hi> Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>and</hi> Germans. Hereby it appears that they had not as yet forgotten in <hi>Germany</hi> the Council of <hi>Francfort.</hi> It is also remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that several English Authors, who have written after the arrival of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> said that <hi>the Church had in abhorrence the worship of Images.</hi> The Doctrine even of <hi>Lanfranc</hi> concerning the Eucharist, which the <hi>Normans</hi> brought into this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland, was contrary to divers ancient Forms and Writings of the English. And this is the cause that a long time after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> there were in this Country several People of his Opinions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom <hi>Matthew of Westminster,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished a Book in the year Mclxxx. Our Author gives the History of <hi>Berengarius</hi> in this Chapter, but this matter having been treated at large in French Books, by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld</hi> and <hi>Claude,</hi> the Reader will be there better satisfied. We shall only take notice here, that towards the middle of the twelfth Age, they had an Idea of the Sacrifice of the Eucharist far different from that which the Roman Church hath at this day, seeing <hi>Peter Lombard Bishop of</hi> Paris, who is called <hi>Master of the Sentences,</hi> speaks thereof thus, <hi>l. iv. dist.</hi> 12.
<q>What is offered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated by the Priest, is called a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Oblation, because it includes the Memory and Representation of the true Sacrifice and Immolation made upon the Altar of the Cross; Jesus Christ, adds he, once died, and hath been immolated upon the Cross in himself: But he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molated every day in the Sacrament; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Sacrament includes a Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of what was once made.</q>

                     <p>The <hi>Beringarians</hi> have given exercise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to some Popes successively one after another. But the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who begun to be known in Mclx. gave them much more. <hi>Reinier</hi> a Dominican, and an Inquisitor, who lived in the year Mccl. less than 100. years after the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> speaks thereof in these terms:
<q>Amongst all the Sects which are, or have been, there hath been none so pernicious to the Church, as that of the <hi>Leonists</hi>; and this for three Reasons. The first is, that it hath lasted longer, for some say, that it hath been from the time of <hi>Sylvester,</hi> others from the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. The second, because it is more general, for there is scarcely any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where some of this Sect, are not found. The third is, that whereas all other Sects gave a horrour to those who so much as heard of them, by the excess of blasphemies which they vomited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, the Sect of the <hi>Leonists</hi> hath a great shew of Piety, because they live well in the eyes of Men, and that there belief towards God is good, seeing they embrace all the Articles of the Creed. They blaspheme only the Roman Church and Clergy, against whom the multitude of Laicks suffer themselves easily to be overcome.</q>
Hereby we may see, that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> boasted then, that there had been People since the Apostles time, who had been of the same opinions with them, so that they pretended not that theirs begun only in the twelfth Age. As to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the purity of their manners, several of those who have written against them, give them a good Name, as appears by the passages — which <hi>Vsher</hi> cites thereof. An Inquititor saith, with Ingenuity enough speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, <hi>Cognoscuntur Haeretici per mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res &amp; verba, sunt enim in moribus compositi &amp; modesti, superbiam in vestibus non habent,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>Hereticks are known by their manners and Discourse, their Manners are well-ordered and modest, and there appeareth no Vanity in their Cloaths.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not easie to know their belief; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those who have spoken thereof do contradict each other almost of them, and that most have endeavoured to blacken them the most they could. Monks are such Lyars, and so well known for so long a time, that one scarcely dares trust them, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle soever their Interest is of telling a lye, and such are the principal witnesses which may be produced upon this matter.
<q>
                           <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff</hi> said facetiously enough in his <hi>Trialogue,</hi> that as it is a Topick Argument to say, that a man is luxurious, because he is too well dressed; it's also a Topick Argument to reason thus; this opinion comes from a Monk, therefore it is false: for the lyes of Monks, render this Topick Argument evident.</q>
                        <hi>Sicut est Argumentum Topicum, quod homo comptus exhinc est luxuriosus: Sic est Argumentum Topicum; ista opinio origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur à fratre, ergo est falsa.

These Names are drawn either from the opinions which were attributed to them, or of some famous Doctors amongst them, or of places where they lived, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath at large shewn in <hi>Ch. viii.</hi> It's much to be desired, that there was as much method as reading, and that the additions which he made in the first Edition, were either better ranged, or better distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Rest: For it must be granted that in this great confusion are many repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, which all sorts of Readers are not equally fit to digest.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter Waldo,</hi> according to some Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, was of <hi>Lyons</hi> and engaged himself after this manner to form a new Sect. One of his acquaintance dying suddenly, he was so frightened thereat that he gave all his Goods to the Poor, and so drew many of the People, which he went about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct in expounding unto them the New Testament. He was reprehended therein by the Ecclesiasticks of <hi>Lyons</hi>; which made him withdraw into <hi>Gasconny,</hi> and into the neighbouring Provinces, where he always taught the People, and censured the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Ecclesiasticks, praising volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Poverty, and blaming the covetousness of Priests. A great number of Laicks join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves to him, in spight of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which the Council of <hi>Tours</hi> held by <hi>Alexander</hi> the III. in Mclxiii, and the Bishops of each place darted against them. They assure us that in the beginning there were no learned men amongst them, but that afterwards there were. So that we cannot be certain that they at first had all the opinions which since appear amongst 'em; because nothing hinders, but that there might be some introduced by learned men, who entred into this party. If what <hi>Gaultier Mapes</hi> an Author of that time, saith of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> be true, they were also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103507:36"/>
ignorant in the time of the III. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Lateran</hi> held under <hi>Alexander</hi> III. in MCLXXIX. This Author saith, that some of them presented to the Pope, divers books of Scripture translated into French, with Comments, and demanded instantly of him the Power to preach. Two amongst them, who passed for the most able, were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in an Assembly, where <hi>Mapes</hi> was Commissioned, as he saith, to Question them. He asked of them, if they believed in God the Father, the Son and Holy Ghost. They answered Yes. <hi>Do ye</hi> also <hi>believe,</hi> added he, <hi>in the Mother of Iesus Christ?</hi> The <hi>Vaudois</hi> replied they did, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thus, saith the Author, to be laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by all Men. Notwithstanding as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not, that they were willing to desist from their design, they were excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the Council, yet they continued their Assemblies in <hi>Gasconny,</hi> and in the Neighbouring places, where they begun from that time to exclaim against the abuses they had observed at <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p>History tells us, that <hi>Manicheans</hi> were mixed among them, tho' they were very different in opinions, and some were burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who were discovered in divers places of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> St. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the following Age against I know not what Hereticks, whereof he speaks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contemptibly, and to whom he also at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, some of the Sentiments of the <hi>Manicheans.</hi> He assures us, that they chose rather to die than to be converted, and that they not only shewed Constancy, but even rejoyced when they were led to the place where they were to be put to Death. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri magis eligebant, quàm converti; nec modo patienter, sed laeti, ut videbatur, ducebantur ad mortem.</hi> We may see hereby that seduced Persons as sincerely believe a false Doctrine, as the Orthodox do theirs, who defend the Truth, for infine, one would not be burned for what one look'd upon as a lye.</p>

They made the greater progress by reason that Priests were fallen into the utmost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, whereof here is a proof drawn from a vulgar way of speaking which this Author relates. To shew that they were far from doing a thing, they were accustomed to say, <hi>I would rather be a Iew</hi>; But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb changed, and it is said in <hi>Gasconny, I would rather be a Priest, than to do that: Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem esse Capellanus, quàm hoc vel illud facere.</hi> Men were every where so wearied with the Ecclesiastical Tyranny, and so scandalized at their lewd course of Life, that those who spake against them, were hearkened to with Delight and Pleasure, as they did to one <hi>Arnand of Bresse</hi> a Disciple of <hi>Peter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bailards,</hi> who went to censure them at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Poet <hi>Gunther</hi> speaks thereof more at large, in the third book of his <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurin,</hi> and concludes thus what he says of 'em.</p>

                     <p>Our Author relates divers of the violent proceedings against them, and amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a Declaration of <hi>Alphonsus King of Arragon,</hi> published in MCXCIV, wherein he drives the <hi>Vaudois</hi> out of his Estates, prohibites his Subjects to give them any succours, upon pain of Confiscation of all their Goods, and orders them to add all manner of grievances and affronts, to beat and abuse them, yet upon Condition they will neither kill nor cripple them, <hi>praeter so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lummodo laesionem mortis, aut membrorum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truncationem.</hi> This is a cruel mildness, which sometime Persecutors have practis'd, and whereof it would not be hard to find fresh Examples.</p>
                     <p>The second period of time, during which <hi>Usher</hi> believes the Dragon was let loose, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends from the beginning of the Pontificate of <hi>Innocent</hi> III. unto the beginning of that of <hi>Gregory</hi> XI. to wit, from the year 1194. unto 1370. <hi>Innocent</hi> endeavour'd not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to establish the indirect Authority of Popes, over Kings, and that which they pretend to have over all the Bishops of the World. He named himself, in a discourse which he made upon the Consecration of Popes, <hi>the Spouse of the Church.</hi> He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that all Bishops were but his Vicars, and that it was he alone, <hi>who retain'd an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi> Episcopal <hi>Authority. So that other</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <hi>might say of him as of God, we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of his fulness.</hi> He caused a Synod to be held at <hi>Rome</hi> in MCCXV, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the fourth of <hi>Lateran,</hi> where he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Canon of the III. Council held in the same place, by which <hi>Alexander</hi> III. had absolved from the Oath of Fidelity the Subjects of a Prince, who had favoured He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, against the Remonstrances of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Here are the terms of the second decree.
<q>If a Temporal Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and advertised by the Church, neglect to purge his Lands from the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Heresie, let the Metropolitan and the other Bishops of the Province ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate him. If he makes not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in a year, let the Soveraign Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif be advertised, that he may declare his Subjects absolved from the Fidelity which they owe him, and give his Countrey to be possessed by Catholicks, who, having rooted out the Hereticks, may possess it, without any contradiction.</q>
As this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is quite contrary to the Authority of Princes, some Catholick Authors, who have lived in places, where this indirect Authority of Popes is refused to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged over the Temporalities of Kings, they say that the Canons attributed to this Council were suppositious, or at least that things did not pass therein after a canonical manner, so that these Decrees obliged no Body. But a famous English
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103507:36"/>
Protestant hath shewn that these Decrees are not suppositious; that they are obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, according to the Principles of the Roman Church; that they have been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>England</hi>; that the distinction of those who say that the Decrees of Councils ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige in matters of Faith, and not in matters of practice are unreasonable and contrary to the Principles of the same Church; and that tho' this distinction was true, it could not exempt them from submitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Decrees of the IV. Council of <hi>Lateran.</hi> It was in this same Council that <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> was established, and that a Croisade was published against the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois,</hi> as it was usually done against the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. <hi>Antoninus</hi> in his Chronicle affirms that the County of <hi>Thoulouse,</hi> and <hi>Lombardy</hi> being full of Hereticks, who amongst other errours endeavoured to take from the Church all it's Temporalities (<hi>omnem Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralitatem.</hi>) St. <hi>Dominick</hi> set himself to preach against them, and converted a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand of 'em. He took, adds he, to his help some devout and zealous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for the Faith, who conquered these He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks corporally with the material Sword, when they could not convince them with the Sword of the Spirit. <hi>Quae corporaliter illos Hereticos gladio materiali expugnarent, quos ipse gladio verbi Dei amputare non posset.</hi> They were called <hi>the Brothers of the War of St.</hi> Dominick.</p>
                     <p>At that time <hi>Innocent</hi> established an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition at <hi>Thoulouse</hi> and in other suspicious places; because the Bishops being employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about their temporal Affairs took no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> care enough to extirpate Heresie. St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick</hi> was Commissary over <hi>Gasconny,</hi> and established his Order there that they might assist him in the Work; there never was before regular and perpetual Inquisitions. Another Order of begging Monks was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, besides that of the Dominicans, to wit, the Minor Brothers founded by St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and that of the Augustines, as an assistance to the Bishops and Pastors. But it soon appeared that instead of helping them they pretended to take the care upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves alone, which the Pastors were inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with; this necessarily caused a great many complaints, as our Author sufficiently shews. There was particularly a great quarrel in MCCLIII, betwixt the University of <hi>Paris</hi> and the Preaching Brothers; which was hard to be appeased, because the King fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the University, and the Pope upheld the Monks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who pretended to a Right of Teaching Divinity without having any regard to the Laws of the University. During this quarrel <hi>Iohn of Parma</hi> an Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Monk, and General of the Minors, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished a Book intituled the <hi>Eternal Gospel.</hi> This Book was full of Impieties, and of as strange absurdities as those of the Alcoran. The Author amongst other things maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Gospel should be abrogated, as not being capable of conducting to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that this was reserved to the Order of the begging Monks, who in the latter end of the World should teach a Doctrine much more perfect than that of Jesus Christ. This Book was condemned at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Author was obliged voluntarily to quit his Charge, with the least noise that could be, not to irritate an Order then powerful enough, and which was of great use to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> A Book was also condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which four Doctors of the University of <hi>Paris</hi> had read against the former, intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>De periculis novissimorum temporum.</hi> It was burned at <hi>Anagnia,</hi> where the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> then was, and at <hi>Paris</hi> likewise, <hi>not for any Heresie which it contained,</hi> saith <hi>William de Nangis</hi>

                        </gap>d <hi>the Doctor of Doctors, the source of Life, and the irrefragable Doctor.</hi> He commented on the first four Books of the Sentences of <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> and summed up all the heads of Divinity, by order of <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. About the same time <hi>Gaultier Bishop of Poitiers</hi> made the first work <hi>de Quodlibetariis,</hi> which gave birth to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of disputing for and against all sorts of Propositions. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>the Seraphick Doctor,</hi> was their Contemporary, and so much esteemed by <hi>Alexander de Hales,</hi> that he was accustomed to say, <hi>it seemed to him that</hi> Adam <hi>had not sinned in</hi> Bonaventure. <hi>Iohn Duns</hi> a Scotchman, who flourished at the beginning of the IV. Age, and who was a Disciple of the same <hi>Alexander,</hi> acquired to himself the glorious Sirname of <hi>Subtil Doctor. Thomas Bradwardin,</hi> had towards the middle of the same Age, that of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Doctor.</hi> The Dominicans also have not fail'd of having Divines also in their party, whereof these are the two chief: <hi>Albert</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> who died in MCCLXXX, Sirnamed <hi>The Great,</hi> even during his Life, and <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> the <hi>Angelical Doctor,</hi> who was his Disciple. There hath besides been in this Order the famous <hi>Durand de S. Porcien,</hi> Sirnamed, <hi>the most Resolute Doctor, resolutissimus.</hi> There was at the same time a Carmelite named <hi>Gilles Romanus,</hi> who was called <hi>the most Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Doctor, Doctorem fundatissimum</hi>; and a little time after, in the Order of <hi>Cisteaux, Alain des Iles,</hi> who was named <hi>the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Doctor.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vsher</hi> hath also collected without much Order, divers things concerning the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Sentiments of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> and <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gese,</hi> and there begins to make the History how they were persecuted, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the third Age, until the year MCCXL. (As these events are found in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103507:37"/>
divers French and Latin Histories) we shall not relate them.</p>
                     <p>Here is only an Example of the barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Age. <hi>William le Brebon</hi> contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Poet, saith in his <hi>Philippide</hi> LXVIII, with an Ingenuity particular to himself, speaking of the taking and sacking of <hi>Bezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>:
<q>60000 Souls had their throats cut, which the inordinate fury of the Vulgar, and the indiscretion <hi>of the Ribaldorum</hi> kill'd, without the consent of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, making the faithful die with the incredulous, and not much mattering which deserved Death, or ought to have his Life saved.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet what he saith of the Consent of the Heads of the party is not altogether True. <hi>Arnold Abbot of Cisteaux,</hi> since Archbishop of <hi>Narbone,</hi> and Legate of the Pope in this occasion, was so much afraid that some He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick should escape, that he ordered the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to cut off indifferently all those they met. He is a witness not to be suspected who tells us it, to wit, <hi>Cesaire de Heister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach</hi> Monk of the same Order, in the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and who lived in the time this Massacre was.
<q>Knowing, saith he, by their Confessions, that there were Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks amongst the Hereticks, they said to the Abbot, what shall we do, Sir? we cannot distinguish the good from the bad. But the Abbot and the rest fearing that the Hereticks would counterfeit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be Catholicks, only for fear of Death, and should return to their old He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, when the Army withdrew, the Abbot, I say, answered, as they tell us; kill them, for God knoweth those who are his: <hi>Caedite eos, novit enim Dominus qui sunt ejus.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>If <hi>Vsher</hi> could have continued, he might perhaps have recovered Authentick pieces, to end his History. There was one seen, a little while since, which could have served his purpose, and would be of great use to those who would be willing to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his design. It is an Original Register of the Inquisition of <hi>Thoulouse,</hi> written and collated by two Notaries of the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, which contains what it hath done against the <hi>Albigeses</hi> for sixteen years, from the year Mcccvii, to the year, Mcccxxiii. The forms of the Oath are therein which Civil Judges tendred to the Inquisition, to defend it, and not to protect Heresie direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or indirectly; and the Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was design'd against those who favoured it; amongst whom were reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even those who accused those Hereticks which were of their acquaintance. There is the process of a great number of Persons condemned for Heresie, to divers punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to the exigency of the case. Some of those were condemned who repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, after having kept them some time in Prison to put upon their cloaths violet cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor'd Crosses; which they thus wore all their Life, not being suffered to appear with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloaths, and with this clause that the Inquisition reserved a full power of change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sentence pronounced, as it should be thought fit, whether those who had been condemned to wear the Cross were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed anew, or whether there was no accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all. Those whom they resolv'd to mortifie by a sad imprisonment were kept between four Walls, where they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to go of themselves, and where they were nourished only upon Bread and Water. The obstinate Hereticks were put into the hands of the Secular. There was at that time in <hi>Gasconny</hi> of divers sorts, as well as before. In this Register are <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois,</hi> and <hi>Albigeses</hi> condemned for divers pretended Heresies, as of denying Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, and the seven Sacraments of the Romish Church, of maintaining that we shall not rise in spiritual Bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There have been besides <hi>Baguins,</hi> certain Monks of the <hi>third Order of St.</hi> Francis, who thought that it was not lawful for them to possess any thing whatever, who called the Pope Antichrist, because he suffered the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of St. <hi>Francis</hi> to possess Riches, and who suffer'd themselves to be burned ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to retract these Fantastick Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. There is also the Condemnation of divers Manicheans. And the proceeding against <hi>Peter Ruffit,</hi> who quite to overthrow Concupiscence, had with a Woman the same commerce, as some Priests had with Young Women in the time of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> a Custom which lasted so long, that the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> condemned it. As being us'd in the beginning o'th' fourth Age, and that St. <hi>Basil,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> employ'd all their Eloquence to cure several Ecclesiasticks of this Custom in their time, an exact account hereof may be seen in Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi>'s third Dissertation upon St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>

And it was <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leutherius,</hi> who had the Glory of receiving into the Christian Faith <hi>Lucius</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with all his Kingdom: and that there were Bishops so well established from that time, that ten years before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> held in 325. three English Bishops assisted at the Council of <hi>Arles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After having proved the establishment of Bishops by the Apostles, <hi>Vsher</hi> examines the origine of the Metropolitans to whom he gives the same Antiquity. For suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing as we have said, that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>seven Angels</hi> understands nothing else but <hi>Bishops,</hi> he extends his conjecture so far as to say, that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>to the seven Churches of</hi> Asia without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting them more particularly, it necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, that they had some Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and that they were distinguished by themselves; that is to say, by their quality of <hi>Metropolis.</hi> He confirms it by this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, that the Prefects of the Romans resided in these Cities as Capitals, and that the Adjacent Cities came for Justice thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whence he concludes, that they were as Mothers to the other Churches. He concludes in shewing it to be the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and proceeds to the second part of his Work, which treats of the <hi>Proconsulary</hi> or <hi>Lydian Asia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He observeth, that the Name of <hi>Asia</hi> properly belonged to <hi>Lydia,</hi> for they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that <hi>Asia</hi> was the Name of an ancient King of the <hi>Lydians</hi>; and that it was <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> that made a Proconsulary Province on't. After that these three Questions are resolved. The first if at the time of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> all the Bishops were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the three Patriarchs of <hi>Rome, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> and <hi>Antioch.</hi> It's proved by the very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and by the first Council of <hi>Constantinople</hi> assembled under <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Great, that each Patriarch had Power no farther than the extent of his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, and over the Bishops of his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Province. And to inform us, where the Patriarchats were limited, he saith that, that o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Alexandria</hi> comprised <hi>Egypt, Lybia</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis</hi>; but that <hi>Africk, Thebes,</hi> nor the <hi>Mareotides</hi> were not subjected to it. That of <hi>Antioch</hi> had not the whole Empire of the <hi>East,</hi> whereof <hi>Constantinople</hi> was the <hi>Capital.</hi> But only all that extended from the Mediterranean Sea towards the <hi>East,</hi> to the Frontiers of the Empire. That of <hi>Rome</hi> contained ten Provinces. The Islands of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily, Corse</hi> and <hi>Sardinia</hi> were three of them, and the Continent of <hi>Italy</hi> on the East-side made the other seven, that the ancient Lawyers called <hi>Suburbicaries.</hi> But not to leave the work imperfect, upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he examines in what dependance the Churches were, who set up no Patriarchs. To this purpose he observes, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire was divided into thirteen Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses, seven on the East-side, and six on the West-side, in all 120. Provinces. Each Diocess had a Metropolis, where the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> resided as well as the <hi>Praetor</hi> or <hi>Vicar,</hi> who decided appeals in Civil Affairs, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so each Province had it's Metropolis. It will not be useless to add, that tho' Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates had the same Authority as the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, they preceded them notwithstanding in Councils; and that <hi>Rome, Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antiochia</hi> were honoured with this dignity, which gave them the Preference, because they were the three chief Cities of the World.</p>
                     <p>The second Question is, whether the Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> was subject to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Alexandria</hi>; and answer is made, that he was subject to neither, because he was a Prima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e himself of one of the thirteen Dioceses, whereof we have spoken.</p>
                     <p>As to Jurisdiction, he saith, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canons of the Councils, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the differences amongst Ecclesiasticks, and all that concerned the Clergy was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be carried before the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan, and by an appeal before the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate without acknowledging the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of the Patriarchs. That which makes the difficulty is, that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> said that St. <hi>Cicilian</hi> in his difference with <hi>Donatus,</hi> appeals to the Bishops beyond Sea. But answer is made, that that ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the Council, and not of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Bishop, as that of <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>The third Question is, an enquiry whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no <hi>England</hi> ever depended on the Patriarch of <hi>Rome</hi>; and its decided in the Negative. It had it's Primate, who was the Bishop of <hi>York.</hi> For although <hi>London</hi> according to the Relation of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> was already famous through commerce, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the City of <hi>York</hi> was the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, the Vicar of the Empire resided there, and the Emperor <hi>Constance,</hi> Father of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Great died there.</p>
                     <p>If the Gallican Church hath it's Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the English Church is not wanting;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103507:38"/>
this is examined in a Treatise, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth those we have already spoken of, but 'tis not <hi>Vshers.</hi> The Author establisheth for a Foundation, that under the ancient Law, the Priesthood and Royalty was joyned together; and that when they were separated, the whole Authority always remained in the Person of the Prince. Which is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the example of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>Abiathar</hi> to perform the Function of High Priest, and by other Examples inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the request that was presented to King <hi>Philip the Fair,</hi> by all his Subjects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the enterprizes of <hi>Pope Boniface</hi> VIII. And he thence concludes, that the outward Policy of the Church belonged always to the Prince, and that it's he alone, who hath the power to convocate Councils, and in particular by that of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which were assembled by the Authority of the Emperours, and confirmed by <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi> For tho' the Intrinsick Authority depended on the Word of God, the Extrinsick never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless depended on the Imperial Seal, to give them the force of publick Law.</p>
                     <p>From whence he infers, Patriarchs were not erected but by the <hi>Councils</hi> and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Emperours</hi>; and chiefly that of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Author evidently demonstrates, this dignity was not attributed to it, but by the respect that the Fathers and Councils had for the Capital of the <hi>Vniverse</hi>; which was adorned with the Senate and Empire. To convince these who are most prejudic'd in favour of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; we shall relate but the terms of the last Council save one. The Canon of the Council of <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as it is to be seen in the Manuscripts of the Libraries of M. <hi>de Thou,</hi> and M. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stel.</hi> He says, that the Priviledges of <hi>Rome</hi> were granted by the Fathers, because it was the <hi>Mistris</hi> of the World; <hi>Quod urbs illa imperarèt.</hi> Neither by Divine, nor Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Institution, as he observes, but a motive purely Temporal. Therefore also the same Canon grants to <hi>Constantinople new Rome</hi>; the first rank after <hi>old Rome</hi> for the same reasons, because it was also honoured by the Senate and Imperial Throne.</p>
                     <p>After that, the Author descends to the Priviledges of the English Church; and maintains it did not depend on the Roman Patriarch, because it was a different Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and that it was not in the number of the Suburbicary Provinces. This Verse only is a proof on't.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Ad penitùs toto divisos orbe Britannos.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>It's also further justified by this particular circumstance, that the English celebrated the Passover, according to the Custom of the <hi>East,</hi> and conformed not to the <hi>West.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus prepared the Mind, he shews that the Order of Parliament under <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. who shook off the Popes Yoak was not a new Law, but the re-establishment of the Ancient Laws, and Maxims of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> who have maintained in all Ages, that the Excommunications of the Pope were void in <hi>England</hi>; and he brings many Examples to prove it. He thence draws this Consequence, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> cannot be aspers'd with the odious term of <hi>Schismatick</hi>; because it hath not raised <hi>Altar against Altar</hi>; that it hath kept it's Ancient Government, and can shew a Succession of Bishops not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted since the beginning of Christianity; and consequently it had sufficient Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to reform it self.</p>
                     <p>There is added to these Treatises, the advice of <hi>Iohn Barnesius</hi> a <hi>Benedictine Monk.</hi> Who much disapproved these flatterers of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have incens'd the Minds of men, in maintaining that the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> owes any homage to the Holy See, and have caused this breach with the Pope. He saith, it would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happy, if the Pope for the good of Peace, would again receive into his Communion the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> without rendering it dependant on him, until a Council may cure the evil. But the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lets go its hold, and it's long since that Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth answered to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of <hi>Barnesius.</hi> For the Embassadors of <hi>England</hi> under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> asking him Absolution in the Name of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he omitted not to demand of them if he might send an Exactor of the Tribute of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> declaring unto them that they should not expect this Apostle should open them the Gate of Heaven, whilst they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Patrimony upon Earth. <hi>Barnesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> confesseth it's very hard to be submitted to the Pope, who when he pleaseth Arms the Subjects against their King; and adds, that the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving declared those Hereticks, who hold that <hi>the Pope was not Inferiour to General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> the Modern Popes are in the Case of Excommunication declared by these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. This he saith, not to quarrel with his Holiness, but humbly to insinuate unto him the means of bringing back so fine a Kingdom into the bosom of the Church. Notwithstanding the good Intentions of this poor Monk, have been very ill acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; for he was sent out of <hi>Paris,</hi> strip'd of his habit, tied like a fierce beast, and uncompassionately dragg'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there cast into the dark Dungeon of the Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where he miserably expired.</p>

He shews that the Original of the Latine must be sought in a Dialect of the Greek Tongue, because that the Greeks inhabited a part of <hi>Italy,</hi> as well as the Neighbouring Isles, from whence 'tis called <hi>Magna Graecia,</hi> very near that which he calls the <hi>Kingdom of Naples.</hi> They formerly divided all the People that spoke Greek in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ionians</hi> and <hi>Dorians,</hi> which were the two Principal Dialects.

But as the Roman Law suffered Women to repudiate their Husbands, so it came to pass that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast Women changed them too often; witness this passage of <hi>Seneca</hi> cited by our Author: <hi>Illustres quaedam ac Nobiles Faeminae non Consulum numero, sed Maritorum, annos su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os computant, &amp; exeunt Matrimonii causa, nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt Repudii.</hi>

                        <hi>Salmatius.</hi> I have run through the book of <hi>Salmatius</hi> upon <hi>Simplicius.</hi> There is, as you say, much reading. I wonder he disposeth not his thoughts in a better order. 'Tis some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times difficult to reconcile him to himself; he often disputes about words, &amp;c.

                     <p>A great friend of <hi>Salmatius,</hi> hath told me a little while since, that a Book could not easily be made <hi>de lingua Hellenistica Redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viva,</hi> drawn from this, that he saith he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to confess in many places that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the thing, and disputes but of the Name. He saith that no body hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd that <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Daniel Heinsius,</hi> I have read the Works of <hi>Heinsius</hi> upon <hi>Nonnus,</hi> which was not worth my while, for others have said several things which he remarks upon <hi>Iohn.</hi> I find that speaking of the Trinity he contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in many places, as it happens to those who would know too much upon this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>In the same</hi> Let. 149. there are many things which are not to be despis'd in the book of <hi>Heinsius,</hi> but he hath not drawn a few thereof out of the Epistles of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and the Works of <hi>Peucerus,</hi> of <hi>Fuller</hi> and <hi>Selden,</hi> without naming them. The more I consider him, the more I find that those who would know more concerning the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity than Scripture tells us, are punished for their pride. The desire they have of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting others, makes them to contradict themselves. See only <hi>p.</hi> 272. He calleth practice [<gap reason="foreign">

After that he saith that Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in Trinity is really distinct, and the proprieties of the Persons, only according to our manner of conceiving, &amp;c. Let. 152. <hi>Grotius</hi> censures such like absurdities in his Letters 156. and 157.</p>

He doth not seem to me so haughty, as he appear'd in a little book which he had sometime since publish'd, yet he shews a great boldness therein. A sensible proof of this is, that he often blots out and changes words in the antient Writings, without following any Manuscript but his conjectures only. He hath also much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to reprehend others, and when it's any that's still living, 'tis the more easily to be suffered, but he often accuseth <hi>Caesar, Strabo,</hi> and, several other excellent Authors, of great Ignorance, &amp;c. to <hi>Isaack Pontanus,</hi> Let. 11. <hi>P.</hi> 2.</p>

He applyes himself to the opinions of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers, and speaks not of the Scholasticks. He distinguisheth the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets defined by the Church, from those up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it is permitted to say what we will. He expounds-them all very well; his Books are extream useful. <hi>Salmatius</hi> is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therein, and it's said it was he who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himself <hi>Wallo Messalinus.</hi> But I could not but laugh to see him call <hi>Conrad Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius Calvinist,</hi> Let. 678. <hi>p.</hi> 2.</p>

                           </gap>r of the Sorbon.</hi> All the World knows that <hi>Grotius</hi> was very far from the opinions of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> upon <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination,</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> but this hath not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Grotius</hi> from giving him the praises he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103507:40"/>
deserves. This he saith of his book of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Communion.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud will have publick penitence re-established in regard to the publick sins, &amp; that those who shall make their sins known but by their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Confession to the Priest, abstain from the Communion, untill they are assured that they are amended in it. This book was approved by five Archbishops, thirteen Bishops, and one and twenty Doctors; some have already introduced this Custom into their Churches. For it is lawful for Bishops to bring again into use the antient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, even by the Authority, of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>&amp; by the example of Cardinal</hi> Berronius <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Milan, <hi>who hath been Canonized.</hi> Let. 669. p. 2. to William Grotius. <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise your Stationers,</hi> saith he, in the 671. Letter, <hi>to send for the book of the frequent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and to get it Printed anew. You will do thereby a good service to Christianity.</hi> And elsewhere: <hi>They make it a crime in him for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving said in what he has written against a Iesuit, that he believes those who feel in themselves their ancient inclinations to vice, do not ill to abstain from Communion; and that he judgeth that even those who are given but to venial sins, do not amiss to abstain, and other such like things. The antient severity, which we are no more able to suffer, as one saith, annoy'd him.</hi> Nocuit antiquus rigor, cui jam pares non sumus, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t ille. <hi>The Prince of</hi> Conde <hi>(for he hath also Written upon this matter, but without adding his name) thinks it's believ'd hitherto, that if any one hath confessed his sins, is in the resolution of never more returning to 'em, and to undergo the penitence that will be imposed on him, he may morally be assured that he is in a State of Grace, and that he doth well to Communicate. The Queen demanded the judgment of the</hi> Sorbon <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these matters. The Parliament and</hi> Sorbon <hi>think it is against the Laws, that a Subject of the King should be constrained to quit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, especially the Abbot</hi> Dubyse (Dubysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um) <hi>who going to</hi> Rome <hi>to justifie himself, was immediately put into prison. Therefore Mr.</hi> Arnaud, <hi>being a Man of so good a life, that his greatest enemies could find nothing to say against him. being thirty six years old, and submitting himself to the judgment of the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>to the Catholick Bishops, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the Archbishop of</hi> Paris <hi>and the</hi> Sorbon, <hi>as you may see by what I have sent you, we may judge here of his affair, adding to these Iudges those which the</hi> Pope <hi>hath Commissioned for that purpose. For my part, as I favour those who would reestablish the antient satisfaction, I see that the most part of those who favour Mr.</hi> Arnaud <hi>are</hi> Jansenists, <hi>to wit,</hi> Calvinists <hi>upon matters of Predestination.</hi> Thus it is that <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> speaks to his Brother in a Letter dated the 9th. of <hi>April,</hi> 1644.</p>

                        <hi>Peter Hoofet.</hi> I have begun to read the History of <hi>Hoofet,</hi> 'tis a fine work, his expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions after the antient manners of speaking will not please others. But <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Salust</hi> have given him the example, as well as <hi>Tacitus</hi> who lived a great while after them, Let. 636. 2. <hi>p.</hi> He also praises the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great Writ in <hi>Dutch</hi> by the same Author.</p>

                        <hi>Iustus Vondel.</hi> This famous <hi>Flemish</hi> Poet published in 1638. a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted once a year at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> entituled <hi>Gishrecht van Amstel.</hi> He dedicated it to <hi>Grotius,</hi> who makes this judgment thereof in a Letter to <hi>Vossius</hi> the 28th. of <hi>May</hi> the same year: <hi>Vondel</hi> did me a kindness in dedicating unto me (as to a man who hath some gust of these sort of things) a Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whose subject is noble, whose order is excellent, and expression fine, &amp;c. It is a folly not to have in a subject of 300 years, the customs of that time represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus it is that those of <hi>Geneva</hi> in a <hi>French</hi> Edition of <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi> have observ'd every where, where the Author saith that the King heard Mass, that he was at the Lords Supper.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. These are the chief things of the Criticks, which are in the Epistles of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> We shall observe in short the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological matters before our Author was put in Prison, being still in possesion of his Employments, he Writ several Letters touching the Controversies of Grace and Predestination, which then were maintain'd with much heat, and which was the occassion of his ruine.</p>
                     <p>In Letter 31. <hi>p.</hi> 1. He quotes some words of St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> whom he saith 'tis hard ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely to excuse of Semipelagianism, as well as St. <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> He endeavoureth notwithstanding, to give a favourable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thereof. Here is one of these pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> drawn from his third book against the <hi>Pelagians: Vbi misericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia Dei &amp; Gratia, ex parte cessat arbitrium, quod in eo tantum est ut velimus &amp; cupiamus, &amp; placitis tribuamus assensum. Iam in Domini potestate est ut id quod cupimus, quod laboramus ac nitimur, illius ope &amp; auxilio implere valeamus. Grotius</hi> saith, that perhaps St. <hi>Ierome</hi> and the other Fathers, who speak thus have call'd <hi>Grace,</hi> but that which renders us holy and acceptable unto God, and not that which excites us to do well, and which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the first motions of our will. He speaks more of this <hi>preventing Grace</hi> in the 31, 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34, and 62. Let.</p>
                     <p>He treats in Epistle 62. and 31. of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, and he maintains that on this occasion we ought not to prefer the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> to that of all the Fathers who lived afore him in the purer Ages of the Church, and such as were also troubled with disputes. But he clearly maintains that all these Fathers rejected absolute Predestination, and maintain'd that God hath predestinated to Salvation, those only whom he foresaw would make good use of his Graces, and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath resolved to Damn those only whom he foresaw would continue impenitent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the formal Concession of <hi>Prosper</hi> Disciple to St. <hi>Augustin. Retractatis priorum de hac re opinionibus paene omnium par invenitur &amp; una sententia, qua propositum, &amp; praedesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationem Dei secundum praesentiam receperunt.</hi> He cites upon this occasion divers passages of <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and several others. But these things may be seen
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103507:41"/>
treated on more at large in the <hi>Pelagian Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Vossius,</hi> which our Author appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth of in several places of his Letters.</p>
                     <p>Moreover he treats of Liberty, Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality, and Sufficiency of Grace, of Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and of the certainty of Salvation in Letter 62. But as he speaks of these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matters only by the by, to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend well the sentiment of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants, which he maintains thro' the whole, we should read in those amongst their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours who have treated thereof <hi>ex professo,</hi> as <hi>Episcopius, de Courcelles, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grotius</hi> seems to have believed in his Youth that the Socinians were far from deserving the name of Christians, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited not barely to be called Hereticks, as appears by a Letter Written in 1611. to <hi>Anthony Walaeus.</hi> But afterwards he was of another mind on this occasion, tho' he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways protested that he was not of their opinions touching the Divinity and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Jesus Christ. He cou'd not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hinder his being suspected of having too much inclination to their opinions, tho' he took great care to Write the contrary to his Friends. See Letters 880, 883, 1035. <hi>P.</hi> 1.411.456. <hi>P.</hi> 2. He assures us in this last Letter, that after having had some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations with <hi>Ruarus,</hi> this Unitarian had in fine answered him upon the Article of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, so that there scarcely remain'd any Controversie amongst them. <hi>Alios quosdam,</hi> adds he afterwards, <hi>qui in illo caetu fuerunt, plene ad meam perduxi sententiam.</hi> This may be seen in their Confession of Faith, and in the Apology which they made about it a little after. This renders one thing credible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough which <hi>Grotius</hi> saith in the same Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he had learned of <hi>Bisterfeldius</hi> and of some others, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Crellius</hi> said on his death-bed that <hi>he would never have undertook to Write against</hi> his book <hi>of the satisfaction of Iesus Christ, if we had read what</hi> Grotius <hi>had remarked in his Book</hi> de jure Belli ac Pacis, <hi>concerning the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Punishments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The same thing happened to our Author in respect to the Roman Catholicks, as it did in regard to Socinianism. As he grew mild concerning the opinion of the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which was the cause why his Enemies accused him of being an Unitarian, so he growing more moderate in regard to the Roman Catholicks, he was accused of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Communion. It may be seen by some Letters Written in his Youth, that he had the same sentiments of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church as the generality of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, tho' he was then more moderate than several Reformed Divines. See his Letters 14. and 15. of the 1. <hi>p.</hi> and the 15th. of the 2. <hi>p.</hi> There is also a Letter from <hi>Paris</hi> of the 7th. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1622. wherein he exhorts <hi>Episcopius</hi> to refute the grounds of the followers of <hi>Cassander,</hi> who maintain that those who disapprove most of the errors of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, ought not for that to separate themselves from it's Communion. He saith that we ought principally to examine two questions against these Gentlemen: the first is, to know if an action permitted of it self, such as is genuflection in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, becomes unlawful by the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which those give it who govern the Church, that this action hath Jesus Christ for an Object present under the accidents of Bread, or even the visible Signs: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to know if it be lawful for one to joyn with an Assembly, whose Pastours maintain certain Tenets which are disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, are necessary to enter into their Communion; tho' they exact not of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars a distinct profession. But <hi>Grotius</hi> believeth, that it's needless to prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these Gentlemen, that the Pope hath not the whole Authority which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> attributes to him, because they do agree therein. He saith that they bow not their knee before the Images; that they shun the Processions wherein the Eucharist is carried; that they hold the belief of the Invocation of Saints, and that of Purgatory, as Opinions that are unnecessary; as they do not hold themselves obliged to embrace the definitions of the Latin Church, and that they place the force which is used to make them to be received, in the Rank of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions which good Men ought to suffer, as well as the denying of the Cup.</p>
                     <p>It seems that in process of time the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence which <hi>Grotius</hi> had with some of those whom he calls <hi>Cassandrians,</hi> made him almost of their Opinions, as may be seen by the notes upon the Consultation of <hi>Cassander,</hi> and the other books which he published, touching the means of reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting Religious. He testifies in many places of these Letters that he desired passionately the Reunion of Protestants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, and of Protestants with Roman Catholicks. But it appears also that when he reflected upon the difficulties of reuniting, which are already, and upon those w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> arise every day, he look'd upon the Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as a thing which ought to be wished for, but of which there is but little hopes. Thus it is that he speaks in several places. In the first part may be seen Letters 422.426.519.649.976. Where he complains particularly of the new Institution of the <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                           <hi>a Monks dress worn over their faces.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Scapular,</hi> and of the books of the Office of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, which he looks upon as obstacles to peace. This is what makes him speak thus to his Brother <hi>William Grotius</hi> in a letter of the 21. of <hi>February</hi> 1625. <hi>Hoc voti magis est quàm spei, praesertim cum Romae M.

wishes than his hopes: so it appears by the Letters 534. and 637. of the 2. <hi>p.</hi> that he flattered himself that in time the Roman Church might relinquish several of its Tenets, and correct several abuses whereof the most understanding persons of that Communion complain every day. He ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped nevertheless to see it, but this Idea flattered him so pleasantly, that he could not but say,

                     <p>What he had written in his youth was objected against him, as contrary to what he maintained towards the end of his life. But first he saith, that if all this be examined there will no contradiction be found in it, and he adds in the second place, that if by a more advantage, by the conversation of the Learned, and by much Reading, his judgment is become more solid, he ought no more to be accused of inconstancy than St. <hi>Augustin</hi> who retracted in his old age, several things which he had advanced in the first books he published. <hi>P.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 647.</p>
                     <p>Besides these matters of Divinity which respect Controversie some Questions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality are found in these Letters, which are not of a less importance; for example, What rule men should keep in the estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things which are exchanged and sold, and in the Interest which can be demanded for ones money? <hi>l.</hi> 953. <hi>p.</hi> 1.

                     <p>One <hi>Nicholas de Bye</hi> of the Society of the Menonites, which <hi>Grotius</hi> calls <hi>genus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum non malum,</hi> had sent him a great let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by which he endeavoured to prove that it was prohibited to Christians to make War, &amp; to punish with Death. <hi>Grotius</hi> answers to that several things in the Letters 545 and 546. of the 2d. <hi>P.</hi> which may be added to what he hath said upon these matters in his book <hi>de Iure Pacis ac Belli.</hi>

                     <head>An Extract of the Letters of <hi>Grotius,</hi> II. <hi>Part,</hi> Treating upon <hi>Law, History,</hi> and Politicks.</head>
                     <p>WE have run thro' the <hi>Criticks</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> in the Letters of the famous <hi>Grotius.</hi> It remains that we should make an extract of the matters concerning <hi>Law, History</hi> and <hi>Politicks.</hi> Tho' he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes not to treat throughly on this subject, there are nevertheless several places which may contribute much to the understanding of divers hard questions in the Law. Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and in the Government of States.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The famous question concerning the Domination of the Sea may be referred to Law, which hath been so often agitated in the North. There was at the beginning of this Age a dispute between the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> concerning the fishing for Whales. Commissaries were named on both sides, to regulate this difference. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was one of the Commissaries of the Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> and he relates the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of the Conference which they had with the <hi>English</hi> Commissaries in his Letter 56. 1. <hi>p.</hi> He saith they silenced the <hi>English,</hi> and made it appear that neither the Country of <hi>Greenland,</hi> nor the Sea belonged to them, and that the <hi>Dutch</hi> could not lose the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their Navigation, nor of fishing for Whales, whereof none had any right to claim the Propriety to himself. We clearly shewed, saith he, that the Land belonged not to them, seeing before the year 1596. no body had gone to it, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> discovered it, and gave it the Name which it hath yet, as is evident in all the modern Geographers Spheers, and Mapps. They would fain have persuaded us that <hi>Hugh Willoughby</hi> discovered it in 1553. But we prove by the very Journal of this Voyager, that he being parted from <hi>Finland,</hi> took Anchor at the Isle of that Name, which is very far from <hi>Greenland</hi>; that he in fine died with Cold and Hunger, with all his Companions, upon the Coasts of <hi>Lapland,</hi> where some <hi>Laponians</hi> found them the next Summer, and whence their journals were carried into <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> could answer nothing to all this, only that there had been much wrong done to their master to contest a Right with him, which he had till then pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably possess'd.</p>
                     <p>In the letter 15. <hi>P.</hi> 2. He treats of this question, to wit. <hi>Whether a Lord of</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>might yield something touching the Rights of Navigation and Commerce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Consent of the States.</hi> He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains he cannot, because the Lords of <hi>Holland</hi> were but the Guardians of the Rights of the People, without being able to Alienate them, as he says may be shewn easily by the Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Upon this occasion, he saith that <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was a free Countrey, even under its Lords, and that this liberty began not when the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was declared a Receder from his, Rights or when a Truce was made with him. <hi>Grotius</hi> brings some reasons for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103507:42"/>
this, which may be read in the Original.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grotius</hi> had written in 1615 to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador of the States at the Court of <hi>France,</hi> touching the Controversies which were in agitation at that time in <hi>Holland,</hi> and his Letter was shewn to <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> as then Minister of <hi>Charenton,</hi> who had made some Reflections upon this Letter, which were sent to <hi>Grotius.</hi> This gave him occasion to write to the same Ambassador the 62 Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the 1. <hi>p.</hi> Where he treats of some of these Controversies, and amongst others those which respect the Authority of the Magistrate in Ecclesiastical things. It seems by what <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, that <hi>du Moulin</hi> should believe that a Magistrate ought to be Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have some Authority in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal things. <hi>Grotius</hi> refutes this thought. He applyes himself again to shew, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Prince depends not on the truth of his opinions in matters of Religion. He brings the words of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>ad Vincentium: Reges cum in errore sunt pro ipso errore leges contra veritatem ferunt, cum in veritate sunt, similiter contra errorem pro ipsa veritate decernunt.</hi> He cites besides, the example of the Emperor <hi>Aurelian,</hi> who, at the prayer of the Christians, drove from his Bishoprick <hi>Paul de Samosate,</hi> who would not submit himself to the Authority of the Councils, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> had condemned his Doctrine. <hi>Grotius</hi> saith several things upon the Power of Princes, in the regulating of Controversies which arise in matter of Religion. But he hath treated on all this more fully in his Book <hi>de Imperio summarum Potestatum circa sacra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We find in the Letter 329. the solution of another question which belongs to the Canon Law. It was to know <hi>if the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to whom the Pope permitted to Preach and Confess, can do it without consulting the Bishops, and without asking their Permission.</hi> Mr. <hi>de S. Cyran</hi> under the Name of <hi>Petrus Aurelius</hi> maintain'd they could not, and the Jesuites pretended that these priviledged Fryars needed no permission from the Bishops. Mr. <hi>des Cordes</hi> Canon of <hi>Limoge</hi> and a great friend to <hi>Grotius,</hi> had demanded of him his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereupon. He answers that the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Mr. <hi>de S. Cyran</hi> was certainly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and that even where these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions are received, they ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted in such wise that they make the least prejudice to the Canons and received Uses. But he adds that he cannot tell how Mr. <hi>de S. Cyran,</hi> as well as the Jesuits, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the Pope an almost absolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, can maintain that he has not the power to do what Bishops do every day, to wit, to give the permission of Preaching and Confessing. He saith that in giving the Pope the power that is given him, they ought to fall into the same inconveniency wherein the Romans were under an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who would have all the questions of Law to be sent to his Oracle.</p>
                     <p>In Letter 693. directed to a Polish Lord, who had asked him his opinion concerning Torments, he answers that there is nothing less certain than a Confession extorted by Torments, upon which he cites this word of an ancient: <hi>mentietur quiferre non potuerit, mentietur qui ferre potuerit.</hi> I have (saith he) infinite examples of People who were unjustly put to Death, upon so uncertain a foundation. I do not wonder that there have been grave persons who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that Christians should not make use of Torments to extort Confessions, seeing it's certain there is no such thing in the Law of Moses: That in <hi>England</hi> Men live in as great security as any where, tho' Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not in use there, and that whilst <hi>Rome</hi> conserv'd it's Liberty the Citizens were never tortured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>William Grotius</hi> had made some questions to his Brother concerning the publick Law, upon which occasion our Author shews in his Letter 4. <hi>P.</hi> 2. the difference which is betwixt particular and publick Laws, and sheweth that they are equally founded upon Nature, the Law of Nations, and the Civil Law. He treats afterwards on this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>If natural Right can suffer some change</hi>? He divides this Law into divers branches, and shews in what sense there may happen some change. He also treats on the same matter in Letter 6. It had been it seems objected against him that the Civil Laws do sometimes alter the Law of Nature, when they make void all the promises that a Pupil might make without the consent of his Guardian, seeing he violates this Right of the Law of Nature, <hi>that one must keep his promises. Grotius</hi> shews how Civil Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees herein with the Law of Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ure, and also expounds some like cases; as if a Pupil having borrow'd without the consent of his Tutour, and being become rich by this bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing, whether he is oblig'd to pay? <hi>Grotius</hi> answers, that although by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Civil Law of the <hi>Romans,</hi> a Creditor could not have an action against a Pupil, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the Pupil is bound to pay by the Law of Nature, whereof here is an inviolable Law: <hi>That none ought to enrich himself with the damage of another.</hi> He cites divers Laws upon this subject.</p>
                     <p>He treats in Letter 4. of the same Part, <hi>of Servitudes,</hi> and sheweth that it is a Right esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Men against Liberty and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Freedom. He expounds the Law <hi>in fine ff. de aqua,</hi> where it is said that the low possessions have commonly this Servitude, that they receive their waters which run from those that are highest. In Letter 12. He speaks fully enough of Conventions in general, and of Stipulations in particular. He shews that the Law of Nature necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obligeth one to keep his word, whence several Philosophers have given the name of <hi>Truth</hi> to justice, and <hi>Simonides</hi> said that Justice consisted in speaking the truth, and in giving what one hath received; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Theophrastus</hi> were of opinion that no body ought to have the power of forcing any one to keep his word by virtue of the Laws, but that it should be free not to keep it, as it is free not to be generous. But this Philosophy, saith our
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103507:42"/>
Author, agrees not with our Age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few Folks are virtuous by their own motion, without the fear of Laws. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters after that, upon a great Question, to wit, how Civil Law can derogate from the Law of Nature, in matters of agreement and promises? He expounds in a few words in what manner the Roman Laws have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, from those who submitted themselves thereto, the Liberty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising certain things, so that on these oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions they have rendered contracts void, as well as when they were not extorted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner which these Laws prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. He shews that the Laws have not in all that, injured the Law of Nature.</p>
                     <p>We find besides in Letter 352. <hi>p.</hi> 2. The examination of this Question: <hi>Vtrum voluntas testatoris coram septem testibus ad id convocatis declarata, nolle se Testamentum an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te factum valere, habenda sit pro Testamento ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li quale esset, si haeredes ab intestato instituisset disertè?</hi> Grotius answers yes, and that it is thus he understands those terms, <hi>Voluitque intestato decedere in l.</hi> 1. §. <hi>Si haeres. D. si tabulae Testamenti nullae extabunt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>Grotius</hi> hath also by the by spoken of some other Questions of Law, which are not necessary to be related here. We shall pass to what is Historical in his Letters, whereof one part belongs to ancient Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Profane or Ecclesiastical; and the other to the History of his Time, or of his own Adventures. We shall in a few words ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, what's most curious upon these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>We have already noted, that there is in a Letter to Mr. <hi>de Pieresc,</hi> the Life of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> of <hi>Damascus.</hi> There is no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane History but this, except some allusion by the by, to some fact which he relates not, as Letter 399. <hi>p</hi> 2. One of the finest works, saith he, of <hi>Parrhasius</hi> is written in <hi>Pliny.</hi> He represented the People of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> after a very ingenious manner. He would represent a People Cholerick, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, Inconstant, and at the same time easie to be perswaded, Merciful, Clement, Proud, Cowardly, Fierce and Timorous. He pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the figure of a man, much as I would have the Republick of <hi>Holland,</hi> or that of the United Provinces, to be represented by a Virgin. I would have a Virgin to be painted, who hath yet her Virginity, but who makes it known, that it is burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to her.</p>
                     <p>In the Letter 122. <hi>p.</hi> 1. He remarks the Oaths that the ancient Jews were accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make use of, but in things of small consequence, they believed one should not swear by Divinity it self, but by ones Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, by the Earth, by the Stars, by Heaven, or by the Universe. It's apparent in the beginning of the Book of <hi>Philo,</hi> intituled <hi>de specialibus legibus.</hi> Which serves much, according to the Judgment of <hi>Grotius,</hi> to clear what Jesus Christ saith of Oaths, in <hi>ch.</hi> v. of St. <hi>Mat.</hi> Where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibites us to swear <hi>at all,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) to wit, after any manner which the Jews swear. He makes besides, some other remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place of the Gospel, but as he most enlarged upon this matter in his Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it's better to send the Reader to them, and to take notice of another thing which is in his Letters touching the Jews. He saith, that since the Jews were banished from their Countrey, and dispersed amongst Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who hate them, they are more expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to calumny, and that we ought not slightly to believe the evil which we may hear of them; that notwithstanding he would not always answer for their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, seeing they believe it is lawful to curse Christians, as appears by the <hi>Thalmud,</hi> and by other Books. They are not satisfied with words, they proceed to effects, when they think themselves strong enough for it. You may see, adds he, in the History of <hi>Dion,</hi> what the Jews of <hi>Cyrene</hi> have done in times past; and in <hi>Sozomen</hi> l.vii. c. 13. and <hi>Socrates</hi> l.vii. c. 17. what the Jews did who lived between <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och. Nicephorus</hi> passeth for an Author, on whom one cannot well rely. It's not amiss however to hear what he saith of the Jews of <hi>Arabia, Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> l.xvii. c 6. &amp; 24. l.xviii. 44. because, what he saith, is upheld by the Testimony of <hi>Paul the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> l.xviii. and by <hi>Zonaras</hi> in the Life of <hi>Phocas. Polydor Virgil</hi> assures in <hi>l.</hi>xvi. of his History, that they were banished from <hi>England,</hi> because a cruel design was discovered which they had formed. <hi>Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phius, Thomas Barbartensis</hi> in his <hi>Fortalitium fidei, Michael Neander</hi> in his <hi>Erotemata lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guae sanctae,</hi> accuses them of having killed Children, and gather'd their Blood for he knew not what uses at <hi>Munster, Zurich, Berne,</hi> at <hi>Weessensch,</hi> in <hi>Turing,</hi> at <hi>Vber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingue</hi> near <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> at <hi>Dieffenhof,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellicus</hi> affirms the same thing of the Jews of <hi>Trent,</hi> l.viii. Ennead. x. <hi>Bonfinius</hi> saith as as much of those of <hi>Tirnave</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> l.iv. Dec. v. For to say nothing of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick and Superstitious uses which may be made thereof, the Blood of Infants being a remedy against Leprosie, whereof several Princes have been accused to have made use; Jewish Physitians might have easily undertaken to make a trial of it, because of the hatred which they bore to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when they believed they had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to fear the Laws. It's then visible, 'tis a long time since this crime was imputed to them true or false, <hi>Let.</hi> 693. p. 1.</p>
                     <p>There is another observation touching a Sect of the ancient Jews, wherein perhaps more likelihood of Truth will be found. The most exact Chronologists, according to <hi>Grotius,</hi> say that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> lived towards the end of the Empire of <hi>Cyrus. Numeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Porphyrius</hi> and <hi>Hermippus</hi> followers of this Philosopher say, he was in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and that he followed in several things the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Jews. If we seek, what Sect of the Jews might have served for a model to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> none will be found, upon whom this suspition may fall, but that of the <hi>Esseans.</hi> There was nothing more alike
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103507:43"/>
than the Assemblies of these Jews, and the common Auditories of the Pythagoreans, such as <hi>Porphyrius, Iamblicus, Herocles</hi> and others describe. In effect <hi>Iosephus</hi> says, that the manner of living of the <hi>Esseans</hi> and <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> was the same. If <hi>Iosephus</hi> speaks of the <hi>Esseans,</hi> only in remarking what happened under <hi>Ianathas,</hi> an <hi>Asmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi> Prince, it was but by the by, and on the occasion of mentioning the <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Phari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ees,</hi> without telling when this first Sect begun. <hi>Grotius</hi> believes, that their Sects were formed upon those of the <hi>Recha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> and <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> Let. 552. <hi>p.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>Speaking of Ecclesiastical History in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, he cryeth out, Let. 22. <hi>p.</hi> 1. What do those read, who read the Ecclesiastical History, but the Vices of Bishops? <hi>Qui Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticam Historiam legit, quid legit nisi E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscoporum vitia?</hi> and elsewhere, upon the occasion of something which <hi>Heinsius</hi> said of the Trinity, he remarks that the Greek and Latin School agree not, after which he adds, <hi>Mihi constat Patres in explicatione ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum rerum plurimum dissensisse, etiamsi vocum quarundam sono inter se conveniant: quae sex re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertae sunt bono affectu, successu non semper op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo.</hi> There arose in 1630. a pretty warm dispute between Mr. <hi>de l' Aubespine,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rigaut,</hi> who had prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some Books of <hi>Tertullian</hi> corrected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some old Mss. touching the sence of a passage of this Author, in his Book, <hi>de Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortatione Casti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>atis.</hi> Mr. <hi>Rigaut</hi> thought <hi>Tertullian</hi> meant, that it was permitted to Laicks to Consecrate, being in places where they cou'd have no Priests. Mr. <hi>de l' Aubespine</hi> upheld, that in this place, he did not speak of the Eucharist, but of what we now call <hi>Blessed-Bread</hi>; because the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> defined, that it belonged to Priests only to consecrate. These are the Words of <hi>Tertullian; Nonne &amp; Laici sacerdotes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus? scriptum est, regnum quoque nos &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotes Deo &amp; Patri suo fecit, Differentiam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordinem &amp; Plebem constituit Ecclesia, &amp; honor per Ordinis consessum Sanctificatus: adeo ubi Ecclesiastici ordinis non est Consessus, &amp;</hi> OFFERS <hi>&amp;</hi> TINGUIS, <hi>&amp; Sacerdos es tibi solus.

We may also see an Abridgment thereof in a Letter to <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matius,</hi> which is 260. of the 1. <hi>p.</hi> where our Author testifies, he was of <hi>Erasmus</hi>'s opinion, to wit, that in the Primitive times the Faithful consecrated the Bread and Wine, and communicated together, there being often no Priest in the Company. See the Letter of <hi>Erasmus</hi> to <hi>Cuthbert Tonstar,</hi> l. xxvi. Epist.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grotius</hi> seems to have much respect for Christian Antiquity, as may be seen by all his works, and by this place of the Letter 191. of the 2. <hi>p. Perhaps those who are of</hi> Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etius<hi>'s opinion will think, it will be a Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism to make the principal part of Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the observation of the precepts of Iesus Christ. But I see that the Christians of the first Ages, the Assemblies, the Doctors, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs have been of this Iudgment, that there are few things which we ought necessarily to know, and that as to the rest God Iudgeth us, according to the obedience we have rendered to him.</hi> The same also appears by a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, that <hi>Grotius</hi> had with the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> in 1639. and whereof he gives an account to Chancellor <hi>Oxenstiern</hi> in Letter 1108. of the 1. <hi>p.</hi> He relates to this Suedish Lord, that the Prince had given him a visit, that they had discoursed of several things, and that this Prince had approved his Opinions; that in this Age one may attribute to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Name of a Christian, and the Surname of Catholick, the Scripture must be believed, interpreted, not according to the particular Judgment of each one, which hath caused Seditions, Schisms, and often Wars, but according to the universal and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual consent of the Ancient Churches; which we find in the Writings of several excellent men, and chiefly in the Symbols and Acts of the true Ecumenick Councils, which were held before the Schism of the Eastern and the Western Churches; and which the Emperors, and all the Churches have approved of: That moreover, we must abstain from calumniating any one, to leave off the Spirit of Parties, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Unity of the Church, such as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ hath ordained, and the Apostles have founded, and to hold for our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to wit, for Christians and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, all those who are in these opinions, although those who rule over the Churches have separated themselves from the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion. <hi>Haec omnia Princeps &amp; si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi dicebat probari, &amp; sapientissimis quos cognos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set hominibus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not that <hi>Grotius</hi> was very much concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the antiquity he believed, as some are, that the Ceremonies which it hath constantly kept to, are all of Divine Right. Thus he speaks to Mr. <hi>des Condés</hi> about Confirmation and Imposition of hands, Let. 329. 1. <hi>p.</hi> I have found by reading, that the imposition of hands was a Jewish Ceremony, which was introduced, not by any Divine Law, but by Custom, every time that any Body prayed God for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the Jews prayed God, that his Power should accompany that Man, as the hands which were put upon his Head, and which were the Symbol of the Divine Power, were united to him. Jesus Christ followed this Custom, as several others of the Synagogue, whether Children were to be Blessed, or the sick were to be Cured, in joining Prayer to this Ceremony. It is according to this Custom, and not conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to any Precept, that the Apostles laid their hands on those to whom they conferred the Gift of the Holy Ghost by Prayer. Thus it was, that not only Priests used the same, when they received any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Body, as it appears by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. iv. 15. But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103507:43"/>
themselves received anew the imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hands, when they engaged into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new design, <hi>Acts</hi> xiii.2. So if at every time, that hands were imposed, a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was conferred, we shall find Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in all the Prayers, which have been made for any one; which is contrary to the true Signification of the word, and to the use of the Ancients.</p>
                     <p>It's from this Ceremony, continueth our Author, which was not ordained by God, but which hath of it self been introduced amongst the Jews and Christians, that sprung the Sacraments of Confirmation, of Ordination, and Penitence, of Extream Unction, and even of Marriage; for the Ancient Churches, laid their hands on those who were Married, as the <hi>Abyssins</hi> this day do.</p>
                     <p>The Baptism of Christians, adds he, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in times past in immersion only, as that of the Jews who baptized all those who embraced their Religion. It appears not that any laid hands on those who were baptized, but those who had the Gift of conferring the Holy Ghost. This hath been introduced rather in honour of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, to persuade the People, that they had succeeded to the Rights of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. In the second Age, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, divers Ceremonies were added to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, by allusion to some passages in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, according to the Custom of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, who expressed themselves not only by Words, but also by Signs and Symbols. It is for that, that they made those who were baptized to tast of Hony and Milk. But it was thought fit to represent particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by these Symbols, that those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jesus Christ receive in their Soul the same Graces which Jesus Christ made the sick feel which he cured, in their Body, or that those who make profession of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him, feel the Eyes of their Soul to open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as the Ears of their Heart, that they are cured of all their spiritual ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, and that the Devil hath no further Power over them. Therefore Exorcisms were made use of, and the term of <hi>Epphata,</hi> be opened, also of Spittle, of Oyl, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Jesus Christ and the Apostles made use of in curing corporal maladies.</p>
                     <p>Posterity was not content with this. 'Twas thought it ought to be made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that Christians are Kings and Priests, in anointing with a more odoriferous oyl. This Unction was joined to Baptism, as it is yet with the Greeks, and as it hath been a long time in the Latin Church. The Priests who baptized, administred it as well as the Bishops, the Bishop according to the Testimony of St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> and St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> differing from the Priest, only in this, that the Bishop had the sole right of Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Priests. Our Author, after having made these Remarks, gives his Sentiment concerning a Canon of a 1. Council of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> which caused then great disputes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Mr. <hi>de S. Cyran,</hi> and <hi>F. Sirmond,</hi> and maintains that the latter had well cited and understood it, tho' his Adversary accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him of falshood. <hi>Grotius</hi> believes, that this Canon gives the Power to Priests to administer the <hi>Chrisme,</hi> and orders that it should be administred but once: <hi>Nullus Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrorum qui baptizandi recepit officium, sine Chrismate unquaem debet progredi, quia inter nos placuit semel Chrismari. Nam inter nos Chrismatis ipsius non nisi una benedictio est. Non ut praejudicans quicquam dico, sed ut ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaria non habeatur Chrismaetio repetita.</hi> But according to him, this hinders not, but that when they use two Chrisms in <hi>Italy,</hi> as it appears by the famous Decretal of Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> who speaks of a Chrism, which Priests as well as Bishops administred in Baptism, and of another which Bishops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone administred in Confirmation: <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, seu extra Episcopum, seu praesente Episcopo baptizant, Chrismate baptizatos ungere licet, sed quod ab Episcopo fuerit consecratum, non tamen frontem ex eodem oleo signare, quod solis debetur Episcopis, cum spiritum tradunt Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletum.</hi> Grotius also believes, that Father <hi>Sirmond</hi> had reason to follow the Mss. where there is <hi>non habeatur,</hi> and not the Editions, where this Negation is omitted, but that he hath not well expounded <hi>praejudicans</hi> by <hi>nocens,</hi> a signification which hath been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this Latine word only in the time of <hi>Bartolos,</hi> or of <hi>Baldus.</hi> He saith it signifies <hi>condemnans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grotius</hi> wonders, that Christians dispute so much amongst themselves for indifferent things as these, which are neither comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor prohibited, and which make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of themselves to the distinction of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Priests. He treats besides of the same Ceremonies in Letter 355.1. <hi>p.</hi> where he saith, much the same thing. One may see what he thought thereof, before he was gone out of <hi>Holland,</hi> in Letter 62. Where he speaks very respectfully of these ancient Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>Writing to one of his Friends, from whom he had received Letters, from <hi>Grand Cair,</hi> and who had consulted him touching the Schism of the <hi>Nestorians</hi> and <hi>Eutychians,</hi> he answers thus: The Schism of <hi>Alexandria</hi> whereof you write unto me, was begun from the time of <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> of whom there are several Proselytes in this Countrey, in spight of the Condemnation of the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and who are spread even into <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> as the party of <hi>Nestorius</hi> stopped at <hi>Babylon,</hi> whence it extended it self into all <hi>Asia.</hi> I doubt not, but <hi>Nestorius</hi> hath used hard ways of speaking, who inclined too much on one side, as well as <hi>Eutychus</hi> did on the other; and I freely follow in this, the consent of the greatest number of Churches. Nevertheless it seems to me, that the Ancients were too forward in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the Church, those who were not of their Opinion in all things. See Letter 239. <hi>p.</hi> 2. As <hi>Grotius</hi> believed, that his Friend was in <hi>Abyssine,</hi> he takes occasion to speak of some Ceremonies of the <hi>Abyssines,</hi> as follows; <hi>Suarez</hi> in his Book of the Laws, says, that although the <hi>Abyssines</hi> retain Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103507:44"/>
provided they believe not that it is absolutely necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ry to Salvation, they may be received into the Church. I believe, they make use of this Mark, not in imitation of the Jews, or from the time of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as they speak, but that it is much ancienter, seeing <hi>Herodotus</hi> puts it amongst the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, which were always received in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia.</hi> I should believe, that it owes its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal to the Children, which <hi>Abraham</hi> had of <hi>Kethura</hi>; who according to <hi>Iosephus</hi> went to inhabit <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> I suppose, they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from certain Meats rather for health than for Religion. The annual Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Baptism is a tolerable Ceremony. It is better to interpret favourably the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, affirmed by the Observation of so many Ages, than to rend the State and the Church all at once.</p>
                     <p>To mix some diverting Subjects to these which are so serious, we shall not omit a remark touching the Original of Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which is in Letter 285. <hi>p.</hi> 1. In the time, saith he, that the Roman Empire was the most flourishing, each City had Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, not only in Eloquence, <hi>Non Eloquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae tantum &amp; Philosophicarum Haeresium (non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ob id nomen comburi homines coeperant) sed Medecinae quoque,</hi> and in all the Heresies of Philosophy, thus the Sects of Philosophers were called in the Ages, wherein Heresie was not a Crime worthy of Fire, but also in Physick. An arrest only of the Decuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was needful. It's what the <hi>Pandects</hi> the <hi>Code,</hi> and several Greek and Latine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors teach us.</p>
                     <p>In the time of the Controversies about Grace, <hi>Grotius</hi> made a small Treatise inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Disquisitio an Pelagiana sint ea dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata quae nunc sub eo nomine traducuntur.</hi> It is in the third Tome of his Theological Works. He endeavours to shew in this small work, that the Sentiments which then were called <hi>Pelagian</hi> are not so: But he doth more in the 19. Letter of the second part, where he maintains that these same Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are far from those of some <hi>Pelagians.</hi> The Divines of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> saith he, who were called Semi-pelagians, pressed the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Grace, after such a manner that they denied Grace prevented the first good motions of the Will, at least in some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. We need only to see the Council of <hi>Orange,</hi> which hath condemned the Errours of the Semi-pelagians. This was all their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which the Council disapproved so, that notwithstanding the Communion was not refused those, who were of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But those who believe, adds he, that Predestination is founded upon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, the universality of sufficient Grace, and the opinion of those who maintain that Grace can be resisted, and that it can be lost, are Tenets of Semi-pelagianisme, <hi>ritu sabino quod volunt somniant,</hi> according to the Latin Proverb. And as to the Semi-pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, we shall find a passage of <hi>Vincent</hi> of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in Letter 31. <hi>p.</hi> 1. upon which <hi>Grotius</hi> makes some Reflections.</p>
                     <p>To return now to more modern Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>Grotius</hi> relates, Letter 366. <hi>p.</hi> 2. A quarrel which happened between the Pope and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> in 1636. about an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription which the Pope caused to be put under a Picture, of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> III. and <hi>Frederick Barbarousse</hi> at his Feet, with these Words; <hi>Alexander Papa</hi> III. <hi>Frederi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci Imperatoris iram &amp; impetum fugiens abdidit se Venetiis, &amp; à Senatu perhonorifice susceptum, Ottone Imperatoris filio navali praelio à Venetis victo, captoque, Fridericus pace facta supplex adorat, fidem &amp; obedientiam pollicitus. Ita Pontifici sua dignitas Venetae Reipublicae beneficio restituta est.</hi> These terms did too much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> the Pope caused the Inscription thus to be corrected: <hi>Fridericus</hi> I. <hi>Imperator Alexandrum</hi> III. <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisicem, quem diu insecutus fuerat, post constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas cum eo pacis conditiones, &amp; damnatum Schisma, Venetiis supplex veneratur.</hi> Grotius sends to his Brother a Latin Epigram, where he equally disapproved the action of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and that of <hi>Vrban,</hi> and which ends with this distich,
<q>
                           <l>Nolite in fastum titulo pietatis abuti,</l>
                           <l>Esse jubet Regum libera colla Deus.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This quarrel of the Venetians with the Pope, makes me remember a rumour that ran at <hi>Paris,</hi> in 1630. they said that <hi>Fra. Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentio,</hi> a Divine of the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> and Successor to <hi>Fra. Paolo,</hi> endeavoured to inspire into the Greeks of the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> the Sentiments of the Protestants, to introduce the Reformation into <hi>Italy,</hi> by that means. See Letter 238. <hi>p.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>It may be, this was but a bare Report. <hi>Grotius</hi> was too far from the places, to be throughly inform'd in it, but he had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to be perfectly instructed of some other things, which happened in <hi>Holland,</hi> whilst he was there. He saith, Letter 11. <hi>p.</hi> 1. That in a Conference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Gomarus</hi> had before the Gentlemen of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> as <hi>Oldenbarndvelt</hi> said to these two Gentlemen, that he praised God for that the Controversies which was amongst them, were not upon any funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Article, <hi>Gomarus</hi> answered, that the Opinions of <hi>Arminius,</hi> his Collegue were of such a nature, that he cou'd not appear before the Tribunal of God with 'em. The whole dispute concerned Predestination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the greatest difference that was betwixt their opinions, was that <hi>Gomarus</hi> believed God had resolved to create the most part of men to damn them, without having any respect to their Actions, only for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of his Power; whereas <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> maintained that God damns not men, but because of their unbelief and impenitence. This last opinion is <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s, as <hi>Grotius</hi> saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ep. 58. <hi>p.</hi> 1. and elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>The Gentlemen of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> made in 1614. an Edict, which may be seen in the 3. Vol. of the Theological Works of <hi>Grotius,</hi> by which they ordered the two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which then were in the Reformed Churches of the Low Countries, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103507:44"/>
each other, and to treat with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the controverted matters, the then King <hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>England</hi> at first praised this order, also divers Bishops approved it, as <hi>Grotius</hi> saith in his Letters 28, and 29. But this Prince changing his opinion afterwards disapproved this conduct, as appears by Letter 111. <hi>p.</hi> 1. to Mr. <hi>Anthony de Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Spalatro.</hi> But that which was most fatal to <hi>Grotius</hi> and those of his party, was, that from that time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Provincial Synods were held where they were not favoured, as he himself says, in Letter 64. <hi>p.</hi> 1. The Magistrates of every City, promised Pastors of that party, shou'd exercise their charge as before, but those of the contrary party, thought the same toleration ought not to be given to them. Some refused to Preach in publick Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, because the other party were suffered there. They assembled themselves in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Meetings, so that the Magistrates fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these divers Assemblies wou'd cause trouble in the State, as they had in the Church. There was an attempt made at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> relates Letter 65. <hi>p.</hi> 1. to calm these troubles by a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, where the reasons of those Pastors were heard, who would not Preach in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Churches with those who were not of their opinion nor communicate with them. But this Conference had no good effect, as may be seen in this Letter of our Author, and in the following, where he gives an account of what happened on both sides in this Assembly.</p>
                     <p>Lastly the Schism was made after such a manner as all the World knoweth, and that besides many other reasons was no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hindrance, according to the Judgment of <hi>Grotius,</hi> to the design which several Pious persons formed some years after, of reuniting all Protestants. The King of <hi>Swedland</hi> too endeavour'd it a little before his Death, having assembled at <hi>Leipswich</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Lutheran and Calvinist Divines. The authority of this great King, made this Conference end with mildness on both sides, but his Death which hapned a little while after, made all hopes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation vanish. It was at that time that an English Divine named <hi>Duraeus,</hi> who had as 'twere consecrated himself to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this reunion, ran vainly over all the Protestant States to induce them to Peace, which the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury William Laud,</hi> whose Encomium <hi>Grotius</hi> makes in divers places, (<hi>v. p.</hi> 2. <hi>Ep.</hi> 405, 406.532.540.) and several Bishops of <hi>England</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately desired: <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, that an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of Doctor <hi>Hois</hi> Preacher to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Saxony</hi> being too violent against the Reformation, hindered it very much; see Let. 444. <hi>p.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>Protestants not being able to unite with one another, there was no likelihood that the Union between them and the Roman Catholicks should succeed. Yet there was a great talk on't in <hi>France,</hi> and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> if we believe <hi>Grotius</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 531. <hi>p.</hi> 2. affirm'd that it would be agreed on. <hi>Cardinalis quin <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> negotium in Gallia successurum sit dubitare se negat.</hi> This made several persons apply themselves to writing, to propose to the publick means and projects of an Union. Amongst whom none appeared that made so much noise as <hi>Theophilus Brachet dela Millitiere,</hi> which seemed the more surprizing, because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the taking of <hi>Rochel,</hi> this Author had attacked the Kings party, and all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks with an extraordinary heat, in a little Book which he Printed for the defence of some Assemblies held at <hi>Rochel. Grotius</hi> speaks of it in divers places, but particularly in Letter 373. <hi>p.</hi> 1. 385.343, 345. <hi>p.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>There was then a report at <hi>Paris,</hi> which gave some hope to those who penetrated not the policy of Cardinal <hi>Richeleu,</hi> that there would happen a change in the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> Church, which would much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to an Union. Which was that the Cardinal had a design to render himself Patriarch in <hi>France,</hi> and thus to draw the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church from the obedience of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> To this design was applied, according to the relation of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> Letter 982. <hi>p.</hi> 1. this <hi>Tetrastich</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stradamus.</hi>

                     <p>Some are so far from taking away from the obedience of the Apostolick See, that they scarcely dared to defend the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. The King who had given orders to make a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Edicts of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and of the Acts of Parliament, by which until then the excessive power of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was opposed, got this col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection suppressed in 1639. when the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof was finish'd, <hi>Grotius</hi> who had promised himself much from the courage of the <hi>French</hi> on this occasion, could not dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his grievance, which he too strongly expresseth: <hi>Ita sub Regibus aut ignavis, aut ignaris, tantum sape fit damni, quantum suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessores aegre sarciant: mirumque est pro Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus scribi Lutetiae non licere, cum Romae quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidie contra Reges &amp; eorum jura liberè fiant.</hi> He speaks thereof also in as weighty terms in Letter 1105. to <hi>Lewis Camerarius,</hi> Ambassador from <hi>Swedland</hi> into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>

Prelate believed that it was easie to reunite Religions by correcting some abuses in the Roman Church; and <hi>Grotius</hi> saith of him, Let. 37. p. 2. <hi>Marc Anthony de Dominis now saith Mass at</hi> Antwerp. <hi>He followeth the opinions of</hi> Cassander, <hi>only he attacks more openly Transubstantiation, and some other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.

                           </gap>or he believes that the Religion of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants and Catholicks is the same.</hi> Another thing which made <hi>Grotius</hi> despair of ever seeing Religious united, was the establishing cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for the Propagation of Faith, whereof he complains in a Letter to the great Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of <hi>Swedland</hi> dated <hi>Iune</hi> 29. 1639.</p>
                     <p>Besides these matters wherein great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms have been interested, there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particular Histories in these letters, whereof we shall here relate some. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosio Spinola</hi> Besieging <hi>Breda</hi> prohibited duels in his Army upon pain of Death. His Son having afterwards transgress'd this Order, was seized and condemned to Death, but the Guards letting him escape, he turned all his severity against them, and hanged six of them. He demanded his Son of the King of <hi>France,</hi> into whose Countrey he was withdrawn, to punish him, but he had not his desire, Let. 83. <hi>p.</hi> 2. Here is moreover another example of a <hi>Roman</hi> severity. A <hi>Venetian</hi> Senator of <hi>the Council of Ten,</hi> named <hi>Zeni,</hi> after he had punish'd the Sons of the <hi>Doge,</hi> who had done something against the State, he was attacked by assassinates, who wounded him in divers places. The People running to him, he was carried to his house, where he ordered his Sons and his Men to take his Bloody Cloaths, and thus to carry them to the Palace of St. <hi>Marc,</hi> to call for Justice. The Senate thereupon promised a great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to those who should discover the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices; some days after the <hi>Doge</hi> himself came to accuse his own Son, who was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done the Fact, and was of opinion that a far greater reward should be promised to him who could deliver the guilty dead or alive, into the hands of Justice, Let. 166. <hi>p.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grotius</hi> relates in the Letter where he speaks of <hi>Spinola,</hi> which we have cited, a History of another kind, and which is more diverting. He saith that a Courrier named <hi>Doublet,</hi> who was sent in 1625 from <hi>Holland</hi> to the Ambassador of the States at <hi>Paris,</hi> not knowing his aboad, nor even him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, made a pleasant equivocation: Which is, that having asked where lived the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour of the Low Countries, he was carried to the Envoy of <hi>Brussels,</hi> to whom he gave the Packet, and immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to speak of affairs of great consequence, afterwards perceiving his mistake, he got himself conducted to the Ambassador of the States, where he yet committed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fault, in opening his Port-mantle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those who conducted him, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that there was Money in it, after which going abroad about some affair, he returned no more, and this caused in the Ambassador a great uneasiness.</p>
                     <p>It was doubtless a great imprudence to commit matters of State to so unhandy a Man, but <hi>Grotius</hi> relates another fault of a witty man, which is as great, if it be true. He saith that famous <hi>Peter du Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> was obliged to go out of <hi>France</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a Letter he had written to King <hi>Iames,</hi> wherein he exhorted him to succour the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> who was of late chosen King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to which he added, that the Reformed of <hi>France</hi> would see what they could expect from him in such an occasion. These Letters being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the Hands of the King of <hi>France, M. du Moulin</hi> staid not to be bid to withdraw, nor until he should be seized, Let. 640. <hi>p.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>Here are other Histories for the diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Naturalists and Philosophers. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> assures us in Letter 361. <hi>p.</hi> 2. that the whole Court of <hi>England</hi> had seen in 1635 a man aged 153 years, who was in good health, but that he lost his sight 20 years before. In the Letter 405. <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,</hi> saith he, <hi>lying in the Trenches before</hi> Landrecy, <hi>was advertised in a Dream speedily to retire, unless he was willing to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed by a Mine which was going to play. Scarcely was he up, but the Mine blew up the place he lay upon. This will surprize you, but if you had</hi> M. de Saumaise, <hi>he would relate unto you a History which he has of his Father. A certain man who knew not a word of Greek, came to see</hi> M. de Saumaise <hi>his Father, who was a Counsellor at the Parliament of</hi> Dijon, <hi>and shewed him these words which he had heard, at night in his Dream, and which he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in French Characters as soon as he awaked, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; he asked of</hi> Mr. de Saumaise <hi>if he knew not their meaning</hi>; Mr. de Saumaise <hi>said unto him that they signified, Away, perceivest thou not thy Death? This man quitted the House where he lived, and it fell the night following.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this History is true, it is assuredly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing. It includes a prediction, which may be attributed to some Invisible power, who had advertised this man in a Dream of what was to happen the next day, but here is another prediction, which deserves not less our Relation. <hi>Grotius</hi> not only made a kind of Horoscope of a great Prince who was born the fifth of <hi>September</hi> in 1638. In the Letter 1079 of the 1. <hi>p.</hi> directed to Queen <hi>Christine,</hi> but foretold upon a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple passage, that he would be one day a great Conqueror. This Prince troubled several Nurses which were to be given him in biting the Nipple of their Breasts. <hi>Fugiunt eum conquisitae ad hoc Faeminae,</hi> saith <hi>Grotius</hi> Letter 189. <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>quod ubera earum morsicando lancinet robustus calidique Spiritûs puer; non sine omine futurae rapacitatis. Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> seems to have taken delight in this thought, seeing he repeats it in his Letter 1231. written to <hi>Barlaeus</hi> the following year: <hi>Nutrices,</hi> saith he, <hi>non lassat tantum, sed &amp; lacerat, caveant vicini sibi à tam ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura rapacitate</hi>

some such thing of <hi>Hercules,</hi> whom <hi>Iuno</hi> was obliged to abandon, after she had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to Nurse him, because he dealt too violently by her Paps. See <hi>Diodorus</hi> Lib. IV.</p>
                     <p>To finish the Extract which we are to make of the Historical things which are in the Letters of <hi>Grotius,</hi> we need no more but to add some matters which concern himself. Mr. <hi>Aubery,</hi> who caused to be Printed some years ago a Book Intituled <hi>Memorials of the History of Holland,</hi> hath made in this Book a kind of an abridgment of the Life of our Author, where he prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and blameth him, according as he thought him to have deserved either. But it is astonishing that being a particular friend to this great man, and having often seen him in the time wherein he was Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador to the Court of <hi>Swedland,</hi> he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding doth advance divers things, which are contrary to what <hi>Grotius</hi> saith himself in his Letters. He saith for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that <hi>Grotius</hi> being vext because Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> had cut off his Pension, the first time he was in <hi>France,</hi> and had caused him thus to leave it, <hi>See not the Cardinal under this fine pretence, that he helped not the Ambassadors.</hi> It's what Mr. <hi>Aubery</hi> calls <hi>an unconceivable stand, or for a better expression, a Dutch obstinacy,</hi> which hindered his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with this potent Minister, tho' he had a very great need of him for his service in his particular affairs,</hi> so that <hi>he treated but with the subaltern Ministers. Grotius</hi> saith on the contrary, that he saw him pretty often, and relates some discourses he had with him, as may be seen in 1. <hi>p.</hi> letter 491, 505, 535. and elsewhere. There is no great likelihood that <hi>Grotius</hi> gave the Chancellor of <hi>Swedeland,</hi> long relations of any affairs which he had negotiated, as he saith, with the Cardinal himself, if he had never seen him during his Residence in <hi>France</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Mr. <hi>du Maurier</hi> assures. But it seems this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath confounded the Cardinal of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu,</hi> with Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> of whom <hi>Grotius</hi> thus speaketh in a Letter dated the 26th of <hi>September,</hi> 1643. <hi>I have caused your Letters to be given to Cardinal</hi> Mazarin; <hi>I shall not see him, without an Order from our Queen, because at his own house he gives not the hand to the Ambassadors of Crowned heads, and being treated with the Title of Eminence, he treats not again with that of Excellence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be equal to Kings, according to the Opinions of the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>and very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly yields precedency to Princes of the Blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>du Maurier</hi> also says another thing, which is not conformable to the Letters of <hi>Grotius, viz.</hi> that the Ministers of <hi>Charenton,</hi> who despised <hi>Grotius,</hi> during the time he was but a private man in <hi>France,</hi> used him quite another way when he was Ambassador of <hi>Swedland. Having considered,</hi> saith this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>that it would be a very great honour to them, that an Ambassador of so considerable a Crown should be present at their Assemblies, they sent unto him one of their Ministers, with the Elders of the Consistory, to pray him to honour their Sermons with his presence; telling him, that the very</hi> Lutherans <hi>were of late admitted to their Communion, by an Act of the last Synod of</hi> Charenton, <hi>hut he answered them haughtily, that they having neglected him whilst he was a private man and a Refugee, he would neglect them in his turn, being Ambassador.</hi> It's very well known, that the Ministers of <hi>Charenton</hi> endeavoured to draw <hi>Grotius</hi> to their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, from the first time that he was in <hi>France</hi>; but as we see nothing of it in these Letters, we do not at all rely upon it. It's true, some were deputed to <hi>Grotius,</hi> as he says himself in the Letters 378. <hi>p.</hi> 1. 340, and 350. <hi>p.</hi> 2. but he refused not to go to the Sermons of <hi>Charenton,</hi> after the manner which <hi>Mr. du Maurier</hi> saith; he thus tells us himself, he received the Deputies of <hi>Charenton,</hi> Letter 350. <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>I have had this day at my House three Learned Reformed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> le Faucheur <hi>Minister of</hi> Montpellier, <hi>and</hi> Mertrezat <hi>and</hi> Daille <hi>Ministers of this Church. They desired me to join my self to their Communion, and told me that what was in times past established at</hi> Alez <hi>and</hi> Charen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>being changed by new rules, wherein</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans <hi>are admitted to the Communion, they hoped we should hold their Confession for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Confession, as they had the same opinion in respect to the Remonstrants: that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred what I formerly writ against</hi> Sibran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, <hi>to wit that I should be very much surpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if the Reformed refused the Communion to</hi> Chrysostome <hi>and</hi> Melanchton <hi>if they came again into the World: That they had read and approved my whole Book of the Truth of the Christian Religion, and the admonition I gave at the end to Christians, to bring them to an agreement. I told'em I was satisfied with what they said, being conformable to my maxims: that the opinion of</hi> Melanchton <hi>had always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly pleased me, and that I had sufficiently shewn it; that as to what concerns Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Peace, I knew well that it ought not to be troubled by a turbulent manner of acting. That there should be free conferences amongst the learned. They also said that they endeavoured to bring the Remonstrants of</hi> Holland <hi>into their Communion, and that they had written about it to</hi> M. Rivet: <hi>that they were become more prudent with time, and that they hoped that the Dutch after having well examined their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, would do somewhat in their favour. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having said these things on each side, I added that I was ready to testifie by the external signs the Communion of the Spirit, in which I had always joined with them; and that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my fault that it was not so: that if I went into a Country where</hi> Lutherans, <hi>knowing my opinions of the Eucharist, would receive me into their Communion, I would make no difficulty to communicate with them. They approved this conduct. Grotius</hi> seemed after this to be inclined to go to communicate at <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton,</hi> but there was an obstacle which never could be taken away, that hindered him; 'twas that <hi>Grotius</hi> would have had a distinct place in the Temple, and to be received there in the quality of Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Swedland</hi>; which the Consistory of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103507:46"/>
                        <hi>Charenton</hi> would not grant him. <hi>Grotius</hi> complains thereof in these terms, in Letter 358. <hi>I am surprized at the inconstancy of these people, who having invited to their Communion the</hi> Lutherans, <hi>say that they cannot receive an Ambassador of</hi> Swedland, <hi>in the Quality of Ambassador, because of the difference which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the sentiments of that Kingdom and theirs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grotius</hi> notwithstanding in the Letters which we have cited praiseth the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ministers of <hi>Charenton.</hi> But here is a good character of Mr. <hi>Daille</hi> in Letter 232. <hi>p.</hi> 2. A Roman Catholick having put several questions to <hi>M. Daille</hi> in a Letter, and amongst other things why the Reformed had condemned the <hi>Arminians</hi>; he answered that seeing peace was oftentimes offered to the <hi>Lutherans</hi> who are of the same opinions, it was not so much the <hi>Arminians</hi> who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as <hi>Arminianism. I fear</hi> saith <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, that those who are here stronger than they, shall say one day that they drive not away the</hi> Calvinists <hi>but</hi> Calvinism; <hi>which I pray God may not befal them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M. du Maurier</hi> relates a pleasant History of a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Minister that <hi>Grotius</hi> had at his House, whom he names <hi>Doctor Ambreus,</hi> whereas <hi>Grotius</hi> complains of <hi>Brandanus,</hi> Letter 840. <hi>p.</hi> 1.410. <hi>p.</hi> 2. He saith that this <hi>Ambreus,</hi> instead of expounding purely and simply the Word of God, flung him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into controversie with so much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that his Sermons were full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives, which <hi>Grotius</hi> being at last weary of, exhorted him to expound the Gospel, without wounding Christian Charity. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Doctor <hi>Ambreus</hi> told him he could not but say what God inspired him with: and <hi>Grotius</hi> having at last ordered him, either to abstain from railing, or Preach no more, this <hi>Ambreus</hi> leaving him in anger, and coming down stairs, said grumbling, that it was a strange thing that the Ambassador of the Crown of <hi>Swedland,</hi> would shut the Holy Ghost's mouth. Which <hi>Grotius</hi> related unto me, adds Mr. <hi>du Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier</hi> being ready to split with laughing, and said that this <hi>Ambreus</hi> complained every where that he shut the Holy Ghost's mouth, because he hindered him from speaking against his Neighbour. Yet <hi>Grotius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains only of <hi>Brandanus,</hi> and also contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts in another thing M. <hi>du Maurier.</hi> This Author saith that <hi>one M. d'Or who was of the same Sentiments with</hi> Calvin, <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Afternoons,</hi> and that he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so engage himself in Controversie. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> had only a design to take this <hi>M. d'Or</hi> after he had sent away <hi>Brandanus,</hi> and this <hi>M. d Or</hi> was formerly of the Judgment of the Arminians, on which account he came out of <hi>Sedan,</hi> where he was Minister before the Synod of <hi>Dordrecht.</hi> See Let. 410. <hi>p.</hi> 2. by the following Letters we see that <hi>Grotius</hi> made no use of him, tho' he had a design so to do.</p>
                     <p>We shall end the Extract of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Person of <hi>Grotius,</hi> by his Epitaph which he made himself, and which is in Let. 536. <hi>p.</hi> 2.</p>

                     <p>Concerning his works, he telleth us him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that his Book of the Truth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, was translated not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to High Dutch, French and English, but even into Arabick and Persian, to serve for the Conversion of Infidels. See the 2<hi>d. p.</hi> Letter 411, 444, 534. He saith also that the Queen of <hi>Swedland</hi> caused his Book <hi>de Iure Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> to be read which some Divines said included Socinian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. <hi>Grotius</hi> saith laughing thereat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p n="5">V. To come, in fine, to what is in the Letters of <hi>Grotius</hi> concerning Politicks, we believe we may say to the publick what <hi>Peter Grotius</hi> Son to our Author, esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so much the Letters which his Father had Written during his Ambassy, that he said they were as excellent in respect to Policy, as his Annotations upon the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel were in matters of Divinity. It is what the Publick may Judge, and whereof per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons would yet judge better, if divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which undoubtedly contain the most important things, were not written in figures, or if the Author had not made use of invented names, which are not easie to be understood <hi>M. du Maurier</hi> is of a senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very different, since he saith, <hi>that</hi> Grotius <hi>being withdrawn from the society of the Living, and passing whole days, and the most part of the Night with the Dead, he could only send into</hi> Swedland <hi>news about new bridge in fine Latin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We shall not undertake to decide which of the two had most reason, because here we write a History, and not an Apology. Those who will take the pains to compare the news which <hi>Grotius</hi> writ to the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Swedland</hi> with the events of those times may judge thereof. But it would not be surprising that an Ambassador, who is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to write very often and hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways considerable affairs, should write news either not of great consequence, or perhaps false. Howbeit, we shall here collect some political places, which are spread through this great Volume.</p>
                     <p>In the 364. L. <hi>p.</hi> 1. we find a dispute some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary, concerning the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of sending Ambassadors. The great Chancellor <hi>Oxenstiern,</hi> who after the Death of <hi>Gustavus,</hi> had a full power to do all he thought convenient for the good of the state, to send Ambassadors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> sent <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> Some difficulties were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thereupon, which <hi>Grotius</hi> refutes in this Letter by divers examples, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that of the Ambassadors, who having been sent from <hi>Flanders</hi> by <hi>Arch-Dukes,</hi> in vertue of the power they had received from <hi>Madrid,</hi> were received in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as Ambassadors from the King of <hi>Spain. Grotius</hi> then tells us in what manner he was received, after he had been acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Ambassador from the Crown of <hi>Swedland.</hi>

                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:103507:46"/>He sometimes makes political remarks upon the Nature of Nations, and upon the manner wherewith one ought to treat with them, as when he says of the <hi>French,</hi> Let. 371. <hi>p.</hi> 1. that they are at first harder to be dealt with, but that by little and little, they become more tractable, according as they perceive they get nothing by acting haughtily. The same Nation, saith our Author Let. 582. <hi>p.</hi> 1. boasts of its riches, when it seeks for Allies; but when any thing is to be paid, 'tis not asham'd to say that it is extreamly poor: <hi>Galli cum socios quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, maximas praeferunt divitias; Vbi solvendum est aliquid, ultimam paupertatem.</hi> So he speaks elsewhere in what manner the <hi>French</hi> do use the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that when they do not obtain of them what they would, they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace it. People, saith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might make use of this way, to diminish the Pope's Power; but for the most part when the affairs of private Men go on well, those of the State are neglected. It's thought the Cardinal would frighten the Pope, that he may make him here a perpetual Legate to the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick See.

                     <p>In this Letter also is the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> negotiated, and how he employed the most famous Father <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> in the most difficult negotiations. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> tells us that the Cardinal made use of him, to begin the negotiations, and to put them in a way of succeeding, after which he would put in himself. <hi>Butillerius Pater,</hi> saith he, <hi>&amp; Iosephus Capucinus negotia cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da accipiunt, cocta ad Cardinalem deferunt.</hi> Let. 375. <hi>p.</hi> 1. An example hereof may be seen in Let. 371. In the 380. is the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Conference which <hi>Grotius</hi> had with the Cardinal and F. <hi>Ioseph.</hi> This Capuchin at first speaks there with the Ambassadour of <hi>Swedland,</hi> and goes thro' the hardest part of the Contestation. Afterwards the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal intervened, as to make them agree in proposing a Medium. <hi>Dixit deinde Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalis,</hi> they are the words of our Author, <hi>videre se inter me &amp; Iosephum minus convenire: velle se esse Conciliatorem mutuae inter nos bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volentiae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After having observ'd in a Letter to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis Camerarius,</hi> that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had run so much in debt, that they were no more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, and that the neighbouring Nations were not less drained, he adds this political reflection: <hi>Pro divitiis nobis erit eadem apud hostes paupertas</hi>; the poverty of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will serve us instead of Riches. Let. 884. <hi>p.</hi> 1. But there are few places of the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks that are stronger and livelier, than a Description of the Court of <hi>France</hi> in 1635. whereof here are some words, for it is too long to be all inserted: <hi>The Cardinal burthened with care, unloads it on a Monk, this Monk dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth it very slightly.</hi> Boutiller <hi>the Son only runs about, the Father defers every thing, the Commissaries of the Treasury, and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of the Armies, think they are all called to a Harvest of Gold. The Cardinal is charged with the Sins of all the World, and even fears his life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It happened in 1637. that <hi>Grotius</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour having sent their Coaches to meet an Ambassadour of <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Swedish</hi> Ambassadours Men took the Precedency, in spight of the <hi>English,</hi> which made the latter draw their Swords. The Duke <hi>de la Force</hi> who went for the Ambassadour ran to the tumult, and thought he could easily decide it, but the <hi>Swedes</hi> made it appear they were prepared for this accident in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reasons they had to do so, which may be seen in Let. 722. <hi>p.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>I almost forgot to remark that in the 2. <hi>part</hi> which contains much fewer political Letters than the first, that the Opinion of <hi>Grotius</hi> may be seen upon these two questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: to wit, if one is obliged to send a Prince such succour as hath been promised him, when we are attacked our selves? Letter 16. and after what manner the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of the United Provinces hold Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy? Let. 209.</p>
                     <p>This is what was thought fit to relate of the Letters of <hi>Grotius</hi> concerning Politicks. The subject of his Embassy may be seen in the new History of <hi>Swedland</hi> by M. <hi>Puffendorf, lib. vii c.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>In this great number of Letters one may well judge that there are some of all sorts: but we were contented to mark the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal subjects. The Letters of Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be added, whereof these are the most considerable, the 133. to M. <hi>du Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier</hi> upon the Death of his Wife: The 334. to <hi>G.

He added likewise,<q> that if disputes were rais'd in things that were not matters of Faith, as for his own part he had not attributed to himself the authority of forming an absolute Judgment thereof, but offered to be examined by <hi>Zozimus</hi> what he had Written upon these subjects drawn from the authority of the Prophets, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, that it might be corrected if there was any errour.

He said to that, that he could prove this <hi>Paulinus</hi> to be an Heretick, and would not condemn the propositions whereof he had accused him. The other question that <hi>Zozimus</hi> put to him, was if he agreed not with <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> in what he had condemned, and if he would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the sentiments of the Church of <hi>Rome? Celestius</hi> answered, yes.</p>
                     <p>After these formalities <hi>Zozimus</hi> Writ to the Bishops of <hi>Africk</hi> a long letter, where he relates in what manner <hi>Celestius</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before him, and how he had been examined. After that he reproachech them with having acted in this affair with too much precipitation (<hi>fervore fidei praefesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum esse</hi>) and that they had too lightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved extravagant reports, and saith the same to certain Letters of <hi>Eros</hi> and <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> not being well assur'd of their worth.

In what admiration were they all in? some could scarcely keep themselves from shedding tears. Is it possible that you could have defamed persons of so unspotted a Faith? Is there any place in their Writings, where they have not spoken of the assistance and Grace of God</hi>?</p>
                     <p>He condemned moreover in these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Eros</hi> and <hi>Lazare,</hi> accusers of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Celestius,</hi> as persons guilty of great crimes, <hi>erubescenda factis &amp; damnationibus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina</hi> and spoke with much contempt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were parties against them.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding the Bishops of <hi>Africk</hi> took no notice of these Letters, but assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themselves at <hi>Carthage</hi> to the number of ccxiv, and condemned anew <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Celestius,</hi> until they acknowledged the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Grace in the same sense, that it was maintain'd in <hi>Africk,</hi> without making use of any equivocations as they had done till then. This Assembly was held at the beginning of the year CCCCXVIII, they sent their Constitutions with a Letter to <hi>Zozimus,</hi> wherein these Bishops exhorted him to act against <hi>Pelagius</hi> conformably to them. Their Letter had the effect they desired, and <hi>Zozimus</hi> and all his Clergy (who had admired the Writings of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> where
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103507:47"/>
they freely declared their sentiments, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving attention, as St. <hi>Augustin, says, to what the Romans believed thereupon, whose faith might be spoken of with Praise to the Lord) saw that all their Opinions, which were conformable to each other, were very zealous for the Catholick Faith against the Opinion of Pelagius.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <hi>Zozimus</hi> in condemning him, spoke not so strongly, as he had in judging in his favour, as it may be seen in <hi>Vsher.</hi> The Emperors <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived also the acts of the Council of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> and thought fit to prop them with their authority, in making an edict which they sent to the three Prefects of the <hi>Praeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> for to publish it in the whole Empire, by which they banished <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> and likewise condemned to a perpetual banishment and confiscation of Goods all those that should maintain their Tenets, where e're they were, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing all persons to accuse them. The Prefects of the <hi>Praetorium</hi> accompanied this Imperial Law with particular Edicts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one is still remaining, and may be seen in the <hi>Centuriators</hi> of <hi>Magdebourg.</hi> It is of <hi>Palladius</hi>'s, and in these terms,

Those that know the Style of the Preachers then, will be persuaded easily that it was requisite to follow the like method for some time, to begin an Imperial Edict in these Terms. <hi>Ad conturbandam Catholicae simplicitatis lucem, puro semper splendore radiantem, dolosae artis ingenio, novam subito emicuisse versutiam, pervulgatâ opinione cognovimus: quae fallacis scientiae obumbrata mendaciis, &amp; furiato tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum debacchata luctamine, stabilem quietem coelestis conatur attrectare fidei.

                     <p>Notwithstanding the same Bishops of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> who had lately condemned <hi>Pelagius,</hi> knowing nothing yet of the Emperours E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts which were dated the last of <hi>April,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled themselves again at <hi>Carthage,</hi> the next day, and anathematized those that should say, <q>that the first Man was by his Nature mortal. 2. That little Infants ought not to be Baptised, or that they might be so, tho' they were not infected with the Sin of <hi>Adam.</hi> 3. That the Grace by which we are justified, serveth but for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins, and is not sufficient to make us abstain from them for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: 4. That Grace assisteth us only to know our duty, and that it produceth not obedience of it self. 5. That Grace is given us, that we may the more easily by its means do, what we should do with most difficulty without it. 6. That it is only by humility that we are all obliged to say that we are Sinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. That every one is not obliged to say, <hi>pardon us our sins</hi> for himself, but for others only that are sinners. 8. That the Saints are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to say the same words by humility only.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It seemeth that this Council intended not only to condemn the Opinions of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> but also to anathematize aforehand those that could fall into the sentiments that should have any connection with theirs. For it's apparent according to these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he could absolutely deny the four last propositions. He believed not that Grace made us simply to know our duty, nor that there had been any man that had passed his life without Sin, excepting Jesus Christ. But it hath always been the custom of Councils to anathematise some supposed errors that no body held, in condemning the real Opinioins of Hereticks; it may be to inspire more horrour for Heresie, and to hinder that none should be so bold as to protect Hereticks.

                     </p>
                     <p>Nevertheless <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who was still at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> pressed by <hi>Pinianus</hi> and <hi>Melanius,</hi> made a declaration of his thoughts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the necessity of Grace, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be necessary to every act: and at every moment. He also saith, that he always was in regard to Baptism of the same sentiments, he had mention'd in his profession of Faith to <hi>Pope Innocent,</hi> which is, that Children must be Baptized as accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed. But whatever he could say, it was not believed that he understood what he spoke in the same sense with the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Church. Nevertheless <hi>Iulianus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Celenes</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> published Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon the Song of Songs, a book <hi>de Constantla,</hi> and four <hi>books against the first of St.</hi> Augustins <hi>de Concupiscentiae &amp; Nuptiis,</hi> where he maintained the sentiments of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius.</hi>
In the last of these Works, he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted openly the Bishops of <hi>Africk,</hi> as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and Innovators, and said that they

                     <p n="3">III. That God had caused the Gospel to be preached to Nations that he foresaw would embrace it, and that he caused it not to be preached to Nations, that he foresaw would reject it.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. That notwithstanding he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all should be saved, he had chosen to Salvation none but those, that he saw wou'd persevere in Faith and good Works.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. That there was no particular Grace absolutely necessary to Salvation, which God gave only to a certain number of men, and that men might lose all the Graces they had received.</p>

That of little Children which died in their Infancy, God permitted that those only should be baptized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who, according to the foreknowledge of God would have been pious if they had lived; but on the contrary those that were wicked, if they came to a more advanced Age, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Baptism by Providence.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. The Semi-pelagians were yet accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make Grace entirely outward, so that according to them it chiefly consisted in the preaching of the Gospel; but some of them maintained that there was also an interiour Grace, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> himself did not totally reject. Others allowed that there was preventing Grace.</p>
                     <p>So it seemeth, that the difference that was betwixt them, and <hi>Pelagius</hi> consisted only in this, that they allowed Men were born in some measure corrupt, and also they pressed more the necessity of Grace, at least in words. Tho' the difference was not extreamly great, he notwithstanding anathematized <hi>Pelagius.</hi> But this they did, it's like, in the supposition, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> maintained all the opinions condemned by the Councils of <hi>Africk.</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth them to have made the Grace of God wholly to consist in Instruction, which only regardeth the understanding, when as he believ'd it to consist in a particular and interiour action of the Holy Ghost, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining us invincibly to Will good, this determination not being the effect of our understanding.

                     <p>To come back to the History, 'tis said, that in the year Ccccxxix, one <hi>Agricola</hi> Son of <hi>Severiaenus</hi> a <hi>Pelagian</hi> Bishop carried Pelagianism into <hi>England,</hi> but St. <hi>Germain Bishop of Auxerre,</hi> was sent hither by Pope <hi>Celestin,</hi> or by the Bishops of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and extirpated it suddenly. Several mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are attributed to him in this Voyage, and in the stay he made in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Vsher</hi> observes. But if what <note n="(c)" place="margin">

                        <hi>Hector Boetius</hi> saith, a Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who lived in the beginning of the past Age, be true, he used a means that is not less efficacious for the extirpation of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, which was that the Pelagians that would not retract, <hi>were burned by the care of the Magistrates.</hi>
                     </p>

the Seeds of Pelagianism, that <hi>Cassian</hi> had spread amongst the Monks of <hi>Marseille,</hi> and in the <hi>Narbonick Gaul,</hi> caused it likewise to grow in <hi>France.</hi> St. <hi>Prosper</hi> and <hi>Hilary,</hi> had writ of it to St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and had specified it to him, that several Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks of the <hi>Gauls</hi> looked upon his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as dangerous novelties.

                        <hi>Iulian</hi> and the other Bishops banished, as I have already observ'd, from <hi>Italy,</hi> were gone to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> where they importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Emperour, to be re-established, but as they were accused of Heresie, he would grant them nothing, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reasons why they were banished. <hi>Nestorius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> writ about it to <hi>Celestine,</hi> who answered him after a very sour manner, and as if it had not been permitted to be informed of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their condemnation, reproaching him at the same time with his particular Sentiments. His Letter is dated the 12. of <hi>August</hi> in the year Ccccxxx.</p>
                     <p>It was at that time, that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> died, whose Elogium may be found in our Author who approveth of the praises that <hi>Fulgentius</hi> giveth him in his 2.

                     <p>In the year Ccccxxxi, the 22. of <hi>Iune,</hi> this Council composed of CCX. Bishops was assembled for the Condemnation of <hi>Nestorius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> presided there, and whilst it was holding, <hi>Iohn</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Antioch</hi> was assembled with 30. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops, who made Canons contrary to those of this Council. The particulars were, that the party of <hi>Cyril,</hi> and that of <hi>Iohn</hi> reciprocally accused each other of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianism; but the greater part approved of the Deposition of <hi>Iulian</hi> and other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Italy,</hi> that <hi>Nestorius</hi> had used with more mildness. He is accused to have been of their opinion, and to have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that Jesus Christ was become the Son of God, by the good use he made of his Free-will, in reward whereof God had united him to the Everlasting Word. This was the cause, that in this Council Pelagianism and Nestorianism were both condemned together.</p>
                     <p>But notwithstanding all this, and the cares of three Popes, <hi>Celestinus, Xystus,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the first, Semi-pelagianism was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held amongst the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
It may be that the manner wherewith <hi>Celestine</hi> writ to the Bishops of <hi>France</hi> contributed to it, because that tho' he condemned <hi>Pelagius</hi> with heat, and praised St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> he said at the end of his Letter,<q> that as to the deep and difficult Questions, which were found mingled in this Controversie, and which were treated at length by those that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the Hereticks, that as he durst not despise them, he did believe it not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to make a party therein.</q>

These Errours are those to which the Divines of <hi>Marseilles</hi> gave the Name of <hi>Predestinarian</hi> Heresie, that some maintain to have been a real Heresie, and others the opinions of St. <hi>Augustine.</hi> We have no more of the Acts of these two Synods, but the work of <hi>Faustus</hi> subsisteth yet. It is intituled, <hi>de Gratia &amp; libero arbitrio,</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <hi>Leontius</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> and very clearly containeth Semi-pelagianism. <hi>Erasmus</hi> got it first printed at <hi>Basil,</hi> in M.D.XXVIII, and it hath been since in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in the 8<hi>th.</hi> Tome of the Library of the Fathers. <hi>Faustus</hi> sent the opinions of the second Council of <hi>Arles</hi> to a Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narian Priest named <hi>Lucidus,</hi> to oblige him to retract his Errours, and to subscribe this Doctrine of the Council. His Letter to <hi>Lucidus</hi> is still to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103507:49"/>
Christ died for all men; that some are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined to death and others to life: that from <hi>Adam</hi> to Jesus Christ no Pagan hath been saved by the first Grace of God, to wit, by the law of nature, because they have lost the free Will in our first Father: That the Patriarchs and Prophets, and the greatest of Saints have remained in Paradice untill the time of Redemption. This is almost a full Abridgment of the Book of <hi>Faustus.</hi> Some learned men have maintained that <hi>Faustus</hi> had passed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and that many of those that had assisted at the Councils of <hi>Arles</hi> and <hi>Lions,</hi> had not subscribed his Book. It is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless difficult to believe that a Bishop that was very much esteem'd as <hi>Faustus</hi> was, as it appears by the Letters of <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris</hi> Bishop of <hi>Clermont</hi> in <hi>Auvergne,</hi> who makes his Elogy in several places, and by <hi>Gennadus</hi> who praiseth this work; it is I say, difficult enough to conceive how he could have the boldness to attribute to a Council, opinions which were so odious to the greatest part of 'em, and to think the Members of this Council could not shew their Resentment thereof. Neither do those who say that <hi>Faustus</hi> exceeded his Commission, give any reason, only that they cannot persuade themselves that there were so many Semi-Pelagians amongst the <hi>Gauls.</hi> In our Author are the different Judgments that divers learned men have made of <hi>Faustus</hi> and the greatest part of 'em are not very favourable to him. <hi>Baronius</hi> too speaketh ill enough of him. So that it happeneth now to the Semi-Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians, what did in times past to the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians; which is, that those who believ'd their principal Tenets, condemned them only because those who have been more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable than themselves have formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them.</p>

Some maintained it was Orthodox, and others Heretical, as it appeareth by a Letter of <hi>Possessar</hi> an African Bishop, who was then at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and who writ of it to Pope <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misda</hi> in the year DXX. to know his thoughts thereupon. Persons of the first quality amongst which were <hi>Vitalianus</hi> and <hi>Iustinian,</hi> who hath been since Emperour, desired to be instructed what Sentiments the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had of it. <hi>Hormisda</hi> disapproved the Book of <hi>Faustus,</hi> and sent them to consult these of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> of <hi>Predestination</hi> and <hi>Perseverance.</hi> There was then at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a Monk named <hi>Iohn Maxence,</hi> who writ an answer <note n="(b)" place="margin">

                        </note> to the Letter of <hi>Hormisda,</hi> where he compareth the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> and those of <hi>Faustus,</hi> and desperately censures <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessar</hi> and those that maintained that the Book of <hi>Faustus</hi> was Orthodox. It appears by that, that <hi>Possessar</hi> was a Semi-Pelagian, and consequently that the Councils of <hi>Africk,</hi> had not been able as yet to submit all the Bishops of this Church to their Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vandals</hi> were become Masters of <hi>Africk,</hi> during the heat of the Pelagian Controversies, and as they were <hi>Arians,</hi> they drove away a great number of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops that followed the decisions of the Council of <hi>Nice. Thrasamond</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals</hi> had sent 60 of them into exile from the Province of <hi>Byzacene,</hi> into <hi>Sardinia.</hi> They were consulted from the <hi>East</hi> upon the Controversies of Grace, rather to have a publick Declaration of their opinions, than to draw instructions from them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those that did write to them, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken party and condemned in their Letters not only the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> but also the Books of <hi>Faustus. Fulgentius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Esfagues</hi> answered in the name of the others, and exposed the sentiments of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> in a Letter, and in a particular Book di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to one <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>Deacon.</hi> The same <hi>Fulgentius</hi> made also other works upon this matter, whereof several places may be seen in our Author. He had composed seven Books against the two of <hi>Faustus</hi> of <hi>Grace and Free-Will,</hi> but they are lost. These <hi>African</hi> Bishops returned to their Churches in the year DXXIII. which was that of the Death of <hi>Thrasamond,</hi> as <hi>Victor</hi> of <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neins</hi> informeth us in his Chronicle. But <hi>Fulgenius</hi> had refuted <hi>Faustus</hi> before he had left <hi>Sardinia,</hi> whence it followeth, as well as from the Letter of <hi>Possessar,</hi> that <hi>Binius</hi> hath not well related the third Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> whose opinions <hi>Faustus</hi> had expounded in the year DXXIV. But this is not the only fault he hath committed, he hath corrected, or rather corrupted as he thought fit, an infinite number of places of the Antient Councils, without having respect to the <hi>MSS.</hi> which makes <hi>Vsher</hi>

                     <p>As <hi>Hilary</hi> and <hi>Leontius</hi> Archbishops of <hi>Arles</hi> had favoured Semi-Pelagianism, <hi>Cesario,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Leontius</hi> inclin'd to what the Divines of <hi>Marseille</hi> called <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destianism,</hi> to wit the Sentiments of St. <hi>Augustine.</hi> It was by his direction, that the second Council of <hi>Orange</hi> was held in the year DXXXIX, which approved the opinions of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and our Author gives us <note n="(b)" place="margin">

A little while after another Council was held at <hi>Valence</hi> upon the same matters, and which also condemned Semi-Pelagianism. <hi>Boniface</hi> II. approved the acts of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, by a Letter that he writ to <hi>Cesario</hi> in the year DXXXI, and which <hi>Vsher</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in his Works.</p>

                     <p>THIS piece is chiefly designed to answer Mr. <hi>Nicoli,</hi> but the difficulties that Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> Father <hi>Maimbourg,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Meaux</hi> have propos'd in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Church, are herein examined with the utmost exactness; the whole is reduced to these five general questions, 1. <hi>What are the essential parts of the Church?</hi> 2. <hi>What is the invisibility and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>The first is begun by the comparison of the Church with a Human Body animated, and it's pretended that as the essential parts of man are a reasonable Soul, and an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganised Body, and the Union of this Body and Soul; likewise the essential parts of the Church, are Faith and Charity, the Profession of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the outward practice of Charity, and the Union of these four; Faith and Charity are the Soul of the Church, the outward Profession and Practice the Body, and according to this Idea, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Saints in Paradise, nor the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated that are not yet born, are any part of the Church, which is proved by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; after that is examined if false Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and Heretical Societies, make part of the Church; and having shewn the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious incumbrances whereunto the <hi>R. C.</hi> cast themselves, in maintaining that an ill man may be a true member of the Church, and even of those Members on whom God confers the Spirit of infallibility. We are taught after what manner the men of the World are in the Church, and may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pastors in it. Mr. <hi>Nicoli</hi> stands here a rude brunt, for he pretends that his efforts do make St. <hi>Augustin</hi> agree with the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastick Divines upon the question, whether the wicked are true Members of the Church, which is full of obvious contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. As to Heretical or Schismatical Societies, it's needless to prove to the <hi>R. C.</hi> that they do not belong to the Church, for they say it often enough, yet without giving good reasons why crimes are more priviledged therein than errors; but the incumbrance which may be in this res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, hindreth not Mr. <hi>Iuricu</hi> from fully examining this matter; he enters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore into the discussion of the Unity of the Church.</p>
                     <p>He maintains, always leaning upon his comparison of human bodies, that all the Sects of Christianity belong really to the body of the Church, and that in this there is no more absurdity, than to maintain that a distemper'd Member is a true part of Mans Body; he asks whence comes the Idea of the Unity which excludes from
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103507:50"/>
the Church all the Christian Societies but one; and he persuades himself that the monstrous errors which are raised in the first Ages, have been the true Origin of this Idea, in accustoming the Orthodox, to think that Hereticks are Members whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly separate from the Body. He adds that St. <hi>Cyp</hi> finding this Idea ready at hand, applyed the same to the Novations, &amp; groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereon such strong reasons against the validity of the Baptism of Hereticks, that nothing of weight was answered him; this occasions the Author to criticise on the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses of St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> antagonists. He shews them that they understood not what the Unity of the Church is. He makes the same reproach to St. <hi>Augustin</hi> and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses him of perplexing himself with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand contradictions in maintaining on one side, that the Baptism of Hereticks is valid, and on the other that they are absolutely separated from the body of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But St. <hi>Ierom</hi> is not so used; it's granted that he has better understood the question, and it's proved by his disputes against the <hi>Lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> that he excluded not from the Church, even all Hereticks. After this it is maintain'd by eleven proofs, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church includes all the Christian Societies which retained the <hi>fundamentals of Christianity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first proof is drawn from the extent which the Word of God promiseth to the Church, for as it is evident that there is no particular Church which hath ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the notion of this extent, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God must either be false or veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themselves by the extent of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in General. Here are refuted the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions of Mr. <hi>Nicole,</hi> upon the extent of the Romish Communion; the second proof is taken out of the places of the Word of God, which foretel that the Church shall have a mixture of good and bad, of wheat and tares, for if crimes hinder not a Christian to be a Member of the true Church, why should error have the fatality to hinder from it? It is surely a pretention that abuses the light of Nature, to say that a Man that kills another is yet a Catholick, but if he blames the retrenchment of the Cup, he is by that very thing Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and banished the whole Communion of the Church; we need only to ask good reasons for this enormous inequality to make the most resolute Doctors sweat. The third proof is drawn from this, that <hi>God keeps the knowledge of the Truth, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Word in Schismatick and erring Societies,</hi> whence we must conclude that God saves Men in it. Other proofs are founded on examples, or on the Opinions and Conduct of the Roman Catholicks. The examples are, the Schisms of the ten Tribes, which continued, as this Author saith, to be the People of God, and the <hi>Iews</hi> that were converted to the Gospel in the Apostles time, and who refused to have any Communion with the converted Gentiles. For the proofs <hi>ad hominem,</hi> they are drawn either from Father <hi>Goar,</hi> or from <hi>Leo Alatius,</hi> who said that the Schismatick Communions of the East are not out of the Church; Or, according to Mr. <hi>Nicole,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral persons have been saved, tho' of the <hi>Arian</hi> Communion, or else the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>Port Royal</hi>; err, <hi>which glory in this point of Transubst antiation, to have Conformed themselves to the Schismaticks</hi>; or, according to the Confession of the Romish Church, <hi>that there is a true Mission and a saving Grace in the other Communions,</hi> so that other sects are Christians; and during the Schism of <hi>Anti-Popes,</hi> the true <hi>Catholicity</hi> was found under divers obediences. Mr. <hi>Nicole</hi> is strongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed upon this Article.</p>
                     <p>Neither is he with less vigour refuted upon the objection which he hath so much boasted of, which is, <hi>that the Vnity of the Church necessarily includes the Vnity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi> It is the first difficulty which Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> examins in his answer to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which may be alledged against his sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem. The 2d. difficulty is found in the 7th. Book of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> upon the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal of Morality, where he saith this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem is that of the indifferency of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but 'tis strongly denyed him, for it's maintained that one cannot be saved in all the Sects of Christianity, and that there are cases, wherein we must separate from them which err, and that we cannot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in all, nor tolerate all, nor pass successively from one unto another. These are great questions, and for to clear them one must have as much wit, and depth of Judgment as Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> has: He makes a thousand fine remarks upon all this, he saith there are two ways which God makes use of to save Men in Heretical Societies, one is the Grace he gives them to discern the true spiritual nourishment from the false. The other is to bear with their faults ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his great mercy. But lest Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should abuse this Doctrine, the Author brings several Cautions which shew that such as throw themselves into the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Rome,</hi> have reason to fear their Souls, and maintains, that it was well done to separate from it, as in the last Age. He speaks much upon the important subject of Toleration, nor will he have Soveraigns deprived of the liberty of reprehending their Heretick subjects in certain cases, nor will he have them that err, have any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of maintaining their pretended Truths, he examines upon this subject, the reasons that have been lately published to maintain the priviledges of a Conscience that really errs, and then passes to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility and perpetuity of the Church: two great questions, upon which he says some things that are both solid and curious. And so much for the first Book.</p>
                     <p>The second runs upon a subject no less important, that is, <hi>upon the Authority of the Church, and analysis of Faith.</hi> The Author begins his proofs against the infallibility of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103507:51"/>
the Church for this reason, that the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church being a Collection of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties that retain its grounds, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, can no ways be infallible, nor has it any need of being unerrable, for every part maintaining that each other part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to it's self, has fallen into error, it follows that the Church being but a Collection of all these parts, whereof the one refutes the rest, is errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all its parts; and that being so, how can it be infallible, or any single part thereof be unerrable. Nor is it less evident that the infallibility of the Church would be to no purpose, because it is not possible that a Congregation of all Christian Sects should clear or decide any difficulty. And it is confessed here <hi>that the unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all Communions to teach a certain truth,</hi> is a kind of infallible judgment given by the Church, and moreover the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a fundamental truth so hard to be agreed upon is consented to; but lest the <hi>Socinians</hi> might come to cross it, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that neither they, nor the Fanaticks have any share in it, nor yet the other Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries of these times. After this the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Councils is spoken of, and divers reflections made thereon: The Councils are considered different ways. 1. Either as the meeting of wise Men, that have a mind mutually to instruct each other; and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their knowledge. 2. As com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned Law-makers that Assemble for to regulate the form of Government, 3. As Judges established by their Church to learn the prevarications of Religious Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The first of these relations belong to them in respect of matters of Faith, the 2d. In respect of ordering of Discipline, and the 3d. in respect of censures and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; this is exactly ordered, and helps to resolve a thousand great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the submission Christians owe unto Councils, and upon the infallibility that M. <hi>Meaux</hi> maintains that Protestants attribute to Councils. M. <hi>Nicole</hi> goes farther, for he affirms that they attribute the gift of infallibility to each faithful person to refute him; he is given to understand by several examples that it is not necessary to think ones self infallible to be convinced of any Opinion, and because the knot of the difficulty lies in this, that they which are deceived are no less convinced than the Orthodox, the Author acknowledges, <hi>that the Characters cannot be precisely shewn which distinguish the false and true perswasions,</hi> and at the same time says, that <hi>these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are real, and make themselves apparent.</hi> It is good faith that can convince the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick that Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> is none of those Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertists whereof M. <hi>Simon</hi> gives us such ugly Ideas, I would say of those that wou'd rather dye, than acknowledge that they cannot clear precisely this or that difficulty. He gives us at the same time many instructions upon the manner, how hearing and reading the Word of God, conducts infallibly into the Truth, those in whom the Holy Ghost works by an efficacious Grace, but lest people may confound the infallibility that is produced by this Grace, with the privileged infallibility which was belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Apostles, he teaches us the marks whereby to distinguish them, after which he fully answers two objections, that were proposed to make the Protestant Church seem to become to the highest pitch of impertinence. For it was objected that a private Person, how ignorant soever he could be, should be assured according to their principles, that he can understand the true sense of Scripture, better than all the Church besides, and that he owes no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to Church, or Council, unless he sees by his own proper light, that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision is good; all these difficulties are solidly answered and made to disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                     <p>The reader sees that hitherto M. <hi>Iurieu</hi> has met with several difficulties in his way, but they are but trifles to what he must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter now, for he is going to answer objections that relate to the way of <hi>examen,</hi> and that are without any dispute the main strength of M. <hi>Nicole.</hi> He answers them first indirectly, and argues almost thus. <hi>We must go to the knowledge of Scripture either by Authority, or by way of</hi> examen, <hi>but it is impossible that Authority should conduct us to it, therefore we must make use of the way of</hi> examen. He proves the <hi>minor</hi> in shewing, that upon Earth there is no infallible and speaking Authority; and tho' there were, it would be impossible to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to it, because it cannot be known, by any certain sign of necessary truth. It is the bravest Field in the World where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Enemy is led without having any place to retreat to, so that if there were able and disinterested Judges, as the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> and <hi>Aristoteleans</hi> were, to observe the strokes given, there are no People in the World they would despise so much, as the Christians, whereof they would see the greatest part brag of a Doctrine that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep the Field one Moment in sight of the Enemy, and which nevertheless sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues every day some of the other party, upon this may be well said, the absurdity which <hi>Sandaicat</hi> published concerning the Battle of <hi>Cerisoles les Spagnales victoriosos se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinder,</hi> however it be, let us mark in a few words what the Author does here.</p>
                     <p>He shews that if Faith did not enter the Soul, but by the way of Authority M. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole</hi> would have it, the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church should never have had any good assurance of the Will of God, as well because there was not in a long time any Prophet or other infallible Tribunal that declared it, as that the Authority of the Prophets themselves might have been suspected to be false, &amp; that amidst the most famous Miracles; because there was none that could infallibly assure them, that these Miracles came from God, or from the Devil. These dreadful diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties

are pushed to the time of Jesus Christ himself and his Apostles; and it's shewn that according to the Roman Church the <hi>Iews</hi> would have had no reason to be converted to it. The same thing is shewn in respect of following ages; in a word, it is maintained against M. <hi>Nicole,</hi> that his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is the great road to <hi>Pyrrhonisme,</hi> and Atheism, because for to trust well the way of Authority, we must know it well; but very few could be able to come to the requisite assurance by the way of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen</hi> upon this subject, and to the end that the difficulty should come to be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable, the Author has invincibly refuted all that M. <hi>Nicole</hi> brought to prove that the Authority of the Church makes it self easily known, so that here is the way of Authority quite shut up; by what way then will people enter into the Faith? must it be by <hi>examen?</hi> if that be the way M. <hi>Iurieu</hi> must take away the Obstacles that M. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole</hi> has put in it, and he must answer dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, for to answer by retortions, as was observ'd by a Modern Author, is to furnish <hi>Deists</hi> with the best Arms that they ever yet made use of, and is to compleat what M. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole</hi> has begun, for the dullest amongst them would say after he had seen Mr. <hi>Nicoles</hi> book, and what we have mentioned of Mr. <hi>Iurieu,</hi> that seeing <hi>God has not made Man capable of choosing without rashness, the only Religion that is Good, it is evident that he has Revealed us nothing of it, but has left it to our Education and Natural light</hi>; therefore of necessity to disarm these Libertines, he must answer directly to what Mr. <hi>Nicole</hi> says, and let us see how he will behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                     <p>He accuses his adversaries argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the way of <hi>examen,</hi> of two great faults; one that it supposeth no help from the Holy Ghost to them who meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scripture; the other that he supposes a Cartesian principle that would entirely ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine all Religions if it were applyed to Moral knowledge; this principle is, <hi>that we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing but what we understand clearly &amp; distinctly, and to be lawfully assured that we have attained this evidence, we must first have examined a thing all manner of ways, and must have known that it could not have been other ways.</hi> Our Author says that this condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impossible in regard of most People, and yet all men being obliged to be firmly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of their Religion, it follows, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not subject to these preliminary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which <hi>Des Cartes</hi> only requires for the objects of speculation. The Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants believe they can draw great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from M. <hi>Nicoles</hi> objections, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they believe that for to answer him, the points of Faith must be reduced to a very little number of Articles, clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Word of God, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor says that this answer would cure no evil, because to be assured to that degree of certainty which is required by Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole,</hi> that Jesus Christ came into this World, we must examine, according to the <hi>Cartesiaen</hi> method, whether the Gospel be a feigned Book or no, and hear all that is said by the Wicked upon this Subject, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all the moral demonstrations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the certainty of things done, is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Moreover, we must be assured by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical reasons and by good answers to <hi>Spinoza's Systeme,</hi> that Man acts freely, that he has an immortal Soul, and that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares pains and recompences: Where are Tradesmen or Peasants who are capable of so long a dispute pushed to a contradictory decree? So that this cannot be the way to answer well, for if we did but retain one or two Articles of our Creed, we should have enough to do to render our selves certain of them according to <hi>des Cartes</hi> method. And all this shews that Mr. <hi>Nicoles</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought not to be applyed to matters of Religion. And he is shewn several other very inconvenient consequences of this principle, and it is concluded that Faith does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon an <hi>examen</hi> of discussion, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an <hi>examen</hi> of attention, the effects whereof are Learnedly explained in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner how Divine Truths are imprinted in our understanding; this is very fine, and gives us a second example of Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi>'s sincerity, for without troubling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self whether Mr. <hi>Nicole</hi> will brag of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obliged the Ministers to quit their ground, he leaves him wholly to the <hi>examin</hi> of discussion, and maintains that this was not what he ought to have disputed against, and he answers an objection of Mr. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> whether there be a time, wherein a Christian may doubt of the Truths of Scripture, and that according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the reformed Church.</p>
                     <p>Let us say a word upon the last Book of this answer; the Author has not so much indifference for Mr. <hi>Nicole,</hi> but he has taken care to hinder his too great brags of the full victory that he has had in several cases upon the <hi>examen</hi> of discussion, and says that this victory is but of little use to Papists, but that it furnisheth Weapons to <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> to combate the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Moreover, he is not of Opinion, that all the Arguments that were thundered against the <hi>examen</hi> of discussion, are good, and as to what concerns the way of feeling, and this ray that he has so much laught at, he is shewn that there is no reason to be so merry upon that word, that there are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things in Scripture which are known by the way of feeling, and that it is no suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Argument against it, to say that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Hereticks daily, for the Author says, if it deceives them, it is because it is not assisted by an interiour Grace from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, as when we feel the light of Truth: besides this he maintains that the most simple were able to know what was requisite to make them quit the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Communion. In fine he shews the analysis of Faith according to St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and he answers Mr. <hi>Nicole</hi> in several things

concerning the calling of the first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and the Schism whereof some would fain have convinced them, he answers him I say in all this, and accuseth him of a thousand frivolous quibbles, unworthy both of a Man of Honour and a witty Man.</p>
                     <p>I do not doubt but many of my readers may not understand what <hi>the analysis of Faith is.</hi> Let us then say that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by these words, the reducing of Faith to its first principles, that it is a Metaphor borrow'd from Chymists, who call <hi>Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> the Operation that disunites the parts of a compound body, setting apart the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients until they come to the most simple parts; so to make the <hi>Analysis</hi> of Faith is nothing else, but to mount by degrees to its beginning, and to the first reasons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is grounded, and in this the Religions of the West are very different, for tho' it is very true that the Protestants and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks being questioned <hi>why they believe the Trinity,</hi> agree in answering that it is <hi>because God has revealed it in Scripture,</hi> but if you ask them this other question, <hi>how they do know that God has revealed it in Scripture,</hi> their answer will be very different, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick will answer that it is, <hi>because he is told that the Roman Church finds the meaning of Trinity in certain passages of Scripture,</hi> but the Protestant will say, <hi>it is because he finds that these passages signify the Trinity,</hi> whence it follows that the Faith of a R. C. is grounded on the Authority of the Church, &amp; that of a Protestant upon the very Light which he finds in the Object proposed by Scripture. There are but few who trouble themselves with this <hi>Analysis,</hi> they content themselves well enough with believing what they have a feeling of. Moreover, it is a great question with Roman Catholicks, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Analysis</hi> of Faith they must stop at the Pope, or go on to the Council. <hi>Gregory of Valence,</hi> in his <hi>Analysis Fidei Catholicae,</hi> maintains firmly that they are to stop at the Pope.

We shall not speak of them that are insensibly spread all over the Book, but stick to such as form a new entire and well distinguished Member. The first of these Additions is in the Preface, and serves for an Answer to two complaints, the one treats on the fear that new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts may entertain in their state of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, in hopes of a great Reformation in a little time; the other is of what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has said, of the <hi>reign of a thousand years</hi>; he answers to the first of these complaints, and proves too much, because he proves, that God never promised the deliverance of the Church, and that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to the Jews the near Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which God revealed to him; he adds, that God thought it convenient to keep the Knowledge of certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies from Men, to the end, that they might not shun them, but that at other times, he thinks it convenient that we may be aiding in procuring the Effect and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; he says, that as it would be the sign of the last Judgment, to drink of stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and impoison'd Waters, in hopes, that they might be purified in two or three years, so it would be a disorder both of Mind and Heart, that would be very strange, to stick to the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in hopes that in some years it might be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. As for the other point, he admires that some have made a noise against the reign of a thousand years, and declares that he will patiently wait for it, altho' some have threatned to complain of it, and he is not ashamed in this to be of the opinion of <hi>Cocceius.</hi>

                           </gap>ts spoke of in the first book, it would dart a great light upon each of the Visions.</hi> He refutes them that believe that the seven Epistles of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> to the seven Principal Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> are Prophetick; and his opinion is, that the opening of the great Theatre of the Visions of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> was but at the fourth Chap. of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> He finds that it begins like that of the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> and he stops chiefly at the four beasts, and at the twenty four ancients, that are about the Throne of God. After this, he gives us an Observation, which is called the Key of the Apocalypse. This whole Book is but a Paraphrase upon what <hi>Daniel</hi> says, in the seventh Chapter of his <hi>Revelations</hi> about the four Beasts; he explains the systeme of the seven Seals, and the seven Trumpets, in great and small, and always by very inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and happy Suppositions: and all that relates to the destiny of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, to the day of Judgment. What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and what has been explain'd, in the first Edition, relates to the Church, and the Antichristian Empire, which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the bowels of the Church. The third Addition comprehends the 14, 15, and 16 Chapters, and applies to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Papists, the second Chapter of the second to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the 13<hi>th.</hi> and 17.

                     <p>The fourth Addition is very curious, and of importance to the Author, it is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the 15. Chapter of the second Tome; and answers to a remark made by a great many people, that things are spoken of here with great assurance, which ought not to have been proposed but as conjectures; he says, that it will be known some day, what made him speak after so decisive a manner, and with such confidence; but in the mean time, he would be willing that three things were considered. <hi>First,</hi> That he does not speak of the most part of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents that are to happen yet, with so much Assurance as is thought. The <hi>Second,</hi> That whereas he has declared in proper terms, that he consents willingly, that that may pass with the Readers as conjectures. It is reasonable, that he may have the liberty of believing what he sees, or what he thinks he sees in the Prophets writings. The <hi>Third,</hi> That before we censure him of rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, upon what he so confidently believes, that we are at the end of the 1260 years of the Reign of Antichrist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his principles are to be considered and examined together; but because the Readers may chuse whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will take notice of this last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance, when there is any pains to be taken in finding out the connexion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Principles, that are here and there in that great Volume; the Author eases them by summing up his Principles, and their Consequences, and after he has shewed their connexion, he concludes, that it is impossible that false conjectures should meet always; and that chance should unite one or two hundred upon the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                     <p>Whatever strength of Reason is in the Explication of these matters, Philosophers will not find what they will look for, but if they stop at the fifth Addition, they will find that Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> has laboured for them as well as for others; that he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for them the Conclusion of his work as a relishing piece, and the highest point of Meditation. The Title of this Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix is, <hi>An Essay of Mystical Divinity,</hi> where are seen proofs of the greatest mysteries of Religion drawn from Nature. This max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im is first settled, that God applies his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to all Beings, and that from this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication comes an Impression that makes the Divinity, and all its Mysteries appear every where. After that he declares, that this Truth may be ascertained by three Examples, that will shew that the Union of the Father with the Word, the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Trinity of the Persons in the Unity of Essence, and the Incarnation of the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are three Mysteries, whereof the Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were stamp'd in Nature. To shew this, the Author begins to consider the History of the Creation, and after having said in general, that these three Mysteries are found there, he examines in particular <hi>Adams</hi> Marriage, as the Image of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Father with the Son, shewing seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fine Relations of these two matters; then he raises himself to the higher Worlds, and he finds there the same marks, that he found below, for he finds that the Union of Matter and Motion is a kind of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which resembles much that of <hi>Adam</hi>; and the same resemblance appears yet more in the Union of the Spirit of God with what is called Nature, and in the Union of Jesus Christ with the Church. See then four Impressions of the Union of the Eternal Father with the Son, one in the Marriage of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>; one in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Matter and Motion, and in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the sensible World considered in its self; one in the Union of the Spirit of God with Nature, and this belongs to the sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble World, considered as united with the intellectual World; and the last in the World purely intelligible, or in the Union of Jesus Christ with the Church, ascending higher even to the infinitely perfect Spirit; we shall find not only the Impression, but the Seal it self, not a Copy or Image, but the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal: We shall find the Father united with the Eternal Wisdom, upon which there are several remarks. This is the first of the three Mysteries. The second, which is the Trinity of Persons, was not imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in fewer Subjects, and has not made fewer Copies of the Archetype and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Seal. We are shewn here, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103507:53"/>
(1.) In Spirits, which are think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and understanding Substances, that is, these Qualities are Essential to them, and they have a Will, which is their active principle, (2.) In the Light, for we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve three things in it, <hi>viz.</hi> a luminous Body, Brightness, and Heat, (3.) In Bodies, for they have three Dimensions, length, depth, and breadth, all this is still clearer by three great parallels; whereof the last is, what was published in the Novels of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1685. the others may be judged of by this, so we will not give an account, which could not be well done without transcribing the whole.</p>
                     <p>As for the Mystery of the Incarnation Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> does not meet with many Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Creature; he finds but one, and that so strong, that it is equivalent to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; it is the union of the humane Soul with an organized Body, the parallel he gives between the Incorporation of this Soul, and the Incarnation of the Word is a very Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the resemblances that a great Wit can imagine between these two things. A curious reflection upon the Reason, <hi>Why God said, let us make a man after our own likeness,</hi> worthily shuts up these parallels.</p>
                     <p>When the Author published in the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Novels, that of the Trinity, and of the three Dimensions of Bodies, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the learned to send in their Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that they might do it the more freely, he does not name himself, he thought he should receive many; but whether it was, that the Orthodox had rather acquiesce to the Reasons that favoured them, than by examining them, to expose their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to doubt, or whether they found the thoughts convincing, or whether it was that the Hereticks had not wit enough to oppose these difficulties; or did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the strength of this proof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore despised it, or whether other reasons work't upon them both, there was but one man that sent in Objections. <hi>First,</hi> He sent those that are in the Nouvelles of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi> 1685. and a little afterwards, he sent some that were never printed. M. <hi>Iurieu</hi> examines them here after one another, and refutes them with his usual acuteness; the Author of these Objections having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the Journal of <hi>September,</hi> that no more wou'd be publisht upon this Subject; but what was sent shou'd only be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Author of the Parallelle, he writ again in Anonymy as before, that tho' he saw nothing easier than to reply, upon what was objected, yet he would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, because of the Intentions which were published: Now he will find the lists o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and if the Glory of disputing against a famous Antagonist (that has at last named himself) does not tempt him, there will be reason to believe that he has but little to reply against his strong Answers.</p>

At first there occur very general differences, as when plants are divided into <hi>Trees, Shrubs</hi> and <hi>Herbs,</hi> as Animals are distinguished into four-footed Beasts, Birds, Fishes, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But each one of these kinds is too general, because it comprehends under it, an almost infinite number of Species altogether different. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it's impossible, that they which will know in particular all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals or Plants, shou'd burden their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with so great a number of Specie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. There must be found a mean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these Extreams.

                        <p>'Tis this, that Mr. <hi>Raius</hi> undertakes in his <hi>new method of Plants,</hi> and in his <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

Mr. <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> acknowledges, that the different dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of the parts, furnish these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal differences and maintains, that the flowers and what environs them below, which he calls <hi>Perianthium,</hi> also furnish very essential differences upon divers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, as well as the order of the leaves which are along the stalk, and a figure of the root.

buttons, that are put at the bottom of Spindles to make them turn, and which the Latins call <hi>Verticilla.</hi> After the same manner are distinguished Plants, that are called <hi>Asperifoliae</hi> or rough Leaves, that differ from the <hi>Verticillatae</hi> in this, that the Leaves which are along the Stalk do not altogether encompass it, nor are all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the same order. The Roots dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer amongst themselves in this, that some are Fibrous and Thready, the other are like buttons; that is to say, round and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid as <hi>Radishes.</hi> The others are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of divers Tunicles or Skins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one over the other, as Onions, or disposed after the manner of <hi>Flower de luce.</hi> We must then examine all these Plants, that we may not confound them in the establishment of their kinds.</p>
                        <p>Those that have never applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to <hi>Botanicks</hi> cannot presently see what the use of this method is, and may judge to be only a dalliance of wit. It's notwithstanding most true, that nothing more useful could have been imagined, nor more proper for the acquisition of the Knowledge of Plants. One finds, for example, walking in a Garden, a Plant never seen before, and hath none to tell him the Name on't, and knoweth not whether it be a Forreign or Native one. If he had the most exact, and the most universal <hi>Herbal</hi> that can be imagined, it may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he may look it all over, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding the Plant he seeks for, unless he takes the pains to read all the Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions after one another, and to compare this Plant with the Figures; he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably spend too much time, unless by chance he meets it on a sudden. On the contrary, according to the method of Mr. <hi>Raius,</hi> he only need take notice of the marks whereof we now speak, and to seek for the Plant in Question, in his <hi>Herbal</hi> amongst those that are of a like Character. If it hath been described, it will be infallibly found in the Rank, and under the kind it ought to be. Not but that there are <hi>Anomal</hi> Plants, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell where to range them: but if any of this Nature be found, it must be sought for in a particular book of the second Tome of Mr. <hi>Raius,</hi> where he hath put those whose Character was ambiguous.</p>
                        <p>The Author having made a Collection of all those, who have written before him, whether of the Plants of <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> of <hi>Africk,</hi> or <hi>America</hi>; it may be said, that nothing will scape this Herbal, when there are Figures, That will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly render it a little dear, but whatever it costs, when all these Figures will be in it, it will not cost the tenth part of what all the Herbals would, which it comprehendeth. There are divers, which are no more to be found, or which are extreamly dear, as <hi>Fabius Columna,</hi> which is but a small one, in 4 <hi>to.</hi>

The Reader ought moreover to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark in general the method of Mr. <hi>Raius,</hi> that it hath been invented, but to avoid Confusion, and to help the Memory. It would be ridiculous to imagine that, by the means of some Divisions and Subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions drawn from the exteriour figure of Plants, their nature is throughly known: as the Philosophers of Schools imagined to know all by the means of the <hi>Vniversals</hi> and <hi>Categories,</hi> into which they reduced well or ill all the Beings that they knew. They did the same thing as a man would do, who for to know the forces of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, would carefully observe what colours the Cloaths of the Souldiers were that shou'd compose it, and should believe he could judge thereby of the enterprizes of this Army. The Truth is, that we know but the outside of things, and some of the Effects they produce, whilst the inside re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in such Obscurity, as all our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge cannot dissipate; so we cannot distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the Species, but by some outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances which cannot be so much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, but very gros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>THis new Edition of the Works of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Francis Pitheas,</hi> is added, by the care of Mr. <hi>Pellatier</hi> Comptroller Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Kings Exchequer, to the Works of <hi>Peter Pitheas</hi> his great Grand-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This Family was originally of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> and we find the Name of <hi>William Pitheas</hi> in the Catalogue of the Gentlemen of that Province; who made the Voyage to the Holy Land, in the year 1190. since they retired into the Countrey; and <hi>Peter Pitheas,</hi> who was Advocate in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris</hi> rendered himself so famous by his profound Learning, that they called him the <hi>Varro</hi> of his Age. He was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Procurer General of the Chamber of Justice the King established in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and after having refused the same place in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> he returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he contributed much to the Resubmission of this great City under the Obedience of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. The most part of his and his Brother <hi>Francis</hi>'s Works had been printed. But there were some others, upon which <hi>Francis</hi> wrought since the death of his Brother; and not having time to print them, he gave them to <hi>Anthony Alain</hi> his Friend who kept them a long time; and at last they came into the hands of Mr. <hi>Pelletier,</hi> who knowing how precious the Relicks of these great men of Letters are,

hath himself assisted in the Work, and given the publick this mark of his Love to Sciences. So we find in this Edition with another in Folio of <hi>Francis Pithou,</hi> which is the, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex Canonum vetus Ecclesiae Romanae notis il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustratus; Parisiis ex Typographia Regia,</hi> 1687.

                     <p>IF there be Plagiaries, who attribute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselves the works of others, whether it is in translating them into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Language, or in publishing the same things in another order, and under another Name, the Publick may be assured that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> is not of this number. He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes not his Works to the fertility of his imagination, and suffers us not to doubt, that they are fruits of his reading: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most at every Period he cites the Authors, whence he hath taken what he saith. We see therein passages of Scripture, Fathers Scholastick Doctors, Canonists, Catholick and Protestant Divines, Lawyers, Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Philosophers, Historians, ancient and modern Poets, Humanists, Criticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in case the Citations are as faithful, as they appear exact, this work may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry useful to find passages or Authorities, which men want sometimes: we shall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explain the Subject thereof.</p>
                     <p>It is divided into two parts, the first whereof treats in nine Chapters <hi>of those who love Books.</hi> 1. He begins by relating the Names <hi>of some persons who have Written,</hi> or became famous by their Works; and then passeth to the manner of describing how the Books of the Ancients were made, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and form of their Volumes, after which he sheweth that the fair sex is not desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of learned Persons, and that well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red study cannot be displeasing to Women, 2. <hi>The multitude of Books</hi> is the subject of the second Chapter. He speaks herein of those Libraries, which have made most noise, and of the Invention of Printing. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines whether this prodigious quantity of Writings, and great Reading spoils sound sense. 3. He gives rules to prevent the falling upon bad Authors, by marking, 1. That we ought not to Write with haste. 2. That we ought to propose general max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims and leave the application thereof to the Reader: which is the Origin of Apologies and Fables. 3. That the Style ought to be modest, sweet and moderate, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he much diaspproves the heat of most of the Controvertists, and the false delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of some Divines, who make capital errours of every thing, and who as soon as they see any, stumble, or to swerve from their Opinion, endeavour to make him be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as an Enemy to Truth, to the good of the State and the Salvation of Souls. 4. He sheweth that order is the life of Books, and that those who have no method, have but confused Ideas of what they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth Chapter he examines wherein consists the solidity of Writing. In the 5th. How clear it ought to be. In the 6th. He shews how briefness is acceptable, and the difference there is betwixt <hi>Plagiaries, Centons,</hi> and those who make a judicious use of their learning. In the 7th. he treats of Reading in general, and proves that it is so far from doing any injury to Divines, that they cannot throughly understand the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred nor Ecclesiastical Authors, if they are not well acquainted with profane Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The 8th. speaks of the choice of books, and how to read them with advantage; and the 9th. of several famous Library-keepers, and of divers Princes, who favoured Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The second Part treats in five Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. 1. Of the hatred People have for books, and of its principal causes, sloath, avarice; 2. The love of novelty which makes us despise the labours of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. 3. The pride and foolish vanity of the Learned, who contemn one another. 4. The mutual envy they bear one another. 5. In fine he endeavours to find the means to shelter Authors from the envy, or hatred which may be conceived against their Works, and speaks of the different destiny of books. We have two other Treatises of our Author, <hi>Otia Theologica &amp; Concionator Sacer.</hi>

                     <p>TIS not above Ten or Twelve Years since the Celebrated Mr. <hi>Spon</hi> gave a very handsom Relation of this Voyage to the <hi>Levant,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Wheeler.</hi> Which hath receiv'd such applause from the Publick, that there's no reason to fear this will be less wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. For as Mr. <hi>Wheeler</hi>'s Curiosity hath carry'd him to many more Subjects than the other has treated on, so he likewise having made a longer abode in those Countries that he describes, has much more enriched and diversifyed his History. Whereas Mr. <hi>Spon</hi> engaged himself chiefly to the Observation of the Monuments of Antiquity, and made it his particular Study; It may be said of our Author, that he forgot nothing that was considerable in any place he pass'd through, of what nature soever. With the exact De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions he hath given of the Principal Monuments he saw, he has very agreeably added an Account of all the Plants of each place, the Cities, most of the Villages, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Plains, Sea-Ports, Rivers, and all that he met with remarkable in his Voyage. He carefully observed the Genius, Manners, and Religion of the Inhabitants; the nature and price of the Commodities of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what Foreign Goods sell there to the best Advantage; with the distance of the Ways; and many other things of this nature. As he opened that, both the Old and New Geographers were deceiv'd in the Situation of divers places, so he Marks what he thought the most agreeable to Truth. He gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the trouble to draw out a new Map of <hi>Achaia,</hi> incomparably more Correct than was ever seen before.</p>
                     <p>The whole Work is divided into two Books, each of which is subdivided into three others. The first contains, 1. The History of our Authors Voyage from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> 2. A Description of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> the Neighbouring places and their Antiquities. 3. The particulars of his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age through the <hi>Lesser Asia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the second Book is comprehended, 1. The Voyage from <hi>Zant</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> and through divers parts of <hi>Greece.</hi> 2. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Athens,</hi> and it's Antiquities. 3. Several Voyages from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Corinth, &amp;c.</hi> With an Account of whatsoever he saw re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable therein.</p>
                     <p>Being at <hi>Venice</hi> that these two Illustrious Friends entred upon their Voyage together, Mr. <hi>Wheeler</hi> thought he was oblig'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his History with a short Description of the Original of this great Republick, of it's Progress, Losses, and in fine the Estate it was in at 1675. when they were there. The first considerable Place they visited in their course was <hi>Pola,</hi> where they found divers Monuments of Antiquity, which evidently shew'd it to be one of the Antientest Towns of <hi>Istria,</hi> and that it was formerly a free State. At one of the best places of <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> which is the Chief City thereof, call'd <hi>Zara,</hi> they found nothing less considerable; which place is more secured by the number and courage of the <hi>Morlaques,</hi> the natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Country, of whom the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the Garison are compos'd, than by the goodness of it's Fortifications; they having an irreconcilable hatred to the <hi>Turks.</hi> But one of the most curious Pieces of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity that this Country affords, is the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of a Palace that <hi>Dioclesian</hi> caus'd to be built near <hi>Salone,</hi> which was the place of his Birth, that he might pass the rest of his Life in this happy Retirement, when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Empire.</p>
                     <p>Those who have form'd an advantagious Idea of <hi>Ithica,</hi> because it was the Country of <hi>Vlysses,</hi> and the particular place of his Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, will be surpriz'd to hear our Author affirm it to be a pittiful little Isle, that wou'd be a perfect Desert, if a People they call <hi>Thiaki</hi> went not from time to time to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate it. In this last is seen the Ruines of an Old Castle, which the <hi>Thiaki</hi> pretend was formerly the Palace of <hi>Vlysses. Samos,</hi> that's now known only under the Name of <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> was the greatest Isle under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of this Prince: For according to Mr. <hi>Wheeler,</hi> 'tis 60 Leagues in Circumference, altho' <hi>Strabo</hi> allowed it to be but 300 Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, which makes not above 19 Leagues, and <hi>Pliny</hi> but 22 Leagues. <hi>Zant,</hi> formerly call'd <hi>Zacynthos,</hi> is nothing nigh so large, since the utmost extent is but 15 Leagues. 'Tis very fruitful, and nothing cou'd be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make it more agreeable, were it not for the Earthquakes which in the greatest part of the Spring are very often twice a week. From this Island now comes the greatest part of those Raisins without Stones, that they call Corants, the Plant of which Fruit is not like our Gooseberrys, as without reason has been an Opinion generally receiv'd; but a Vine differing very little from the other sort of <hi>Raisins.</hi> At the foot of one o'the Hills of this Island is a Fountain, which to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, casts forth with it's streams that are very bright and clear, lumps of Pitch in Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities so great, that every Year they fill 90 Barrels therewith. The Inhabitants profess the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion. And instead of a Bishop which they will not admit of, they have a <hi>Protopapa</hi> as they call him, that is, an Arch-Priest. The Piety that our Author makes appear throughout this whole work, obliges him to complain of the little care that those of its Nation have taken to form an Ecclesiastical Body, and maintain a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor therein.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Delos</hi> is the most celebrated Isle of all the Cyclades. It is two or three Leagues about, is also very full of Rocks, and by consequence Barren. And at present an uninhabited De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert. Tho' there still remain some Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103507:55"/>
of it's Antient Splendor. The most remarkable is a Pile of White Marble, on which the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> was supposed to be built. 'Tis otherwise with <hi>Sestos</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydos,</hi> whereof there remains not the least Footsteps to be found, what is now called the <hi>Old Castles of Rometia and Anatolia,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built in the same places, nor having any mark of Antiquity. <hi>Gallipoli,</hi> which is also near, hath preserved very few of 'em: But at <hi>Lampsaque,</hi> which hath still kept it's Name, and at <hi>Heraclea,</hi> are many more to be found.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Constantinople</hi> having been above Twelve Ages, the Seat of the Eastern Empire, Mr. <hi>Wheeler</hi> thought he cou'd not be too large in describing of it. Many Writings being extant of the same nature, I shall observe in our Author only what's the most curious. 'Tis thought, that <hi>Titus Livy</hi>'s Works are all entire in the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Library. But Mr. <hi>Wheeler</hi> being inquisitive about it himself, offer'd, as he assures us, great Sums to the <hi>Bacha,</hi> who hath the charge of the Books, yet cou'd not procure a sight of it. One of the greatest Conveniences they have for Travellers at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and almost every where throughout <hi>Turky,</hi> is the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Houses to entertain Strangers; which they call <hi>Karavan-Seras</hi> or <hi>Kans,</hi> where Persons may live as well as they please, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commonly near 'em Shops that afford all things necessary at a reasonable Price. It is true, the greatest part of 'em are like Barns, and have about the Walls what they call a <hi>Sopha,</hi> a Foot and a half high for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers to lye thereon. But those which are now built in Cities or great Towns, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more commodious, having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Apartments all distinguish'd from each other. Our Author wishes the like conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies were establish'd amongst Christians, which wou'd cut off many useless Expences, and be a Remedy for several Disorders that occur from the contrary.</p>
                     <p>The Patriarchal Church is an obscure Edifice, without Beauty or any considerable Ornaments: And the Patriarchs <hi>Palace</hi> is not larger than one of the most despicable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Houses in <hi>London.</hi> This Prelates Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit also is very plain, and little differing from the ordinary garb of <hi>Caloyers,</hi> or of the Monks of St. <hi>Basil.</hi> Nevertheless, 'tis hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be credited with what earnestness this Dignity is sought after: And how dearly those that aspire thereto, pay for it to the Grand Visier, who to make it the most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous he can, often upon the least pretence turns out those he has lately put in, to sell it to others; so that sometimes there have been five Patriarchs in the space of 5 Years. The Celebration of the Eucharist, Mr. <hi>Wheeler</hi> saith, is an Act of Religion, wherein the <hi>Greeks</hi> appear the most devout, yet he thinks it impossible to determine exactly, what is their general Opinion upon this Subject. At some places they hold Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as at <hi>Corfou,</hi> and at <hi>Zant.</hi> But he assures us, the Bishop of <hi>Salone,</hi> and the Convent of St. <hi>Luke</hi> in <hi>Beotia,</hi> believes in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only, <hi>a Spiritual and Efficacious Presence</hi>; and as he found none that received the word <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> or of <gap reason="foreign">

'Tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sad to see the deplorable Estate the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are there reduced to, who having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly defended their Liberty as much as they cou'd, are now constrain'd to pay dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the others of <hi>Caratch,</hi> or Tribute, as 9 or 10 <hi>Piastres</hi> by the Year, the <hi>Caratch</hi> being commonly but five, or four and a half to the rest.</p>
                     <p>The first of these famous Cities of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyps</hi> that our Author arrived at, was <hi>Thyatira,</hi> a place well peopled with <hi>Turks,</hi> but not above 10 or 12 <hi>Christians</hi> therein: The antient stately Buildings of Marble ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been for a long time buryed in their own Ruines, and the place fill'd with low despicable Houses, it's Name was almost forgotten, but at length was discovered by some old Inscriptions that were dug out of the Earth. It is not so with <hi>Smyrna:</hi> For that being a very fruitful Soil, and situated advantageously for Commerce, they have taken care to keep it in it's former Splendor, by rebuilding each place as it fell to decay; nevertheless, it was overturn'd six times by Earth-Quakes, and it's final Ruine, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an Old Tradition, is expected by a seventh. A greater Number of Christians inhabited there, in a much better Estate than in any of the seven Churches, <hi>Philadelphia</hi> only excepted. Many <hi>Camelions</hi> are in that place, which obliges our Author to give us
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103507:55"/>
a very exact Description of'em. At <hi>Ephesus</hi> all the Earth is covered with pieces of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Pedestals, Pillars, and all the Ruines of the handsomest and most antient Architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: This City which was formerly the Capital of <hi>Asia,</hi> so famous, and populous, is not the receptacle at this day of more than 40 or 50 <hi>Turkish</hi> Families, who live in miserable Tenements, without having so much as one Christian amongst 'em. Which sorrowful Object drew Tears from our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: When he there saw that Threatning accomplisht, that Jesus Christ had made to this Church when flourishing, <hi>To remove it's Candlestick from it's place.</hi> It fares little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with <hi>Pergamus</hi>; whose Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly so fine, is now composed but of 12 or 15 Families of poor dejected Christians. <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> has no way the Advantage. Once the Capital of <hi>Craesus</hi>'s Kingdom, is now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat only of Beggars and Vagabonds, which have a few Christians amongst 'em, who serve only as Slaves to these Infidels. But the Desolation of <hi>Laodicea</hi> surpasses all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for it is absolutely destroyed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted. There are still at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> 200 Christian Families, who have four Churches where they assemble together; which our pious Author omits not the observing, that 'tis an effect of the promises that Jesus Christ had made to this Church, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it in the time of Tryal that shou'd come upon all the World.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Greece,</hi> which he afterwards travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into, presented him with a Picture not less sorrowful for the Inconstancy and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of humane Things, than that of <hi>Natolia.</hi> It was no small trouble to Mr. <hi>Spon,</hi> and to himself, that they cou'd not find the place where <hi>Delphos</hi> formerly stood; and after a great deal of care and diligent Search, they perceiv'd some Old Inscriptions that testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied this City, once so famous, was now a Village call'd <hi>Castri</hi> upon the Hill of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Athens</hi> has not perfectly shared the same Fate. It at least retains it's Old Name; for the <hi>Greeks</hi> still call it <hi>Athini</hi>; and not <hi>Satines,</hi> or <hi>Saitenes,</hi> as it is now read in the Modern Maps. 'Tis 2 or 3 Leagues in Circumference, and is possess'd by eight or ten thousand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, who are all naturally of a great Wit and Politeness. Tho' there remains no sign of it's Antient Splendour, but the Ruines of some Rich Places and Noble Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents; Mr. <hi>Wheeler</hi> assures us next to <hi>Rome,</hi> 'tis a place that surpasses all the world for curious Pieces of Antiquity. The chief of which he describes very exactly. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves amongst other things, that there is in the <hi>Acropolis,</hi> which is the Citadel, the Ruines of a Temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> the Front of which is adorned with Historical Figures round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, to an admirable Beauty. Likewise he hath not forgot to mention the <hi>Stadium,</hi> where they celebrate the Publick Games call'd <hi>Panathenaica,</hi> 'Tis built all with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in length about 120 Geometrical Paces, in breadth 26 or 27; which had two paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel sides, and was enclos'd Eastward, and opened exactly at the opposite Point. Yet saith, he cou'd have no certainty of the Place where the <hi>Areopagite</hi> was, no more than many others, related to us in the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of former Times.</p>
                     <p>The Mount <hi>Hymetta,</hi> which is but three or four Leagues from <hi>Athens,</hi> is the most noted for it's Honey, which is indeed the best of all <hi>Greece. Megara,</hi> is but a small Village, with very pitiful Houses, cover'd with Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots and Turfs thereon: And there's nothing remains of the Antient Grandeur but the Footsteps of its Walls, and a few Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are not quite obliterated. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more considerable is to be found of the Town and Theater of the <hi>Isthmus</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> where they kept public Plays; and observes the place they begun to dig a Canal to joyn the two Seas together in <hi>Corinth,</hi> hath been more favourably dealt with by time than any of the former, since it is at this day large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to merit the Name of a Town; at least, it cannot pass for worse than a very handsom Village. Tho' nothing is more worthy observation, than the Change that hath happened to the <hi>Euripus,</hi> if what <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                        <hi>Strabo</hi> saith is true, That in their time it Fluxt and Refluxt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly seven times a day; since Mr. <hi>Wheeler</hi> affirms, That for two days that he staid there, he saw no more motion in it than that of our Marishes; and all the Inhabitants agree, that this Flux and Reflux is sometime regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and often irregular, according to the Moon: As a Learned Jesuite found out, who resided two Years at <hi>Negropont,</hi> that it is regular, and very little differing from the Main Ocean, at the end of the Old Moon, till the first Quarter of the New; but at the other part of the Month it is irregular, and changes 12, 13, or 14 times in 24 or 25 hours. In the end of our Authors Work, he gives only a succinct Relation of his Return to <hi>Zant,</hi> and from thence to <hi>England.</hi>

                     <head>A New Relation of <hi>China,</hi> containing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Particularities of the most considerable things of this great Empire. Composed in the Year <hi>1668.</hi> By the Reverend Father <hi>Gabriel de Magaillans</hi> of the <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Jesus,</hi> Apostolick Missionary; and Translated from <hi>Portuguese</hi> into <hi>French</hi> by the Sieur <hi>B.— Paris,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Claudius Barbins, 1688.</hi> in <hi>Quarto, pag. 385.</hi> and is to be had at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> at <hi>Henry Desbordes.</hi>

                     <p>ALthough after so many Relations that have been given of <hi>China,</hi> since one Age or thereabouts, it seems it is difficult to tell us any new thing thereof; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing we are assured that in this there is scarcely any thing to be found that hath been seen in others, and that it will appear to the Readers as new as it is curious. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that the History of <hi>China</hi> is a matter rich and vast enough, and therefore not to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103507:56"/>
be so easily drain'd, it's pretended that the most part of those who have written there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, instead of making exact Recitals, have said nothing on't but what's almost all Fabulous; that others having written in a different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to that of informing us of all the Particularities of this great Kingdom, have omitted the principal ones, or have spoke of them but by the By; and that finally, amongst so many Men that have treated of the same Subject, scarcely was there seen one who could so Learnedly speak thereof as Father <hi>Magaillans,</hi> and that had the same means and the same occasions of instructing himself therein. It was therefore in all likelihood to Supply what was deficient in the other Relations that this Jesuite so well informed, had composed his. But as he dyed in the Year 1677. without having published his Writings, and even without having finished it, the Publick would have run the hazard of being deprived of all the Fruit that it might gather from this Work, if the Translator, who is said to be the Abbot Mr. <hi>Bernou,</hi> had not drawn it from its Obscurity and Dust, and had not put into a condition to see Light by his Translation and Notes, and by all the care that he took thereof.</p>
                     <p>This Author begins (<hi>C.</hi> 1.) with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Names</hi> that the <hi>Chinois</hi> and Strangers give to <hi>China.</hi> And he immediately no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that it is an ordinary custom, where some new Family becomes Master of this State, they make it to lose it's name. Under the Precedent Family, it was called <hi>Tai-Mim-que,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Kingdom of a great Brightness.</hi> But the <hi>Tartars</hi> which are now the Masters, call it <hi>Tai-cim-que,</hi> Kingdom of great <hi>Purity</hi>; and it's also the Name that the <hi>Chinois</hi> themselves commonly do give it. They call it also very often <hi>Tien-hia,</hi> or <hi>Kingdom which containeth all that is under Heaven</hi>; these People being prepossessed with a fancy of the Greatness of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that they reckon as nothing all the States of the Universe besides. Strangers do also call it after several different Names, <hi>Catai, Mangi,</hi> &amp;c. But the most part call it <hi>China</hi>; a Name that our Author brings, either from the Family <hi>Chin,</hi> which govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 169 Years after <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; or more apparently yet from the Family <hi>Cin,</hi> which Reigned 246 Years before <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the chief whereof was the first Absolute and Universal Master of <hi>China.</hi> Father <hi>Magail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> sheweth at large and with great evidence, that the Countries of <hi>Catay,</hi> and of <hi>Mangi,</hi> are but parts of <hi>China,</hi> and not Kingdoms really different, no more than <hi>Tam-gut</hi> and <hi>Tainfa,</hi> that <hi>Cluvier</hi> hath also taken for other Kingdoms distinct from <hi>China,</hi> tho' they are but Cities, whereof the Name is a little corrupted.</p>
                     <p>(<hi>C.</hi> 2.) The Kingdom of <hi>China</hi> is situate almost on the Extremities of <hi>Asia</hi> on the <hi>East.</hi> It's length from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Chinois</hi> Books, that is, from the Fortress of <hi>Caci-pim,</hi> upon the Frontier of the Province of <hi>Pekim,</hi> to the Meridional Point of the Isle of <hi>Hai-nau,</hi> at the <hi>South</hi> of the Province of <hi>Quam-tum,</hi> is 23 Degrees in Extent, which make 5750 <hi>Li,</hi> or <hi>Chinois Stades</hi> at 250 to the Degree, and 575 <hi>French</hi> Leagues at 25 the Degree. And it's breadth measured in a straight Line from the East to the West, from the Point of <hi>Nim-Po,</hi> a Sea-port Town of the Province of <hi>Che-kiam,</hi> unto the extremity of the Province of <hi>Su-chuen,</hi> is 426 <hi>French</hi> Leagues, and 4080 <hi>Li,</hi> or <hi>Chinois Stades,</hi> at 240 a Degree. But they pretend that that is not all the Extent of this vast Empire, seeing that in considering it in another sense, it is 8400 <hi>Li,</hi> which are 750 <hi>French</hi> Leagues in it's utmost length; and 5400 <hi>Li,</hi> which make 500 <hi>French</hi> Leagues in it's greatest breadth. In short, the Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is very sure and exact, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of it's Measures very just and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and here it is that Men have not yet removed all the Difficulties as may be seen in the following Notes.</p>
                     <p>There are 15 Provinces in the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> all which for their Greatness; Richness, and Fertility, might pass for vast Kingdoms. <hi>Cluvier</hi> was mistaken when he counted 18 Provinces, and among them the Kingdom of <hi>Cochinchine,</hi> and that of <hi>Tim-kim,</hi> for tho' these have been at other times subject to <hi>China,</hi> they were so, but for some Years, and have not obeyed it of a long time. It's thought the Walled Places that are in <hi>China,</hi> amount to the number 4402 divided into 2 different Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Civil, and Military. 'Tis true, that several Cities and Towns are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that number, situated in the Provinces of <hi>Yun-nan de Q'uel-ches</hi> of <hi>Quamsi</hi> and of <hi>Su-chuen,</hi> which tho' they are join'd to the Emperours State, pay him no Tribute, nor do they acknowledge him, but have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Soveraigns, and make use in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strict of a different Language from the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noise</hi>; this great Empire is so Peopled, that near 12 millions of Families or Fires are counted therein, without comprehending Priviledged Families or Persons, Manderins, Magistrates, Souldiers, Batchellors, Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, Doctors, Bonzes or Eunuchs, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those who are of the Royal Blood. In a word, counting only those that Till the Ground, or that pay Tributes or Rents to the King: Altho' all the rest, as may be easily urged, make up an almost infinite Number.</p>
                     <p>There are 2045 Places walled of the Civil Order, divided into Towns, Cities, and Royal Inns; these last places for the most part are not less great, nor less peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, than are the Towns and Cities, and in each of them is a place where Mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins which the King sends, and all other Persons to whom he is pleas'd to do the like Favour, are Lodged, and their Charges born at the Princes Expences, and are entertained according to their Quality and Employ. The Military Order comprehends 7 different sorts of stony Places. The first and principal are great Fortresses, which are places upon the Frontiers, as the Keys and Defence of the Empire against the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103507:56"/>
                        <hi>Tartars,</hi> or upon the Borders of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against Rebels and Highway-men. There are 629 of this Order: The others are less considerable and less great propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably. And the last of these Places are small Forts, whereof some are built in the Fields, to serve as a Refuge to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, when they fear the Insults of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies or Thieves, or are willing to secure themselves from the Imposition of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, when the Royal Armies are in march, and the others are situated upon Mountains, whereof there are some almost inaccessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; all these Military Places amount to 2357. which being added to them of the Civil Order, make together the number marked above, 4402. Besides this, there are without and within these great Walls that surround almost all <hi>China,</hi> at least a great part, above Three thousand Towers or Castles, wherein are continually Guards and Centries kept. These famous Walls extend 405 <hi>Portugal</hi> Leagues, which make 23 Degrees 10 Minutes from East to West, which is to be understood in a right Line; for if the Windings of the Mountains and of the Walls were counted, it would amount to more than 500 Leagues: If we credit our Historian, <hi>There are more than Nine hundred thousand</hi> that guard the Frontiers, and there are <hi>Seven or Eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi> employed in the Guard of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom within. But the Translator, to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish somewhat the wonder, that such a prodigious number of Troops amount to, makes us remark in his Observations, that the greatest part of these Souldiers are of the Militia, and that there are but very few that have not another Calling besides being Souldiers. However it be, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor assures us, That all these Souldiers are always entertained, and that <hi>China</hi> is so well furnished with all the Requisites of Defence, that the <hi>Tartars</hi> who have once invaded it, and are Masters of it to this very time, had never passed the Walls, if the Souldiers Cowardize, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of the Officers had not opened them a Passage.</p>
                     <p>There are in <hi>China</hi> Two thousand four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and ninety Mountains, famous either because they have been cut in Form of <hi>Idols</hi> and monstrous <hi>Collosses,</hi> or for their renowned Fountains, or for their Plants or Minerals, endowed with some particular Vertue; or these Mountains were looked upon for their extraordinary heighth, or for some other Advantages of this nature, that makes them be distinguished. There is a like number of Antique Pieces, as Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, famous Painting, Vessels of great price and value; there are Eleven hundred and fifty nine Towers and Triumphal-Arches, and other Works extraordinarily sumptuous, raised for the honour of their King, or other famous Persons of both Sexes; and what deserves to be remembred, there are 272 Libraries embellished with many Ornaments, and full of Books, and built with vast Expence.</p>
                     <p>There can nothing be added to the marks of Love and Veneration, wherewith the <hi>Chinois</hi> are used to honour their Ancest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors deceased; they are not content with building them Tombs and Monuments, but they build them Temples; and there are seen more than 700 built at several times on this design, and these are equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable for the Bigness and Beauty of their Architecture; as for Temples of Idols, there are 480 famous and much frequented, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their Riches and Magnificence, or thro' the Fables that are told of pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miracles done there; and it is in these Temples, and in the others of the Empire, whereof the number is incredible, that Three hundred and fifty thousand Bomzes live, which makes but about a third part of this sort of people, who according to the Account of our Author are above a million, counting all that are of it.</p>
                     <p>But there is nothing according to his Relation more magnificent, than the Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Places of the Nobility of <hi>China,</hi> among others are seen 685 <hi>Mausolees,</hi> whose Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess and Architecture has render'd 'em ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry famous; and the others do not want their Beauty and Pomp Our Historian brags of them all as very worthy of being seen and admired: He adds, That among them whose Memories are honoured, the <hi>Chinois</hi> Reverence after a particular manner 3636 Men, famous for their Qualities and Heroick Actions, and 208 Maids or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who have for their Chastity or Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or something else, deserved to be Celebrated as so many Examples of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                     <p>There is no Kingdom in the World so antient as that of <hi>China,</hi> nor that can brag of a Succession of Kings, so long and so well continued; it has stood in the same Form more than Four thousand Years, and the Succession has be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n continued by 22 Families, which during that time, have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished 236 Kings. It's what the <hi>Chinois</hi> justify by the History of their Country, whereof all the parts have been written by Contemporary Authors; and by a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology which appears so just, so well fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and is backed with such good Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, that it does not seem that it can be denyed; and they are so fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded of this Antiquity, that it is a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Crime among them to doubt of this Article; and generally this Antiquity with the other extraordinary Advantages of this Kingdom, puffs them up with so much Pride, that they conceive Opinions not a little unreasonable to other Countries, and as if all were at an end at the Frontiers of their Empire; they scorn as much as to inform themselves of the rest, and they never speak of it but with a mark of the greatest Contempt.</p>
                     <p>We believe that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were the first that had Letters or Sciences, and Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphicks, yet it is certain, That the <hi>Chinois</hi> have had them before. However it be, the <hi>Chinoise</hi> Letters are not the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103507:57"/>
least Curiosity they have. For whereas, all other Nations have a common Writing that consists of an Alphabet of about 24 Letters, which are almost of the same Sound, tho they differ in Figure: The <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> have 54409 Letters that do all of them signifie something, and do not seem so much to be dumb Characters as speaking Words, or at least Figures and Images that represent to the life, what they signifie; so admirable is their Artifice. These Letters are either simple or compound; these last are a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the first, to signifie somewhat that has some kind of Relation to the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: As for Example, the Letter <hi>Mo,</hi> which signifies Wood, is simple; but the Letter <hi>Lin,</hi> that signifies a Forest, which comprehends many Trees, is composed of two <hi>Mo.</hi> The Author gives upon this many curious things; he shews, that all these Letters are true <hi>Heroglyphics,</hi> and that nothing has been invented with more wit than the Language of the <hi>Chinois.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it cannot be denyed, but that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> is a very surprizing thing, that this Language having but about 320 Words, and all of one Syllable, can bring them together, change them, and mix them in so many different Ways, and yet so Eloquent, and so multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Use and Signification by the almost infinite Variations of Sound and Accent, that they that can speak it, can deliver their Thoughts upon all Subjects with as much facility, clearness, grace, force and energy, as in any other Language, tho' ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so rich and copious, as the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> Our Author who assures this, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains at the same time, that the many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Significations that are given the same word, do not occasion the confusion and difficulty that some imagine; that on the contrary this Language has that benefit by the small Number of Monosyllables where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it consists, that there is neither a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or dead Language in all Europe, that can be Learned with so much Facility. And he alledges for proof, the Examples of the Missionaries of his Order, who in a very short time rendred themselves so Learned in it, that they composed Books much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by the <hi>Chinois</hi> themselves; this gives the Author occasion to run much upon the praise of their Fathers, and to give us a List of their fine Works.</p>
                     <p>There is no Nation that is wittier than that of <hi>China</hi>; they are inventive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious, and we cannot dispute them the Honour of having been the first Inventers of Letters, Paper, Print, Gun-Powder, without mentioning other things.

The first is a Chronicle of their 5 Antient Kings, whom they honour as Saints, with a particular Veneration: The second is the Book of Rites, that contains the greatest part of the Laws, Customs, and Ceremonies observed in that Empire: The third is Verse and Prose, in praise of Vertue and and dispraise of Vice: The fourth is Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical, and was composed by <hi>Confucius</hi>: The fifth is esteemed the antien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He adds, that whereas there is no Town

nor Village that has not some River or Channel, or at least some Navigable Arm of the Sea, that this convenience renders Navigation so common there, that there are as many almost seen upon the Water as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Land; people may soon judge the usefulness of this for Commerce: and with what case, plenty spreads it self over all the parts of this Kingdom. Besides, there is no Country that is more rich in proper Goods, and that draws more from its own Fund than <hi>China</hi>; all is had there, and it may be said almost above wish, and not only what is necessary, but plenty of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious things: The quantity of Gold that each Province has, is so great, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of coyning it, to buy other things with it, it is sold like other Merchandize.

The Wax is of a certain sort peculiar only to this Kingdom, the fairest, neatest, and whitest, that was ever seen, and being of a more agreeable use than ordinary, is used by the King himself, and by all the Court, and the Lords and Mandarins, and by the Men of Learning, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by all rich Folks.

                     <p>There is no Country in the World where the Nobility have greater interest to keep the Crown in the Reigning Family than the Gentry of <hi>China</hi> have, seeing all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Noble-men and great Lords do not subsist, but whilst that Family lasts, and that as soon as another is raised to the Crown, they are all ruined by him. There has been but one Family to this very day, that could exempt it self from this sad Fate: And it was that of the famous <hi>Confucius,</hi> for the Merit and great Worth of this great Philosopher, and the incredible Veneration which his Memory is preserved in, has maintained his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all its Splendour for above 2020 Years, so that flourishing yet in the same State of Esteem and Honour, it may be with justice call'd the Antientest Family in the World.</p>
                     <p>But among all the Advantages attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>China,</hi> it is pretended, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be esteemed for nothing so much as for the Excellency of its Government; and it is here that our Author gives the Relation as curious as important, of the Conduct of this Empire. In general, the <hi>Mandarins,</hi> the Officers and Magistrates of all the Kingdom, they are distinguished into 11 Orders, whereof the Differences are so well marked, and the Subordination so just, that in the Authors Judgment there is nothing comparable to it any where else. The <hi>Mandarins</hi> of the first Order, or the King's Counsellors of State form the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Tribunal, whence all other depend. After this come 11 <hi>Great Tribunals,</hi> among whom the Kings of <hi>China</hi> have distribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the business of the Kingdom. And they pretend that the Establishment was made 2000 Years before Jesus Christ, and that it has continued ever since in the same manner, wherein it is seen now, if some Corruptions be excepted that may have slipt in; of these 11 Tribunals, there are 6 of Mandarins of Learning, as they call them, and 5 of Mandarins of Arms. The 6 first are the most powerful, because there is hardly any thing but what is subject to their Jurisdiction, and they may be said to govern <hi>China.</hi> The first of the six is that which has a general Rule over all the other Manderins, and can give them their Places or Employment, or take them away. The second has a superintendance over the Customs and Tributes, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral over the King's Treasure. The third has the Direction of the Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Sciences and Arts. The fourth has for its share all that belongs to War, and to Arms in all the Kingdom. The fifth of the Crimes and Punishments of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103507:58"/>
Criminals, among which by the by, there is none look'd upon to be so base and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious as to be beheaded. The sixth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-looks the Works and Building of the King, so that there is no business of any nature, but is subject to these 6 Supream Tribunals; and as they have jurisdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver almost all the Court, and over all them of the Provinces, there can none be more respected nor better obeyed than they are where-ever they go. The 5 Tribunals of Arms are governed by great Lords, as Marquesses, Counts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and have above them one Supream Tribunal, called the High Tribunal of War, the President whereof is always one of the greatest Lords of the Kingdom; the Authority of this President seems very considerable, since his Jurisdiction reaches over the five other Tribunals, and over all the Officers and Souldiers of the Kingdom. But lest he might abuse so great a Power, he has given him for an Assister, a Mandarin of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, under the Title of High Regent of Arms, and two Syndicks or Royal Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers, who take part in all Affairs: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it may be said, That all these Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals of War, have more Show and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance than real Authority, because in all things that belong to Execution, they depend necessarily upon the Supream Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Arms, which is the fourth of the six that we spoke of; this was one of the cunningest of the Politicks of the Kings of <hi>China,</hi> and an effect of the Knowledge they had of the Humour of their Subjects, whose ruling Passion is to grow rich, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. To have thus ordained so great a number of Tribunals or Courts, that a great many might have the means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent their Ambition by the Honours and Profits of the Imployments they are in, whilst the little Power they have takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them the means of abusing their places: And the same measures within a very little were observed by the other Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Tribunals, whose Power seems greater and less limited: For as it might be feared, that any one of them might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himself absolute, if he were left to the entire disposal of the Matters belonging to him, all their Employments were distribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their Functions were ordered with so much Prudence, that not one among them is absolute in the Affairs of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but all have a dependence upon one another.</p>
                     <p>All the Eleven Tribunals are placed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Rank in magnificent Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on both sides of that of the King's; the first six upon the left, which is the place of Honour, and towards the East, the other five on the right towards the West; and whereas each of the Six has under it several Subaltern Tribunals to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and order Business, so have these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Tribunals their Palaces within the great one, of which they depend; these lesser Tribunals are in greater or lesser number, in each of the great ones, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to the business they have, and according to our Authors Calculation, there are in all 44, in such sort, that it seems business should be treated of, exactly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through so many different Tribunals; and yet it must be known that in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of each Supream Tribunal, there is always a Hall and an Apartment for a Mandarin, who is called Overseer or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervisor, who examines publickly or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly all that is done, and as soon as he knows of any Disorder or Injustice, he is obliged to acquaint the King with it; all other Tribunals whether of the Court, or belonging to the Provinces, which are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to these Supream Tribunals, are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no less Policy. Those of the Court, which are established at <hi>Pekin,</hi> are so numerous, that we shall take no care to mention them here; for there are some for every kind of business, among others there are some that make up a Royal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy, and which consists of the best Wits of all the Kingdom. They are as it were the King's Learned men, with whom he discourses very often upon several Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and makes choice of many to be his Counsellors; and for other Tribunals, that which is called the Visitors, or that belongs to the general Supervisors, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees all the Court and Empire; it's charge is to see the Laws observed, and Justice executed, and to see that both the Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins and People do their Duty; this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal is much feared, and has under it 25 Tribunals, and is placed in a huge Palace; every three Years it causes a general Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit to be made, sending Visitors into each Province, who no sooner enter into them than they become above all Vice-Roys and Mandarins, and do all with an Authority that inspires no little Fear. But there is yet another Tribunal, the Functions whereof is not less considerable, nor of less importance, which is that of the Overseers, which we have spoken of already, which are divided into six Orders, as the six Supream Tribunals which they oversee; their Authority goes so far, that they may reprehend the King himself when he commits any fault in the Government of the State, and there are found some ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous enough to expose themselves reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to a Banishment, or even to Death it self, in acquainting him of his faults, sometimes by a Memorial, and sometimes by telling him them to his Face. In fine, every Province has its Tribunals as well general as particular, and above all there is one that is Chief, and oversees all the rest, and gives the King and the six Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Tribunals of the Court an account of all important Affairs. It may be easily judged that all their Imploys have a great many Mandarins; and so there are 32000 in the Roll, which the Court sends
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103507:58"/>
from time to time into the Provinces: and though this number may seem very strange; yet our <hi>Author</hi> says, That the distribution, distinction and subordination is much more marvellous and surprising. It seems the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers have not forgot any thing for the establishing of things upon the best bottom that it was possible to put them; and that they have prevented all the inconveniences that might be feared; but by ill looking to the Conduct and Goodness of the Officers, does not correspond to so good an order; for, as they all have an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>What has been hitherto said, must give a very high Notion, or Idea of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of this <hi>Empire:</hi> but, it seems, there is nothing can do that better, than the Pomp and extraordinary Magnificence that shines at the Emperours Court. Fancy it self would be troubled to add any thing to the Relation that has been here made in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Chapters; and, it is hard, after Reading, but the Flattery of the People, will seem more excusable; who, dazled with this Splendour, never speak of their Soveraign, but in Hyperbolick Expressions, and treat all, who have Relation to his Person, with the terms of Heavenly and Divine. What the <hi>Author</hi> says in this Article, must be seen in himself; and the Account he gives of the City of <hi>Pekin,</hi> which is the Princes Place of abode, and Capital of the Empire, and, above all, must be seen, what he says of that Great and Magnificent Palace of this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
                     <p>There are but few Readers that will not take pleasure in this part of his Work, and to whom, the particular account he gives, will not seem curious; and the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause other Relations have said but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon this Subject, and very confusedly; which, in Mr. <hi>Bernon</hi>'s Judgment, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the small help that people had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till now, of Learning much of it: The <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors</hi> that are sent to that Court, being always shut in, in the Palace that they have given them; and the Missioners, except a very few, having never seen <hi>Pekin,</hi> or if they have, it was onely in passing through it; So that, in his opinion, there were but Father <hi>Magdillan</hi>'s, and two or three others, that could have any knowledge of the Court or City; And this <hi>Iesuite</hi> is the onely Man that gave us the Description, after 25 years abode there: In his Book then may be seen more distinctly, than ever yet was seen, the Situation, Form, Disposition and Greatness of this Famous City, which has been a long time spoken of without being known: his Description is as ample, and accompanied with as good circumstances as can be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and the Great Palaces, that contain a great many other, and which, by its great and prodigious scope, and breadth, and for the Beauty, Riches, Majesty and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of all contained in it, may justly pass for the rarest and most marvellous thing in the World. Four Chapters are imployed in this Description, and the <hi>Author</hi> has joyned to them a Draught of the City and Palace, which serves much to comprehend the Symmetry and Order that accompanies all that Magnificence: in fine, in the last Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that immediately follows these, the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> shews the way the Emperor goes out of his Palace, whether it be when he designs to divert himself in walking abroad, or in Hunting; or whether it be when he goes abroad to make some publick Function, as some one of the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> which he does every year, in every one of the Seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Ordained for this Ceremony; and which are situated in the City, without the Walls of the Palace: on either occasion it is believed, that no Prince can appear with so Magnificent an Equipage. But above all it is presumed, that the Pomp and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence cannot be equalled, wherewith he goes to the Publick Functions, for then he is accompanyed with the most Sumptuous and Majestick Guard that can be seen in any Court; nothing could better compleat the representing to us the Splendour of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and all the Glory of its Monarch, than the description given to us of this Pompous March; and so Father <hi>Magaillans</hi> judged, that he could not better conclude his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story than by it; and this is the dash with which he was willing to finish the Picture wherein he has drawn the Grandeur and Magnificence of all <hi>China.</hi>

                     <p>The Sons of the Prince of <hi>Georgia</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by Mr. <hi>Chardin,</hi> what History says of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> said, that they were some of the wandring <hi>Scythians,</hi> like the <hi>Turco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> and have transferred the Soveraignty to their Wives, as did the <hi>Achinese</hi>; and that these Queens were ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by some of their own sex, that followed them every where; after the manner that <hi>Georgia</hi> and its Inhabitants are spoken of here, it would move one to apply to them the <hi>Proverb,</hi> touching the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>; <note n="(a)" place="margin">Camer. 1 <hi>Vol. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note>

For 8 Livres may be bought a Horse-load of the best Wine in the Country, that is to say, 300 pound weight. All this resembles an <hi>Earthly Paradice</hi>; but if we consider the Inhabitants, they will be found like Devils only, except that they are Civil, Grave, Moderate, and very Fair: The <hi>Author</hi> Remarks, That he did not see one ugly Person of either Sex, but <hi>Angelick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>; and, that nothing can be Painted more Charming, than the <hi>Georgines.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, he adds, that they all Paint, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally have a great deal of Natural Wit, but being ill brought up, they become very Ignorant and Vicious, Cheats, Knaves, Traitors, Ingratefull, Proud, and strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Impudent in Lying, Irreconcileable in

their Hatreds, Drunkards, Usurers, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest to the highest Degree. The Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men drink as well as the rest, and have with them handsome Slaves which they make their Concubines; and what is the height of all Corruption, none is scandaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because it is Authorized by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral custom: The Author says, that the Guardian of the <hi>Capucins</hi> told him, that he heard it said by the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> (for so are called the Patriarchs of <hi>Georgia</hi>) that whoever was not drunk at the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Christmas,</hi> &amp;c. does not pass for a good Christian, and ought to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</p>
                     <p>The Women are neither less evil or vicious, they have a great eagerness for Men, and have a greater part in this Torrent of Immodesty than is to be found in any other part of the World: Every one has liberty in <hi>Georgia,</hi> to live according to his own Religion, to discourse of it and maintain it: There are there more <hi>Armenians</hi> than <hi>Georgians</hi>; there are also <hi>Greeks, Iews, Turks, Persians, Indians, Tartars, Muscovites,</hi> and <hi>Europians.</hi> The Religion of the <hi>Georgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> is much the same with theirs of <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grelia</hi>; but that they Fast more, and have longer Prayers, and look after their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es better: The greatest part live on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and inaccessible Mountains; they see them, and salute them at the distance of three or four Leagues, but hardly ever go thither; and what is yet more ridiculous, tho' the Prince is a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> yet he fills all Benefices; generally he places his Friends in them, and it is his Brother that is Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch now; without doubt, it would be known how this <hi>Catholico</hi> first renounc'd <hi>Mahometanism</hi>; and it is very pleasing to see how the <hi>Georgian</hi> Princes have become <hi>Mahometans</hi> and Subjects to the Emperor of <hi>Persia</hi>: The Account is very distinct, and in few words opens all the History of that Country, from <hi>Ismael Sophi</hi> to this very time. There we learn among other things, that the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted them by inflicting great Torments upon them that continued in Christianity, and in giving great Advantages to such as abjured <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and this was done with not so much Reluctancy, as quitting the Protestant for Romish Religion; but as there never was Country or Age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were not found some firm in the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that they believed good, so there was a Princess of <hi>Georgia</hi> that neither Iron nor Fire could shake: <hi>Abas the Great</hi> would not received the Lie, but sent Orders to the Governour of <hi>Chiras</hi> to make her a <hi>Mahometan</hi> at any Price; the Governour omitted nothing to overcome the constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this Princess, he made her suffer 8 Years Martyrdom, by so much the more cruel, that he renewed her Torments every day; she died at last upon Flaming Coals in the Year 1624. her Body was thrown to the Birds of the Air, but the <hi>Augustins</hi> sent it secretly to the Prince her Son; she was called <hi>Kela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Princess of <hi>Georgia</hi> and great part of the Lords do now profess <hi>Mahometanism,</hi> some to imploy themselves at the <hi>Persian</hi> Court, others for Pensions, and some that they might marry their Daughters to the King, or make them enter into the Queen's Service.</p>
                     <p>The head City of <hi>Georgia</hi> is called <hi>Tifflis</hi>; there are fourteen Churches, which is much in a Country of so little Devotion, but that is not the most surprizing. It is more admirable, that these People should be so much against the Building of <hi>Mosques</hi>; the King of <hi>Persia</hi> their Soveraign could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver compass the Building of one at <hi>Tifflis.</hi> The People rise presently, and being arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ruine the Work and abuse the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; they thought to build one at the <hi>Fort,</hi> to accustom the People to the sight of <hi>Mosques,</hi> and to see their Priests call Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Prayer, from the top of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the first time that the Priest was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; this Functions, there were so many Stones thrown on that side, that obliged him to come down in haste; and after this Mutiny, there was none put to do this Office. The King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s Patience, is to be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired here than the <hi>Georgias</hi> Zeal: For tho they have neither Piety nor Vertue, the meer Passions of the Machine or Body, may naturally produce Sallies and Religious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances; it was a thousand times obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That the most Pros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>igate when let loose on the persecuted Party, by the chief Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, were those that shewed most Zeal.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Capucins</hi> of <hi>Tifflis</hi> are very near as lewd as the <hi>Theatins</hi> of <hi>Mingrelia</hi>; their capacity in <hi>Physick</hi> and <hi>Chymistry</hi> is of more use to them than any they can have in Controversy; and they do not maintain their Embassies as they told M. <hi>Chardin,</hi> for any Benefit they reap, but meerly for the Glory of the <hi>Roman Church</hi>; which would not be Universal, say they, if it had not Ministers in all parts of the Inhabited World; they have the Popes leave to receive Pay for their Cure, which they turn to good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; they have power to absolve from any sin, and to disguise themselves to sell and buy, and to receive and set at interest. The Zeal of the <hi>Georgians</hi> for their Fast is so unreasonable, that they do not believe one a Christian that does not Fast as they do, which obliges the <hi>Capucins</hi> to fast the <hi>Georgian</hi> way, and to abstain from Hares, Tortoises, and other things, which the <hi>Georgians</hi> abhor.</p>
                     <p>There is also at large the Patent which the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> sent to M. <hi>Chardin</hi> full of Pride; and indeed generally the Eastern Princes assume the highest Titles that can be conceived. I believe that for the honour of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Christendom,</hi> every one ought to know what Spirit guides them in the East; for when that is not known, we are thought the most ridiculous People in the World, which is false; for these in <hi>Asia</hi> surpass us, and if we keep our selves as we are, they will always excel us in that

particular; there was lately published, which was well done, a strange <hi>Legend</hi> of pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Titles which the Kings of <hi>Siam</hi> give themselves; the Author being minded to shew, That the Eastern Nations are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more vain than all the other; he has inserted in his Journal the Translation of a Letter from the Prince of <hi>Georgia</hi> to <hi>Iohn Casimer</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi>; but because the Patent of the King of <hi>Persia</hi> is dressed with much form, there is care taken to expound all after an Instructive manner. I will meddle but with this Point; the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> have this way, never to place the Name of <hi>God</hi> at the bottom of a Leaf, they put it at top, and at the side, and leave a Blank whereto it relates; and they make a great business of this Circumspection.— And they take the same care for their King's and chief Ministers Names in all their Law Papers, and in Petitions and Publick Acts.</p>
                     <p>The Author being invited by the Prince of <hi>Georgia</hi> to a great Nuptial Feast, gives us the Description of it, which among other curious Circumstances, has this, that the Prefect of the <hi>Capucins</hi> all in white, and very old, was obliged to play upon the Virginals before the Guests, and to sing at the same time; he sung first the <hi>Magnificat,</hi> the <hi>Te-Deum,</hi> and the <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ergo,</hi> and then the Tunes of the Court in <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish,</hi> because the Hymns did not enough delight this <hi>Mahometan</hi> Prince: This Consort lasted 2 hours, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which M. <hi>Chardin</hi> that found it very mean, learned of a Steward that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> Faith did not permit the use of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, and above all prohibits it in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, there being nothing but the voice of Man wherewith God will be praised. The Prince asking how the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his Cousin did, occasioned the Authors Learning, that <hi>Clement</hi> the 8th. writing to a Prince of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and saying, that <hi>Philip</hi> the Second was his Cousin, gave way to this pretension of Kindred; and that the <hi>Iberians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> were Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Before M. <hi>Chardin</hi> quitted <hi>Tifflis,</hi> he had the complaisance on the Account of a <hi>Capucin</hi> to write in his Table Book, several Secrets of an Old Woman that practis'd Physick. His Journey from <hi>Tifflis</hi> to <hi>Irivan</hi> was very tiresom. <hi>Irivan</hi> is a Town of <hi>Armenia,</hi> whereof he gives us the Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is the most considerable Government of the Kingdom: The Revenues producing near 500000 Crowns yearly without reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 200000 which it raises by indirect ways; he that was in possession of it then, was called <hi>Sefi-Couli-can,</hi> the Dukes Slave of <hi>Sefi</hi>; the Name of Slave, which really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Subjects of the Eastern Princes, is a Name of Honour in <hi>Persia, Chacouli</hi> or <hi>Coulom-cha,</hi> which signifies <hi>Slave of the King,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> as honourable a Title as that of Marquess in <hi>France</hi>: The Slaves of the King have at the <hi>Persian</hi> Court almost the same imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ordinary Gentlemen have at that of <hi>France</hi>; they are Children of Quality that are engag'd very young in that Service, as well for the profit that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as that they the sooner have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Court; as for the rest, the <hi>Persian</hi> Eloquence does not flatter ill the Vanity of that Nation, when to signify that an Embassador has saluted the King: they say, <hi>He has kiss'd the King's Slaves Feet</hi>; and for to say, That a Prince has done some great Action, they say, <hi>The Princes Slaves have done a great Action.</hi> The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor imagines, That this is copied from the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> wherein the Works of God are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten called the Works of Angels; the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> maintain, that it expresses more nobly the Works of God; for if they that are but Servants are capable of forming the World, what will not he do that is Master?</p>
                     <p>The Governour of <hi>Irivan</hi> seems to have much Merit for several Reasons; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is spoke of, Mr. <hi>Chardin</hi> rehearses several considerable Points of the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Country, which is of great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the <hi>Christians</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> because it shews, that those of <hi>Asia</hi> make far more idle Stories; some of these Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons relate to <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark. I shall be easily pardoned, if without stopping at these things I acquaint my Reader, that M. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> shews us very curious things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Couriers of the King of <hi>Persia</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the <hi>Persian</hi> Marriages. Their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals upon the <hi>Chapter of Women,</hi> is the most licentious in the World. For they may have four, they may buy, or hire as many as they will, and use them as Treasure, without breach of Civil or Ecclesiastick Law. There are but few nevertheless that Marry more than one Wife; and they find it more to their advantage, not to trouble their Houses with Jealousies of several Heads, whereof every one would be Mistress, and to diversifie their Pleasures cheaper, by the number of Slaves, which they bring up to be their Concubins, without prejudicing in the least the Superiority of a Wife. <hi>Mahomet</hi> had been but a little Politick if in lieu of permitting them to have four, he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to have so many; and if the contrary were desired of him, as a favour it would be as <hi>Phaeton</hi> did: <hi>Poenam, Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton pro munere poscis. They are marry'd there without seeing each other, and a Man does not see his Wife until after the Consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Matrimony, and often he does not consummate it; for some days after she is brought to him, because she hides her self among the Women, and will not let the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band enjoy her. These Forms are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent among People of Quality, because in their Opinion, it is like a debauched Person to yield the Last Favour so soon; especially the Women of the Royal Family, there must be sometimes whole Months to prevail with them. It is very probable,</hi> says Mr. <hi>Chardin, That this way of Marrying without seeing each other should produce very unhappy Effects, but happens perfectly contrary; for it may be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103507:60"/>
said, That there are more lucky Marriages in those Countries where they do not see the Women at all, than in them where they are seen and frequented: The reason is evident, when we do not see another Mans Wife, we do not so soon lose the Love we may have for our own.</hi> And the Reflection is very good. I shall say nothing of several other particularities which the Author mentions here in this great Chapter. He reports of the Governour of <hi>Irivan,</hi> which is a little better than the Answer of this which the Ambassador of <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Governour understanding, That the Box which M. <hi>Chardin</hi> presented him with, was worth 10 Pistols: he desired him to take it again, and to give him the value of it in Keys, Springs and Strings of Watches; this and several other things to be seen in that Journal, shews that Covetousness is so predominant with the Eastern People that it puts them on a thousand base little Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>If this Article had not been a little too long already, I would have related many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things out of this Volume. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor shews much skill in Geography, and gives us the Description of some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Towns, with the Plans of them, and an Abridgment of their Histories, which may satisfie well enough the desire of any curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader. He represents us the City of <hi>Tauris</hi> as very beautiful: there are 250 <hi>Mosques</hi> in it, and a place where the <hi>Turks</hi> may put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Casbin</hi> the Country of the famous <hi>Locman,</hi> the <hi>Eastern Aesope,</hi> appears with great Pomp, but it would be nothing in comparison of another Town, called <hi>Rey,</hi> if it were true, that <hi>Rey</hi> was what the <hi>Persian</hi> Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers maintain it to be, upon the credit of all the Eastern Authors, who say, <hi>That in the Sixth Age of Christianity, the Town of</hi> Rey <hi>was divided into</hi> 96 <hi>Parts, whereof each had</hi> 46 <hi>Streets, every Street</hi> 400 <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and</hi> 10 <hi>Mosques, and that the Town had</hi> 6400 <hi>Colledges,</hi> 16600 <hi>Baths,</hi> 15000 <hi>lesser Mosques,</hi> 12000 <hi>Mills,</hi> 17000 <hi>Channels, and</hi> 13000 <hi>Caravanserais.</hi> The <hi>Magies</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles affirm, That <hi>Chus</hi> Grand-Son of <hi>Noah</hi> was the Founder of <hi>Rey,</hi> and lay'd the first Stone under the Ascendant of <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion.</hi> This is no small comfort to our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern and Southern Fablers: for if on one part they are concerned to be called Dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they will have on the other side the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of having Companions all over the World: For what concerns the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the <hi>Mosques</hi> and <hi>Mausolees</hi> of <hi>Com?</hi> They are not Dreams, but Realities, since the Author professes himself an eye-witness thereof. <hi>The Tomb of</hi> Fathme, <hi>Daughter of</hi> Mouza-Cazem, <hi>one of the</hi> 12 Califes, <hi>which the</hi> Persians <hi>believe were the lawful Successors of</hi> Mahomet <hi>after</hi> Ali, is in the chiefest of these <hi>Mosques</hi> with those of King <hi>Abas,</hi> and <hi>Sefi.</hi> There is but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little wanting in the Worship of <hi>Fathme</hi> among the <hi>Persians,</hi> to equal it to what most of the Christians pay to the Mother of the Son of God. This appears by the <hi>Prayers</hi> that Pilgrims of <hi>Com</hi> rehearse; and the People are persuaded, that the Virgin <hi>Fathme</hi> was transported to Heaven both Body and Soul, yet they do not celebrate the Feast of her Assumption. Mr. <hi>Chardin</hi> gives us in <hi>French</hi> some of these Prayers, as also the famous Elegy of <hi>Haly,</hi> made by the Learned <hi>Haran Cary: This Panegyrick is writ in great Letters of Gold, in the Gallery of the Tomb of</hi> Abas, <hi>and is a piece of Eloquence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in may be seen not only the Genius of the</hi> Persian <hi>Poetry, but also Transports of the</hi> Mahometan <hi>Devotion. 'Tis in Songs divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by disticks; the first is all upon</hi> Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, <hi>the six other upon</hi> Ali. If I were minded to make a more ample Addition of the <hi>Spanish Rotomandos,</hi> many places of this Poem should be copied out. To speak seriously, there are some turns of Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that have much Force in them, as when to express the Beauty of <hi>Ali</hi> the Poet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> assures us, <hi>That God has assigned his Love us a Ioynture to the Ladies of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi>: Naturalists will not find what they look for here, but they may examine the White Pot Work of <hi>Com,</hi> and they will find enough to busy themselves in; it refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Water in Summer <hi>very well, by the means of a continual Transpiration. The first time that this Pot is used, a Quart tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires in</hi> 6 <hi>hours, and then less and less after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards until at last the Pores are closed by gross Matter that is in the Water, that stops its passage through the Pores</hi>; and then a new Pot must be us'd, or else the Water would stink in the other.</p>

What is most certain upon sight of all their pieces, is, that either the Reformed Writers must be the boldest Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators that ever were in the World, or that the Catholick Writers must be the falsest and the boldest Flatterers that have ever been heard of. For in fine, an Army that Plunders, or threatneth to Plunder the <hi>Hugonots</hi> Houses through all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is a thing that 'tis hard to suppress the Truth of, or to persuade that it is false.</p>
                     <p>The Author of this Work dedicates it to God: This Dedicatory Epistle has a very singular turn and an uncommon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, which is that it prosecutes his Praises to the highest, without becoming suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Flattery. I am mistaken if Praises be the only thing aim'd at in it: For certainly, there enters Censure either directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly in the Reflections that follow this Dedication; they have much Fire and Wit, but are very disadvantageous to the Clergy; for they shew, That they managed their Work after so cheating a way, that tho' they have gull'd the People, yet there could be nothing so gross and ill knit together as their Artifices: This Author complains continually that on all occasions they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have wholly the Edicts of Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho at bottom they had no such thought, as the Event has confirmed; one might press People far enough both accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Notions of the Gospel and Maxims of Morals, when they are convinced of such Dissimulation; but those that are acquainted with the Rights of the <hi>Art of Governing,</hi> and who have experienced, that <hi>Politick Wisdom is obliged to conceal their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,</hi> and know that this is a necessary evil in this State of corrupted nature, will not trouble themselves with all these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, but will send all Protestant Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Plato</hi>'s Common-Wealth, or to Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi>'s <hi>Vtopia,</hi> because they think like <hi>Cato,</hi> without considering what a Man is in such an Age as this, and without thinking that a perfect Regularity does not belong to this World; we must stay until the Resurrection new forms Man from Head to Foot, to see him in this Order.</p>
                     <p>To these Complaints are added others; the violent Advices suggested by the Bishops, and after this are made some rough Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the two Orations of the last Meeting of the Clergy, spoke by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Valence</hi> and the Coadjutor of <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> and there is to be seen the Discourse which the Lieutenant General of <hi>Rochelle</hi> made to the Heads of the Protestant Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, wherein he declared, that if they did not quickly learn and enter into the bosom of the Church, <hi>they should be punished in this World with much Pain and Calamities.</hi> And here follows an Account of what pass'd at <hi>Mounaban,</hi> and of divers Remarks that help to shew, that the Persecutions of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> nor of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and them of <hi>Hungary,</hi> were not so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous as those of our Days: The <hi>Donatists</hi> are spoke of, and it's maintained, that they are not to be compared with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and that the success of the Persecutions raised against them is not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now.</p>
                     <p>They found it on this thought, that the new Converts change only in the exterior, and that they will never be drawn from their Hypocrisy, but by having leave to return to their former Belief: If a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Reports that run, were credited, it would be thought that there would become a true <hi>Samaritanisme</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and a mixt Religion that would neither be <hi>Calvinism</hi> nor <hi>Papism,</hi> and which would have been soon excommunicated by the Pope, in the times that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> could main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Pretensions. There was a Discourse that there is nothing asked of the most of the Proselytes, but a general Promise, That they would not remain Separatists. And the Gazett tells us, they are suffered to sing in the very Cathedrals the Psalms of <hi>Clement Marot:</hi> And upon this many cry, that it is an effect of the Promise, that they complain of. But as I have said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, A wise Man should not credit things of this nature upon <hi>Hear-says</hi>; we must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect until time clears all these doubtful Matters, to see whether the Prelates of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103507:61"/>
                        <hi>France</hi> will not, by good Apologies, annul the complaints spread of them through all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> As the Common-wealth of Sciences is a State of Abstraction and Precision from all Sects, and, as such, is not to take the part of any Sect of Divines, or Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; it will be its duty to give an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial account of the Books that will be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the Clergy, and which it will not neglect. The <hi>Author</hi> makes an end of the First Part of his Book with a Letter upon what happen'd at <hi>Guyenne,</hi> in the time of the M. of <hi>Boufflers</hi> Croisade. It's strange he says nothing of the Revocation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of <hi>Nan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>es.</hi> And we may conclude hence, that his Book was Printed before that was known. Without doubt it will be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of another Work. He that made these Reflections, does not look as if he would slip so fertile a matter, or as if he would stop in so fair a road.</p>
                     <p>To understand better the Contents of his Second Part, I must first tell the <hi>Reader,</hi> that the Second Assembly of the Clergy brought a parallel of the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and that which is imputed to it by <hi>Protestants,</hi> which comprehends in Seven <hi>Articles,</hi> all the Points that are Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of; and there are three Columns made on each <hi>Article</hi> of these: The first contains the Formal Terms of the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Faith, and of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> The second, the <hi>French</hi> Translation of these Terms: The third is of the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Protestants,</hi> which the Clergy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Calumnies of the highest degree, and have all, in a Body, petitioned the King for a Formal Justice. The <hi>Author</hi> having made several Remarks on all this, with his ordinary heat, descends to a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar examination of these Seven <hi>Articles,</hi> and maintains, that the Calumnies that were complained of, are very unjust Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, and pretends, that the most rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and hard expressions of the Ministers contain nothing, but pure Truth; and marks, that the Translation of these pretended Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies contain a more injurious meaning than the Original: I will not enter on par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular proofs; it is enough to say, that they are passed with much Vigour and Wit, and that for the honour of the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion they must be Answer'd.</p>
                     <p>The Third Column will produce an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Books of Controversie, which may last a long time; for Questions of matters of Fact are sometimes an Abyss, whereof the bottom is never seen. The <hi>Philosophers</hi> of this Country will be less im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient for these <hi>Books,</hi> than for the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi>; for that they hope that the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Apology</hi> will teach them many curious things, touching the Nature of the Soul, and the Easiness of changing Opinions from morning to night: for, without this, their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology</hi> will seem to want one of its most Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Parts; because the <hi>Cartesians</hi> have made the World experience sensibly the great force of Prejudices that there are, but few thinking Men but believe that there would be need of the Adress of the most able <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi> for two years, to persuade all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that Sensible Qualities are only in the Soul; that the Earth moves continually; that Body and Space are the same thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, upon this, they imagine some hardness of the Fibres of the Brain for F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mr. <hi>Leti</hi> hath published the most part of them at <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he lived several years. In the First Book of the second Volume of this <hi>Brittish Theater,</hi> is the reason why he left it. He went into <hi>France</hi> immediately upon it, and presented to the King a <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> which he had made upon that Monarch, Entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>la Fama Gelo sa della Fortuna.</hi> The Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Mercury of the Month of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1680. and the Journal of the Learned of the 29th of the same Month, speak much in the Commendation of the Person of Mr. <hi>Leti,</hi> and of the <hi>Panegyrick</hi> which he presented at the same time to the King at <hi>Fontainebleau.</hi> He was very well received by this Prince, yet notwithstanding he made no stay at his Court, because he saw there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done there for Protestants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he chose therefore to withdraw into <hi>England.</hi> He was soon known there, and honoured with a considerable Present by our King some few days after his arrival. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so obliged him to Compose a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on His Majesty, who received it very Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously.

                        </gap>nish him with the Memoires which he would require. This was the reason why this Work was much talkt of; As it was one day spoken of at the King's getting up, some one said,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103507:62"/>
That he did not believe that a Stranger could succeed in Writing the History of <hi>England:</hi> others maintained, That a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger would succeed better, because he would speak with less Interest; and that there ought to be no difficulty made to furnish him with requisites for it, rather than to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive born. The King, who excells in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parties, said thereupon; <hi>Let him alone; if he doth well, it is so much the better: if not, 'twill excite some other to try to acquit himself better.</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> knowing what was said of his Work afore-hand, neglected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what could be useful to him: He visited carefully the Wisest Persons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and had considerable Memorials of them: He informed himself of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, of the Laws, and of the Customs of the State, and of all the Particularities of the Countrey. It must not be forgotten that he was made a Member of the Royal Society, by the Nomination of the Decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Duke of <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He begun with describing the Antient and Modern State of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> which he included in two Volumes in 4to. He propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to himself to compose three others, for the History it self of the Country. Whilst he was about these two first Volumes, the King asked him one day, <hi>If his History would be soon ended.</hi> He Answered, <hi>That he feared it would be finished too soon. And why,</hi> reply'd the King? <hi>Because,</hi> Answer'd Mr. <hi>Leti, I fear the Destiny of Historians, which is to be recompenced by Exile, or Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment. You are too Wise,</hi> reply'd the King, <hi>to expose your self to that. If one was as wise as</hi> Solomon, answered the Author, <hi>ones de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny cannot be avoided. Well then,</hi> added the King, <hi>if you believe there is so much danger in Writing Histories, Write Proverbs as</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon <hi>did.</hi> That seemed to be a Presage of what hapned afterwards; but Mr. <hi>Leti</hi> ceased not to go on in his Work, and even to say to the Court, when the occasion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, <hi>That he Writ a History, and not a Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick; that they should dispose themselves so as to see the Truth there, without Flattery as well as without Satyrs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As soon as the Edition of these two Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes were ended, he presented them to the King and Queen, to whom they were Dedicated; to the Duke and Dutchess of <hi>York.</hi> They were very well received: and during ten days Mr. <hi>Leti</hi> was seen at Court as favourably as afore. He believed then, that seeing the King who was willing to read the Work himself, and who stayed up very late some nights to end the Reading there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, said nothing, it was a sign the Book did not displease him. From that time he made divers Presents to the Ambassadors who were at <hi>London,</hi> and to the Lords of the Court. It was, it seems, through the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion of an Ambassador, that this Work which the King had read without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent dislike, passed for a dangerous Book, and hurtful to the State, as treating too open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and too clearly of such Truths as were thought would be better concealed. The Council assembled divers times thereupon, and it was at last concluded, That all the Copies should be seized which the Author had, and that he should be commanded in Ten days to depart <hi>England.</hi> The thing was executed, but mildly. One may see what Mr. <hi>Leti</hi> saith thereof, <hi>p.</hi> 16. of the Second Volume. He relates in the <hi>Preface</hi> of the First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> something a Prelate said to him, which deserves to be taken notice of. <hi>Signior Gregorio,</hi> saith he un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>We thought that the <hi>Reader</hi> would be glad to learn the Adventures both of an History, and an Author, who have made so much noise. And therefore shall proceed to the Work it self.</p>
                     <p>What had been Printed at <hi>London</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but the Antient and Modern State of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> It is to be had entire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing cut off in the two First Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of this Edition; except the Author thought it more expedient to reserve for the Fifth Volume any thing which was Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
                     <p>The First Volume contains eleven Books; whereof the First gives a brief account of the History and Religion of <hi>England,</hi> whilst it had been possessed by divers Princes, and bore the Name of <hi>Britannia,</hi> to wit unto <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> who reduced it altogether under his Power, and gave it the Name of <hi>England,</hi> or of <hi>Anglia,</hi> at the end of the Eighth Age. There are in this First Book divers things very curious concerning the <hi>Druides,</hi> and the Gods who were adored in <hi>England,</hi> before the Faith had been planted in it. The <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> describes in the Second Book, the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the Situation, the Provinces, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the Cities, the Bishopricks, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, the Fertility, the Merchandises, the Negotiations, and the Buildings of <hi>England.</hi> The Third Book is employed altogether up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Description of the Famous City of <hi>London.</hi> Here there is more exactness than in the very Writings of some <hi>English,</hi> who have given the Publick the state of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City, and that of the whole Kingdom. There is, according to the supputation of Mr. <hi>Leti,</hi> near Four hundred fifty thousand Souls in <hi>London,</hi> and about Six Millions in the whole Kingdom. The Fourth speaks of the Government and Priviledges of the same City, as well as of the Factions which do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it. The Sixth describes the Humour of the <hi>English,</hi> and the Application they have to Religion, and to the Observation of the Laws of the Country. The Seventh is a Continuation of the same subject, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Laws and divers Customs of <hi>England.</hi> The Eighth speaks of the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers who are in that Country, and chiefly of the <hi>French Protestants</hi> who have fled thither some time since. In this is the Declaration of the King of <hi>France,</hi> importing, <hi>That the Children of those of the</hi> R. P. R. <hi>may
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103507:62"/>
convert at seven Years</hi>; accompanied with political and very curious Reflections. In the Ninth Book the Author describes the Three States of <hi>England,</hi> the Clergy, the Nobility and the People, but particularly the first. It contains the number, and names of the Bishops of this time; the manner of consecrating them, their Revenues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Tenth speaks of the State of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> of their number, of their Exercises, of the Endeavours to bring in again their Religion, of the Missions of Fryars, and of the Complaints they make of Protestants. The Author adds the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of the Protestants to these Complaints, and shews by the <hi>Catholick</hi> Authors the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> upon <hi>England,</hi> and of the Intrigues it makes use of to bring it under its Yoke. The last Book of this Volume contains the Policy of the Court of <hi>England</hi> and its Maxims of State.</p>
                     <p>The Second Volume is composed of Eight Books, whereof the two first do treat of the Religion and different Parties which divide it. Therein are to be seen the Disputes of the Conformists, and of the Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists, the Opinions of the Quakers, of Anabaptists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Fourth contains the Foundations and the Rights of the Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> the Revenues of the King, and other Particulars of this nature. There are several things in this place, which cannot be found elsewhere. The fifth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the Government of <hi>England,</hi> the King's Council, the Parliament, and the divers Tribunals of Justice of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Herein are the Reasons why Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments have opposed in so many Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Designs of King's, which Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are commonly ignorant of. The sixth speaks of the particular Government of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and of Countries, as also of the Posts, of Governours of Places, of the Garisons, and of the Land Forces and Sea Forces of <hi>England.</hi> The seventh is a Description of the Court, and the King's Officers, and of the Royal Family. The last speaks of the strange Ministers who are at <hi>London,</hi> of the manner wherewith they receive Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours there, Residents, Envoys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of the Priviledges they enjoy. Here is the Description of those who were in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> whilst the Author lived here. He tells very frankly their good or ill Qualities; and this is not a little useful to judge of their Negotiations, and to know why the one succeeds without pains in his Designs, whilst the other stumbles every where. It were to be wished, that all the Histories which we have, were thus circumstantiated. For as there would be much more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in reading them, so we might also profit thereby much more than we do. We should know not only the Events, but also the secret Causes, the Intrigues, and the means which have contributed to the great Revolutions, and it is what may profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably instruct us. What signifieth it to know in general, that a certain thing hath happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a certain Year, if we do not know how and wherefore: It is the Conduct of Men which serveth us for an Example and an Instruction, and not the simple Events, which of themselves are of no use to us. But where are there Men so couragious as to write without Flattery the History of their Time? Where are there Princes who are so just as to suffer that their Truths should be told to their Faces? Where are there even Ministers of State, who would permit that their Defects should be divulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during their Life? Nevertheless, it is but then that it can be well done; for if in the time wherein things are fresh, more than one half is forgotten; much more are the following Ages deprived of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a thousand particular Facts, which have produced great Affairs.</p>
                     <p>The Author having thus described the State of the Kingdom in the two first Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, takes up again in the three others, the sequel of the History of <hi>England,</hi> from <hi>Egbert,</hi> and continues it unto M DC Lxxxii. He hath disposed his Work after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that after having made all the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Remarks of the History of <hi>England</hi> in the two first Volumes, he should not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in the following to interrupt the course of his Narration. The third Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume contains Six Books, whereof the last is destined to the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. The fourth Volume is composed of Five Books, the first whereof includes the Reign of <hi>Edward,</hi> and of <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Second that of their Sister <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> In the Third the Author after he begins the History of King <hi>Iames</hi> who reunited the Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, makes a Description of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and speaks of their Ancient and Modern State, after which in the Fourth Book he composes the History of the Reign of King <hi>Iames,</hi> wherein are very curious Particulars. There is the Life of famous <hi>M rc Antony de Dominis,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Spalatro,</hi> included in a Letter written from <hi>Rome.</hi> The Author had already publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in the Third Part of his <hi>Brittanica Politica.</hi> It is a very curious Piece, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is seen how this Prelate imbraced the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and how being deluded by the Promises of <hi>Dom Diego Sarmianto de Acuna,</hi> Ambassador of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and by that of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he unhappily end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Days, without obtaining any thing of what he hoped. There also is a Letter of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> who was since <hi>Charles</hi> I. Upon his Marriage with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and an Answer of this Prince to the Pope. The Fifth Book contains the Reign of the same Prince, where his Innocence may be seen, and the unheard of Violence of his Subjects describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without partiality, and all the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which were made against him.</p>

                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:103507:63"/>The last Volume is composed of Six Books. The first contains the History of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Usurpation more exact and sincere that it had been heretofore: Hitherto have been but Satyrs or Panegyricks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. The Creatures of <hi>Cromwell</hi> have raised him up to the Clouds, and his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have omitted nothing that might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame him. The Author pretends that he hath been the greatest Politician, and the greatest Captain of his time, and that he was much more able to Reign than seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of those whom Providence hath plac'd upon the Throne by Inheritance. But he sheweth on the other side, That he was a Cheat and a Tyrant, who after having dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his hand in the Innocent Blood of his Master, all his Life cheated the People by a specious Zeal for Religion. The Second Book contains the History of <hi>Charles</hi> the II. until his Restauration. In this Book are seen the Honours which were rendred to him in <hi>Holland</hi>; his Magnificent Entry into <hi>London,</hi> his Clemency to those who had bore Arms against him, and his Justice towards the Murderers of his Father. The same History is continued in the Third Book from the Year M. DC. LXI. unto the Year M. DC. LXXX. There is also the Life of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> until his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with Chancellour <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the Quarrel, which happened between the Ambassadours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> about Precedency: The subtilty wherewith the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador carried it; the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Princess <hi>Henrietta,</hi> and that of the King, the War of <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Holland,</hi> and with <hi>France</hi>; the Peace that was made afterwards with both the others, which was followed with a secret Treaty betwixt <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>France,</hi> appeared in M. DC. Lxxii. the Marriage of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> with the Princess of <hi>Modena</hi>; the Calling, Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and dissolving different Parliaments. In fine, the Discovery which <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow</hi> made of a Conspiracy, which made so great noise, and whereof this Author appears not very much persuaded. We find in the fourth Book the sequel of the same Troubles, and the History of what passed in the Parliaments convocated in M. DC.LXXX. at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Oxford.</hi> There is particularly in this Book one thing of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great importance, which the Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with as much sincerity, as if none was interessed therein. Which are, 1. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> made to exclude the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from the Crown. 2. The Reasons which were alledged for this. 3. The manner wherewith the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of this Prince defended his Rights. The Author endeth this Book by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Pensilvania,</hi> without omitting either the Offers which are made to those who will go to inhabit it, or the manner they may be established in it. The fifth Book begins with the Encomium of the House of <hi>Savoy</hi>; and tells us afterwards with a very great exactness the means which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made use of in M. DC. LXXX. and M.DC.LXXXII. to obtain of his <hi>British</hi> Majesty, that the Ambassadours of <hi>Savoy</hi> shou'd be received in <hi>London</hi> like those of Crowned Heads. It is one of the finest places of the whole Work, and they who love to read the particulars of a Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, cannot read a more curious one, nor one better related than this. The last contains the Affair of Count <hi>Koningsmarc,</hi> with all its Circumstances, which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good History, and whence the manner may be Learned after what Strangers are judged in <hi>England.</hi> Here it is, that the Work endeth. The Author promiseth us in his Preface another Volume, where all will appear which hath happen'd in <hi>England</hi> till these latter Years.</p>
                     <p>The Style of this History, as well as the other Works of Mr. <hi>Leti,</hi> is easy and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Affectation, contrary to the custom of most <hi>Italian</hi> Writers: But what is most considerable, is, that he relate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Matters so nakedly, and speaks so freely of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of the greatest Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> that perhaps one day persons will not be easily persuaded, that the Author had caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Work to be printed during his Life, and the life of those of whom he speaks, if at the beginning, the Year had not been marked wherein it was print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Leti</hi> hath since written a Book which treats of all that concerneth Embassies. There may not only be seen the modern use of all Courts in this respect, but the ancient also; so that it will be a History of great concern. The Author is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to speak of the Duties and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of all the Ministers which one So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign sends to another, but of each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Degree of his Character; he speaks largely also on the Origine of this Function, and upon all the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which are formed in the World. He relates several Examples of Ambassadours, who have committed gross Mistakes, and gives Instructions how to manage worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Post, according to the different Courts wherein they are oblig'd to reside. Men, will easily believe that a Work which treats of things of this nature, and of so great a number of others, is worthy of Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

Though they differ amongst themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout several Speculative Doctrines, they perfectly agree upon <hi>Morality,</hi> and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which we owe to the <hi>Divinity</hi>; they also, in general, are of one Mind, in those Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion which they admit, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to Holy Writ, and have all an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream aversion for that Church, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be a Judge in its own Cause; and which, without delay, forceth those it calls <hi>Hereticks,</hi> to a Worship which is against their Consciences.</p>
                     <p>Amongst the Protestant Societies, there is none who hath declared it self more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly against Human Authority, in matter of Religion, and against the Constraining and Spirit of Persecution, than the Remonstrants. They will have the Fundamental Error of the <hi>R. Church</hi> to consist in this. <hi>We must not</hi> (saith <hi>Episcopius,</hi> in a Writing inserted by Mr. <hi>Limborg,</hi> in the <hi>Preface</hi> of this Work) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider Popery in some of its parts, but in its whole; not in this Doctrine, nor in that, which is accused of Heresie; for it is almost the same thing on both sides; the one is mistaken in one point and the other in another..... We must look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole Body of the Roman Church, which is a composition of ignorant, ambitious and tyrannical Men: I call them ignorant, not because they are not very Learned, for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are too much so; but because they know not, and are obliged to know only what is prescribed unto them, often against their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, against Reason and Divine Law. It is the most pernicious of all Ignorances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a servile one, which is upheld only by the Authority of the Pope and Councils, and which is the source of the many Sophisms they are constrained to make, to maintain such Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they have ingaged themselves into, whether they find them true or false. It extends its Empire, as well upon the Practice as Belief, because they are both tyed to the Foundations, which they are always to suppose unshaken, without freeing themselves by examining the solidity thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thence Tyranny is form'd. It is this which makes it impossible ever to come back from this ignorance; and which produceth</hi> Idolatry, <hi>and ridiculous thoughts of the Divine Worship. It is the Poyson of true Religion, because it leads Men to serve God, not according to his Will, or by a Principle of Knowledg and Conscience, but after that manner which the Pope liketh. So that it is in vain to say, that in this Church are many things, which are good, or sufferable; this availeth nothing, seeing they hold not what is good, because it is good; but because they are obliged to acknowledge it for such.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Remonstrants have upon this, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht Principles, which are very opposite to those of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> They not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, with other Protestants, that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture contains clearly all that is necessary to be known, to believe, to hope, to do, and to be saved; and that all those who read it with an attentive mind, and without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, may acquire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by this reading a perfect knowledge of the Truths contain'd in it, and that there is no other Divine Rule of our Faith: but they admit also, and maintain the necessary consequence of this Principle, upon which many Divines expound not themselves distinctly enough.</p>
                     <p>Thence it followeth, saith Mr. <hi>Limborg</hi> in this <hi>Preface,</hi> 1. That no Man, whoever he be, no Assembly, how considerable soever its Authority is, and how Learned soever its Members are, have not a Right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing to the Faithful, as necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, what God hath not commanded as such in his Word. 2. That from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion are to be excluded those only whom God hath clearly revealed he will exclude from Heaven. 3. That to know certainly Damnable Errors, and wholsome Doctrines, we must see if in Scripture God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Salvation to those who shall believe these Doctrines; or threatned with Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation those who shall embrace these Errors. 4. That the only means to procure the Peace of the Church, it to suffer those who retain the Fundamental Doctrines, although, according to us, they are mistaken in things which God hath not commanded, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited expresly, under the condition of Salvation or Damnation. 5. That if this rule was followed, all <hi>Christians,</hi> who have quitted the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> would soon agree in Fundamental Points, and differ but in Tenets, which have neither been command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor prohibited under this condition. 6. That consequently none have a right of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the necessity of Believing, under pain of Damnation, these non-essential Tenets. 7. That no other means can procure a true Christian Union; because constraint may tye the Tongue, but not gain the Heart.</p>
                     <p>This is the drift of the <hi>Preface</hi>; to come to the Work it self, It is composed of three Letters, and of a small Treatise of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Bom</hi> a Roman Catholick, with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Answers, and some other Letters of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopius,</hi> concerning the Infallibility of the Church. The matter, we see, is of the utmost consequence, and it is sufficiently known after what manner <hi>Episcopius</hi> was able to treat thereof. <hi>Bom</hi> was a Priest, who was no great Grecian, as he confesseth himself, and who besides was ingaged in the weakest Hypothesis; which the Doctors
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103507:64"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> ever embraced; it is that which makes the Infallibility of the <hi>Church</hi> reside in the Pope's Person. So that although he hath exposed pretty well the common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of his Party, it may be said of him, in relation to his Adversary,
<q>
                           <l>Par studiis, aevique modis, sed robore dispar.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The occasion of this Dispute was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which <hi>Bom</hi> and <hi>Episcopius</hi> had, at the coming from a Sermon which the last had Preached. Some of those who had been present thereat, declared, That <hi>Bom</hi> had been reduced to silence: upon which, he being willing to shew how much these reports were false, Writ to two common Friends, to put them in mind of the Reasons he had said, and added to that a Writing, to prove that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was established chief of the <hi>Catholick Church. Episcopius</hi> at first made some difficulty of Answering this Priest; because there is nothing more tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and more unprofitable for a Protestant, than to enter into dispute with a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> seeing that as it is an Article of Faith with him, that his Church is Infallible, so he believes himself obliged in Conscience not to confer with Hereticks, but in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of instructing them, and not to have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the thought of receiving any instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor any light from them.</p>
                     <p>It is not possible, without ingaging ones self into an excessive prolixity, to relate all the reasons, which have been said on each side, in this dispute; we shall only stop at some of the principal proofs, and those which are not so commonly met withal in Books of Controversie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Episcopius</hi> failed not at first to ask of his Adversary, in what place of the Gospel <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> had appointed any body to be Soveraign Judge of Controversies, and to decide, without Appeal all the differences which should arise in the Church, after the death of the Apostles? As there are not in Scripture, passages sufficiently express for this institution? <hi>Bom</hi> had recourse to the Practice of the Church; upon which <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> alledged to him three Acts of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical History, which agrees not well with the Belief of the Infallibility of the Pope.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first is drawn from the dispute; which fell out towards the middle of the Second Age, concerning the day in which the Passover should be celebrated. <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> Excommunicated the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Diocess of <hi>Asia,</hi> because they Celebrated this Feast the Fourteenth day of <hi>March,</hi> and not the Sunday following, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Custom of <hi>Rome, Palestine</hi> and the <hi>Gauls. The conduct of</hi> Victor <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not all the other Bishops, who exhorted him, in their turn, to have sentiments confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to a Peace, Unity and Love to our Neighbours. There are still of their Letters, adds</hi> Eusebius, <hi>wherein they reprehend</hi> Victor <hi>with eagerness enough. Amongst these Bishops was</hi> Irenaeus, <hi>who, in the Letter which he Writ upon this Subject, in the Name of the Brothers, over whom he presided among the</hi> Gauls, <hi>maintains also, that one Sunday must be Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the Resurrection of our Lord: yet he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiseth</hi> Victor <hi>with much gravity, that he ought not to cut off from the Communion whole Churches of God, who observe a Tradition and Ancient Custom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It will be some difficulty to believe, that <hi>Bom</hi> found in this Affair a Proof of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope: Notwithstanding it is the conclusion he draws from it, and grounds, 1. Upon that the Bishops who were displeased at this Excommunication, would undoubtedly have acted with more haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against <hi>Victor,</hi> if he had not been their Superior: whereas they speak unto him with a mildness, which marks well, that they contested not the Right of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating the Churches, as not being of his Jurisdiction; but that they only found fault with the use he made thereof, the cause of the Excommunication not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of consequence enough, according to them. 2. That notwithstanding they were deceived in that, and that <hi>Victor</hi> did well to use this rigour, because <hi>Blastus,</hi> one of the principal Patrons of the Opinion of the <hi>Asia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> would have introduced <hi>Iudaism,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this pretence. 3. That the Church approved of the Conduct of <hi>Victor,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Bishops of <hi>Asia,</hi> to whom was given the name of <hi>Quartodecimal Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> 4. That <hi>Irenaeus</hi> himself hath not doubted of the Superiority of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> seeing he saith elsewhere,
<q>That all the Churches must, to wit, all the Faithful, of what place soever they are, come to this Church in which the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Tradition hath been preserved, by those who came to it from every Part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of its more powerful Principality.</q>
                        <hi>Ad hanc enim Ecclesiam, propter potentiorem Principalitatem, necesse est omnem convenire Ecclesiam, hoc est, eos qui sunt undique fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deles, in qua semper ab his qui sunt undique, conservata est ea quae est ab Apostolis Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Episcopius</hi> Replies: That the Answer of the Bishops of <hi>Asia,</hi> and the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> would not be very respectful, if <hi>Victor</hi> had been the Chief of the Church; that the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies properly <hi>to give a contrary order,</hi> and those of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>acerbius per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringere,</hi> are not invented to express the submission of a Subject to his Prince; and that if these Bishops could take it ill, that their Judge, a pretended Soveraign, and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> should banish from the Church, and exclude from Heaven so great a number of Churches, for so slight a cause, they have therefore thought that he might be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his Decisions, upon matters of Faith, and that they had a right to examine them. 2. That the Heresie of <hi>Blastus</hi> justifies not
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103507:64"/>
the proceedings of <hi>Victor</hi>; seeing the <hi>Asia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> looked not upon the Celebration of the Passover as a necessary Observance, and which should precisely be applyed to such a day; that they were contented that <hi>Victor</hi> and other Bishops should Celebrate it on Sunday, if they had their Reasons for it; but that they, having not the same proofs thereof, believed themselves not obliged to abandon the Apostolical Tradition. It hath not been remarked that our Professor answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the passage of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> because we need only to read it throughly, to shew, that there is no mention there of the Right of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Decision of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, but only of the Characters which they, in the time of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> did acknowledge A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical. Thereupon he saith, <hi>That it must be sought for in the places where the Apostles have established Bishops; but because it would be too long to make an enumeration of all the Apostolick Churches, he stops at one of the most ancient and greatest, which is the Church of</hi> Rome. As this City was the Capital of the Empire, <hi>Principalitas Potentior</hi>; and that for that Reason the Inhabitants of divers Provinces negotiated there, and were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to come thither; <hi>Irenaeus</hi> concludes, that the Apostolical Tradition could not fail of having been faithfully kept there; since that if the <hi>Christians</hi> of a Province, or of a City had been minded to corrupt it; the <hi>Christians</hi> of other places, who were at <hi>Rome,</hi> would have opposed it; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable to suppose, that so many different Nations would agree to abandon, in so little a time, the Doctrine of the Apostles.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>Bom</hi> often alledged passages out of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> for the Authority of Popes; that gave occasion to <hi>Episcopius</hi> of citing him the 22d <hi>Canon</hi> of the Council of <hi>Millan,</hi> where St. <hi>Augustin</hi> was Secretary; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Canon</hi> of the 6th Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where this Bishop also assisted; both which prohibited the drawing Ecclesiastical Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Diocess of <hi>Africk</hi> on the other side the Sea, whether they regard the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Members of the Clergy, or the very Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. That the Deputies of the Pope ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving represented to the Assembly, That this <hi>Canon</hi> destroyed the Priviledges, which the Council had granted to the Patriarch of <hi>Rome,</hi> in permitting Ecclesiasticks to appeal unto him in Judgments had against them by the Ordinaries; the Bishops of <hi>Africk</hi> were extreamly surprized, and said all Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously, That they never heard of such Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges. Thereupon these Deputies rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted three <hi>Canons,</hi> which they said to be of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Fathers of <hi>Carthage</hi> to <hi>Constantinople, Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the Authentick Copies of this Council; where, not finding these three <hi>Canons,</hi> they Writ to the Pope, That the Right of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing, which he pretended to, in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Supream Judge, and belonged not to him, by virtue of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> seeing the Three <hi>Canons,</hi> upon which he grounded his pretentions, were not to be found in the Originals.</p>
                     <p>The Exceptions are reduced to this, 1. That the Council of <hi>Millan</hi> prohibits but the Inferior Clerks to Appeal beyond the Sea; and that this is evident, because Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> to whom the Synod of <hi>Millan</hi> submitted all their Decrees, as to the Head of the Church, approved the <hi>Canon</hi> in question. 2. That there is no reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Copy of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which was kept at <hi>Rome,</hi> was supposed, but that there is much more likelyhood that those of <hi>Constantinople, Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> were defective; seeing the Manuscript, upon which <hi>Ruffinus</hi> Writ his History, was so; and that there are several <hi>Canons</hi> of this Council, cited in that of <hi>Calcedonia,</hi> and in St. <hi>Ambros,</hi> St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and <hi>Ierome,</hi> which are not found in this Historian. 3. That the Decrees which are accused of Supposition, have been cited by other Popes, before <hi>Zozime</hi> (as <hi>Iulius</hi> speaks, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but Twenty years after the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> could easily have been convinced of falshood;) as also by <hi>Leo</hi> and by <hi>Innocent.</hi> 4. That there are several proofs of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the Bishops of <hi>Africk</hi> to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Letter of <hi>Stephen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania</hi> Written to <hi>Damasus</hi> in the name of three Synods of <hi>Africk,</hi> where, after several high Titles which this Prelate gives to the Pope, he tells him, <hi>That the Decrees of all the Fathers of these Synods have reserved eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sentence, Iudgment of Bishops, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Ecclesiastical Affairs to his See, in honour of blessed</hi> Peter. 5. That it is not true, that this 6th Council hath prohibited to Appeal from <hi>Africk</hi> to the Pope, seeing that in the Letter, which the Bishops Writ to him, they only desire him not to <hi>hearken slightly</hi> to the Ecclesiasticks of <hi>Africk</hi> who shall have recourse to him.</p>
                     <p>To refute the first Objection, <hi>Episcopius</hi> relates the very words of the <hi>Canon</hi> of the Council of <hi>Millan,</hi> viz. <hi>It was ordered that when Priests, Deacons and other inferior Clerks shall complain of the Iudgment of their Bishops, they shall be heard by the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bishops, who with the consent of their Bishop, and joyntly with him, shall pronounce a definitive Sentence upon his Affair. That if they would appeal from this Iudgment of Bishops, they shall carry their appeal but before the Councils of</hi> Africk, <hi>or before the Primate of their Province; so as it hath been often or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in affairs which respect Bishops. If any one would appeal to the other side the Sea; that is to say, to</hi> Rome, <hi>or without the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, let him be excluded from the Communion of</hi> Africk.</p>
                     <p>The Letter which the Bishops of the 6th Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> Assembled to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 207, Writ to Pope <hi>Celestin,</hi> after they had received the Original of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> and seen that the <hi>Canons,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Deputies of the Bishop of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103507:65"/>
                        <hi>Rome,</hi> were not in it, deserveth to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. <hi>We pray you,</hi> say they, <hi>that for the future you give no more so slightly Audience, to those who shall go hence to you, and that you no more receive into Communion those who are excluded from ours; seeing you may easily mark that this hath been thus ordered by the Council of</hi> Nice. <hi>For if it seems that this Council was willing to prohibit from such Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals the inferior Clerks and Laicks, by how much more would it have this Prohibition to give place in the affairs which regard Bishops; whence it followeth, that those who are suspended from the Communion, amongst us, ought not to be re-established precipitatly, or unlawfully, by your Holiness. Let therefore all Refugé be taken away from bad Priests; seeing there is no Canon, which hath deprived the Church of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick <hi>of this priviledge, and that those of</hi> Nice <hi>have as well submitted the inferior Clerks, as Bishops, to their Metropolitans.</hi> The Fathers of this Council have prudently and justly judged, that every Affair ought to be judged in the place where it happeneth; assuring themselves, that the Grace of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> would not fail to be poured into each Province, where there are Priests of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> capable of examining wisely the equity of an Affair, and of constantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it; especially since that it is lawful for every one who thinks he hath reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his ordinary Judges, to Appeal to the Provincial Councils, or to the General. If it be not, as some imagine, that God may sufficiently inspire every one of us, to judge of the equity of an Affair, but that he will refuse his Grace to a great number of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Assembled in Council.</p>
                     <p>It is a vain conjecture to say, That the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which was kept at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> the Copies of the Patriarchs of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and all those that 207 Bishops had, were defective. But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe that the Pope, knowing that some <hi>Canons</hi> were missing in Copies of Particulars, imbraced this occasion, to make three <hi>Canons</hi> of a Synod of <hi>Sardis</hi> to pass for Decrees of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which were in his favour.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It's true that <hi>Iulius</hi> Writ a Letter to the Eastern Bishops, to get <hi>Athanasius</hi> and some other Bishops re-establish'd in their Sees; but it's also true, that when these Bishops had received it, they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as an outragious Letter; assembled themselves into a Synod at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and made him unanimously a civil Answer in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but full of <hi>Ironies</hi> and <hi>Menaces,</hi> saith <hi>Sozomene</hi>; to which <hi>Socrates</hi> adds, <hi>That they severely reprehended</hi> Julius, <hi>letting him know, That it was not necessary that they should take Laws from him, in banishing some Persons from their Churches, and that they had not opposed him, when he had banished</hi> Novatus <hi>from his.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the Letter of <hi>Stephen</hi> to Pope <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masus,</hi> most of the Learned do take it to be suppositious, because it's only to be found in <hi>Isidonus Mercator,</hi> who hath attributed several other Letters to <hi>Damasus,</hi> and one to <hi>Aurelius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which <hi>Baronius</hi> acknowledgeth false. But though it was true, What can be concluded from the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a particular Bishop, but that he was one of these Ecclesiasticks, who having been Excommunicated because of their Crimes in <hi>Africk,</hi> flattered the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> to re-establish them again by their means? To this unknown <hi>Stephen</hi> are opposed famous St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Firmilian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> who treated Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> with contempt enough, upon the occasion of the dispute touching the Baptism of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The terms, <hi>of not receiving slightly and unlawfully the Communion</hi>: the <hi>African</hi> Ecclesiasticks, who fled to <hi>Rome,</hi> mark not (according to <hi>Episcopius</hi>) and that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the City had a right to admit them to the Peace of the Church, provided this was done with the necessary Formalities. He pretends, that the Fathers of <hi>Carthage</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed themselves thus, to shew, that not only the Pope violated the <hi>Canons,</hi> but that he often did, with much temerity, and without any specious pretence, as when he received the Appeal of the Priest <hi>Apiarius,</hi> and admitted him to the Communion, though this very thing is expresly prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Sardis,</hi> which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of <hi>Zozime</hi> would suggest, as Decrees of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. The third Fact, which <hi>Episcopius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, is the Erection of the Bishoprick of <hi>Constantinople</hi> into the Patriarchship, to whom equal Priviledges were given with him of <hi>Rome</hi>; in Ecclesiastical Affairs, with this only difference, That the Patriarch of ancient <hi>Rome</hi> would have the precedency in Councils, before him. The Bishop of <hi>Bizantium</hi> was in times past but a Suffragan of the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan of <hi>Heraclea</hi>; but after that <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> had transported thither the Imperial Seat, it was considered as new <hi>Rome,</hi> and erected into a Patriarchiate by the <hi>Third Canon</hi> of the Council of <hi>Constantinople</hi> composed of 150 Bishops, and confirmed by the 28<hi>th Canon</hi> of the 4<hi>th Ecumenick</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which is that of <hi>Calcedonia.</hi> The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that our <hi>Catholicks</hi> make against these <hi>Canons</hi> are so weak, that we think them not worthy of being related, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally seeing Mr. <hi>du Pin</hi> hath cleared this fact in his Historical Dissertations, <hi>p.</hi> 45, &amp;c. <hi>fol.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>Bom</hi> after that takes another turn, to <hi>Answer</hi> the Question of <hi>Episcopius,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Institution of a Soveraign Judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Controversies,</hi> who succeeded the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi> He asks of him a formal passage, Wherein <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath ordered the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, that if there arose Disputes in the <hi>Church,</hi> they should Convocate a Synod, and make Decisions thereupon, to which the Faithful should be obliged in Conscience to submit. <hi>There is no appearance,</hi> adds he,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103507:65"/>
                        <hi>that the Apostles should do it, if they had not believed this Action conformable to the Will of their Master, nor that the Primitive Church should so soon imitate them, if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had ordered nothing thereupon.</hi> It must then be that either the Institution of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods is an Apostolical Tradition, or that it is an inseparable Sequel of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Promises, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath made to those who exercise it; <hi>I am always with you until the end of the World</hi>; and other Passages, which tho they are at every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the mouth of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> seem not the stronger for that to <hi>Protestants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Episcopius</hi> confesseth, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath commanded no where his Disciples to convocate Synods; and that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they have done it. He adds, That according to their Example, <hi>Ecclesiastical Assemblies</hi> may be held; but that it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that these Assemblies, where none less than the Holy Ghost presides, have as much Authority as the Apostolick ones. The reason hereof is, that the Authority of the Apostolick Synods depended not so much on the consent and conformity of their Opinions, as on the quality of their persons, and of the Authority which God had clothed them with, by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations he had made unto them, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he had given them. This will appear evident, if we take notice of the conduct of the Apostles. When they have an express command from God, they expect not the Resolutions of a Synod for to act; and St. <hi>Peter</hi> understood no sooner the meaning of the Vision, which he had had, but he went to <hi>Cornelius.</hi> But when they speak of their own head, they say, <hi>I advise you,</hi> 1 Cor. vii. 25. On these occasions they took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of one another: Sometime they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed not, as it happened to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> Act. xv. 39. But commonly the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Mildness and Peace, which fill'd them, and which shewed them all the Principles and all the Consequences of the Gospel, brought them mutually to consult each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So that their actions being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the Spirit of God, they could say, <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But tho it was granted, that the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Synods is of a divine Institution, doth it follow, that all the Synods and Councils, which have been held after the Apostles, have made good Decisions? A Catholick denyes it, and if he is asked the reason: He must of necessity answer, that what distinguisheth true Synods from false ones, is, that there have been some which have had all the Conditions necessary for a true Synod, and have made good <hi>Decisions,</hi> and the others wanting these Conditions, have been but <hi>Conciliabula.</hi> But how can it be known that these Conditions are assured marks of the Truth of Synods, seeing that there is not one which is not equivocate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to some Doctors of the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> And how can one tell what Synod hath them? Will it be known by its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions? But they should be examined, and so to deny the Principle, to wit, that it might have pronounced a definitive Sentence. Is it enough to assure it lawful, that it be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral? Yes, for the <hi>Gallican Church</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> but not for <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> It must besides be confirmed by the Pope; but who hath given him this Right? Is it a Priviledge of the Successors of St. <hi>Peter?</hi> How have they obtained it, and whence comes it that the Bishops of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who have succeeded this Apostle as well as those of <hi>Rome,</hi> have had no share in it? Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, what needs there any trouble to prove the Authority of Synods, when People are of the sentiment of <hi>Bom,</hi> and the <hi>Iesuites.</hi> And seeing that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours are the Soveraign Judges of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, what need is there of these Ecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Assemblies, convocated with so much difficulty and Expences? It's not enough to interrogate this infallible Judge, and to receive his Decisions as Oracles from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>The Passages which the <hi>Catholick</hi> alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here in his behalf, and the Answers which he hath made to those of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> have been so often repeated, that tho <hi>Episcopius</hi> refutes them sufficiently after a new manner, we notwithstanding do not think it worth while to stop at them. We shall only relate the manner, wherewith our Professour tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slates the famous passage of the First Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> III. 15, 16. because it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and that it destroyeth at once all the proofs which the <hi>Roman Church</hi> could draw thence. <hi>Episcopius</hi> having proved against his Adversary, as an illiterate Person, that the Division of the Canonical Books into Chapters and Verses, is not of the Sacred Writers, and that it is not they, who have put the Points and Comma's thereto; he sheweth him, that it is much more natural and more conformable to the aim of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, to point this place otherwise than the common Copies are: And to Translate it thus: <hi>I have written this unto you, That if I delay to come, you may know how Men ought to behave themselves in the House of God, which is the Church of the living God. The stay and prop of Truth and the Mystery of Piety is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly great, God manifested in the Flesh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When there is want of clear Reasons and convincing Arguments, people are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to have recourse to Prejudices, to Comparisons, and to the Reasons of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. Therefore the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> say incessantly to us, That God who well knew, that there would arise Disputes in the Church, upon Matters of Faith (as there are Processes formed amongst Citizens of one State, touching the Goods which they possess) ought to establish a Judge, who should be consulted at all times, and who might instruct us in the true sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in contested places, and thus end the Differences. It seemeth that <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> otherwise would not have taken care enough
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103507:66"/>
of his Church and the faithful who compose it; seeing he would not have given them means of assuring themselves perfectly, that the Doctrine which appears most conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scripture, is true; if they might be in doubt as to several Articles of Faith, and that what they should most determinately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thereupon, could not pass but for a a greater likelihood of Truth.</p>
                     <p>It must be granted, that there would be nothing better understood, nor more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious than a Judge of this nature. There would be no more need for one to break his Head in examining all things, and to seek for truth; it should be all found, and People would go to Heaven by a very plain way. Why was not <hi>Iesus</hi> pleased to render the way more easy. and did not tell us where we should find such a Judge? We are therefore obliged to look for him, saith <hi>Episcopious</hi>; and this Disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must necessarily aim at either of these two things; Either that each particular So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Christians, and even each Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Society attribute to it self the Power of Soveraign judging of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies; or that the Universal Church, to wit, the Body of all those who profess the Gospel, hath at all times right to chuse such a Judge. The first cannot be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because every one looking upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as Infallible, no body would submit himself to the Decisions of his Neighbour. The second is naturally unpracticable; for before the Universal Church can choose a Supream Judge of Controversies, it must needs have cast it's Eyes upon divers Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects capable of fulfilling this Charge, and examined carefully their capacity. And how shall it make this Examination? All the Christian Societies must concur in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection: But how should they agree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and whom could they choose, who should not be suspitious or uncapable of this Employment? Seeing all Christians have already taken Parties, and those who are not Christians understand not our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes. Add to this, that tho Men would be decided by the ordinary Judges of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church,</hi> there would still a Party of Male-Contents remain. If the Pope was chosen, <hi>France</hi> would appeal to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council; if a Council was assembled <hi>Italy</hi> would not accept on't until it had been confirmed by the Pope; and this Bishop would only do it upon condition that this Ecumenick Council would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it self beneath him; which is contrary to the pretensions of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The impossibility of this Design is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident proof, according to our Author, that God will not have his Church to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after the manner of the Kingdoms of the Earth, where one is obliged to submit without knowing for what; because there is but the Body and some transitory Goods in question. But the Kingdom of God extending it self over the Soul and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, Men must be instructed, convinced and persuaded. Men must read, pray, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and live Christianly, to obtain the Grace of distinguishing Truth from Falshood. In vain would Scripture teach us these Truths, and exhort us to these practices, if there were an infallible Judge. All this would be useless, neither is it of great me amongst those who believe they have one.</p>
                     <p>All the World knoweth the ridiculous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications the <hi>Roman Doctors</hi> gave to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, before Protestants had put it into the hands of the People; and no body is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the many Truths which have been discovered, since it hath been believed that every one should instruct himself in the Will of God by his Word. It is true, that there have arisen Disputes, which are the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable consequences of Examination. But if Christians applyed themselves only to Scripture, and that instead of deciding of their Differences, when Scripture is not clear thereupon, they supported each other with a mutual Charity, we should soon see them become both more wholsome in their Opinions, and more reformed in their Manners. It is a consequence very clear and very easie to comprehend; but such as apparently will never be justified by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. The last writing of <hi>Bom</hi> is a small Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, to prove that St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished <hi>Head of the Catholick Church,</hi> where this Priest relates the common Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Controvertists; <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>&amp;c. Feed my Sheep, &amp;c.</hi> The Answer of <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi> is not complete: but that which there is on't appears more than sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute all the Objections of the Missionaries. The first Reason would be even enough; which is, that although his Adversary had clearly proved his <hi>Thesis,</hi> he would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for all that, if he did not shew that the promises made to St. <hi>Peter</hi> regard also his Successors, whereas most of the Fathers have taken them for personal Priviledges, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book of <hi>Chastity,</hi> c. 21. who speaks thus to Pope <hi>Zephirin: If be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord hath said to</hi> Peter, <hi>Vpon this Rock I will build my Church; I will give thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and all that thou shalt bind or unbind upon Earth, shall be bound or unbound in Heaven: If I say for that cause, you imagine that the power of unbinding or binding is passed unto you, to wit, to all the Churches found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by</hi> Peter, <hi>Who are you that overturn and change the clear intention of the Lord, who hath conferred this</hi> personally <hi>on</hi> Peter? <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> thee, <hi>saith he, I will build my Church, and I will give</hi> thee <hi>the Keys, and</hi> not to the Church; <hi>and all that</hi> thou <hi>shalt unbind, and not that</hi> they <hi>shall unbind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. After having shewed that these Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges are not personal, it should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that they regard only the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> excluding those of <hi>Antioch.</hi> 3. That they regard them all without exception, and without condition; to wit, That all and every one of the Popes are infallible,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103507:66"/>
as well in Fact as Right, against the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and the Sentiment of most of the Doctors of the <hi>Roman Communion.</hi> 4. It should be defined what the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is, and shewed by formal passages, that these Terms denominate the Body of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, which is called the <hi>Representative Church</hi>; which is impossible: Whereas, it is very easy to shew, that the <hi>Church</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in Scripture only the People in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Pastours. And in this sense, there is nothing more absurd than all that is said of the Power of the Church and it's Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, seeing it is but the Body of the Pope's Subjects and <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, and that Subjects who are far from making Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, must submit and obey their Lot.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. After all this, it should be still proved, that the Priviledges given to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> his Successors, import not simply a Primacy of Order, and some Authority in things, which regard the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Government of the Church, which Protestants could grant, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a prejudice to their Cause; but they do moreover mark a Primacy of Jurisdiction, of Sovereignty, and Infallibility in matters of Faith; which is impossible to be proved by Scripture, and all the Monuments we have of Antiquity; and which is even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory; seeing the belief of a Fact, or Truth, is persuaded, and forceth not it self. Have not <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> much Grace to accuse <hi>Protestants</hi> of Obstinacy, because they refuse to embrace a Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, which supposeth so many dubious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, whereof most are contested even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Divines of <hi>Rome</hi>; and to ask them to obey the Church, without distinctly telling them what this Church is, or in what consists the Submission which is required of them, or how far it ought to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                     <p>THE difficulty which there is of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into <hi>Iapan,</hi> is the reason that we can learn nothing beyond what the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have Written thereof in their Relations. They are alone permitted to go and Traffick in these <hi>Isles,</hi> which the <hi>Portuguese</hi> discover'd in 1542; since a poor Cook of a Ship, which parted from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam</hi> for the <hi>Indies,</hi> being come to the Charge of President of the Comptoir of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> put into his head to exclude the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese</hi> from this Commerce; for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, to this end, such black Calumnies against them, and all the <hi>Christians</hi> of this Country in general, that the Emperor of <hi>Iapan</hi> resolved to Banish the first, and to Extirpate the others; whose number, which augmented every day in this Empire, was come to more than 400000. It's what Mr. <hi>Tavernier</hi> describes in the First of the Five Parts, which compose this Volume.</p>
                     <p>The Second is but a Relation of what passed in the Negotiation of the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who have been in <hi>Persia</hi> and in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as well from the King as the <hi>French</hi> Company, for the establishing of Commerce.</p>
                     <p>In the Third, which contains the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations of this <hi>Author</hi> upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and upon the Frauds which may be committed therein, there are three or four singular things. The First he assures us he had learned of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral old People in the Kingdom of <hi>Bengall,</hi> that Sugar kept 30 years becomes Poison, and that there are few sorts more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. All the World assuredly will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree upon it. The 2. is the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Inhabitants of <hi>Kasaubasar</hi> use to whiten their Silk, which is yellowish, by the means of a <hi>Lye</hi> made of the Ashes of a Tree, called, <hi>The Fig-tree of Adams,</hi> which renders it as White as the Silk of <hi>Palestine:</hi> and the 3d is the manner wherewith <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> is prepared; but that's too common to be further noted.</p>
                     <p>He pretends that the Relations which have been given to us hitherto of the <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> are not very exact. He corrects them in his Fourth Part, which is a Relation of this Countrey; in which he remarks, amongst other singular and curious things, two sorts of Dainties amongst the <hi>Tunquinois,</hi> which are far from ours. The first is that of the <hi>Batt,</hi> which in <hi>Tunquin</hi> are neither smaller nor less delicate than our <hi>Pullets</hi>; and the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103507:67"/>
second is of the Nests of certain Birds which are of the bigness of our <hi>Swallows,</hi> which being a kind of <hi>Gum,</hi> melteth in luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm-Water; and is made use of in all the Dainties and Sawces which are made for Flesh and Fish; and communicates to the Flesh, which is seasoned thereby, such a good Tast, that these Nests seem to be composed of all the Aromaticks which are found in the East.</p>
                     <p>The manner whereby the <hi>Tunquinois</hi> do preserve Eggs, two or three years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, deserves to be observed. They throw Salt into the water, and as soon as the Pickle is done (which is known when the Egg swims on the top of the Water) they throw Ashes into this Pickle, until it is made as it were a kind of Paste. Then they inclose each Egg in a great Leaf of an herb, which resembles the Leaves of our <hi>Beet.</hi> They put them afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great Pots of Earth, which they cover well, and thus they Preserve them for two or three years.</p>
                     <p>As the other Relations speak of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Air, of Government, Religion, and several other things of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> it would be useless to speak of them here.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the latter part of this Work is the History of the Conduct of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> in <hi>Asia.</hi> Those who would know the particulars will take the pains to read it in this Original; and we shall be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to speak here of some Remarks which Mr. <hi>Tavernier</hi> makes therein by the by; as that of the ordinary <hi>Muscade Nut,</hi> which being preserved, inebriates more than Wine, though one should eat but one, whether at the beginning, middle, or end of ones Meal. He saith that the quantity of <hi>Elephants</hi> Teeth which are found along the Coast of <hi>Mozambique,</hi> is so great, that they make Palisadoes thereof about Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, so that they may be said to have a Cloister of Ivory. In fine, the last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is, that of a pleasant, but filthy Counterpoison. In the Isle of <hi>Iava</hi> the Soldiers have accustomed to Poyson their Darts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with a Poison so strong, that all those who are struck therewith dye sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly. The only remedy which prevents it is, that every one having dryed some of his own Excrements, and having reduced them into Powder, puts a few thereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Glass of Water, and presently swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it as soon as he feels himself wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By this means they feel no ill effect of the Poyson. If this Remedy is as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign as they say, this Secrecy deserves well to be known.</p>

                        <hi>DISSERTATIONS</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> at <hi>Rotterdam, 1688.</hi> in Quarto.</head>
                     <p>THE Posthume Works of Great men are like Children half formed, who cause more shame than honour to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. As Superstition hath Consecrated the Hairs and Bones of Saints; the respect and love Men have for the Learned, brings them to let Posterity participate of their most imperfect Essays. It is true, that there were in the Closet of <hi>Salmatius</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises <hi>upon the Warfare of the Romans,</hi> and <hi>upon Plants,</hi> which deserved a better lot than what they have hitherto met withal. But on the other side, Men do Print some <hi>Scaligerana</hi> and <hi>Petroniana,</hi> which should for ever had remained in the Closet of those who had them. Howbeit, here are the Dissertations of Mr. <hi>Burman</hi> Professor in Divinity in the Academy of <hi>Vtrect,</hi> where he died some years ago. He became fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous chiefly in binding his Divinity with the Philosophy of <hi>Descartes,</hi> and in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a kind of Medium between the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hypotheses of the Divines of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Opinions of <hi>Cameron.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Four first Dissertations are to prove Providence. The Pagans who were so wise as to acknowledge a God, had much ado to believe that this same God presided over all the events. Some have denyed it openly; and as if they were afraid to trouble the Repose of this Infinite Being, or to oppress him under too great a number of Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they have excused him from taking knowledge of what was done on Earth. <hi>If there are Gods who govern the World, whence do evils come,</hi> said <hi>Epicurus?</hi> It was also believed that all events depended upon a certain Chain of Second-causes, which drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the very Gods after them. In fine, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath been substituted in the room of Providence. The <hi>Romans,</hi> naturally haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, never received any disgrace from For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, without taking their Revenge on her by a great number of abuses. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> reproacheth them, that they had made an Altar to this Goddess in a place which was the receptacle of all the filths of <hi>Rome. Will ye take vengeance on your Gods,</hi> saith he unto them? <hi>Or do you believe that the ill smell annoyeth them not, as the good ones can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rejoyce them? otherwise they could not suffer the odour of the grease which is burned in Sacrifices, nor the smoke of Frankincense, which blindeth and blackeneth them.</hi> This Temple, whereof <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> speaks, is undoubtedly the same which <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> speaks of for the detested Fortune. This Fortune was every moment, called blind, perfidious, unconstant: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing these very <hi>Romans</hi> did put it in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103507:68"/>
of Providence, rendred unto it Divine Honours, and had dedicated several Temples in their City. There was one of these God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses which was called <hi>Primogenita,</hi> because she was considered as the Principle of all things, and the source of all Goodness. There was another, which was represented with Paps, to mark her abundance. In fine, there was one to whom young folks render'd Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, when they began to have a Beard: The <hi>Platonicks</hi> were the wisest of all <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>; for, by walking in the steps of their Master, who was the first Inventer of the Term <hi>Providence</hi> amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they acknowledged that there was a God who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided over second Causes. The <hi>Iews</hi> jealous of the Glory of their Nation, have preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Cares of God had a respect to them only, whilst they abandoned all other People of the World to the Course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the Influences of the Stars, or to the Malice of Devils. The wisest of the Rabbins believe, that most Animals de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve not the looks of Divinity. But that which is more astonishing, is, that St. <hi>Ierome</hi> was found to be of the same opinion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning a great number of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> and <hi>Divines,</hi> who, to extend the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Man, maintain, That God cannot foresee all events. The necessity of a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is proved, which extends its self ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally over all Creatures, because God ought to have an Infinite Knowledge: But his Knowledge would be necessarily limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if he did not see to the very smallest actions of Creatures; or if he saw them but after a speculative manner, as People speak, to wit, without having any influence upon them. Moreover, if all the actions of Creatures depended not absolutely upon God, there would be certain Moments wherein Nature would be independant, it would subsist of it self, seeing it would act by it self, and consequently it would be God, whose greatest Perfection is to be Independant, and to subsist of himself.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Author</hi> afterwards Treats of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Justification, whereof he distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth three kinds: the one which would be solely done by Works, if the first Man had persevered in his Innocency: the other which we obtain by Faith in <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> and the third whereof St. <hi>Iames</hi> speaks, which is done partly through Faith, and partly by Works. The first is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaking a Justification: for this term supposeth a Crime and guilty Men. There was then no enmity betwixt God and Man, no demand from injured Justice. So there was no need of Repentance. In the second may be remarked three actions of God. For,
<list>
                           <item>I. He hath imputed our sins to his Son.</item>
                           <item>II. He imputes to us the obedience of his Son, and keeps an Account for us of the Price which he hath pay'd for us in Suffering on the Cross.</item>
                           <item>III. In fine, by vertue of this obedience which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> has rendered, he forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us our sins, he receiveth us into his Grace, and destines the possession of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for us.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whence it's easie to conclude, that this Second Justification is purely Gratuitous. The Principal difficulty runs on the Second Action of God. <hi>For,</hi> say they, <hi>How can God justifie us by the Iustice of his Son? Can one be White with the Whiteness of another? And would it not be a ridiculous thing to say, That a General of an Army is brave, by the bravery of</hi> Alexander? But, these Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are not proper for the matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. For it is true, that a Body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be White by the Whiteness which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther possesseth: but nothing hinders but that a Man may be acquitted from a Debt which he had contracted, though it be not he, but a generous Friend who hath pay'd it. Man had contracted unmeasurable Debts with the Justice of God; <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath payed this Debt by his Death, and God keeps us an Account of his Satisfaction: There is nothing herein which implyeth contradiction. It was all the Consolation which was given to dying People in the time of <hi>Anselmus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to make them solely to rely on the Justice of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> as it appears by the Form of Consolation which he had made for Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours. And the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth found nothing finer than these words of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> which he often repeated. <hi>I cannot enter into Heaven by my deserts: but I hope that</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>who hath a double right to this happiness, will be satisfied with one; and that suffering me to enjoy the other, which is the Merit of his Passion, he will procure unto me the enjoymen thereof. This is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all my hopes. For it is a perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to put our confidence in our Merits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here the <hi>Socinians</hi> are engaged, who say, <hi>That God having foreseen that Man could not absolutely be exempt from Sin, had resolved to supply the defect of his Iustice, provided that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having consecrated his heart vnto him, he endeavoured to execute his Commandments, and to live conformably to his Will.</hi> This is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the opinion of the Ancient <hi>Iews,</hi> who denyed not, That the Mercy of God inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in the Work of Salvation; but, who maintained at the same time, that the Acts of their Repentance joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Sacrifices which the Law had commanded, were the causes of their Justification, whereas Scripture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it to us purely Gratuitous. St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures, <hi>That Man is justified by Faith without Works:</hi> whereas these Doctors make this Grace to depend of <hi>Works</hi> rather than of <hi>Faith.</hi> Moreover, How can God impute to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103507:68"/>
Men the Charity of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to supply the defect of their Justice, if <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in obeying perfectly the Law, and in dying upon the Cross, had not had a Design to satisfie for us?</p>
                     <p>The Third Justification is by <hi>Works.</hi> For the better comprehending thereof, we must observe, that Man can be accused of two things before the Tribunal of God, either to be guilty, or to be a hypocrite; God dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us from the first of these Accusations, in imputing to us the Merit of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which abolisheth all our sins. He discharges us from the second, by giving us, by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the force of producing good Works, which are marks of the sincerity of our Faith. It's in this sense, that it is said, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by the Sacrifice of his Son: God himself thus expounding this passage, when he saith, <hi>Now I see that thou lovest me.</hi> And it is the same Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ought to be given to this famous passage of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> who teacheth, <hi>That we are justified by Works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We shall not speak of the Disputes, which are the Third Part of this First <hi>Tome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are very short <hi>Analyses</hi> upon <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Hosea,</hi> and some other Prophets. The sense thereof is expounded after a very clear manner, and all along there are some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks mixed, as when <hi>Hosea</hi> saith, <hi>That the People shall weep upon</hi> Bethaven; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks very justly, That the pride of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Conquerors stopped not at triumphing over Cities, or over People they had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, but insulted over the very Gods whom the People adored: and that thus this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet threatneth the People of <hi>Israel, That the King of</hi> Assyria <hi>will lead their Calves in Triumph to</hi> Babylon.</p>
                     <p>There are at the head of the Second Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume Nine Dissertations upon the Synagogues of the ancient <hi>Iews.</hi> The Origine thereof is not very ancient. Those who believed that <hi>Moses</hi> had had a precaution, which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law-givers had past over, of making his Law to be Read every Saturday, that it might never be forgotten, have been mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. It was at the Return from the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of <hi>Babylon</hi> that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did a thing whereof there was no example. For he Read the <hi>Law</hi> to the People without the Temple, in a Publick place. Since that time it was thought that the Service of God was no longer tyed to the Church of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> but that it could be done elsewhere; and each City took care to build them Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, sometime without the City, and sometimes without the Circumference of the Walls. This opinion which our <hi>Author</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves to be truest, may be oppos'd by a great number of Objections. I do not stand at this passage of the History of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where it is said, <hi>That the</hi> Jews <hi>had Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues according to an Ancient Custom,</hi> for 500 years, or thereabouts, sufficeth to give this Name. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> calls the words of the Ancients <hi>a Tradition,</hi> which was much more new in the Jewish Church: and in the number of the Ancients or Fathers is put St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who lived in the 12th Age. But <hi>Asaph</hi> in one of his <hi>Psalms,</hi> saith, <hi>That all the Synagogues of the living God will be burnt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Brochard</hi> was mistaken, when he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that this <hi>Asaph</hi> lived since the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of <hi>Babylon</hi>; for then he must needs have acknowledged that there were <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> since <hi>Malachy.</hi> And it is not only a constant Tradition, but <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who ought not to be suspected in the things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Glory of his Nation, assures us there were none. It is said, that this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction concerns the Church under the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> But this Oracle was not accomplished in the Ten Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the <hi>Christian Church</hi> suffered. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oclesian</hi> caused a Monument to be raised, by which he boasts to have destroyed the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion.</hi> Yet then were numerous Churches seen amongst the <hi>Gauls</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> which were governed by <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> And if the Church afterwards hath been as it were interred, it was rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the number of Vices and Errors, than the violence of Persecution. Therefore there is much more likelihood that this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle concerned the time of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> wherein the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned, and the Service of God in some wise abolished. Therefore there were Synagogues in <hi>David</hi>'s time. For how should he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a name to express a thing which he knew not, and which was not in use? Moreover, how could the <hi>Iews</hi> pass so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages without making any publick exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their Religion, since the Event hath shewn that it was a lawful thing.</p>
                     <p>The name of Synagogues became soon excessive. They built 460. in the very City of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Each Trade had its Chappel or Synagogue. Strangers also had a great many. The <hi>Thalmud</hi> speaks of that which those of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had built at their expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and that of the <hi>Libertines</hi> is famous in the History of the <hi>Acts.</hi> Each Synagogue had its Judges, who had a right to cause those to be Scourged who were accused be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, as the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> made a sad Experience on't. It had also its <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi> and <hi>Apostles.</hi> Yet Cardinal <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was mistaken, when he thought that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> had borrowed from the <hi>Iews</hi> the name of <hi>Apostles,</hi> which he gave his Disciples. For it is easie to prove that this term is not in use with the <hi>Iews</hi> but since the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Gospel. I know not if Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> hath much more reason than <hi>Baronius,</hi> when he thinks, that by the Angels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, when he would have Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be vailed in the Temple, because of the presence of Angels, the Ministers are to be understood, who bear this Name in the Old Testament.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:103507:69"/>The Service began with Prayers, to which the People answered, <hi>Amen.</hi> Yet there is a Tradition which says, That this was not done in the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; but that at the end of the Prayers the People an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>Blessed be the God of Glory, His Kingdom reigneth for ever.</hi> In the Great Churches, where the Voice of the Priest was not easily heard, he took a Pocket-Handkerchief, and shew'd it to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when it was time to raise their Voice. This custom of answering <hi>Amen,</hi> at the end of Publick Prayers, hath passed in the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> until at length the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the People hath obliged the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Deacon in their place. But what is most remarkable, is, that in the <hi>Prayers,</hi> which were said with a low voice in the Temple, or in a Closet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were obliged to say <hi>Amen</hi> with a loud voice. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi> in speaking of the Martyrdom of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp,</hi> insinuates it; and the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferances</hi> of <hi>Pionius</hi> suffer us not to doubt thereof. The <hi>Christian Church</hi> hath also borrowed from the <hi>Iewish</hi> the manner of ordaining Bishops. For one could not be a Doctor of the Law but after having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> in the presence of three Priests. And the Councils have ordered the same thing for Bishops.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Law</hi> was Read in <hi>Hebrew.</hi> But since the Captivity, that the knowledge of this Tongue was lost, there was an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who Expounded each Verse in the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Tongue, that all the People might understand it. They pretend, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect for the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi> had passed unto the <hi>Hellenist Iews.</hi> Our <hi>Author</hi> inclines much on that side. But it agrees not with the Veneration which they had for the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the 70. If the <hi>Iews</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it, the rest of 'em had Instituted a Feast-day, to give God Thanks for that he had given it to them.</p>
                     <p>The Seventh Dissertation Treats of the Doctors of the <hi>Iewish Church.</hi> The Title of <hi>Rabbin</hi> is not before <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> at least if we believe the <hi>Iews,</hi> who say that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel,</hi> the same Doctor whereof the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> speaks, was the first who took it. But how could it be so common in the time of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> if it were not more ancient? According as Knowledge and Vertue diminished, this defect hath been endeavoured to be supplyed by proud Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, which should draw the Veneration of the People. There have been none who have taken finer Names than the <hi>Scholasticks,</hi> whose knowledge was pure Barbarity; and the Monks, whose mind hath been almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways filled with Visions, and an Imaginary Devotion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Scribes</hi> are ancient enough, for they appear'd in the time of <hi>Esdras</hi> in a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished Rank, seeing they are raised above the Priests. Their Original is at this day the Subject of a great Contestation. For they pretend, that <hi>Moses,</hi> who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in all the Wisdom of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> established Scribes at the same time that he did the <hi>Law</hi>; and that we owe unto them the Body of the Holy Scripture. But as they were never mention'd before <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There were three sorts of persons who bore this name.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The <hi>Publick Notaries,</hi> and the <hi>Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of the <hi>Counsel.</hi> These first were the least considerable.</item>
                        <item>2. Those who were called <hi>Scribes</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> to wit, who had the right of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding unto the People. They were thought to sit in the Chair of <hi>Moses,</hi> as well as the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> They were consulted with in Important Controversies: and it's what <hi>Herod</hi> did upon the arrival of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi> Finally, their Decisions were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the same Veneration as the Law of God: the <hi>Iews</hi> saying, <hi>That even the Traditions of the Scribes are better than the Law.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. In fine, the Title of Scribe is the name of a Magistracy with the <hi>Iews,</hi> as well as with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and it was the latter who were called the <hi>Scribes</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>From the Ministers of the Synagogue we shall pass to those of the <hi>Christian Church. Iesus Christ</hi> had Clothed his Apostles with so great Priviledges, that they could not have Successors in their Charges. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Protestant Divines,</hi> who pretend that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is of <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> maintain, at the same time, That Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was not an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives him the Title of an Apostle. They say, <hi>That this first Bishop of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>had a right of entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the most</hi> Holy Place, <hi>and to carry a Golden Reed, as the</hi> High Priest <hi>of the</hi> Jews. But it is certain at least, that St. <hi>Epiphanes</hi> mistook, when he relyes upon the Authority of <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> to prove it. For <hi>Eusebius</hi> never said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such thing, speaking of St. <hi>Iames</hi>; and there is a great likelyhood that this is one of these false Traditions, which cannot be applyed to any of the Apostles.</p>
                     <p>Besides the Apostles, there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were Prophets in the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> whose Charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted chiefly to edifie the <hi>Church</hi> by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the most difficult passages of Scripture. They penetrated sometimes into the time to come, and foretold its events. <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> assures us, that this Gift of Prophecy continued also to his time. But it was soon extinguished. For when <hi>Montan</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:103507:69"/>
begun to publish his Revelations, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Phrygia</hi> were moved thereat: and these motions of wonder and admiration are formed commonly on unheard of events, or which are extreamly rare. The <hi>Author</hi> affirms this Maxim: <hi>That Prophecies are not well understood until after their accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Opinions have been always much divided about the duration of the Ministery of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who is the Head of the Church. St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> refuting the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> is fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great Excess. For he believed that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> lived almost 50 years. The most common opinion is, that he Preached the space of 3 or three years and a half. Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> takes another Party, and maintains, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> Celebrated but two Feasts of the Passover: whence he concludes, <hi>That he could live but a year and a half after his Baptism.</hi> The last Passover, wherein <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> Instituted the Sacrament of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> makes another subject of Contesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Greeks,</hi> who think they have a great Interest to maintain, That <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> Communicated with Leavened Bread, pretend, That he Celebrated his last Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sover after the Wednesday at night. This opinion, which is established by them but since the Dispute they had with the <hi>Roman Church</hi> upon the Azymes, deserves not much examination.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath not been ashamed to retract and to refute himself upon this matter. For after having inclined to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he maintains at last, <hi>That there is reason to believe, that</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>eat the Lamb of the Passover a day before the greatest part of the other</hi> Jews, <hi>who begun to Celebrate the Feast but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on Friday at Night.</hi> Our <hi>Author</hi> believes on the contrary, <hi>That all the</hi> Jews <hi>were forced to Celebrate the Feast the same day, because it was necessary to kill all the Lambs in the Porch of the Temple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The almost infinite number of these beasts which were to be killed, and which, if <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi> may be believed, amounted to Five Millions five thousand six hundred, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth him not. He believeth, that the great number of Priests who assisted at this Service, was sufficient for this great Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Not mentioning that each private Man had a right to kill his Lamb, provided it was in the Porch of the Temple, which was so big, that in the time of <hi>Solomon</hi> there entred into it 22000 Oxen, 12000 Sheep, besides the other Sacrifices which the People offered. Yet there remains a great difficulty. For the Lambs were not begun to be presented but at the Ninth Hour, to wit, at three in the Afternoon; and <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> assureth us, that this Ceremony end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about Nine of the Clock. So, though the Temple should be spatious enough to contain the number of Lambs, the time would not be long enough to kill them.</p>
                     <p>The last Disputes concern the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist.</hi> But as this matter hath been treated on very often, we will make an end here.</p>

                     <head>Some <hi>LETTERS</hi>; Containing an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what was most remarkable in a Voyage into <hi>Swisserland, Italy,</hi> and a part of <hi>Germany,</hi> in the years 1685 and 1686. Written by Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to <hi>M.B.</hi> The Second Edition Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Author. With Additions concerning <hi>Swisserland, Italy,</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by a Person of Quality. At <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> Sold by <hi>Acher, 1687.</hi> in Octavo. <hi>p. 336.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THIS Book contains Five Letters, and is both in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> as well as <hi>English.</hi> There have been lately added some Remarks Written in <hi>French</hi> by a Person of Quality originally of <hi>Italy,</hi> and who hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there a long while. These Remarks are but Fifteen Pages, and respect only some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities touching the Country of the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, Grisons,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> the City of <hi>Bologne,</hi> and the Government of the <hi>Pope.</hi> We see thereby, as well as by the Letters of Bishop <hi>Burnet,</hi> that the greatest part of <hi>Italy,</hi> and particularly that which belongs to the Pope, is altogether deserted and ruined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the too absolute Government which is there every where exercised; and of the Maxim of those People, to lay always the greatest Taxes that can be. Princes in this Country seem to envy their Posterity the enjoyment of their Estates, they take such care to ruine them without remorse; and this evil is but too common elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>But Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> observes in all this Voyage the same rules which he hath proposed to himself in his History. He praiseth and blameth, according as natural equity seems to require it, without having respect to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in which those he speaks of are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. So he praiseth the fine qualities of Cardinal <hi>Howard</hi> in his Fourth Letter, and remarks what may be reprehended in the conduct of the Divines of <hi>Swisserland</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> in regard to a Form which those who are received Ministers are obliged to Sign in that Country. As he who hath made the Extract of the Voyage of Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> which is in the <hi>French</hi> Republick of Letters, hath not spoken of this place, it shall be altogether inserted here. It is in the First Letter dated from <hi>Zurich,</hi> the 1<hi>st</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1685.</p>
                     <p>As the Medium which <hi>Amyraut</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ille</hi> have taken in the Controversies agitated in <hi>Holland,</hi> touching the Decrees of God, and the Extent of the Death of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> had been almost universally embraced in <hi>France,</hi> this same opinion hath found some defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and in <hi>Swisserland.</hi> These Gentlemen maintain <hi>the Universality of the death of</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>and the sufficiency of Grace</hi> (objective) <hi>given to all Men</hi>; affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwise, that God hath freely cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen a certain number of Persons, to whom alone he gives a Grace (subjective) efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. They are called <hi>Universalists</hi>; and their number had begun to be considerable at <hi>Geneva,</hi> because two Professors in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity openly favoured this Opinion. Those who incline to the contrary Sentiment, were extreamly moved at it, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute grew so warm, that almost the whole City entred either into one or other of the Parties. If the Magistrate had imposed si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on both, he had certainly done very well: for the Question was of Speculations so uncertain, and so little Essential to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that the diversity of Sentiments ought not to cause any Quarrel or Faction. But though the Party of the <hi>Universalists</hi> was pretty considerable at <hi>Geneva,</hi> it was extreamly weak in <hi>Switzerland.</hi> Therefore some Divines of that Country upheld the received Opinion, and made <hi>Articles,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they, in the first place, condemned the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the <hi>Universalists,</hi> and some Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Sentiments touching <hi>the Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Adam,</hi> and the qualities he had, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those Divines, in the state of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. Moreover, <hi>Cappel</hi> and other Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks having maintained not only the novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Points of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but also taken the liberty of correcting the Text in some places, upon supposition that there were errors of the Copists in the Bible, both as to Vowels and Consonants: to oppose these Sentiments, all the Corrections were condemned which might be made in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, and the Antiquity of the Points was asserted, <hi>at least as to the force,</hi> or manner wherein they have determined the Reading. If hereby all Divines are not engaged to be of the Sentiment of <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> as to what regards the Antiquity of Points, the Correcting of any thing whatever is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in the punctuation of these times: If this <hi>Consent of Doctrine,</hi> for so this Form is named, had been established as a Rule, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which it was not lawful to Teach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, without incurring some censure, severity would have been more sufferable. But all those are obliged who aspire to the Ministery, or to a Chair of Professor, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, <hi>Sic sentio,</hi> I am of this opinion. This Form being established at <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Zurich,</hi> the Authority of the Divines who had made it caused its being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So they were not satisfied to make a regulation touching these matters, but by a Maxim, which hath been so often fatal to the Church, they undertook to become Masters of the Conscience of the People, and to put the young Folks from their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, or to impose an Oath upon them, that all, perhaps, have not signed without remorse of Conscience.

The <hi>Romans</hi> were so charmed with him, that they sent to the Emperor, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that he would oblige him to live in the midst of them, but they obtained not this advantage. <hi>Themistius</hi> chose rather to return to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he passed the greatest part of his life. He was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Six Emperors. <hi>Constantius</hi> confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the dignity of Praetor upon him, and honoured him with a Brazen Statue. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> had so great a deference for him, that in consideration of him he moderated the false zeal which led him to persecute the Orthodox. It is assuredly one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est marks of esteem which can be given to a Man; for as soon as a Prince hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to extirpate a Religion, all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards the progress of this design is uneasie to him, and incommodes him extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; they are very powerful Reasons only which can work an alteration of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Yet the Discourse of <hi>Themistius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this great effect upon an Emperor animated to the ruin of the Orthodox, by the Counsel of some <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops, and by the Intreagues of the Empress. This Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher represented to <hi>Valence, That he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, without cause, Men of worth; that it was not a crime to believe and to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than he did; that he should not wonder at this diversity of Opinions; that the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles <hi>were much more divided amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves than</hi> Christians; <hi>that every one pointed at truth by some place; and that it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to confound the pride of Men, and to render himself more venerable by the difficulty which there is of knowing him.</hi> It is pity that such fine thoughts have been said by a Pagan, and that it should be necessary that Christians should learn this Important Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Idolatrous Man. Yet they ought to profit thereby. But Mr. <hi>Flecher,</hi> who hath so carefully related this Discourse of <hi>Themistius,</hi> to shame thereby the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of an <hi>Arian</hi> Emperor, tells us, that the Emperor <hi>Theodosius</hi> a little while after, also took upon him a command, which was as a fit subject for a second discourse of <hi>Themistius</hi>; But he was far from doing it, because of the charge of <hi>Prefect of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and of <hi>Tutor to the Son of Theodosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us the Great,</hi> which this Emperor gave him, lest he should cease his Applauses for all the <hi>Orders</hi> of the Court. It is very strange that a Prince who abolished vigorously the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of <hi>Paganism,</hi> and who gave even no very good quarters to the Sectaries of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> should trust the Education of his Son to a Heathen. Yet it's true, that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> hath done all this; for those who say, that <hi>Themistius</hi> was a <hi>Christian,</hi> and Chief of the Sect of the <hi>Agnoites,</hi> who believed, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> was absolutely ignorant of the end of the World; they confound him with another <hi>Themistius,</hi> a Deacon of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who was the head of this Sect under the Empire of <hi>Iustin,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the year 519. It signifies nothing to the proof of the pretended Christianity of <hi>Themistius,</hi> to say, that he hath cited this passage of Scripture, <hi>The heart of the King is in the hand of the Lord:</hi> This, I say, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing, because that besides his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting these words, as if he had taken them from the Books of the <hi>Assyrians</hi>; every one knoweth, that <hi>Longinus</hi> hath quoted <hi>Moses</hi> with Elogies on him, without being on that account, engaged e're the less in Paganism. <hi>Themistius</hi> must needs have been an honest Man, because he always had the Friendship of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianze.</hi>

                     <p>He had left 36 Harangues. <hi>Henry Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> is the first who hath published any of them. Father <hi>Petau</hi> being then at the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>la Fleche,</hi> made an Edition thereof. He added a second much better when he came to <hi>Paris,</hi> but it was yet very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, seeing there lacked Sixteen Orations. He sought so successfully that he found thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, whereof he Translated into Latin the considerablest part. He left them as a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum</hi> in the Colledge of <hi>Clermont</hi>'s Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theck; and these are they which appeared the first time in the Edition of <hi>Themistius,</hi> that Father <hi>Hardouin</hi> hath lately given us. He is a very learned <hi>Iesuit,</hi> who was brought to <hi>Paris</hi> to be imployed with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cautel</hi> to make the Supplement of <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata Theologica</hi> of Father <hi>Petau</hi>; but this design hath not succeeded; so that these two Jesuits have elsewhere endeavour'd, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Works, to make their Talent be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued. Father <hi>Cautel</hi> hath set his face ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

way. As for Father <hi>Hardouin,</hi> the Publick hath already known, that he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon a Commentary of <hi>Pliny, in usum Delphini,</hi> which will be, say they, a most complete piece, and which will be publish'd in a year. Moreover, he hath a design to publish all the Manuscripts of the <hi>Bibliotheque of Clermont,</hi> which have not been as yet printed; and he hath begun by the Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Themistius,</hi> at the intreaty of Father <hi>Garnier,</hi> who dyed an <hi>Bologne</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> the 26<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1681. during the Voyage he made to <hi>Rome,</hi> about the Affairs of his Society.</p>
                     <p>In this Edition have been inserted all the Notes of Father <hi>Petau</hi> upon twenty Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of <hi>Themistius,</hi> and many things are very Learned therein. There is in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, a gross Error of <hi>Appian,</hi> who saith in the First Book of the Civil War, <hi>That the</hi> Romans <hi>have had Kings during</hi> 100 <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piads, and Consuls</hi> 100 <hi>Olympiads; also where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is certain, that</hi> Tarquin <hi>was banished</hi> Rome <hi>in the Year</hi> 244, <hi>after the Foundation of the City</hi> 156 <hi>years, before it had lasted a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Olympiads.</hi> Besides that, <hi>Appian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himself visibly, seeing he places the Dictatorship of <hi>Sylla,</hi> but in the 175 Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad. Father <hi>Petau</hi> also pretends, That <hi>Scaliger</hi> was mistaken when he said, That the lesser Mysteries were celebrated at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> but every three Years. This Jesuite maintains against him that they were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated every year. But when he afterwards proveth by a very obscure passage of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> that they were celebrated every first Year of each Olympiad, he seems to give himself a needless trouble, seeing that if he hath proved well, that they were ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated every year, it followeth without any difficulty, that they were celebrated the first Year of all the Olympiads. It may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless be said for his Justification, that he makes use of the passage of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> but to shew the impossibility of the Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis of <hi>Scaliger.</hi> He corrects in this same place a passage of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> which seems to say, That the Mysteries were celebrated in the Market place, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>; to wit, to <hi>Agra,</hi> which was a place near the River <hi>Ilissus,</hi> where there was a Temple of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and whence <hi>Diana</hi> had apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken her name of <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. In fine, her Remarks that most Authors have unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably confounded the Mysteries, with the <hi>Thesmophoria,</hi> which were celebrated in the Honour of <hi>Ceres.</hi> He relates several Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences betwixt these two Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>One of the things upon which he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged so much, is the Bridge that <hi>Xerxes</hi> built to pass from <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Europe. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> hath given us the Description there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; Father <hi>Petau</hi> expounds it, and corrects in it a great many faults. We should be too tedious if we should descend into a more particular Relation. Let us be content with this Remark upon a passage of <hi>Cassiodorus,</hi> L. 9. Ep. 5. Where it's ordered to keep no more Corn than would be necessary to maintain each Family, <hi>Sive in gradu, sive in aliis locis condita potuerint invenire.</hi> These words have much tormented the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, Father <hi>Petau</hi> saith, that by <hi>in gradu,</hi> an Isle of the <hi>Adriatick Sea,</hi> must be understood, situate towards the place where <hi>Venice</hi> hath been built, and not the Bread which was distributed upon the Stairs at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us now say somewhat of the Work of Father <hi>Hardouin.</hi> He has plac'd the Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Themistius,</hi> in the order they ought to be in, according to the time wherein they were spoken; and to effect this, he hath made a Chronological Table, the exactest that he could. He hath filled the vacancies which were in this Author; and cut divers things which had been added, and spoiled the sense; he hath corrected the faults which had slipped thereinto; and finally, he hath cleared the places that are most difficult by his Learned Observations.</p>
                     <p>He observes that the <hi>Romans</hi> had Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons in their Colours; and as 'tis also certain, that they had Eagles in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, he teacheth us to discern these two things; it is, saith he, that the Eagles ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the entire Legion, and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons for a Cohort. He pretends, that <hi>Sethus Calvisius</hi> having placed the Death of <hi>Procopius</hi> in the Year 365. and changed the Name of <hi>Iovinus</hi> designed Consul for the Year ensuing, into that of <hi>Dagalaiphus,</hi> hath added a false Calculation in all the sequel of his Chronology. He makes several Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, and several Remarks upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the Emperour <hi>Theodosius,</hi> to whom he restores two Children that no body does more than mention, to wit, <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Pulcherius,</hi> tho' it is certain, that St. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>Nissa,</hi> and St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> have spoken thereof. He speaks to the purpose, upon the Chapter of Genealogies, for he hath better distinguished than Mr. <hi>Henry de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois</hi> had done the two young <hi>Valentinians,</hi> whereof the one was Son to the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> the first, and the other was the Son of <hi>Valens,</hi> and was named <hi>Galates,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was born in <hi>Galatia.</hi> It was for this that the ninth Oration of <hi>Themistius</hi> was made. Mr. <hi>de Valois</hi> seemed to believe when he published the first time his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian Marcelline,</hi> that these two <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were Brothers. He is reproached with it here: but as he corrected this fault in his Notes upon <hi>Socrates,</hi> after he had seen the <hi>Idatius</hi> of Father <hi>Sirmond,</hi> and that the same fault was also corrected in the new Edition in <hi>Folio</hi> of <hi>Amien,</hi> it will be taken ill that Father <hi>Hardouin</hi> thought upon such a Censure, and it will perhaps be said, that he fetcht the occasion a little too far.</p>
                     <p>One of his most curious Remarks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the passage which induced some to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103507:74"/>
believe, That <hi>Themistius</hi> made profession of Christianity, and which seems to be the same with that of <hi>Solomon, The heart of the King is in the band of the Lord.</hi> This Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher cites his fine Sentiment as taken out of the Books of the <hi>Assyrians.</hi> Father <hi>Petau</hi> believed by these <hi>Assyrian</hi> Books, the holy Scripture was to be understood, because <hi>Themistius</hi> sometimes gave the <hi>Christians</hi> the Title of <hi>Syrians,</hi> according to the custom of the Gentiles, who often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the <hi>Iews</hi> with <hi>Christians.</hi> Father <hi>Hardouin</hi> rejects this Opinion, and founds his own upon this, that <hi>Themistius</hi> could not borrow the passage in question, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Original of Scripture, nor from the Version of the 70. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, <hi>Leb melek Ve Iaed Iehovah,</hi> the Heart of the King in the hand of the Lord. The 70 have thus Translated it simply, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. But <hi>Themistius</hi> saith thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. He has this passage from another place, according to this <hi>Iesuite,</hi> and not from Holy Scripture. Some profane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor furnished him, as was that who taught him to say, That Men commonly sung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Lebanon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know not whether it was ever said, That <hi>Aesop</hi> must needs have read <hi>Solomon,</hi> seeing he cites a Sentence which is found word for word in Chap. 3. of Proverbs, <hi>God resists the Proud, but shews favour to the Humble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So it is, That the 70. have turned the passage of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and that the Apostle St. <hi>Iames</hi> hath cited it in his Epistle. There would not be much reason under pretence of this great conformity between the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of <hi>Aesop,</hi> and that of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to maintain that <hi>Aesop,</hi> had read the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Books; for whence could he draw the signification which the te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m hath in the Sentence of <hi>Aesop,</hi> which is a particular signification to the <hi>Greek Bible</hi> of the 70. It is better to say with <hi>Vavasseur</hi> the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite,</hi> That <hi>Plenuda</hi> is the Author of the Book which we call this day the <hi>Fables of Aesop.</hi> At least it is true, That some Christian is the Author of the Moral Sense, which hath been expressed in one of the <hi>Fables</hi> of <hi>Aesop,</hi> by the very Greek terms of the Scripture.</p>

                     <p>The Abridgment of the Perogatives of St. <hi>Ann,</hi> is one of these Works.

Henry Stephens</hi> that was no Divine, but knew that such a Deist as <hi>Postell</hi> was might be suspected that he had embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished this Work, and <hi>Casaubon</hi> attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole to him. However it is, this pretended Gospel of St. <hi>Iames</hi> with many others was condemned in a Council of 70 Bishops held at <hi>Rome,</hi> under Pope <hi>Gelasius.</hi> Nevertheless, the Writers of <hi>Legends</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and form new ones, as the Book of the Birth of <hi>Mary,</hi> of the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and the Gospel of St. <hi>Ann.</hi> The latter may be judged of according to this passage mentioned by <hi>Henry Stephens, when Iesus was so grown that he could work,</hi> Joseph <hi>employed him to Carpentry; and one day having commanded him to saw a piece of Wood, he did it without taking notice of the Mark that was to direct him, and so made the piece too short.</hi> Joseph <hi>was angry at this, and had a mind to beat him, and would have done it, if Iesus had not lengthened the stick, by making</hi> Joseph <hi>pull at one end, whilst he pull'd at the other.</hi> If the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of those absurd Relations were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to dishonour the Christian Religion, they could not find a better way; the Gospel of the fictitious St. <hi>Iames</hi> is full of such extravagant Histories; and one would think the Inventor had a mind by his Ironique Imitation, to ridicule several pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of Scripture, and several Miracles of the Old and New Testament, among others the History of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> that of <hi>Hanna</hi> and her Son <hi>Samuel,</hi> and that of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And nevertheless, it is upon these counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Books and scurrilous Relations, that the most part of the Devotions of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> are founded; the pretended St. <hi>Iames</hi> has consecrated a Feast to St. <hi>Ann,</hi> which is kept the 16<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and was ordained by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. 1584. Sometime after <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the 5<hi>th.</hi> founded or at least confirmed a Religious Order, called the <hi>Maidens</hi> of St. <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who made choice of St. <hi>Ann</hi> for their Patroness; they afterwards established them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in <hi>France,</hi> under the protection of <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> Regent of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>So that it was in our times, that the Grand-father and Grand-mother of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> were brought into remembrance; and I hope his great Grand-father and his Father will be soon deisy'd, especially if the principle lay'd by the <hi>Maidens</hi> of St. <hi>Ioseph</hi> in this work be followed; for if one must make his address to the Blessed Virgin, because <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refuse her any thing, and if we must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress our selves to <hi>Ann</hi> the Mother of <hi>Mary,</hi> to have the Daughters Favour, then we must go back to great Grand-mother, and so on to the rest.</p>

                     <p>IF it be useful in Civil Life to know them that give us advice, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret motives that make them act; such an examination cannot be of less advantage for our Spiritual conduct in the different ways shewn to Christians by the Doctors of divers Societies: if Prejudices and Obstinacy do not damn, at least it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd but they are very dangerous: but when Learned Divines, whose imagination is neither overheated with Dispute, nor with the Opinion of a particular Party, and does endeavour to call into doubts the most constant practices and publick cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms; there is reason to suspect, that they have imbib'd no less odious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples than Head-strongness and Prejudice.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Roman Church</hi> ever had Judicious and moderate Controvertists, they were the <hi>Iansenists,</hi> and <hi>M. de Meaux,</hi> and some <hi>English,</hi> that in these times have imitated the former; so that if there be want of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in the proceedings of these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, it is a strong presumption against the Defenders of <hi>Rome,</hi> and no weak proof, that its Doctrin cannot be maintained but by indirect courses.</p>
                     <p>These Reflections were necessary, to <hi>shew the usefulness of the Modern History of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, as well in</hi> France <hi>as in</hi> England, which Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> gives in his <hi>Preface</hi> of these <hi>Three Works,</hi> and whereof we design to give a more than ordinary exact Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, because there are remarkable circumstances known to very few.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. All the World knows now that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of all the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was resolved on even from the <hi>Pyrenean Peace</hi>; and there are some that believed it was one of the secret Conditions of that Peace: The difficulty was to put that Decree in execution without raising a Civil War, and without alarming the <hi>Protestant Princes.</hi> The Politicians took very just measures to weaken insensibly the Reformed of that Kingdom, and either lull asleep, or set at variance the Forreign Powers of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. There is none ignorant of the success; but it would have been more happy, if the Divines employed to maintain <hi>Rome</hi>'s Cause had sped as well as the Coyners of Propositions, and Inventers of Decrees.</p>
                     <p>And nevertheless it might be said, that the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Doctors were not in the fault that things did not go on better, and that it was not for want of incapacity that they persuaded no body. The first that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to give a new turn to Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, was M. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> whose very Name is praised enough. It is well known that this eminent Man, who was a Philosopher, a Mathematician, well read in the Fathers, and as well acquainted with Scripture; has had several remarkable victories over the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of his own Communion; yet with all his great qualities, all that he did in his <hi>perpetuity of the belief of the Roman Catholick Religion, touching the Lord's Supper,</hi> was to repeat over and over, that Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being now the common Doctrine of the Church, it follow'd, that there never was any other Belief, because it cannot be comprehended how all Christians should have agreed to change their Opinion, which had it happened, the certain time should be marked wherein the Universal Church had varied in this Point; and when and how each particular Church came to Corrupt the Antient Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>It is very strange, that after so many proofs of matter of Fact, which M. <hi>Aubertinus</hi> alledged out of the Belief of the Holy Fathers, that an Argument, purely Metaphysical, should make so much noise, and be so much applauded by the Roman Communion. It's almost a certain sign of the weakness of a Cause, to see the maintainers of it blinded with the least Sophism, and Triumph in their fancy, for the least appearance of Truth.</p>
                     <p>There wanted no great strength to ruin these imaginary Trophies. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants had no harder task than to shew, that this reason supposed no error could be brought into the World, nor embraced by a numerous Society. The beginning of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry is disputed upon, and nothing yet decided. Some will have it, that it began by the adoration of Stars, others from the deifying dead Men; and then, say they, Statues were erected for Kings, for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors of the People, for Law-makers, and for the Inventors of Sciences and Arts. And this to reduce People to the practice
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103507:75"/>
of Vertue; and, to do it the better, they spoke of their Ancestors, and proposed their Examples; their Actions were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in high Terms, and their Soul pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Heaven near the Divinity; they thought they would not be idle there, but that God would give them some considerable office there, because they had acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so well of the Employments they had upon Earth.</p>
                     <p>The common sort of People generally much taken with Figures and great Words, it may be, conceived a higher Idea of those excellent Persons, than their first Authors designed; and Priests observing that these Opinions made People more devout, and brought themselves Riches, made the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pass insensibly from a Respect to a Religious Veneration. And hence Idolatry was rais'd by little and little to its height; now must we infer from hence, that it is not a pernicious Error, and that it was from the beginning of the World; because the precise time cannot be marked in which People begun to adore the Stars; nor tell who the first Hero was, that had Divine Honors rendred to him? and yet the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be as concluding as Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s. Many Learned Men have Writ much of the Antient and Modern Idolatry, and have shewn its various progress. One can tell very near what time the <hi>Saturnalia</hi> were Instituted, and the Mysteries of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and <hi>Corpus Christi</hi>-Day; and that of St. <hi>Ann.</hi> And at what time the Temple of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was built, and the Church of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>; and when <hi>Hercules</hi> was Canonized, and <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Abisa</hi>; and <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius Loyola:</hi> all this is known: But the first beginning of an Error, is always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable, and can never be found out.</p>
                     <p>As for the Consent of Christians, which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> did alledge, he was shewn, that the Eastern Churches termed Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks by <hi>Rome,</hi> were not of her opinion touching the Lord's Supper, and that if they had any Idea of a Real Presence, it drew nearer the Consubstantiation of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> than the Transubstantiation of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is true, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> produces several Attestations of <hi>Graecian</hi> Priests, to shew, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were of the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion with <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi>; but it is likewise true, that he obtained the most part of them by Bribes. Mr. <hi>Wheeler</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us in his Voyages of <hi>Greece,</hi> that he spoke to many <hi>Pappas</hi> whom M. of <hi>Nointel,</hi> Nephew to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> had endeavoured to bribe for the same end. The <hi>Miscella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi> of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> may also be seen to this effect.</p>
                     <p>One might be satisfied with this Answer; yet the Superstitions of <hi>Rome</hi> being not so antient as those of <hi>Paganism,</hi> the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med have thought, that by a continual search, at last that Prodigious Opinion might be discover'd, which gave Birth to Transubstantiation. And they have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht it, for they have shewn, how the Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getick Expressions of the Fathers, touching Transubstantiation, occasioned in the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Ages an obscure Idea of an Union, or of an incomprehensible change; and they have marked the Authors of these two O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions differing thus about the Sense of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and Vertue: <hi>Iohn Damascenus</hi> in the year 728, began to Preach in the East the Union of the Bread and Body of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; and <hi>Paschase Ratbert</hi> was the first that published Transubstantiation, or the change of the Substance of one into the Substance of the other, in the Latin Church, in the year 818.</p>
                     <p>So that all that the Catholicks of <hi>France</hi> gained by Dispute, was, to see their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes worsted, by a Minister, who, though Eloquent and Witty enough, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless have yielded to M. <hi>Arnaud</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things.</p>
                     <p>This Tryal made the <hi>Romish Church</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that it ran the hazard of losing its repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with all honest People, if its Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets came once to be examined. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Advocates turned wranglers, and barricading themselves with formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, prescriptions; and the ends not answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they thereupon pretend that their Adversaries are condemnable without any necessity of examining into the bottom, who is in the right, and who is in the wrong. M. <hi>Nicole</hi> took upon himself to plead this part, and acquitted himself in <hi>his lawful Prejudices against the Calvinists,</hi> with as much cunning and Eloquence as could be expected from a Disciple or Friend of M. <hi>Arnaud.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By ill luck the <hi>Iansenists</hi> came to the worst, both in <hi>Rome</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> in the Famous Dispute of the Five Propositions; and were forced to say, <hi>That the Five Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Propositions</hi> were not in the <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin of Iansenius</hi>; whence it clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that neither the Pope nor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were Infallible in what they did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they might call People as Hereticks, that were not so at all, in imputing to them Opinions which they never held, nor were to be found in their Works. The <hi>Iansenists</hi> saw this consequence, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it openly, and did advance several Principles that destroyed the Authority of the Church, and its Infallibility.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French Protestants</hi> presently took notice of this contradiction of Doctrin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Author of the Prejudices and his Friends, or his Disciples, and did not fail to promote it. M. <hi>Pajon</hi> did it after, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with much Wit and Acuteness, that the Arguments of a prejudiced Author, are more valid in a <hi>Iew</hi>'s, a <hi>Pagan</hi>'s or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi>'s
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103507:76"/>
Mouth against <hi>Christianity,</hi> than they are, when used by a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> against the Reformed.</p>
                     <p>About the same time M. <hi>Claude</hi> Answered M. <hi>Nicole</hi> in a direct way, shewing that the excess of Corruption, which the Doctrin and Worship of the <hi>Romish Church</hi> was come to, made our Predecessors to examin Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion strictly, and consequently to separate from a Society that would force them to receive, under pain of Damnation, a Faith whose practices were altogether opposite to Scripture.</p>
                     <p>That was enough to make the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> repent that they gave that turn to their Controversies, and that being their last shelter, there was no hopes they would leave it; for they continued turning their Prejudices into so many meanings, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them as confidently as if they had never been refuted. And these pitiful eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions pleased the Assembly of the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> so well in 82. that they made Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Methods of Prescription, on which the conversion of the Reformed was to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for. And which is yet more, these Gentlemen thought them so convincing, that they intreated the King, that a Copy of them might be given to every Consistory; imagining perhaps, that some Ministers may happen to be there, who might be wrought upon by these Illusions, or frightned with the Threatnings of the <hi>Pastoral Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement.</hi> The Intendant, or some other of the King's Commissaries, went on a <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> accompanyed with some Clergy-men, deputed by the Bishop of the Diocess, and with Two Apostolick Notaries, to acquaint each Consistory with this Writing, and give several Copies amongst the People; making several Orations, to desire them from the King to enter into the Communion of the <hi>Roman Catholick Church</hi>; but all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. M. <hi>Pajon,</hi> Minister of <hi>Orleans,</hi> made presently some Remarks upon this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement and Methods, and addressed a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Clergy, wherein there are not so many Figures of Rhetorick, as in their Writing, but much more Sense and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> who has always gloried in assisting his Afflicted Brethren, seeing most of our Ministers out of a condition of defending themselves, gave himself the pains to examin the little Books of the Prelats of <hi>France.</hi> And at last Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> Answered them by way of Recrimination, <hi>in his Lawful Prejudices against Papism,</hi> which he proposes, to the number of Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen; which are so many, whereof the least plausible has more force than all those of the Clergy. We must add to these Books Two other of the same Author, wherein he Refutes two of the Indirect ways, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Controvertists use: the First is <hi>his Apology for the Morals of the Reformed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst M.</hi> Arnaud; and the Second, <hi>his true System of the Church against M.</hi> Nicole. All these Methods were in Vogue when the Book of <hi>M. de Meaux</hi> appeared. The turn he gave to the Controversies, did much more surprise the Protestants, than all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities which the Divines of <hi>France</hi> thought of. There was a Prelat of great reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tutor to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> that did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle himself in the Disputes of <hi>Grace,</hi> and that consequently was neither suspected by <hi>Iesuites</hi> nor by the <hi>Iansenists,</hi> nor by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor by the <hi>Gallican Church</hi>; he was seen, I say, to publish a Book well stocked with Approbations, wherein he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to moderate the most displeasing Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of his Sect, to put their grosser abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in Oblivion; and finally, to bury the most part of School Disputes.</p>
                     <p>It was hard to think, that a Man sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by all that is great in his Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof he seemed the Oracle, should Write to deceive his Fellow-Citizens; or that he should think that a bare Exposition of the Doctrin of his Church should be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to bring back into its Bosom them that had quitted it with so much reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, and remained in it in spight of what could be inflicted upon them. The Tenets of <hi>Rome</hi> are not taught in the <hi>Indies,</hi> nor in <hi>America</hi>; nor are we to learn from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain relations of some ignorant Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. We see its Practices and Devotions before our Eyes. The Books of their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are told in every place; and most part of our Reformers were either Bishops, Priests or Fryars; so that neither they nor their Disciples can be ignorant, neither of what the <hi>Romish Church</hi> Believes, nor of what it Practises: besides, the Ministers have no reason to dissemble in their Opinions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Clergy of it gain far more than those of any other Communion.</p>
                     <p>This Reflexion might make M. <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s sincerity very doubtful; who declares at the very beginning, <hi>That he Designs to render the Tenets of the Catholick Church more clear than they are, and to distinguish them from such as are falsly imputed to it.</hi> Nevethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Reformed being brought up in a Religion which inspires true Faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwise moved to desire a Re-union, in hopes to see the end of their Miseries; fancy'd, that the Accusation of this Bishop was but a pretext he used to cast out of his Creed what is troublesom and hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Besides the noise of an Agreement between the Two Religions, which was a long time sown among the People, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of divers' Ministers were made to draw the Project. M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> and his followers slipt many words, which were general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of a Reformation, upon condition of Re-union.</p>
                     <p>If it appears now, that there was not the least shadow of sincerity in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises that the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> made, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103507:76"/>
that at that very time the clear-sighted could soon discover, that it was but a pure cheat, the Reformed cannot be praised enough for not trusting to them, nor can the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be blamed enough that make nothing of playing with what is most sacred, when they have a design to cheat the simple.</p>
                     <p>To know whether M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> be of this Number, as several <hi>Protestants</hi> pretend and endeavour to prove, in shewing the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of his Sentiments, with those of the other Doctors of his Communion, it will not be unprofitable to know the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of his Book, because it may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly perceived by the way that a design is managed which is the end proposed.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>Turenne</hi> who saw a long time that his Religion was a hinderance to his Fortune, would have been very glad if he could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himself to the <hi>Romish Religion</hi>: But the vile Practices of this Church seem so strange to those who are brought up in other Principles, that he could not persuade himself to join with a Society that impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such ridiculous Superstitions upon its Votaries; to cure him of this Scruple, M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> published a small Writing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he strained himself to shew, That these small Devotions were not of the Essence of the <hi>Catholick Doctrine,</hi> and that one might live and die in its Communion without practicing them.</p>
                     <p>This Work, or rather the King's Cares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Liberalities having had Success, which all People know; our Prelate was of Opinion, That he could work the same effect upon others, and resolved to print this Manuscript that remained written four years before, and to add to it divers Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as that of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> of the <hi>Authority of the Church,</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> and obtained the approbation of the Bishop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> and of some other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sorbonne</hi> these several Ages has been look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as the source of the <hi>French</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, it's therefore that not only the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of this University, but also Bishops and other Clergy are glad to have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of that famous House at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of what Books they write of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. M. of <hi>Condom</hi> had that design, but he did not speed; for having sent his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position as soon as it came from the Press to some of the Doctors of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> instead of approving the Work, they marked se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places either contrary to, or favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but in a very little the Doctrine of their Church. So that Edition was presently suppressed, and another was composed, wherein the Passages were changed that were marked by the Censurers.</p>
                     <p>This could not be managed so secretly, but the Reformed came to know it. Mr. <hi>Noguier</hi> and M. <hi>de la Bastide</hi> who knew the Edition that was published; and this last did not fail to remark the Alteration that the Author made in the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script, and in the suppressed Edition. They also reproached him, that the true <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> were but little pleased at his Moderation, and one of them finish'd the Refutation of his Book before any <hi>Protestant</hi> had Printed his, but he was not forbidden to publish it.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Credit was great enough to stifle the direct Answer that those of his own Party made to him: But he could not hinder them that were dissatisfy'd from taking an indirect course, and to say what they thought, and even to refute him. The <hi>Iesuites</hi> and the <hi>Friars</hi> sharp maintainers of the Superstitions that enrich them, could not forgive him at all. Father <hi>Maimbourg</hi> in his History of <hi>Lutheranism</hi> drew this Prelates Character, and criticiz'd on his Book under the Name of Cardinal <hi>Contarini,</hi> and of one of his Works, and says well, <hi>That these Agreements and Managements of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in these pretended Expositions of Faith, which either suppress or do express in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful terms a part of the Doctrine of the Church, neither satisfie one side nor the other, who equally complain of swerving in a matter so momentous as that of Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Cresset</hi> gave this Bishop a more sensible stroke in his Book of the <hi>true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to the Blessed Virgin,</hi> printed at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> in 4to. in the Year 79. with priviledge from the King, and the Arch-bishops leave, and the consent of his own Provincial, and of three <hi>Iesuites</hi> that are the Censurers of all the Works of that Society. The <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins</hi> Tutor was too powerful an Adversary to be opposed directly. But a Writer of lesser Authority that adopted the Opinion of this Prelate, touching the Invocation of Saints, and Worship of Images, felt the weight of Father <hi>Cresset</hi>'s Anger.</p>
                     <p>This Author was a <hi>German Gentleman,</hi> called M <hi>Widenfelt,</hi> intendant of the Prince of <hi>Suarzemberg,</hi> and his Book was Entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Monita Salutaria</hi> B. <hi>Virginis, wholsom Advices of the Blessed Virgin to her indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Votaries.</hi> This Book made much noise in the World, especially after the Pastoral Letter of the Bishop of <hi>Tournay,</hi> wherein he recommends this Book to his People, as full of <hi>Solid Piety, and very fit to remove the Abuses whereunto Superstition wou'd engage 'em.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Mysia</hi> Suffragan of <hi>Cologne,</hi> the Vicar General of that City, the Divines of <hi>Gant, Malines,</hi> and <hi>Lovain,</hi> all approved it. Nevertheless, the <hi>Iesuite</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures that That Writing scandalized the good <hi>Catholicks</hi>; that the Learned of all Nations refuted it, that the Holy See con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it, and that in <hi>Spain</hi> it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to be printed or read, as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Propositions suspected of Heresie and Impiety, tending to destroy the particular Devotion to the Mother of God, and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the Invocation of Saints and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Images.</p>

                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:103507:77"/>There are now near 10 Years past since M. <hi>Meaux</hi> kept us in Expectation of Mr. <hi>Noguier</hi> and M. <hi>Bastides</hi> Refutation, but at length instead of an Answer in form, there only appeared a second Edition of his Book, bigger by half than the first, by an Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Advertisement in the beginning of it. One may soon judge, that it does not cost so much pains to compose 50 or 60 pages in <hi>Twelves</hi> as the taking of the City of <hi>Troy</hi> did. But tho' the time was not very long, it was too long to oblige all that time the Pope and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to give their Approbation to a Book so contrary to their Maxims: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, the Secret was communicated to them, and they were assured, That as soon as the Stroke was given, and the Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots converted either by fair or foul means, what seemed to be granted would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called.</p>
                     <p>Some <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> worthy of a better Religion, suffered thro' the ignorance of this Mystery. A Prior of <hi>Gascogne</hi> Doctor in Divinity, called M. <hi>Imbert</hi> told the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that went to the Adoration of the Cross on <hi>Good Friday</hi> in 83. <hi>That the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks adored Iesus Christ crucifyed on the Cross, but did not adore any thing that they saw there.</hi> The Curate of the Parish said, it was the <hi>Cross, the Cross</hi>; but M. <hi>Imbert</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, No, no, it is <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> not the <hi>Cross.</hi> This was enough to create trouble; this Prior was called before the Tribunal of the Arch-bishop of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> and when he thought to defend himself by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of M. <hi>Meaux,</hi> and by his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, what was said against that Book, <hi>was objected to him, that it moderated, but was contrary to the Tenets of the Church.</hi> After which, he was suspended from Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Functions; the Defendant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided an Appeal to the Parliament of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and writ to M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> to implore his protection against the Arch-Bishop, who threatned him <hi>with a perpetual Imprisonment and Irons</hi>; it is not known what became of it.</p>
                     <p>The History of M. <hi>de Witte,</hi> Priest and Dean of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s of <hi>Malines,</hi> is so well known, that I need not particularize upon it. Our Author refers us here to what the Journals have said: It is known what Persecutions he has suffered for expressing the Popes Supremacy and Infallibility, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to M. <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Doctrine. He did not forget to alledge that Bishops Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to say, That his Exposition required no more of a Christian and an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox; but this did not hinder the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Lovain</hi> to judge that Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pernicious and scandalous, that intimates that the <hi>Pope is not the Chiefest of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Reformed did not forget M. <hi>de Meaux</hi>; his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement did no sooner appear, but it was refuted by Mr. <hi>de la Bastide,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iurie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> a little after made his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative against the change of Religion,</hi> in opposition to that Bishops Exposition. But all these Books and those that were writ against his Treatise of the Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the two Kinds, had no Answer; this Prelate expecting booted Apologists who were to silence his Adversaries in a little time.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> of <hi>England</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their small number flattered themselves with hopes of the like Success, having at their head a bold couragious Prince, and one that would do any thing for them. They had already translated M. <hi>Condom</hi>'s Exposition of 1672 and 1675 into <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> and as soon as they saw King <hi>Iames</hi> setled on his Brothers Throne, they began to dispute by small Books of a leaf or two, written according to the method of the <hi>French Bishop.</hi> The Titles with the Answers, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Defences of each Party, may be had in a Collection printed this present Year at <hi>London,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Chiswells,</hi> which is Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>A Continuation of the present State of Controversy between the</hi> English Church <hi>and that of</hi> Rome, <hi>containing a History of the printed Books that were lately published on both sides.</hi> The Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> did begin the Battel by little Skirmishes, but found themselves after the first or second firing, without Powder or Ball, and not able to furnish scattered Sheets against the great Volumes made against them, said at last, instead of all other answer, that the little Book alone, entituled, <hi>The Papist Misrepresented, and there represented a-new, was sufficient to refute not only all the Dissertations which the English Divines lately published against Papists, but all the Books and Sermons that they ever preached against Catholicks.</hi> It is to no purpose to take the trouble of Disputing against peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that have so good an Opinion of their Cause. And in consequence of this the <hi>English</hi> answer to M. <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Reflections on his <hi>Pastoral Letter</hi> of 1686. met with no Answer as well as several other Books.</p>
                     <p>But Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> had no sooner published his <hi>Exposition of the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, but these Gentlemen which know better to assault than to defend made a Book Entituled, <hi>A Vindication of the Bishop of</hi> Condom<hi>'s Exposition, with a Letter of that Bishop.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Because we do not design to enter on the particulars of these Controversies, we will only take notice as to what past. That First, M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> denyed that any <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> writ against, or did design to write against it. Secondly, That <hi>Sorbonne</hi> did not refuse approving his Book. Thirdly, He says his Exposition was reprinted to alter those places which the Censurers had improved; and maintains that it was put into the Press without his knowledge, and that he had a new Edition made only to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103507:77"/>
change some expressions that were not exact enough. Fourthly, That he neither read nor knew any thing of Father <hi>Cresset</hi>'s Book.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> published the Defence of his Exposition about the middle of the same year 1686, where he shews, <hi>First,</hi> That the deceased Mr. <hi>Conrait,</hi> a Man acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by both Parties to be sincere, had told many of his Friends, that he saw this <hi>Answer</hi> in Manuscript, and other persons of known honesty that are still living, assured the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that they had this Manuscript in their hands.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> justifies his Accusations on the 2d and 3d heads, by so curious a History, that it seems worthy of being believed. He says, that one of his Acquaintance who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry familiar with one of <hi>Marshall de Turenne</hi>'s Domesticks, was the first that discover'd this Mystery. For this Domestick shewing his Friend in his Masters Library the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed Edition of M. <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Exposition with Marginal Notes, which he assured him were Written by the hands of some of the Doctors of <hi>Sorbonne</hi>; the Friend desired to borrow the Book, which the Servant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to. So strange an accident made the borrower use his utmost care to get a Copy of the First Edition, but there was such care taken to suppress it, that all he could do was but to gather up some loose Leaves, whereof he almost made an entire Book, and copyed what he wanted out of M. <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Original, which he then restored to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; it is this same Copy which Mr. <hi>Wake</hi> has, with his Certificate, that gather'd it, and compared it with the Mareschal's Copy.</p>
                     <p>It is not at all likely that Mr. <hi>Cramoisi,</hi> Director of the Printing-House, at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> should Print a Book of Importance, without the knowledge and good-will of the Author, that was a Bishop, and Tutor to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> and a great Favorite at Court; and it is more unlikely, that Mr. <hi>Cràmoisi</hi> should obtain the King's leave, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the <hi>French</hi> Prelates, for a subreptitious Copy? And why did not M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> shew his resentment for a bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this nature? And how came he to give this Printer not only the Corrected Copy, but also all the other Books that he made since?</p>
                     <p>We must examin but Fourteen places of the First Edition, taken notice of by Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> to see whether the alteration that M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> made in it, did only concern the exactness and neatness of the style.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First</hi> Edit. p. 1. <hi>Thus it seems very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to propose the Doctrine of the Catholick Church</hi> (to the Reformers) <hi>in separating the Questions which the Church hath decided, from those which belong not to her Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Second</hi> Edit. p. 1. <hi>It seems that there can no better way be taken than simply to propose the Doctrine of the Catholick Church, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish them well from those that are falsly imputed to her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First</hi> Edit. p. 7, 8. The same Church Teaches, <hi>That all Religious Worship ought to terminate in God, as its necessary end. So that the honour which the Church gives to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgin, and to the Saints, is only Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, because this honour is given to them only in respect to God, and for the love of him. And therefore the honour we render our Saints, is so far from being blamable, as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries would have it, because it is Religious, that it would deserve blame if it were not so.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> has thought it expedient to blot out the last period, and to express himself thus in his common Editions, <hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>And if the honour that is rendred to Saints can be called Religious, it is because it regards God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the same place, speaking of M. <hi>Daille,</hi> the Author expressed it after a very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner, but little favourable to his cause; <hi>As for Mr.</hi> Daille, <hi>said he, he thought that he ought to keep to the Three first Ages, wherein it is certain that the Church then was exercised more in Suffering than Writing, and has left many things, both in its Doctrine and Practice, which wants to be made clearer.</hi> This Acknowledgment was of importance, and the Censurers had reason to note it, and has not been seen since.</p>
                     <p>All the other Alterations are as conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as these; and Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> protests he could mention more, if he were minded to shew all the places wherein the Manuscripts differed from the common Editions.</p>
                     <p>The Author may judge, whether these be words, or things, that M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> has cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; but as to Father <hi>Cresset</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it may be said, that this Bishop has strained his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to such a degree, that none dares give him the Epithet it deserves. Is it possible that this Author should not have heard of a great Volume in <hi>Quarto,</hi> Writ against <hi>the profitable advice of the Blessed Virgin</hi>; since the Pastoral Letter of the Bishop of <hi>Tournay,</hi> who approved this last Book, has caused such long Disputes in <hi>France?</hi> Can it be supposed, that M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> was ignorant that the Opinion of this Jesuit was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Exposition? After M. <hi>de la Bastide</hi> reproached him with it, <hi>in his Answer to the Advertisement.</hi> And that the Author of the <hi>General Reflexions on his Exposition,</hi> and M. <hi>Iurieu</hi> in his <hi>Preservative,</hi> have made great Extracts out of the Book of <hi>The True Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Since Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> laughed at Father <hi>Cresset,</hi> in his Answer to the <hi>Preservative,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> refuted his Adversary, in the <hi>Iansenist convicted of vain Sophistry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Mr. <hi>Imbert</hi> in his Letter to this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, offered to refute the <hi>Preservative,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he might be secured, that no violence should be done him, and that he might have
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103507:78"/>
the liberty of saying what he thought. In fine, after that he himself Answered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers passages of the <hi>Preservative,</hi> in his Treatise <hi>of the Communion under both kinds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us add to all this, what M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> had the confidence to advance in his Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Letter upon the Persecution of <hi>France: I do not wonder,</hi> says he, <hi>my dear brethren, that you are come in such great numbers, and so easily into the Church: none of you have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered violence either in his Body or Goods. And so far from suffering Torments, that you have not heard talk of any. I hear that other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops say the same.</hi> Let this notorious fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood be compared with the Apology for the <hi>Persecution,</hi> which this Prelate made in a Letter to one of his Friends, that I read my self, Writ and Signed by his own hand; The Original whereof a certain Author prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to shew him. And it will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that one may be very hard upon the Catholick Religion without committing so gross a contradiction.</p>
                     <p>But why should we stay so long upon the discovering the mystery of the Composition? the Gentleman had done it himself without thinking of it. Confessing, that he weighed all his words, and racked his Invention to cheat the simple. At least this is what they that understand <hi>French</hi> will soon perceive, in reading this period of his <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement. In the mean time the Italian Version was mended very exactly, and with as much care as a Subject of that importance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, wherein one word turned ill might spoil all the Work.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though one must be very dull to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these pious Cheats as a sincere dealing, M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> was so fearful, lest he might be thought to abolish some abuses, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to reform his own Church, that he has lately given evident proofs of the hatred that he always bore the Protestants, and which he thought fit to hide under an affected mildness until the <hi>Dragoon Mission.</hi> It was in the <hi>History of Variations</hi> that he unmask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself, and shewed him what he was, by the Injuries and Calumnies which he cast upon the Protestants, and has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Model of the manner how he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be treated.</p>
                     <p>There were Three Months past when Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> whom this Bishop attacked with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cause, made a general Critique of all this History; to which he adds some Reflections upon M. <hi>le Grand.</hi> It was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated into <hi>French,</hi> and had been published long ago, had not M. <hi>le Grand</hi> busied himself in making a small Book against a Letter of Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> and against the Extract of his <hi>History of Divorce.</hi> The Author of this Bibliotheque had begun to Answer it, but this xi. Tome of the Bibliotheque, which lay upon him alone, and which could not be put by, made him discontinue; yet 'tis hop'd, that the Publick will lose nothing by this delay, but may see once more, if God be pleased to lend him health, and give him leisure to shew, that M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> is none of the sinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rest in the World.</p>
                     <p>And yet this Prelate has subject to reason himself, since those who approve his Works, have as little sincerity as himself. At least Mr. <hi>Wake</hi> shews, that what the Cardinals <hi>Capisucchi</hi> and <hi>Bona</hi> teach in their Works is a very different Doctrine from that of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Exposition,</hi> concerning the Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, and the Worship of Images.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Adversaries were so long silent, that the Dispute was thought end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but at last they broke silence about the middle of the year 1687, when was publisht a <hi>Reply to the Defence of the Exposition of the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>with a second Letter from M. de</hi> Meaux.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> a little after that made his 2d Defence, which he divided into two parts; in the first he justifies all that he advanced concerning the Expositions of M. <hi>de Meaux.</hi> He brings many Historical Proofs of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the old and new Papism, or between the Speculative Doctrine of M. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and of the other Doctors of the Catholick Church, and their common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. And examins in particular what <hi>Rome</hi> Teaches concerning the Worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The Second Part runs upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Object of the Divine Service; upon the Invocation of Saints, and upon I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and Relicks, and upon the accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Idolatry, which the <hi>Protestants</hi> charge the <hi>Roman Church</hi> with.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. M. <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Apologist believed, that to be even with Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> he should make a History of Controversies; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently runs upon Generalities that are not to the purpose; he speaks of the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> Zeal, and of the different methods that <hi>Rome</hi> has made use of to bring back those who have left her Communion; but he has forgot the chiefest of them, at least that which had most success, which is her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution. Then he comes to <hi>England,</hi> jumps from the Monk <hi>Augustin</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. makes some Reflections upon the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> and on Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and then, like Lightning, passes to the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and then to <hi>Iames</hi> the 1<hi>st</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the 2<hi>d,</hi> and then to <hi>Iames</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Preambles gave Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> occasion to speak of several remarkable things which would be too tedious to mention here. It will be enough to Remark two of the most important. The First relates to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Party and the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>; and the other to the Murther of <hi>Charles</hi> the 1<hi>st.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the First; He acknowledges that many of those whom the Persecution of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> had Exiled, were obstinate in the Form of Religion which they saw abroad; but that this Spirit of Schism was foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who mix themselves
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103507:78"/>
with them, pretending to be of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. In effect it was by the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in 1588, that the Puritans begun to make a noise, the Chief of them being <hi>Commin, Heath, Hallingham, Coleman, Benson,</hi> were all Papists; who thus dissembled and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised themselves, as appeared by a Letter which dropped out of <hi>Heath</hi>'s pocket. And it was discover'd, that the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> had Colledges in <hi>Germany, France, Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein the Students were brought up in Sciences and Mechanick Arts, and they exercised twice a week, to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute for and against <hi>Independents, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> and <hi>Atheism</hi> it self. After which they sent them to <hi>England,</hi> to play the best game that they understood. A <hi>Iesuit</hi> of St. <hi>Omers</hi> acknowledged, that there were some of the Fathers of their Society hid for Twenty years among <hi>Quakers,</hi> which is likely enough, because the scruple these Fanaticks make of Swearing, gives the Fryars the means of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving among them, being so exempted from the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In 1625. the Jesuites published a Book, Intituled, <hi>Mysteria Politica, or the Letters of some famous persons:</hi> designing to break the League that divers Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> made against the House of <hi>Austria</hi>; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Eight Letters, equally injurious to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> to the <hi>Venetians, Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Swissers.</hi> In the last, the Author that counterfeited the Protestant, forgot no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which he thought proper to give a mean Idea of King <hi>Iames,</hi> and to sow divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion between this Prince his Son and the Princess <hi>Palatine</hi>; and between the Lords of the Parliament, the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Puritane</hi> Ministers.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Civil Wars of <hi>England,</hi> and the death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, Mr. <hi>Wake</hi> acknowledges, that the fear of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Popery re-established, made the People take Arms; who, since the Reformation, had always horror for this Superstitious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. But he maintains, that the Papists were the first Authors of the troubles. M. <hi>du Moulin</hi>; Doctor of Divinity, and Chaplain to King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> with this a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after the Re-establishment of this Prince; and not contented to prove it in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the <hi>Philanax Anglicus,</hi> he offered to prove it legally, or by Law; there were then many alive that were ready to Swear, that there was held a Consultation of Cardinals and Doctors of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> wherein it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That it was lawful for the <hi>English Roman Catholicks</hi> to push the King on to his ruin, thereby to endeavor the Change of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Government. The <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> instead of taking this Challenge, made use of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Authority to hinder Mr. <hi>Moulin</hi> to press for the decision of this Suit. And though the Book and Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on remained without Answer for 17 years. The Author renewed the Challenge in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Edition of his Work, and dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being Answered, none having Courage to undertake it. They that do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>English</hi> will find the most part of M. <hi>Moulin</hi>'s proofs, <hi>in the Politicks of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, in the last endeavors of afflicted innocence.</hi> And in Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi>'s <hi>Parallel betwixt Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism and Popery,</hi> with some new reasons of the Author, to which if we add what Mr. <hi>Wake</hi> has here, the conjecture will be more than probable.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the beginning of the Troubles, the King perceived that the Fanaticks were set on by the Papists. <hi>Their Principles,</hi> says he, <hi>in his Declaration against the Rebels of</hi> Scotland, <hi>are those of the Iesuites; their Preachers Sermons are the style of</hi> Becan, Scioppius <hi>and</hi> Eudaemon Joannes, <hi>from whom they borrow their very Phrases. The pitiful Arguments of their Seditious Libels are drawn word by word out of</hi> Bellarmin <hi>and</hi> Suarez. <hi>The means they use to make Proselytes are the pure Stories and Inventions of the Iesuites, and false Reports and Prophecyes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Inspirations of Womens Dreams; as if</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi> Pilate <hi>were reconciled, and had joyned to destroy</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>his Worship and his Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In 1640, there was a design discover'd to the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> That the <hi>Pope,</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and several <hi>English Roman Catholicks,</hi> but especially the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> were engaged together, and that what they proposed, was, to cause a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as was done a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; this is certain, for the Histories of those times have it all at length.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>William Boswel</hi> was then King <hi>Charles</hi> the First's Resident at the <hi>Hague,</hi> he was told of this Conspiracy, and that the Roman Clergy misled the English, giving them hopes of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government. That there were Indulgences from <hi>Rome,</hi> and Dispensations from the Pope, approved by a Congregation of Cardinals, that suffered Scholars to be instructed to Dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Episcopal Party, and against the Liturgy of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> That in the space of a years time 60 Priests and Fryars went from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> to Preach the Scotch Doctrine, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to destroy the Bishops, whom they looked upon as the only Supporters of the Crown.</p>
                     <p>Arch-bishop <hi>Bramhall</hi> being in <hi>France</hi> some time after the King's death, learned there how this business was manag'd. In 1646, about 100 Popish Clergymen crossed the Seas, and being Mustered in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Army, they kept Correspondence with the Catholicks that served the King, and acquainted them with what passed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day. The ensuing year, having deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated among themselves, whether the King's death would not be an advantage to their Cause, and main Business; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Affirmative. But some Priests and Fryars were of opinion, to Consult the Universities, and among others, that of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103507:79"/>
                        <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> which made Answer, <hi>That for the good of Religion, and Interest of the Church, it was lawful to alter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, especially in a Heretick Countrey, and that so they might take off the King with a safe Conscience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Salmone</hi> in his History of the Troubles of <hi>England,</hi> Printed in <hi>France,</hi> with the King's Priviledge, makes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of two Companys of <hi>Walloon Catholicks</hi> which the Parliament had in it's Service; and that at <hi>Edge-Hill-Fight,</hi> there were many Popish Priests found among the dead of their Army.</p>
                     <p>After all these Proofs, if one does but consider the Principles of both Religions, it will be easie to find the true Authors of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Death. It is certain that the Reformed had not Pastors at the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> nor in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor in <hi>Spain,</hi> to cause Rebellions, or beset the Prince, and make them violate the Priviledges of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But it must be confest that they were for a Common-wealth, as their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries accuse them, and not that they did not obey a King as freely as they would States; it was because they loved Peace and Liberty, and that after the Example of Common-wealths, they sought quietness, suffering others to do as they please. Their Doctrine and Discipline dispose them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually for a Peaceable Life. All their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters may Marry, and because this is a Grave and Staid <hi>State,</hi> there are few but do Marry. When one is engaged in such firm Tyes, there are but few that think of Removing, or Seeing and Travelling the World: whereas those that serve the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church have no greater engagement than that of a <hi>Mistress,</hi> which they may break at pleasure, and which they always do when a good occasion serves, or when they are sent into other places by their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the Popish Conspirations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> the First, without mentioning other Princes, make it more suspicious that the Monks were the contrivers of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s death. What could not they do against a King who did not love them, and that is certainly dead in the Profession of the <hi>Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; since they have Sacrificed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and Restitution of both his <hi>Sons,</hi> whereof the latter has declared in Ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the Throne, that he was of their Communion? After a step of that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, one should think, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> had reason to be satisfied, and that they should study to blot out the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of her past Cruelties, by a more moderate and mild conduct.</p>
                     <p>But on the contrary it is well known, how far the Jesuites have pushed this easie Prince; and his Retractations are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted proofs of the Infringments they made him guilty of; they may be seen in the Memorials of the <hi>English Protestants,</hi> and in his Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s, (now King <hi>William</hi>'s) Declaration, which now are very common. But if these Books, and several others, were lost, and that one had but the King's own Writing, they would be sufficient to condemn that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The <hi>Proofs</hi> that were brought that the <hi>Prince of Wales</hi> was but a <hi>CHEAT,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be otherwise destroyed, than by Witnesses, incapable of being heard, to Swear according to the Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Or of such as only heard a Woman Groan, which they did not see; or have seen a Child new-born, without being sure that it was the Queen's. To examin a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this consequence, and to prevent Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars, there ought to be a Free <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> according to the Custom of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And though all <hi>England</hi> desired it, yet the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> stay'd the King a long time from calling it, to give all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the marks of their bad intentions.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. It is time to give an Idea of each of these Treatises.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the Exposition of the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> follows the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Order, and in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Doctrine, he shews wherein it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or disagrees with <hi>Popery,</hi> as Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> explains it, and according as the other Doctors Teach it.</p>
                     <p>There is a <hi>Preface</hi> in the beginning, where the Author examins the <hi>Principle</hi> by which the <hi>Expositor</hi> pretends to justifie the Tenets of his Church, which is, that it is unjust to impute the consequences of a Tenet to Adversaries that deny them. Which is true, when they deny as well in deed as in word. And thus the Contra-Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strancers are to be excused, that make God the Author of Sin; for this Inference can lawfully be made out of their System of Absolute <hi>Predestination</hi>: Nor can it be imputed to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that some of them believe, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> ceased to be Man, and was Transformed into a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty after his Ascension, though this is a clear consequence from the Doctrine of Ubiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The reason is not that Contra-Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants fear these consequences; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not influence neither their Worship, nor their Practice; and because they Teach contrary Doctrines to these Principles. If in stead of this the first had maintained, that a Man was but a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,</hi> that had neither Liberty, Vice nor Vertue, nor Punishment nor Reward; and that all is necessary to God himself: And if the other affirms, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded not for us, and takes no care of his Church; and that he pities not our Infirmities, having suffered them himself; and that he will not come at last to Judge all Mankind; then there would be Reason to call the one Atheists, and the other no Christians: but every one knows that they are far from these impious thoughts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="tcp:103507:79"/>The <hi>Protestants</hi> accuse the <hi>Romish Church</hi> of Idolatry, and for having recourse to other Saviours besides <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; but the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators make a noise of that, as if it were a hainous Calumny, and maintain that it is only God that is to be worshiped with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worship, and that we are not saved but through the Merits of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> The Reformed shew them, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Saints, and that they worship them and the Cross, Images and Relicks, as the Pagans did their Heroes, their Demons, and inferiour Gods, their Statues, their Idols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That they believe they satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Divine Justice, by Indulgences, Vows, and Pilgrimages, and that according to them the Merit of these Actions, and of the Saints, together with them of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> reconcile Sinners to God. They prove that this is the Doctrine which their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, Popes and Councils teach, not only in their great Volumes for the Learned, but also for the rest in their Catechisms and Prayer Books, and other Books of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion for the use of the People; that it is not only the practice of the Laity and of some ignorant and superstitious Priests, but also of all the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in their Rituals Breviaries, Missals, and other Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices, that it never punished such as pushed the Superstitions to an Excess, which the Moderator seems to blame: But that far from having a mind to redress these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses, she prosecutes such as are suspected to have a design to abolish them, as the <hi>Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senists</hi> and <hi>Quietists,</hi> tho' these two at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom are but idle People, and of little sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. Would a Magistrate set a Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at liberty simply because he denyed a Deed that is well proved, or because he has the face to maintain, that the killing a Man at 12 a Clock is neither Murder nor a Crime punishable by Law? On the contrary, this Criminal would deserve a double Chastisement, as a Murderer and as a Disturber of the Publick Peace in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Doctrine that is contrary to Civil Society.</p>
                     <p>Because M. <hi>Daille</hi> acknowledges the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Points, which the Reformed teach, M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> pretends to justifie his Church, and prove it's Purity, tho this acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment serves only to state the Question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Parties; and to shew that the Question is not whether the Fundamental Doctrine of Protestants be true, seeing that is confessed on both sides; but the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is to know, whether <hi>what the Roman Catholicks hold over and above be Articles necessary to Salvation as they pretend, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are contrary to the truth that both hold as Divine, and whether they ought to be cast away for this reason, as the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is according to this method that Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> explains the Articles exposed by <hi>M. de Condom,</hi> marking in each what the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> approve, and what they condemn in the Tenets of <hi>Rome,</hi> and bringing some of the chief reasons that make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark these Distinctions.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. We said before, that we were not willing to enter upon the particulars of Controversies; but because the <hi>Roman Church</hi> continually fomenting the Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Protestants,</hi> have persuaded some il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate People, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> agrees in a great many more Points with it than with the other <hi>Protestants.</hi> We shall mention her Sentiments here according to Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Exposition upon the Articles, wherein the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> brag of this pretended Conformity: As

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, The <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> speaking in the name of his Church, says, it is an extravagant Practice invented at pleasure, and so far from being contained in Scripture, that it is several ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. It is true, that according to an innocent ancient Custom, we make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the Communion Table of Saints that dyed in the Communion of our Church, thanking God for the grace he did them, and praying him to give us the grace to follow their Example: But this respect we bear their Memory, does not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from condemning a Practice that M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> seems to have omitted, and which cannot agree with us at all, which is, that <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> recommend the Offering of the Host to God by the Merit of the Saints, whose Reliques are upon the Altar; as if <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> whom they pretend to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, needed S. <hi>Bathilde,</hi> or <hi>Potentiana</hi>'s Recommendation to become agreeable to his Father.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Iesus</hi> by his Passion has satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd Divine Justice for us, and therefore God pardons us all our Sins thro' the Merits of his Son, and by an Effect of his Good Will treats us with an Allyance of grace, and by Vertue of this Allyance solely found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Death and Passion of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> he sends us his Holy Spirit, and calls us to Repentance. If we answer this Calling, God justifies us thro' his pure Goodness, that is to say, he forgives us all our past faults, and gives us the grace to obey his Precepts better, and better, and will Crown us in Heaven if we persevere in his Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; he grants us all these Graces, not for any good Quality that he sees in us, or for any good we do, but only in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103507:80"/>
of the Satisfaction and Merits, of his Son that are applyed to us by Faith.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Tho' our Church take all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of care to hinder Childrens dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptism, rather than to determine what would become of them; they died without it; we cannot nevertheless but condemn the want of Charity of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> that excludes them from Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Church of <hi>England</hi> does not believe that Confirmation is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor that the use of Chrism, tho' of an antient Custom, was an Apostolical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution; but because the Imposition of Hands is an antient Custom, and comes from the Apostles; the <hi>English</hi> have kept it, and according to their Discipline the Bishops only have liberty to administer it. The Prelate that does it, addresses his Prayer to God, to beg of him to strengthen with his Spirit him that he puts his Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that he may protect him from Temptations, and that he may have the grace to fulfill the Conditions of his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, which he that he prays for ratifies, and confirms with his Promises.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Nor are the Orders a Sacrament according to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> because they are not common to all Christians; but she believes that no one ought to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the Function of a Minister with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ordination, and that it belongs to the Bishop only to confer it; and she allows the Distinction of Orders: And tho' there is none under a Deacon, because the Scripture makes mention of none; yet she acknowledges that they are very antient.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, As for the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> tho' Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> treats of it at length; we will omit speaking of it until we come to the XII. Article, where there are many Books seen that concern this Subject.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, We receive, says the <hi>English Expositor,</hi> with equal Veneration all that comes from the Apostles, let it be by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Tradition, provided we be assured that they are the true Authors of the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine or Practice attributed to them; so that when we are shewn, that a Tradition was received in all Ages and by all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, then we are ready to receive it, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Character of an Apostolical Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. So our Church does not reject Tradition, but only the Tenets and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions which <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to justify after this way.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, And as for the <hi>Authority of the Vniversal Church of all Ages,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> acknowledges, 1. That they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Scripture from their Hands, and it is chiefly for this Authority, that they look upon <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Song to be <hi>Canonical,</hi> and reject other Books <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> which perhaps they would have received with as much ease. These Books have our respect even before we know by reading whether they be worthy of the Spirit of God; but this Reading confirms us in the respect which the Authority of the Church gives unto them, as to the Holy Writings.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. If there had been an <hi>Vniversal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> not contested, that had come from the Apostles to us, concerning the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Books, as concerning their number, the Church of <hi>England</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it also; but she does not believe that a particular Church, such as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> should usurp this Priviledge, nor that it ought to force others to follow the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations which she gives of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. When any Disputes arise concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, the best way to appease them is to assemble a Council; but it does not follow, that such an Assembly can say as the Assembly of the Apostles at <hi>Ierusalem, It seem'd good to the Holy Ghost and to us, nor that it is Infallible, or that it's Canons are not subject to Correction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> goes on, and says, <hi>When we say, I believe in the Holy Catholick Church, we do not only understand, that Iesus Christ has planted a Christian Church which is to last to the end of the World, but also that the Son of God will conserve either among the Christians, or in the Vniversal Church, Truth enough to denominate it such a Church; that is, he will never suffer that Truths requisite for Salvation should be unknown in any place. So that tho' the Vniversal Church can err, it does not follow, that it can sink altogether, nor become wholly erroneous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then it would cease to be; but such a particular Church as that of</hi> Rome, <hi>can err and fall into utter Apostacy. And tho' the Fundamental Points be clearly contained in Scripture, and that it is very hard that one Man alone should gain-say the Opinion of all the Church, nevertheless, if this Man was certainly convinced, that his Opinion was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the undoubted Authority of the Word of God, we would be so far being afraid to bear with him, that we all agree, that the most glorious Action that St.</hi> Athanasius <hi>ever did, was that he alone maintained Christ's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity against the Pope, the Councils, and all the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">V. <hi>And so, tho we acknowledge that God has subjected Christians to the Government of the Church for Peaces sake, and to preserve Vnity and Order, and that she has power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to her Children what Doctrines are and are not to be publickly taught in her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet we believe that the Holy Scripture is the only Support of our Faith, and the last and infallible Rule by which the Church and we are to govern our selves.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:103507:80"/>Ninthly, That there are some that think that the <hi>Church of England</hi> makes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the three First Ages Idols, and equals them in Authority to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But Mr. <hi>Wake</hi> will undeceive them; for, says he, <hi>Tho' we have appealed to the Churches of the first Ages for new Proofs of the truth of our Doctrine; it is not that we think that the Doctors of those times had more right to judge of our Faith, than those had that followed them, but it is because that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a serious examination, we have found that as for what concerns the common Belief that is among us, they have believed and practised the same things without adding other Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Superstitions that destroy them, wherein they have acted conformably to their and our Rule, the Word of God; notwithstanding it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, but that they effectually fell into some wrong Opinions, as that of the</hi> Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenaries <hi>and Infant Communion,</hi> which are rejected by both Parties.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, <hi>Whether one may be saved in the Roman Church</hi>; the <hi>English</hi> think that as she yet conserves the Fundamental Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, those that live in her Bosom with a disposition to learn and leave off their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Errors and profess all the truth that they will discover, may be saved thro' the grace of God, and Faith in Jesus Christ, and by a general Repentance, that puts their Errors in the number of the Sins they do not know of. But that ill use may not be made of this charitable Grant, the Expositor limits it as followeth.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That it is harder to be saved in the Communion of this Church, since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation than it was before, because its Errors were not so well known, nor so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly refuted, which rendred the ignorance excusable.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That they that live among <hi>Protestants</hi> and in a Country wherein they may learn and make publick and open profession of the Truth, are more condemnable than the other.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. That Priests are yet more than Laicks. In a word the <hi>Protestants</hi> hope that the good Men of the Roman Church will be saved; but they have no assurance, that they are to be saved: Whereas they are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That they will be saved that live Christian-like in their own Communion. They do not know, whether God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Roman Catholicks for the Errors they professed, taking them for truth; but they are assured, that the Crime of those that being convinced of Popish Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, leave the Protestants thro' motives of Interest and Ambition, and maintain Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical and Superstitious Tenets against their Consciences, deserve no pardon.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, As for Idolatry, the Homilies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> accuse that of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as the <hi>English</hi> Doctors who lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The Catholicks object, that the Learned of this Kingdom changed Opinion in the Reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> the First, and begun to maintain, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not Idolatrous; but these Gentlemen are so unlucky in Proofs, that of six Authors which they quote, the Arch-bishop <hi>Laud, Iackson, Feilding, H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>These are the Points whereon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Protestants would make the Church of <hi>England</hi> pass for half Papists, tho there is not one but was taught by other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, excepting Episcopacy. And this Government is so ancient, that even those who think Presbytery better, ought not to condemn for some little difference in Discipline a Church that is otherwise very pure, unless they are minded to ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematize St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> St. <hi>Clement,</hi> St. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp,</hi> St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the whole Church of the second and third Age, and a great part of the first.</p>
                     <p>Without question the Episcopal Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> have the like Charity for <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> I will not alledge the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Modern Doctors, nor of such as were accused of having favoured the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Puritans</hi>; we see the Marks of its mildness and moderation towards all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If there ever was a time wherein the <hi>Church of England</hi> differed from <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> and had reason so to do; it was in the middle of the Reign of K. <hi>Iamss</hi> the First; and notwithstanding, you may see how the Bishop of <hi>Eli</hi> speaks, writing for the King, and by his Order, against Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Bellarmin.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>One may see how much the Protestants of this Country agree, by Harmony of their Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, where each Church acknowledges where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she agrees with the rest. Then lay aside those odious Names, seek our Professions of Faith in our Confessions. The Reproach you make us concerning the</hi> Puritans, <hi>is altogether absurd, because their number is but small, and the most moderate among them agree with us in the chief Articles of Religion. The</hi> Scotch Puritans <hi>Confession has no Error in Fundamental Points; so that the King might say with reason, That the Establish'd Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Scotland <hi>was certainly true.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as for the rest, there's no reason to suspect Dr. <hi>Wakes</hi> Testimony; for the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> have approved his Books: None of the other Doctors contradicted him; and some sided with him against <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</hi> And these last have not accused him of swerving from the common Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> only in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle

                     <p>DR. <hi>Wake,</hi> Minister of the Holy Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel at <hi>London,</hi> who is said to be the Author of this Book, gives, First, In few words the History and Origine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as it hath been ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily done amongst <hi>Protestants.</hi> Secondly, He names several Illustrious Persons of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> who have been accused of not believing the Real Presence, or <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> to wit, <hi>Peter Picherel,</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>du Perron, Barnes,</hi> an English Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine, and Mr. <hi>de Marca,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who gave his absolute Sentiment hereon, in one of his Posthume Disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, tho' in the Edition of <hi>Paris</hi>; the places wherein he said, it have been chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or blotted out. But it could not be hindered, but that this Work having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before Persons, took notice of these Sentiments; some entire Copies thereof have fallen into the hands of <hi>Protestants,</hi> who got it printed in <hi>Holland</hi> in 1669. without cutting off any thing. To these Authors are joined F. <hi>Sirmond</hi> the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> who believed the Impanation, and who had made a Treatise upon it; which hath never been printed, and whereof some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have yet Copies. M. <hi>de Marolles,</hi> who got a Declaration printed in form in 1681. by which he declared, that he believed not the Real Presence, and which was insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here in <hi>English:</hi> And in short, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Book Entituled, <hi>Sure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest means of Converting Hereticks,</hi> whom we dare not affirm to be the same who published a Treatise of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> which the Fifth <hi>Tome</hi> of the <hi>French Bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liotheque</hi> speaks of, <hi>p.</hi> 455. The <hi>Cartesians,</hi> and several others, are suspected of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the same no more than the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</hi> So that if the <hi>Catholicks</hi> cite some Reformed for them, <hi>Protestants</hi> also want not <hi>Catholick</hi> Authors, who have been of their Opinion. Thirdly, The Author shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the dangerous Consequences which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, according to the Principles of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> from the incredulity of so many Men of Knowledge, be it in respect to <hi>Mass,</hi> or in respect of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Treatise it self is divided into two parts. The first contains two Chapters and an Introduction, wherein is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Nature and Original of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> much after the Ideas of <hi>Lightfoot.</hi> In the first Chapter <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is at large refuted by Scripture, by Reason, and the Fathers. We shall make no stay at it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Matter is so well known. The Second Chapter is imployed to refute what Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> said, concerning the Opinions of several Doctors of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> upon the Real Presence. Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> at first complains, That his Adversary in that only repeats Objections which his Friend <hi>T. G.</hi> had before proposed in his <hi>Dialogues,</hi> and which a Learned Man had refuted in an Answer to these <hi>Dialogues,</hi> printed at <hi>London</hi> in 1679. As to what concerns the Faith of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which he maintains to have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the same, since the Reign of <hi>Edward.</hi> He reduces it to this, according to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who refuted <hi>T. G.</hi> viz. <hi>That she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves only a Real Presence of the invisible Power, and grace of Iesus Christ, which is in, and with the Elements; so that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them with Faith, it produces Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and real Effects upon the Souls of Men. As Bodies taken by Angels, continueth he, may be called their Bodies, whilst they keep them; and as the Church is the Body of Iesus Christ, because his Spirit animates and liveneth the Souls of the Believing; so the Bread and Wine after the Consecration, are the Real Body of Iesus Christ, but spiritually and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He gives not himself the trouble to prove the solidity of this comparison by Scripture; and when he comes to the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Authors, that Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> hath quoted; he contents himself to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce other Passages, where they do not speak so vigorously of the participation of the substance of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Calvin,</hi> descends not from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>The vertue of the Mind being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to penetrate through all impediments, and to surmount the distance of Places.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He cites several other places of <hi>Beza,</hi> of <hi>Martyr,</hi> and many English Doctors; by which it appears, that they did not believe the Body of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> properly descended from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the Eucharist, or is in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103507:81"/>
at the same time, though they say we are nourished hereby through Faith, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an incomprehensible manner. Yet it must be granted, that if these Great Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood nothing by <hi>nourishing our selves by the flesh of Iesus Christ,</hi> but to believe that we are saved by his Sacrifice, and, to feed our selves with this hope, or to receive his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it was not necessary to tell us of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Union of our Spirits with the Body of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> notwithstanding the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of places; the Spirit of God being every where, and Faith having no relation to local distance, there's nothing in the Spiritual eating of the Body of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> taken in the sense we have above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of Miraculous, nor of Incomprehensible, more than in other acts of Piety, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces which God gives unto us. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we suppose this, or any other method to expound the eating of the Body of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; there would be no danger to the Reformation, to say, that these Learned Men have not had an Idea altogether distinct thereupon, or that their Expressions are not exact. Although it were granted that they mistook in some things, it would not follow that the <hi>Romish Church</hi> could have justly rejected all their Doctrines; or that <hi>Protestants</hi> are in the wrong, by inviolably retaining their Sentiments, as far as they are conformable to Holy Scripture; and to abandon that wherein they might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. We do not make a profession of believing, that those who err in one thing, are deceived in all; or of rejecting every thing they have said, because they have not perceived the truth clearly enough in some things. Thus all the Objections of this nature might be ruined, without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to defend indifferently all that the Reformers may have said, seeing it's agreed on, that the Protestant Religion is not founded upon their Authority, and that they might be mistaken in incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable things, without its being in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> thought not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to act in this manner. He believes that the Reformed never changed their Opinions hereon; and for the Divines of <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he maintains that they were perfectly of the same opinion; which he proves by a passage of <hi>the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Reformation,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Second Part, which is wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the 3d Chapter, he answers first to what Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> affirms to have been allowed by Protestants, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained against him, that he hath not well understood the words of some of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors whom he cited, that say very well, that in Communicating, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> ought to be Adored, but not as Corporally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent under the Species of Bread and Wine. As for <hi>Forbes</hi> and <hi>Marc-Antony de Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> it is agreed on, that the desire they had of reconciling Religions, made them say too much. <hi>Thorndyke</hi> speaks not less vigorously, but upon a Hypothesis quite different from that of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> seeing he believed that the Bread is called the Body of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and the Wine his Blood; because by the Consecration they are Hypostatically united to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as well as to his Natural Body. It was spoken of in the First Part. To oppose to the Catholick Author, Doctors of his own Party; they say, that <hi>Thomas, Paludanus</hi> and <hi>Catharin,</hi> maintains, that it was an enormous Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry to Adore the Sacrament without believing Transubstantiation. Thus, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is agreed on, that if a Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Host is truly Adorable, one would not be guilty of Idolatry, if one Adored one which should not be Consecrated, thinking it once would be so: It's incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that the Reformed Religion can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive so much prejudice hereby, as the Authority of the Catholick Doctors who have been cited; because the Reformed deny that a Host can be Adored, whether it be Consecrated or not. As to the Grounds of this Subject, he sends us in his Preface to a Book, Entituled, <hi>A Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning the Adoration of the Host,</hi> Printed at <hi>London,</hi> 1685.</p>
                     <p>In the Second place, The Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is briefly examined; but as there is none who hath not read divers Treatises upon this Subject, we shall insist no longer upon it.</p>

But thus the Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> understands them. Jesus Christ, <hi>the true Sun, who, as 'tis known, made his Light to shine over all the Vniverse, towards the end of</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius<hi>'s Reign, at which time his Religion was propagated, without hinderance, in spight of the Senate, because this Prince threatned those with death that should accuse the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>; Jesus Christ, <hi>I say, made his Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams to shine, to wit, his Precepts, not from the Firmament, but the highest place of the Heavens, (and which was from all Eternity) upon this frozen Island, distant from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Sun. Gildas</hi> speaks of two several times, wherein the visible Sun appeared; the one towards the end of <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Reign, at which it shined to the view of the whole World: and the other that it particularly appeared in <hi>England,</hi> and which he marks by the Particle <hi>interea.</hi> This word relates to the time whereof he speaks, to wit, that in which <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> Conquered the Queen <hi>Boadicea,</hi> which happened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign, about Twenty years after that <hi>Claudius</hi> had sent <hi>A.

                     <p>The Monks of the last Ages, fruitful in Ancient Histories, affirmed, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> came from <hi>Glassenbury,</hi> where he founded a Monastery, Preaching there the Gospel.

                     <p>Nevertheless he believes it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by good Authorities, and maintained by probable circumstances, that <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> entred into <hi>England</hi> in the time of the <hi>Apostles. Eusebius</hi>

Many of the Writers of the last A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, said, that a King of <hi>England,</hi> named <hi>Lucius,</hi> was Converted to <hi>Christianity,</hi> in the time of <hi>M. Aurelius,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Verus.</hi> But suppose this true, in the Main, there are divers circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are really false; as when this <hi>Lucius</hi> is made King of all <hi>England,</hi> which was, at that time, a <hi>Roman</hi> Province. Our Prelate believes there might be a <hi>Christian</hi> Prince of that Name, in some place of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and whom the <hi>Romans</hi> suffered to Reign, because he was of their side; such as might have been the Descendants of one <hi>Cogidunus,</hi> who favoured them. That this place of <hi>England</hi> perhaps was the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Sussex,</hi> where there is no Monument of the <hi>Romans.</hi> This being so, it may easily be conceived, that <hi>Lucius</hi> had heard Discourses of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> by some antient <hi>Britans,</hi> or Soldiers of the Army, which <hi>M. Aurelius</hi> brought hither, and which had been delivered from an eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by the Prayers of the <hi>Christians</hi> that were in it, as the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror himself said <note n="(d)" place="margin">

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will not fail to add to this, that in the Conjectures that are always made in the Enquiry after these Antiquities, founded upon the Traditions of as great Lyars as the Monks of the past Ages; that in these Conjectures, I say, <hi>Si trapassano i confini del vero, per scrivere negli ampii spatii del possibile, cose incerte &amp; non seguite,</hi>

                     <p>And also the silence of <hi>Gildas,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd us of all he knew of the Antiquities of <hi>England,</hi> yet speaks not one word of this <hi>Lucius,</hi> which renders this History very suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, even in what appears most possible in it.</p>
                     <p>Our Prelate proves there were <hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in the time of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and that several suffered Martyrdom in it; though the Persecution could not last long here, seeing <hi>Constantius,</hi> Father to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> stopped it. <hi>Constantius</hi> dying at <hi>York,</hi> and his Son being declared <hi>Caesar</hi> by the Army, the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure: we find the Names of Three Bishops of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who Subscribed to the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> in CCCXIV. The Author believes there were a great many more; and that those Three were sent by the Bishops of the Three Provinces, for all were never at any of the Councils, which wou'd have been too numerous, if every one had gone thither. He believes also, that there was a continual Succession of Bishops in <hi>England,</hi> from the Apostles till that time. Some Monks have thought, that Bishops were Established in <hi>England</hi> in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Flamines,</hi> and <hi>Archiflamines</hi> of the Heathens; but Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> shews 'tis but a Dream, and that the first Pagan Hierarchy was established by <hi>Maximinus,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Model of the Christians, which was much more Antient.</p>
                     <p>Speaking of the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> the Author shews, that its Canons were sent to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> not to Confirm them, as <hi>Baronius</hi> maintains, but to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish them. <hi>Quae decrevimus,</hi> say these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>in Communi Coneilio, charitati tuae significare, ut omnes sciant, quid in futurum observare debeant.</hi> To this he joyns the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Council, which he reduces to certain Heads, and expounds, in a few words, particularly the Third <hi>De his qui arma projiciunt in pace,</hi> who ought to be suspended from the Communion. If an Allegorical sense might be given to these words, our Bishop believes they may be expounded of the <hi>Christians,</hi> who, in the time wherein the Persecution ceased, grew more indifferent, as to their manner of living, and less conformable to the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which they had kept before. But if they are understood Literally, they may refer to the <hi>Christian</hi> Soldiers, who would leave the Army, when there was no fear of being constrained to any Idolatrous act, in serving the Emperor, as they had been under the Heathen Princes. <hi>Constantine</hi> offered to dismiss all the Soldiers that desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it. The Fathers of the Council might fear that all the <hi>Christians</hi> wou'd abandon his Armies, and that afterwards it should
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103507:83"/>
be supply'd with <hi>Pagans</hi>; which could have been fatal to Christianity: So the Bishops assembled at <hi>Arles,</hi> and thought they ought to prevent this accident, in suspending from the <hi>Communion</hi> such <hi>Christian Souldiers</hi> as quitted the Service.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. After having <note n="(m)" place="margin">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 88.</note> shewn, That there were Bishops in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> before the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>; the Author speaks of the State, wherein the Churches of the same Island were after this Council to that of <hi>Rimini.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the Subscriptions, which we still have of the Bishops who assisted at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> there is none of any Prelate of <hi>England</hi>; it is very probable there were some of them. 1. Because <hi>Constantine</hi> did all he could, to assemble a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Bishops. 2. Because there is no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood this Emperor should forget the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>England,</hi> where he was born and proclaimed <hi>Caesar.</hi> 3. Because they having been at the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> which was held before, and at those of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and <hi>Rimini,</hi> which followed that of <hi>Nice,</hi> there was no reason to suppose, that they should be forgotten in this latter.</p>
                     <p>This being granted, Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, that we may learn from the Canons of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Rights and Priviledges of the <hi>British Churches.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he relates and expounds these Canons; but makes the longest stay upon <note n="(t)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Page</hi> 95.</note> three which concern <hi>Ecclesiastical Discipline.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth is conceived in these Terms, <hi>That a Bishop ought chiefly to be established by all the Bishops of the Province; but if that be too difficult, either because it requireth more haste, or that the Proceedings of the Bishops wou'd make it too long; there must at least be three present, and they have the consent of the Absent to consecrate him. But the Confirmation of all that is done in the Province, ought to be reserved to the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this Canon, the Rights of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans are established after an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable manner; but that which creates dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, is to know whether by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>to establish,</hi> which is at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, must be understood the <hi>Right of choosing a Bishop,</hi> was devolved on the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the Province; or whether the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion be only of <hi>Conservation,</hi> which should be done by the Bishops upon the <hi>Election,</hi> made by the Suffrages of the People. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Interpreters of the Canons, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by the Word <hi>to establish, to elect</hi>; and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> sheweth, That all this may be proved, by a place of the Synodal Letter <note n="(n)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Conc. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> of the same Council to those of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where it's said, That the <hi>Meletian</hi> Bishops, <hi>which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should choose,</hi> should be received, and that in the time of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the People named the Bishops, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not but that they were elected by their Brothers, and confirmed by the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan,</hi> without which the nomination of the People signified nothing. So that all that can be concluded from thence is, that the People had the <hi>Right of Nomination</hi>; which they have since deservedly lost, by Seditions and Tumults, and which they cannot recall; unless it is shew'n whether it is a Divine and unalterable Right; which will never be, adds our Author, and which even those, who strive to win the favour of the People, in defending it's Rights, do not endeavour to prove, upon the Principles of the first Ages. It will not be denyed, but that the People had then <hi>the Right of Opposing</hi> the chosen Persons, by shewing, That they were not worthy. But in this case, the People were heard as Witnesses, and not as Judges. If the Bishops who had chosen him who was opposed, judged that the Accusations, which were against him, were just; they proceeded against the Accused, according to the Canons; and then they came to a new nomination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of notwithstanding the Synod of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was to judge: The Author expounds thereby the 16 Canon of the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the 12 of that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> where mention is made of the <hi>popular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi>; not to mark the Preferment of some one to the Episcopacy, but the choosing of a Bishop already ordained, to be Bishop of some Church.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Canon of <hi>Nice</hi> informs us, That he who shall be excommunicated by one Bishop, shall not be received into Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by another. If any one complained of being unjustly excommunicated, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synod judged thereof, and if this Synod revoked not the Sentence of this Bishop, every one was to hold him Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. 'Tis for that the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> orders, That there should be every where held Provincial Councils twice a year, at <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Autumn.</hi> Our Author main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> doth not ordinarily acknowledge in her Procedures any other Tribunal than the Provincial Synods; except in places, whose ancient Customs were different, as it appears by the following Canon. So that all strange Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is forbidden, by the Fathers of <hi>Nice</hi>; as the Churches of <hi>Africk</hi> maintained it boldly against the Popes. Thence it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That the <hi>British Churches</hi> have a right of absolute judging of all that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, in the Extent of their Jurisdiction, seeing they have no less Priviledges than those of <hi>Africk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For fear this Canon should be contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Bishops, who might have a more extended Jurisdiction, the Council made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which intimates, That according to antient Customs, the Bishop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> should extend his Jurisdiction over
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103507:83"/>
                        <hi>Aegypt, Libya</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis</hi> seeing the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had a like Custom; and so likewise at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and in the other Provinces, the antient Priviledges of Bishops should be kept, that no Bishop should be created, without the consent of the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan; and that when differences should arise, the Plurality of Voices should decide them.</p>
                     <p>There are, according to our Author, three remarkable things in this Canon. 1. A <hi>Confirming</hi> the Priviledges of some of the greatest Bishopricks, as of <hi>Rome, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch.</hi> 2. A securing those of other Churches, against Invasions. 3. <hi>To put out of contestation</hi> the Rights of the Metropolitan Churches. For the last of these three things, it is so clear, that there is no stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at it; but the others, chiefly the second, are much inlarged upon.</p>
                     <p>It seems that the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was the occasion of this <hi>Canon,</hi> and thereby it appears, that the Bishop of the City had a much more extended Jurisdiction, than that of the Metropolitans; seeing it reached over three <hi>Provinces,</hi> named in the Canon, upon which here are divers Remarks, which we shall pass over. Some Learned Men have maintained, that there were no <hi>Patriarchs</hi> in the time of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>; but without disputing about words, Dr. <hi>Sillingfleet</hi> shews by this Canon, and other Proofs, that the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had already before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> a true patriarchal Power over <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and which answered to that of the Governour, named <hi>Praefectus Augusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi> Some pretend, that the Power of this Bishop was only that which commonly the Metropolitans had; because the Provinces of <hi>Aegypt</hi> had no other Metropolitan but him, and depended immediately of him. But tho this Authority was as that of Metropolitans, as to what concerns the manner of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising; it was Patriarchal, in respect of the extent. Such was also that of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had under him no Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans, and who received immediately the Appeals of divers Provinces.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> believes, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> provincially confirmed the custom of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> fearing that if it were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, in remitting to the Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the Supream Authority, as was done for the most part by other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, the <hi>Arians</hi> should draw an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thereby, fearing also that this should draw too much hatred upon the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> if he were named alone, those of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> were added; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing afterwards, these Regulations of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> were abused; several Churches aspired to the Patriarchship, and that of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho' named only upon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pretended that its Universal Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was established therein.

                     <p>The other thing that they principally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, was to preserve the Priviledges of other Churches; for it is known that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions render the Laws more uncontesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in unexcepted Cases; so the Provinces, which are not excepted in this Canon, have a right to govern themselves by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synods, without acknowledging any Superiour Authority: Whence it's conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the <hi>British Churches</hi> ought peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to enjoy this Right, seeing they never have submitted to the Patriarch of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Bishop hath never had the right of Consecrating the Metropolitans, or <hi>British</hi> Bishops, he hath not convocated them to his Assemblies at <hi>Rome,</hi> none of their Synods have been called to him; so that the <hi>British</hi> Provinces have the Right, according to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> of governing themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant of every other Church. It was upon this Principle that the Council of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus</hi> condemned the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who pretended to have right of Consecrating the Metropolitan of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> against the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Custom. The Canon of this Council may be seen, in our Author who defends it against the Carpings of some <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Doctors, and shews the true sense thereof, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly against F. <hi>Martin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding, these same Doctors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the Pope hath always had a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal Power over all the Churches of the <hi>West:</hi> It is granted that he had this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> over the Diocess of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Suburbicary</hi> Provinces; but it is maintained, that it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not any farther, and divers Doctors are refuted who have pretended the contrary. <note n="(p)" place="margin">

As to that which concerns the <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of Metropolitans and Bishops</hi> in all the Western Churches; Mr. <hi>Schelstrate</hi> grants, That it was not exercised by the Pope. His Adversary shews, even that St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> was elected Bishop of <hi>Milan,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking the consent of <hi>Damasus,</hi> who was then Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; indeed the Diocess of <hi>Rome</hi> extended not unto <hi>Milan,</hi> but
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103507:84"/>
comprized only 5 Provinces, or 70 Bishops. Some call these Provinces thus: <hi>Marsi, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania, Thussia, Vmbria,</hi> and <hi>Marchia</hi>; and others thus, <hi>Latium, Valeria, Tuscia, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenum</hi> and <hi>Vmbria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To prove that the Diocess of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> extended further, a Letter from Pope <hi>Syricius</hi> to <hi>Anysius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> is cited where the Latter is declared Legate of the Pope in <hi>Illyria</hi>: But our Author shews at length, that that begun but in the time of <hi>Syricius,</hi> upon the end of the fourth <hi>Age:</hi> and that this Pope did thus, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Grandeur of the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> who extended his Diocess too far; upon which there are Remarks in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that cannot be related here.</p>
                     <p>Tho' the Library of the Pope is obliged to grant, That the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> consecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not all the Western Bishops, he pretends to shew, that before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> he had the power of deposing the Bishops of the <hi>Gauls</hi>: He proves it, by the Example of <hi>Marsian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> who was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Pope <hi>Stephen.</hi> But it appears, That nothing else was desir'd of the Pope in this Rencounter, but to join his Authority to that of the Bishops of the <hi>Gaules</hi>; that act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jointly, the People should the more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly submit to their Order, as appears by the LXVIII Letter of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> wherein he speaks to this Pope as his Equal, exhorting him to do what we have said.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> refutes also two other Proofs of his Adversary, not very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; we shall not stop at 'em, that we may not be tedious.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> maintains, that the Pope could not convocate Councils, but within the extent of the suburbicary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; tho' he denyes not, but on certain singular occasions other Bishops have not been invited to these Councils, as when <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> permitted the Bishops of <hi>Italy</hi> to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Affair of <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Samosatus.</hi> But the Bishops of the Diocess of <hi>Italy,</hi> who acknowledged the Bishop of <hi>Milan</hi> as chief, <note n="(q)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Sirm. App. ad Cad.

                     </p>
                     <p>To prove that the <hi>Pope</hi> had the Right of calling the <hi>Bishops</hi> of all the <hi>West</hi> to all his Patriarchal Councils. Mr. <hi>Schelstrate</hi> relates some Examples of <hi>Bishops</hi> amongst the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who were at some <hi>Roman Councils.</hi> But he is answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That it is no wonder, that some should be found, in extraordinary Rencounters; and that it doth not follow from thence, that the Pope was Patriarch of all the West, no more than that Councils of Western Bishops being held at</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, Arles, Rimini, Sardis, <hi>and elsewhere,</hi> prov'd, <hi>That the Bishops of these Cities were their Patriarchs.</hi> It ought to be shewn, <hi>That the Pope convocated the Bishops of the West, by vertue of his Patriarchal Authority. There was also a great Difference amongst the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils assembled, for the Vnity of Faith and the Discipline of divers Diocesses; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial or Patriarchal Synods, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The last of the Patriarchal Rights was to receive Appeals of the Provinces of the Patriarchship. By these Appeals we must not understand, the free Choice that parties can make for one, to be an Arbitrator of their Differences; but Juridical Appeals, from an inferiour Tribunal to a higher one. It hath oft fallen out that Bishops have been chosen Arbitrators of a common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, to make others agree; or that Bishops intermedled in the Differences of others, without pretending to end them with Authority. Our Author brings <note n="(t)" place="margin">
                           <hi>p.</hi> 128.</note> an Example of a Council of the <hi>Italick Diocess,</hi> who medled with a dissention at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> whereof we have already made mention.</p>

                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:103507:84"/>But to this is opposed, That the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> have several times sent Legates, throughout all the West, to examine the causes of the Bishops, and to make Report of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But we have already taken notice, what Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Answer is to that. He adds here, that the Origine of these pretensions was from this, That the Council of <hi>Sardis,</hi> being exasperated against the <hi>Eastern Bishops,</hi> gave the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> the liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examine some Causes in divers Provinces. He took the occasion from thence of sending Legates, and that was one of the first steps by which he ascended to so great a Power in the <hi>West.</hi> A Doctor of <hi>Sorbone,</hi> who writ some years ago, <hi>de antiquis &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joribus Episcoporum causis,</hi> alloweth, That in the space of CCCXLVII Years, <hi>viz.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of the Council of <hi>Sardis,</hi> no Example of a Cause can be produced, which was referred to <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Bishops who were the Judges thereof.</p>
                     <p>It is besides Objected, That the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> attributes to the Pope <hi>majores Dioe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses</hi>; but it hath been seen by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Council, which has been spoken of, that it was far from acknowledging the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> for Superiour. Besides, there are reasons to believe, that the place where these words are, has been corrupted; and tho' it was not so, this may signifie another thing, except this Bishop had a Diocess more large than his Brethren.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> refutes some more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Mr. <hi>Schelstrate</hi> of small consequence, and relates some places of the Letters <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                     <p>After having ended <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                           <hi>p.</hi> 134.</note> this Controversie, our Prelate shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there is a great likelyhood that some <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were at the Council of <hi>Sardis.</hi> But thence an occasion is taken, to say, that the <hi>British Churches</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the Council of <hi>Sardis,</hi> they are obliged to acknowledge the Pope for the Patriarch of the <hi>West</hi>; seeing this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil hath established the Appeals to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome.</hi> To see if this Objection be of any force, Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> examines the Design and the Proceedings of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil as follows:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Athanasius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> had been deposed by two Synods of <hi>Eastern Bishops,</hi> for some Crimes of which he was accused. He could not hope to have this Judgment reverst in the East, because the <hi>Arian Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> was very strong there; he made his Address to the Bishops of the <hi>West,</hi> and particularly to <hi>Iulius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to the Chief. He desired, that his Process might be reverst, and shewed, by Letters of divers Bishops of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that he had not been heard according to the Forms neither at <hi>Tyre</hi> nor <hi>Antioch,</hi> because of the violence of the Faction of <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Iulius</hi> 
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid. Ep. Iulii ad A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasium.</hi>
                        </note> having communicated his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to his Brethren the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the <hi>West,</hi> writ in their name and his own, to the <hi>Eastern Bishops,</hi> That it was just to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this Cause, by Judges that were not suspected of Partiality; and desired them to go to the places where these Judges should be, with the Informations they had taken against <hi>Athanasius.</hi> The Bishops of the <hi>East</hi> would not hearken to it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon those of the <hi>West</hi> received <hi>Athanasius, Marcellus</hi> and other Bishops of their Party, into their Communion. Those of the <hi>East</hi> were extreamly affronted at it, there were many Complaints on each side, and at last the two Emperours <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> agreed to call a General Council at <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> to decide this Difference. There went Bishops to it from all parts, but the <hi>Western,</hi> Bishops were willing that the deposed Bishops should be admitted to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and take place in the Council; the <hi>Eastern</hi> would not suffer it, and withdrew to <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> where they protested against the Proceedings of <hi>Sardis,</hi> as contrary to the Canons of <hi>Nice.</hi> The Bishops of the <hi>West</hi> notwithstanding continued their Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and made new Canons, to justifie their Conduct. The <hi>Eastern Bishops</hi> complained, that the Discipline established at <hi>Nice,</hi> was manifestly violated; and the <hi>Western Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> said, That there was Injustice done to the deposed Bishops, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> had not been heard in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and that it was just that all the Bishops of the Empire should re-examine this Affair. The Bishops of <hi>Sardis</hi> had no respect to the reasons of their Brethren, they renounced not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and made divers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, the chief of which are the III. the IV. the V. which concern the Revisal of the Causes of Bishops. In the third they declared, that the causes should first come before the Bishops of the Province; and if one of the Parties was grieved by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, he should be granted a <hi>Revision.</hi> Our Author makes divers Remarks upon two Canons of the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to which its commonly believed, that that of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Sardis</hi> has some affinity, which we have spoken of; our Author discovers the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities of the Councils of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Tyre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He also remarks, that to obtain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of an Ecclesiastial cause, an Address was made to the Emperor, who convocated a greater number of Bishops, to make this new Examination. The Council of <hi>Sardis</hi> made an Innovation in this; for it seems,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103507:85"/>
that it took away as much as it could, the Right of reviewing these sorts of Causes from the Emperor, to give it to <hi>Iulius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome, in honour to St.</hi> Peter. He might, by the Authority of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, if he thought fit, Convocate the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the Province, to revise the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and to add Assistant Judges to them, as the Emperor used to do. Besides this, the Fourth Canon enjoyn'd, that no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop should enter into a vacant Bishoprick, by the deposition of him who was in it, nor should undertake to Examin a-new a Process, until the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his Sentence thereupon. The Fifth Canon signifies, That if he judges the Cause worthy of Revising, it belongs to him to send Letters to the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bishops to re-examine; but if he thinks it not fit, the Judgment pronounced shall stand.</p>
                     <p>This is the Power which the Council of <hi>Sardis</hi> grants to the Pope, upon which our Author makes these Remarks.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there was somewhat new in this Authority; without which these Canons would have been useless. Thus <hi>de Marca,</hi> and he who published the Works of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> have established this Power of the <hi>Pope</hi> upon the Canons of the Council of <hi>Sardis.</hi> But an Authority given, by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Council in certain Circumstances, as appears by the name of <hi>Iulius,</hi> which is inserted in the Canon, cannot extend it self to the following Ages; upon the whole, this Authority has changed nature so much, that now it passeth for an Absolute and Supream Power, founded upon a Divine Right, and not upon the Acts of one Council.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. These Canons do not give this Bishop the Right of receiving Appeals in quality of Head of the Church; but transport on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto him the Right of a Revision, which the Emperor enjoyed before, It is a great question if the Council of <hi>Sardis</hi> had the Power of so doing; but there is a great likelihood, that the Protection which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> granted the <hi>Arian</hi> Party, engaged it thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. These Canons cannot justifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of those who should carry Causes to <hi>Rome,</hi> by way of Appeal, because they return the second Examination to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the Province.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Council of <hi>Sardis</hi> it self took knowledge of a Cause, which had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. This Council could not be justified by the antient Canons, in that it received <hi>Marcellus</hi> to the Communion; he, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been Condemned for Heresie, as also afterwards even by <hi>Athanasius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Decrees of this Assembly were not universally received, as it appeared by the Contestations of the Bishops of <hi>Africk</hi> against that of <hi>Rome,</hi> seeing the first knew nothing of it some years after, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor sheweth.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>Arianism</hi> being spread every where, and afterwards <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Celestius</hi> being gone out of <hi>England,</hi> the Clergy of this Isle were accus'd of having been <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Pelagians</hi> in those Ages.

Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Relation which we have cited, was not made on design to justifie the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and to get those of the <hi>Arians</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but to give an Idea of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions, without taking any Party; whereas the design of our Author is, to inform the Publick against the <hi>Arians,</hi> without repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending any thing whatever in the conduct of their Adversaries. And our Author hath not applyed himself so much to the order of years, which he doth not mark; as hath been done in the Life of <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea.</hi>

                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:103507:85"/>Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> goes also further then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, seeing the History of <hi>Arianism</hi> was left off at the death of <hi>Eusebius.</hi> Here is an Abstract of what he adds, and which is chiefly drawn from St. <hi>Athanasius.</hi> The Falsities of the <hi>Arians</hi> were not discovered until after the Council of <hi>Rimini</hi>; and it was chiefly at the Council of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> where they declared themselves more openly. It was then that the Followers of <hi>Basil</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyre,</hi> who rejected the word <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> as well as the <hi>Arians,</hi> would separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from them. But the <hi>Arians</hi> had still recourse, in this occasion, to their old Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and consented to Sign any <hi>Creed</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, excepting that of <hi>Nice.</hi> They cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Athanasius</hi> to be banished a second time; but he was soon re called, and his greatest Enemies were obliged to make him Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he may be believed. A little while after, the Persecution began against him and all the rest, who professed the Faith of <hi>Nice</hi>; as our Author describes at large, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Council of <hi>Rimini,</hi> whose Bishops were constrained to abandon the Terms of <hi>Hypostasis</hi> and <hi>Consubstantial.</hi> The Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Bishops would willingly depose all those who refused to Sign the Symbol of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the <hi>Arians</hi> did not treat their Adversaries better, when they could not prevail with them; so that they ceased not Persecuting each other reciprocally. Councils declared both for the one, and the other, which makes our Author reasonably conclude, that we must not yield to the Authority of any Council whatever, till having well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the reasons of its Conduct. If it was not lawful to do it in times past, the Faith of <hi>Nice</hi> could not be re-established; which would have received an irreparable breach at <hi>Rimini</hi>; if the Orthodox Bishops were not restored to their Churches, after the death of <hi>Constantius,</hi> and had not re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, in smaller Assemblies, what so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous a Council had destroyed. We find a remarkable example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note n="(a)" place="margin">

All that he could obtain, is, that they asked time to consult; and offered afterwards to Answer him in a greater As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly. There were Seven <hi>British</hi> Bishops, and several Learned Men, chiefly of the Monastery of <hi>Bangor,</hi> whereof one named <hi>Dinot</hi> was Abbot. The Result of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly was, That the <hi>Britans</hi> altogether refused to submit to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to <hi>Augustin,</hi> as their Arch-Bishop. It is what <hi>Beda,</hi> whose Authority is indisputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in these matters, relates of this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. It is yet found more at large in a <hi>M. S.</hi> published in the Collection of Mr. <hi>Spelman,</hi> an Antient <hi>Britan,</hi> in <hi>English</hi> and in <hi>Latin.</hi> As there have been some objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made against this History, and this <hi>M S.</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> Answers 'em at the end of this Chapter. Thence he concludes, that the <hi>British Churches</hi> are in the same case, in relation to the Dispute they have with the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Churches of <hi>Cyprus</hi> were, in regard to the Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi>; who would fain be their Patriarch, against their Antient Rights, according to which they had a particular Metropolitan: As the Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> condemned the Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who would extend too far the limits of his Jurisdiction: If the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Pope upon <hi>England</hi> be this day judged by the antient Canons, he shall infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly be condemned, for striving to extend his Patriarchship in places, where he hath not been acknowledged for above 600 years.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103507:87"/>
to be Read, as much for the matters of Critick which are therein treated, as for the moderation which the Author shews up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Controversies, which in his time were agitated amongst the Divines of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; and for several Historical Actions, which may be there learned. To help the Reader to judge of the knowledge of Mr. <hi>Alting,</hi> we shall shew some of the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Subjects, which are treated on in his Letters, or in the Pieces which have not yet been published.</p>
                     <p>The First Dissertation of the Fifth Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tad is Entituled, <hi>de Cabbala Scripturaria</hi>;<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Cabal.</hi> 1. <hi>v. P.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 118.</note> He first seeks for the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology of the word <hi>Cabal,</hi> which is the Name that the <hi>Iews</hi> give to their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and pretends, that even after that God had given his Law by Writing, a kind of an Oral Tradition was conserved in the Church, as long as there were Prophets and Apostles. He adds, that after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> esteem'd another Cabal, which they have equalled, and even preferred to the first, and which is not in the <hi>Talmud</hi>; but in Books a great deal less known; whether the <hi>Iewish</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do keep them hidden, or whether their proper obscurity renders them impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable.</p>
                     <p>In regard to the Practick Cabal, which only serves for Magical Operations, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor entirely disapproves thereof: but as for the Theoretick, where some make Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen sorts, and others Three, as it is a kind of a Symbolick Divinity, he will have it to be treated even as Allegories are. There's a great respect due to Allegories, whereof the Sacred Writers are the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22. But those that have no grounds in Scripture are looked upon with contempt. Mr. <hi>Alting</hi> maintains, that we ought to make this use of the Cabal, and pretends that in the Old Testament there are divers Transpositions, Changes, Additions or Retrenchments of Letters, which have not been without a Mystery. He gives, for example, the change which God himself made, of the Names of <hi>Abram</hi>

                     <p>The Author in this Dissertation makes still many Remarks upon divers proper Names, and other words of the Bible, Written diversly, to shew, that this came not by chance.</p>
                     <p>There are many of these Mystical and surprising Expositions in the Fourth Disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this Heptade, <hi>de arborum fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferarum praeputio, sanctitate &amp; fruitione</hi>; where our Author Answers to the following Questions, according to his Method, <hi>viz.</hi> in relating the Opinion of divers Rabbins, and several Famous Divines, and then his own; These Questions are, Why God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that for the Three first years of a Tree, People should look upon the Fruit of it as polluted, and why he forbid the eating of it? And why he would have the Fruit of the Fourth year dedicated to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? If these Consecrated Fruits belonged only to Priests and Levites, or if all persons which were not polluted, or if all unclean persons might eat of them?</p>
                     <p>The Second Discourse of the Seventh Heptade treats of the Anointing of the Chief Priests and Kings; where the Author menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Opinion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> which believed, that <hi>Moses</hi> only made the Holy Oyl; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the Second Temple there was none of this Oyl, the Vial wherein it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lost with the Ark; which denoted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Alting,</hi> that the Priesthood and Temporal Reign of the <hi>Iews</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, and making room for the Reign and everlasting Priesthood of the <hi>Messia.</hi> This Exposition is founded upon this, That the Chief Priests and Kings of the House of <hi>David</hi> were Consecrated with this Oyl, whose Dignity was hereditary, and descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Children. But for the Officers, whose Charges were not considerable, nor did belong to a certain Family, they were not Anointed. As for the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> after the Schism of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> either they were Anointed, or not; if they were as <hi>Iehu</hi> was, it was with another Oyl, and not with that which was kept in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was much of this Holy Oyl poured upon the Heads of Chief Priests and Kings, to Consecrate them; but the manner of this pouring was different. 'Twas poured round the Head of a King in form of a Crown; and the Forehead of Chief Priests
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103507:87"/>
was Anointed in such a manner, that the Traces of the Oyl expressed the Figure of X. The Rabbins troubled themselves to find out the Reason of this Ceremony; but our Author finds it not hard to discover it in the Truth of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> Sacrificing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the Cross.</p>
                     <p>In a Discourse upon the Leprosie, which is the Fifth of the IX. Heptade, it's asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the <hi>Iews</hi> believe, that the Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie is no Contagious Disease; but an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary one which God inflicted upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain persons, by an effect of his unsearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judgments; which they prove by Seven Reasons.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Pestilential Diseases fall indifferently upon Men and Beasts, but the Leprosie has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver infected a Beast. It's true, that there is talk of the Leprosie of Cloaths and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but it's not well known what that is; and 'tis believed this kind of Contagion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appeared out of <hi>Palestin.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. All Lepers were to present themselves to one Priest, who should carefully examin, and was obliged to search them strictly. But if the Distemper had been Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the Priests would have been exposed to great danger, because the Labour of their Duty, and the Obligation of going bare-foot made them very weak.</item>
                        <item>3. These who were attackt with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, were comers-out amongst the rest of the People, till they were visited by the Priests, and declared Lepers. And this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection was neither made upon the Sabbath, nor Holy-day, that Devotion and Publick Rejoycings might not be hindered. It is not likely that People should tarry so long a time to separate the Pestiferous.</item>
                        <item>4. The Gentiles who were not Proselytes, and who lived in <hi>Canaan,</hi> were not obliged to shew themselves to the Priests, though they were Leprous, and yet they were not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to converse with all the World.</item>
                        <item>5. Those who were suspected to be Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, were shut up in the Field, or even in the Town, and there were only those who were judged Lepers, that were obliged to go out, which if they recovered, were not suffered to enter till after many washings, and other Ceremonies which they were to observe.</item>
                        <item>6. According to the Judgment which the Priest pronounced, a Man was looked upon to be clean or unclean, and so he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with, or his company shunned. But it is not likely that this Sentence rendered a Man more or less Contagious.</item>
                        <item>7. The general Leprosie which covered the whole Body, did not render a Man unclean, because they were declared clean who had all their Body covered with White Leprosie, and in whom there was not a bit of Live flesh to be seen. <hi>Naaman</hi> the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per had several to serve him, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was Minister to the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> which could not be if his Distemper was Contagious. Also the Word <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> 
                           <hi>Tame,</hi> which is spoken of polluted and unclean People, marks only a legal impurity, and is not applyed to them who are Infected with a Contagion.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The Heptades are followed by a small Treatise, entituled, <hi>Sciagraphia Biblica, seu specimen Oeconomiae Patriarcharum.</hi> It is as it were a Historical Abridgment of Divinity, disposed according to the order that is contained in Holy Writ. This Treatise is not ended, because it begins at the Creation, and ends at the Punishment of <hi>Sodom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Letters of Mr. <hi>Alting</hi> are one of the most considerable Pieces of this Volume, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all full of Moderation and Learning. In the Second he proposes some difficulties to Mr. <hi>Wetstein</hi> Professor at <hi>Basil,</hi> who said in one of his Dissertations, that <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>In the Third Letter, which is Written to <hi>Buxtorf</hi> the Son, Mr. <hi>Alting,</hi> to shew that the Sabbath was a Ceremonial Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Figured <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and the Gospel, thus Translates a passage in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 58.13. <hi>If thou call the Sabbath a delight, <gap reason="foreign">

The Author Answers in the 4, 5 and 6th Letters, some difficulties which were made upon the Explication of this passage, and upon <hi>Iob</hi> 11.7.</p>
                     <p>In the Ninth is sought the Origine of this Phrase <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Basar vedam, Flesh and Blood,</hi> which is common in the Rabbins and Writings of the new Testament. The Author believes, that the <hi>Iews</hi> did not begin to make use of it until after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets times, when Philosophy began to be brought in amongst them. They saw some Pagan Philosophers define a man <hi>a compound of Body and Soul,</hi> and searching in their own Tongue for familiar Terms, which would
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103507:88"/>
answer this Definition; they added to the word <hi>Basar</hi> Flesh, by which the Scripture commonly marks Man, &amp; that of <hi>Dam</hi> Blood. Besides the passages of <hi>Genesis</hi> 9. and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 17. where it is said, That <hi>the Blood is the Soul of Beasts</hi>; there are many others by which it appears, that the Soul and Blood are Synonymous, with the sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; so they say in some places, the <hi>Messia has given his Blood,</hi> and in other places, <hi>he has given his Soul to ransom many.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is in the 16.50. a Judgment which deserves our observation; but to know the importance of it, we must know the dispute upon which it was delivered about the end of the Year 1655. There arose a dispute amongst the <hi>Mennonite</hi> Ministers of <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> about the external State of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Christian Church; from Conferences they came to Writings, whereof there were several Copies soon made, and as soon print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The first which appeared upon this Subject was signed by <hi>Gallenus,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Spruit,</hi> who put it into the hands of their Brethren. The 11<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1657. it was digested in Nineteen Articles wherein these two Ministers expounded their Opinion touching the Church, which is to this purpose:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there is but one Church, which is called the Spouse and Body of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and that it was to that alone that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> were made.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> has established in this Church Apostles, Prophets, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, Pastors, and Doctors, and hath given them the Gifts of the Holy Ghost, which guide them infallibly, so that they and their Hearers might be assured they did not err.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That not only the Apostles, but even the inferiour Ministers of the Apostolical Church, and even the Deans, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents after receiving the imposition of hands, were endowed with miraculous Gifts which were necessary for the Exercise of their Charge.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That so the first Ministers had a Right to call themselves <hi>Embassadors of Iesus Christ,</hi> and that the People were obliged to receive them in that Quality.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the Church should fall into an entire Apostacy; that this Prediction should be accomplished soon after the Death of the Apostles, seeing that from the time of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity began to increase, since there were already several Antichrists. One must have but a small insight of Ecclesiastical History, to know that the Zeal of <hi>Christians</hi> cooled a little after, and that they fell from a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missness into a corruption of Manners, from a corruption of Manners into that of Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine: and that instead of the Gifts of the Holy Ghost there was nothing seen to Reign in the Church but the Spirit of Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Tyranny over Consciences, of Schism and Excommunication.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That those who undertook in these late Ages to reform the Church, had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miraculous Gifts nor an Express, not extraordinary Vocation from <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. That to prove that the Assemblies which were held are the true Church, they have only some Arguments drawn from passages of Scripture explained according to the weak Lights of their own reason, or to speak better, according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That there is no Text in the Bible which priviledges a Man who is not inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to form an Assembly, which should call it self the true and only Church of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and should appropriate to it self it's Priviledges, by excluding all others.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. That nevertheless, <hi>Christians</hi> divided themselves into innumerable Sects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the most part excommunicates and condemns the other.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. From all this it's concluded, That one cannot look upon any of these <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> nor the <hi>Ministers</hi> thereof, nor the <hi>Tenets,</hi> nor the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of them, with the same respect which one was obliged to have for the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Apostolical Pastors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. Consequently that these Assemblies have no Right to impose their <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Worship</hi> as a necessary Yoak upon Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor to condemn and excommunicate such as do not the same with them.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. That Baptism and the Supper of the Lord, are Sacraments ordained by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> whose use is very profitable; that the Assemblies of Piety are so likewise, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided their Government be not Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, that they are looked upon as the work of some godly Persons who have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to imitate the model of the Church, which they found in Scripture; and they confess these Institutors were not infallible, and that they left faults in their Works, which they are willing to correct when they are better instructed. This was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Dispute, that then made much noise. One of Mr. <hi>Galenus</hi>'s Brothers answered these Articles, which Mr. <hi>Galenus</hi> had print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Year 1659. with a Reply to his Adversary. In 1660. Mr. <hi>Pontanus,</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Remonstrants at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to examine this Opinion in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise which he made of the visible Church of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> of it's Office and Worship. Without doubt this dispute was spoken of in 1664. seeing one of Mr. <hi>Alting</hi>'s Friends, ask'd him his Opinion upon it, to which this Professor answered:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:103507:88"/>
                        <hi>I do not see that the Opinion of</hi> Galenus, <hi>such as you mention it in your Letter, is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable; it would be in vain now to search the form of the Apostolical Church, and the Gifts which the Apostles conferred by imposition of hands. I remember I told you that we have a Faith which makes us uncapable of receiving Gifts. As we believe that the Signs which according to the Promise of Iesus Christ,</hi> Mark 16.17, 18. <hi>should accompany the Faithful,</hi> viz. <hi>the gift of Miracles, the gift of Tongues, and of Prophecy, have ceased in the Church, then it is not strange, that they descend not to us. In the Opinion of some Men, this Faith and it's Efficacy, lasted not as long as the first Age: It wou'd distract us to find out the Signs of it in such distant times; after this, I do not admire that most Doctors have taken so different ways, and that like Painters they have drawn more or less near after the model of the Apostles, according as their Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was fine or gross. Thence sprung so many different Churches, to which were given the names of their Doctors, as commonly the names of Painters are given to their most excellent pieces. It's true, that there are some far better than others: but there are none but please some people so much, that they despise and condemn sometimes all other Churches, how little soever they differ from theirs. It's an evil that could only be deplored hitherto, and God only knoweth when it will be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died: When he is pleased to give us this Faith which we have lost, he will give us it's Fruits, and 'tis then we shall be the Image of the Primitive Church. In the mean time, we must preserve, and endeavour to preserve and increase the Faith we have, which is that of Tenets, and which may conduct us to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, notwithstanding the faults of the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour form and Government of the Church.</hi>

                     <p>In the 45.50. Mr. <hi>Alting</hi> proves the necessity of studying the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue against a Professor who durst maintain in his Publick Lessons that that Tongue was not necessary for Ministers, nor for Students in Divinity, because St. <hi>Augustine</hi> and all the Doctors of his time were ignorant of it, except St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> who drew upon himself the hatred of all his Contemporaries.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Perizonius</hi> designing to refute <hi>Spinosa,</hi> consulted Mr. <hi>Alting</hi> upon some difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which our Professor resolves in his 59. and 50. The first relates to the Authors of the Canon of the Old Testament; and 'tis asked whether it was <hi>Esdras?</hi> Mr. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> saith,
<q>That 'tis commonly believed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Testimony of <hi>Buxtorf</hi> who assures us in his <hi>Tyberiade,</hi> That the Members of the great Synagogue assembled to bring into one Body the <hi>Canonical Books,</hi> and that <hi>Esdras</hi> presided in that Assembly, and that the three last Prophets were there accompanied with <hi>Mordocheus.</hi> But <hi>Gans David</hi> remarks that <hi>Simeon</hi> the Just, who is said to have been the last of the Assembly of this great Synagogue, lived eight Generations after <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah,</hi> Son to <hi>Iosadack.</hi> Add to this, that there is no likelyhood that <hi>Malachy</hi> was Contemporary with <hi>Esdras,</hi> since he doth not speak of the rebuilding of the Temple nor return of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that he chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sticks to reprehend the Priests, who corrupted the Law by their Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: So that this Prophet seems to have lived about the time of <hi>Hillel,</hi> when the Sect of the Pharisees began to flourish, and their Traditions to be in Vogue. <hi>Parker</hi> has remarked, that the Fathers of the Church pass'd for Apostolical Traditions, customs established by long use, whereof the first Author was not known, and to which they had a mind to give some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The same Remark may be made concerning the <hi>Iews.</hi> There were amongst them Institutions, whereof the Authors were uncertain, which they attributed to the Members of the great Synagogue, and made them come from inspired Men, which were but Traditions of the Pharisees. The Members of the Synagogue never lived in the same time, nor in the same place, and that consequently there never hath been such an one. It is an invention of the Sticklers for Tradition, to give some like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood to their System.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second difficulty regards the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Iews</hi> who returned from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem. Esdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> agree in a Total Sum, which was 42360. but when we our selves will muster up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of each Family, there will be only found 29818 in <hi>Esdras</hi> and 31089 in <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> There is yet this thing remarkable, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> mentions 1765 Persons, which are not in <hi>Esdras,</hi> and that <hi>Esdras</hi> has 494, whereof <hi>Nehemiah</hi> doth not all speak. The Difference that seems to make it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to reconcile these two Authors, is what makes them agree; for if you add the Over-plus of <hi>Esdras</hi> to the number of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and the Surplus of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to that of <hi>Esdras,</hi> the same Number will come of them both.</p>

                     <p>In the sixtieth Letter our Author makes the History of the Canon of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
<q>
                           <hi>Moses,</hi> saith he, committed the keeping of his Books to the <hi>Levites, Deut.</hi> 31.25. and the following, and created them as 'twere Doctors of the People.</q>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxiii.10. And it seems that <hi>Malacby</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to this charge, Ch. 2. vers. 4, 5, 6, 7. Yet these Doctors did not much increase this <hi>Bibliotheque</hi> until the time of <hi>David.</hi> The Prince assisted with some Prophets, divided the Priests and Levites into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Classes, who were to serve by turns: But this Order was the cause of a great confusion amongst the holy Levites, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of none took care, but when his turn was come. Thence proceeds the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is remarked in the Collection of the <hi>Psalms: David</hi> gave them to the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103507:89"/>
Levites, who were in their Week, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he composed them; each Classis kept those which had been remitted to it: In fine, there was a Collection made, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together what each Classis had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, without having regard to the Order or time in which they were Written. The same thing sometimes hapened, in regard to the Sermons of the <hi>Prophets, Habac.</hi> 2.2; which having been intrusted to divers Priests, were gathered, according to this Method, and put into the number of the Sacred Books. As in the time of <hi>Malachy,</hi> they began to have too much esteem for Traditions, and to attribute unto them an Authority, which weakned that of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writings; this Prophet discover'd the Imposition of the <hi>Levites,</hi> who gave way to these Traditions <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                              <hi>Malac.</hi> 2.8, 9.</note> because it augmented their credit. He prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, for the future, that any Writing whatever should be put into the Sacred Volumes upon their Word, and before it had been compared with the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> 
                           <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                              <hi>Malach.</hi> 4.4.</note> which he would have to be as the Rule to all Books: Thence it cometh, that after him nothing was added to the Canon of the Holy Writings. I cannot believe that this was done by the advice or order of some Ecclesiastical Assembly. There are no Footsteps of these sorts of Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in Scripture, and 'tis evident that God would not suffer that there should be any; least it should be thought, that the Authority of his Word depended on the Will of Man; or that the Church, under this pretence, should attribute to it self the right of Pronouncing upon the Canon, and to reject, or admit the Books, as it should think fit. If the Church had this power, there are many Prophetical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which we should miss: undoubtedly we should not have the Prophesies of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> to whom the whole Colledge of Priests, and all the ordinary Prophets were opposed; and it is absurd to say, that the Church had this Power one time, and not another. God gave Credit enough to <hi>Moses,</hi> in speaking to him in the sight of all <hi>Israel, Exod. xix.</hi> 14. and his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings never wanted the Authority of any Assembly to be received. As to the other Prophets, Do you ask how their Books were received, or how they have been preserved? It is a conduct of Providence, which I adore without comprehending its ways. It hath not yet been proved that we owe this obligation to the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> or <hi>Rabbins</hi> in particular. It is to the Jewish People in General that St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives the Title of <hi>Depositors</hi> of the Divine Oracles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</q>

Yet we are not more charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the choice of things, than with the pleasant turn, and refined manner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are united, and which will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well bear a second or third review by the <hi>Reader.</hi> As the Definition of an <hi>Art</hi> is, <hi>the manner of well-doing a thing</hi>; so this Work seems, at first sight, to be the same thing with a <hi>French Logick,</hi> attributed to the Gentlemen of the <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> and Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The Art of Thinking.</hi> Wherefore Father <hi>Bouhours</hi> thought himself obliged to say in a <hi>Preface,</hi> That his Object was different, and that he hath not proposed the Teaching how to form <hi>Ratiocinations,</hi> with all the exactness that Reason requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, assisted with Reflections and Precepts; but that his end was to observe those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Sentiments which are called <hi>Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as it has a relation to the <hi>Operations</hi> of the Mind. So that one regardeth exact Reason, and the other a good Relish and Fine Wit. The Two Persons that are to maintain the Four Dialogues, whereof this Work is composed, are adorned with all the Gifts which can render Conversation Ingenious and Sparkling. <hi>Science</hi> hath not spoiled them, nor have they much less Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteness than Learning. The Judgment of the one is good, and nothing pleaseth him but what's Reasonable and Natural: And all that is Glittering and Bright charms the other. It's this difference of their Judgments which is the Subject of their Dispute. If there should a new <hi>Cleanthes</hi> arise, he would perhaps find that Father <hi>Bouhours</hi> could as well say, without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, that he himself hath all the Good Qualities, seeing he is here both <hi>Eudoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Philanthus,</hi> as he formerly was <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> and <hi>Eugenius.</hi> In short, unfold the matter (to wit) blot out those imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Names, and the <hi>Elogiums</hi> run immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately back to the Author. This severe Critick would perhaps let go some fine Raillery, because Father <hi>Bouhours</hi> makes the Conversation proceed <hi>from the doubts upon the French Tongue proposed to the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy by a Country Gentleman. Philanthus</hi> found his Friend intent upon this Book, and the business could neither be more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103507:90"/>
nor more necessary to the will of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bouhours.</hi> But this place ought not to be examined with rigour. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of a Father left him, and he could not retain his love for this expos'd Child, which beareth not the Name of him that gave it Birth. Do we not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the Transports of a Mother for her Infant, because of Nature? This secret power draweth us as 'twere against our Will, and possesseth all the affections of our hearts.</p>
                     <p>The first Thought that falls under the Censure of Father <hi>Bouhours,</hi> is that of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> in this Verse so famous;
<q>
                           <l>Victrix causa Diis placuit; sed victa Catoni.</l>
                           <l>The Gods serve <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> follows <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey.</hi>
                           </l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He saith, That notwithstanding the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorers of this <hi>Poet,</hi> it hath only a fine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; and that when it's examin'd into, it is no good Sense. For it represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Gods upholding the Unjust Party, as was that of <hi>Caesar,</hi> who Sacrificed his Countrey to his Ambition, and Oppressed the Publick Liberty. But good Sense will suffer the Gods to approve of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice of an Usurper. And <hi>Cato</hi> being a Man of worth, according to the <hi>Poet,</hi> there is no reason to oppose him to the Gods, and to give him even the advantage over them. That would destroy his Character of Vertue. Notwithstanding, the Friends of <hi>Lucan</hi> might say, that his Thought shou'd be examined by the Spirit that reigned then amongst the Heathen. The Pagans, far from making any scruple to put their Gods in the unjust Party, made use of a way, in relation to them, which was not the most respectful in the World: On the contrary, they would sling them out of the Windows when they were not well satisfied with them; and it hath been observed, that <hi>Alexander</hi> was so angry because they had let <hi>Hephestion</hi> dye, that after having said a Thousand Injurious things to them, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed their Altars. According to this opinion of Father <hi>Bouhours</hi>'s, there is no good Sense in all the <hi>Aeneids</hi> of <hi>Virgil.</hi> For one of the finest places is the Anger of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> who persecuteth pious <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly resolveth the loss of so good a Man, in a passion, because <hi>Paris</hi> did not think her handsome. As for <hi>Cato,</hi> all the World knows, that those who were educated as he was in the Opinions of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> had not a Piety so exact. <hi>Seneca</hi> would say bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That the Prosperity of</hi> Sylla <hi>was the crime of the Gods.</hi> The quality of Honest Man that was given to <hi>Cato,</hi> regardeth only his unshaken Love for the Publick Liberty and Good wherewith he was animated. So the <hi>Poet</hi> that makes him a Hero upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, by a noble and bold thought, puts the resolution of <hi>Cato</hi> in ballance with the Power of the Gods, and the Fortune of <hi>Caesar.</hi> The <hi>Reader</hi> charmed with so fine a stroak, doth not stand to decide the Quarrel of <hi>Caesar</hi> with <hi>Pompey,</hi> nor to examin, <hi>which of the two had most justly unsheathed his sword.</hi> Father <hi>Bouhours,</hi> after having marked that <hi>Breboeus</hi> mistook the Sense of <hi>Lucan,</hi> and that he has been a little remiss in this place; begins to give Rules to discover a <hi>True Thought.</hi> He saith, That it ought to be Natural, and far from those Lustres which have no Solidity; that it ought to be a faithful Image of the Thing it Represents, and always founded upon Truth. Not but that a Thought which runs upon a Fiction, may be Just, provided it be autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised in the Fable: but the points of Wit which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Vivezze d'ingegno,</hi> are not agreeable to the Judgment of this Age. <hi>Metaphors</hi> well placed produce a handsom effect; and they are very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously compared to Transparent Vails, which let us see what they cover. The Author disapproveth not Equivocations: For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, this of Mr. <hi>Voiture,</hi> in favour of the Coachman that had overturned Cardinal <hi>Mazarin. He thought he could hazard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in overturning you,</hi> saith he to him, <hi>because you always fall upon your feet.</hi> The true sense of this Equivocation was, that nothing overturned either his Designs or Fortune, and that his Wit was still in the same scituation, and drew him out of the most entangling Affairs. But if the Reputation of Mr. <hi>de Voiture</hi> made it be approved in that time, we may doubt it wou'd not now have the same success. Our Age; delicate even to a scruple, loves not the Games of Wit, wherein Ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty makes all the Finery; wherefore he adds here, that they become nauseous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipid, even at the very instant that we think to gain credit by 'em. A mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearance that forms a double sense, causes a secret despite; when having sought long to find the true meaning, we perceive it to be a thing of so little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> so dear to the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> have a little more credit, provided there is nothing excessive in them. For Vertue it self ceaseth from being so, as soon as it runs into Extremities: and it was permitted to Mr. <hi>de Balzack</hi> only to speak with a Grave Tone things that were extream. If they are too harsh, they must be sweetned with Terms, and so prepare the Mind for it, that it might not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to revolt. Notwithstanding they lye, according to <hi>Quintillian,</hi> without decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and lead to Truth by a Lye; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause something on't is always abated, and the intent of it is reduced to a reasonable Sense. And if the exactness of thoughts makes the beauty of the Work, we must not be litigious with a Sporting Writer, who, in a small debauch of Wit, speaks a World of Follies to please himself. Then too much strictness would be a Fault. And as a Woman ought not to be regularly dressed but for Ceremonious days, so the'yre
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103507:91"/>
only grave and important Pieces, where all ought to be in the utmost exactness.</p>
                     <p>After that, the Author relates Examples of false Thoughts, that he has drawn (if our Conjecture be true) from <hi>Essays of Morality.</hi> He condemns much this Moral Reflection: <hi>When Ignorant Persons see these great Libraries, they imagine a Man happy, or capable to know all that was contained in these Collection of Volumes, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider as Treasures of Light. But they are mistaken; for if all that shou'd be reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one head only, it would not either be more Regular, or more Wise: It would but augment its Confusion, and darken its Light.</hi> Yet the Fancy is neither altogether just, nor altogether false. For if there are Wits capable of disintangling all these Idea's; there are a great many more to whom Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth but produce disorder and obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And, as the design is to make Men perceive the unprofitableness and vanity of Human Sciences, there was no great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of pushing the Reflection a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Truth. Father <hi>Bouhours</hi> also condemneth the false Motions of Preachers. He Laughs at him, who, examining the Reason why <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, first appeared to <hi>Mary,</hi> saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That it was because God would have the Mystery of his Rising to be Publick, and that a Secret of this Importance, in the hands of a Woman, would speedily be spread every where. He maintains, that if Custom hath authorised, in Profane Works, such Thoughts, as make <hi>Fortune</hi> enter in the shape of a Person, that is like the trifling and Chimerical Divinity which the Pagans thought presided over Events, and dispensed Good or Evil, according to its Capriciousness; it ought now to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, because it savors too much of the Fable, and Paganism. After which he merrily proposeth this Question, Whether we may, with exactness, say, <hi>That the Heart is more ingenious than the Mind</hi>? But why should it not be said, Seeing those that Love have their sight more fine, and quick, than the most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive persons? Nothing escapes Love, it refines above all things, and knows how to deceive the most clear-sighted. This op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Heart and Mind may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry delicatly applyed: And can there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing juster than this, <hi>The Mind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not personate the Heart very long?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the beginning of the Second Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, the Author gives us to observe, That from the Elevation of our Thoughts shou'd proceed a certain Sublimity, that transporteth even to ravishment. He cites this Magnificent Elogy that <hi>Seneca</hi> gives to <hi>Cicero, That he is the onely Wit that the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>had equal to their Empire:</hi> and this of <hi>Horace; That</hi> Caesar <hi>brought into subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the whole Vniverse, except the fierce and invincible Soul of</hi> Cato.</p>
                     <p>After this, is a long Chain of Passages of divers Authors, and a very Polite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the finest places of <hi>Tatius.</hi> He shews, that this Poet robbed others; but that sometimes he so pleasantly stole from them, that his Thefts were pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Father <hi>Bouhours</hi> ingenuously confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that he's not violent for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients; and it's easily seen that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns have very much Charmed him. Wherefore he rangeth himself in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of Chancellor <hi>Bacon,</hi> who said, That the Antiquity of Ages was the Youth of the World; and that in Accounting justly, we are properly the Antients. Those that will be willing to determin of his Judgment, may do it by examining the Choice of such Thoughts as he cites for Examples of Nobility and Majesty. In this great number, the Praises of the King are not omitted. It is, say they, a Noble Thought, to tell him, <hi>That he hath the Looks of a Hero; and that if the Title of Majesty was not due to his Rank, it would be to his Person: That he is not like those, that would be Nothing if they ceased to be Kings: but that the Hero is greater in him than the King, and that there is nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Dignity but his Merit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We shall add, that in the high Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Kings are placed, they seldom tast, without mixture, the pleasure of being Praised, because it may be perplexed with this unquiet Thought, that in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons is not adored the Fortune whereof they are Masters; and by this Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so Judicious in a Prince: <hi>I should be proud of the Praises that are given me, if those that give them to me durst tell me the contrary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Comparisons also produce a handsom ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, where they are rich and noble, well chosen, and borrowed from the greatest Subjects of Nature and Art. They must not be too bold, neither ought they also to be condemned with too much precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; because with them often it is the same, as with those Pictures; where that which seems at first to offend the sight, by strokes too strong and particular, is a happy boldness, and a Master-piece of Work in the eyes of understanding Men.</p>
                     <p>In the matter of Comparisons it's said, that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> said one day, after having read the Lives of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> and St. <hi>Xavier</hi>; St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> Caesar <hi>who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any thing without good Reasons:</hi> St. <hi>Xavier</hi> Alexander <hi>whose Courage hurry'd him away sometimes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Author ravished with so happy a Comparison, finds a wonderful Relation between the Character of these <hi>Two Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Men,</hi> and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his fine Atchievement in Arms, and in leaving the World, he lost not his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Ideas: On the contrary, he conceived the Affairs of God under these Martial I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, whereof his head was filled; and <hi>it was in the Meditation of the Two Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards that he formed the Draught of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in the same Mind he gave it a WARLIKE NAME, calling it the Society of Iesus.</hi> As for St. <hi>Xavier,</hi> as he has made many Evangelical Conquests in the <hi>Indies,</hi> so there is no Injustice in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Conqueror of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>; both having always followed the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour that animated them, without being frightned at the perils inseparable from great Designs. But both have sometimes suffered themselves to be transported with their Courage, and have almost passed the bounds of Heroick Vertue. Can there be any thing more Noble, or that can give a higher and more magnificent Idea of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, than to make these Two Founders e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with these Two Heroes, who have brought the World under their Yoak, and founded the Two Greatest Empires in the World? We must not therefore wonder, if the <hi>ORDER</hi> have kept the Spirit of CONQUERING, and this Warlike Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that makes People submit to it.</p>
                     <p>To awake the Mind of the <hi>Reader,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bouhours</hi> observes, that the <hi>Gallant Strain hath its Licences</hi> as well as the <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi> He gives a Picture, (or rather Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation) of the Despair of the unfortunate <hi>Dido,</hi> and of the Habitation of Lovers in Hell. <hi>Virgil</hi> seats them in places besprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Tears, and in Solitudes under the shadow of Myrtles; because Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does not abandon them even in the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Death. He confesseth, that his heart is touched with this Thought, and that nothing makes us more sensible, how far this foolish Passion reacheth. He very gallantly Laugheth at the folly of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> who went in search of his Wife even to Hell. The Torments of the Unhappy were suspended, according to his Opinion, more by the surprise that this Husband gave by his New Enterprise, than by his Melodious Voice: And the God of Hell, being touched to see him re-enter into such hard bonds, snatched his Wife from his hands to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense his Musick.</p>
                     <p>After the Thoughts of Pleasantness, Men pass to those that are delicate; <hi>If you ask of me</hi> (saith he) <hi>what delicateness of Meat or Musick is, it would not be hard to content you:</hi> But I do not know where I should meet with Terms to expound a delicate Thought. It sufficeth not to say, it is the finest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, and even the most Curious Piece of Wit; it must be added, that it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Sence, which is not visible enough to transport us of a sudden. It resembleth not those Sheperdesses, whereof the great Strokes offer themselves immediatly to our eyes; but such Master-pieces, where Nature worketh by little, and whose Matter and Structure, almost imperceptible, make us doubt whether it hath a design to shew, or hide its Address. For an Example of this Delicacy, which leaves more to be Thought on than is said, we'll cite this place of Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio; The Illustrious Birth and great Merit of the Marquiss of</hi> Spinola <hi>made him a Grandee of</hi> Spain <hi>before he was so.</hi> Is not here a little Point and Game of Wit rather than Delicateness? This Stroak of the <hi>Panegyrist</hi> of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Great appears more fine. <hi>You have,</hi> saith he to him, <hi>so acted, that no Man thinks himself Conquered when you are Victorious:</hi> and that of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that makes <hi>Sabina</hi> say, being divided betwixt her Love to her Husband <hi>Horatius,</hi> and her Tenderness for her Brother <hi>Curiatius</hi>;
<q>
                           <l>I fear our Victory as much as our Loss:</l>
                           <l>
                              <hi>Rome,</hi> if thou complainest that this is to betray thee,</l>
                           <l>Make thy self Enemies that I can hate.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Application of these two last lines to a Catholick who had changed his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to Espouse a <hi>Huguenotish</hi> Woman, I believe is no less delicate than the Thought it self. It's a great Art continues the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to know how to Praise well; and no kind of Eloquence requires turns so delicate as this. A gross Praise, that is, a Praise that is affected, or strain'd, and which is in no wise conceal'd, makes Rational Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons ashamed. A false Praise renders those ridiculous that are praised; Whilst the Praises that are acute flatter their Self-love, and satisfie their Vanity.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning of the Third Dialogue is his Criticks upon Thoughts, wherein too much Affectation and Art appears. 'Tis a defect that costs much: But the <hi>Reader</hi> loves not to perceive the Work of the Author, and will not have us shew him all the efforts that we make to please him. He imagins, that we would ravish his approbation. A Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Discourse (if I may use the Expression) and too exact, as much displeaseth delicate Minds, as high flights displease Men of a good Judgment. Artifice spoileth Nature. A Thought is vitious in a sublime strain, when it is too far sought, and too much extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. True Greatness ought to have Just Measures: or to express our selves more Figuratively, A Discourse, like to a River, quiet in its Course, should not overflow, nor become of a sudden an impetuous Torrent, which produceth a Noise, and falls into Precipices. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are lovers of these Foppish Thoughts, and Chymerical Pomp, which they insert with so much Pride into their Works.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lucan</hi> also sometimes raiseth things a little too high, and beyond their Nature.

Is there not an excess in this Flattery, wherewith he treated <hi>Nero?</hi> For after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lamented the evils of the Civil War, he again cryes out, <hi>But if the Destinies wou'd not give</hi> Nero <hi>to the World, but only in lieu of so many Evils, let us no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of any thing, we are very willing to buy him at that price.</hi>

                     <q>
                        <l>Iam nihil, O superi, querimur, scelera ista nefasque</l>

                     <p>It's likewise a Vice to affect too much Finery in Ornaments, and it often happens that we Please not, for having too much Wit. For Example, these Verses are drawn from a Treatise, which hath passed for a Master-piece, and where the Author Paints a Fountain:
<q>
                           <l>Within this Grove a Liquid Cristal Glides,</l>
                           <l>Which like a Mirror made of Frozen Glass,</l>
                           <l>Shews every Passenger his Mien and Face.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is nothing natural in this. On the contrary it may be said, that it would be finer if it were less, and that it were better a Thought should be a little more Dim, than to be so bright. It is sufficient to adorn, without setting it off with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny false colours. <hi>Seneca</hi> the Tragedian of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten falls into this Fault. He's so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid lest a fine Thought should escape the Hearer, than he sets it off with all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours that can render it pleasing. Prest on by the heat of his imagination he will have every thing sparkling in his Works. But it's a sign of great Wit to stop, and know how to make an end when it's necessary. The Passions, of all things, will not be too ingenious. The agitation they cause suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no motions that are exquisite, for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expounds it self more simply. In fine, Men Preach too acutely, because the Thought being too much refined, degenerates into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, and evaporation. It is with them, as with Works that are over-fine, which have no solidity, and where Art is no more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, because there is too much on't. The Author upon this proceeds to <hi>Tacitus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his reflections are too refined. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is a Mystery with him, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates not things as they fell out, but as he imagines they might have been. <hi>That is the Turn,</hi> addeth he, <hi>that pleaseth one of those Apes of</hi> Tacitus, <hi>who thinks to be as great in counterfeiting him, and in giving us noble Idea's which his Imagination furnisheth him with, as also Political Mysteries forged by his own brain, which he hath added to his</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Dialogue is design'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to us the care we ought to have for neatness of phrase. The Mind is not agreeably touch'd, when 'tis put to too much trouble to clear the obscurity of the thought. He shews here, the difference betwixt <hi>Gallima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Phoebus. Gallimatius</hi> (says he) is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, and dark on every side, <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> is less obscure, and seems to signifie something fine. Doth it belong to <hi>Phoebus</hi> to call the Long Robes of Women, <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole's of Cloth?</hi> The Author relates the unimitable Models of <hi>Gallimatius,</hi> and the Abbot of St. <hi>Cyran</hi> furnished him with the chief of 'em. The Adorers of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> have invented a most honourable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to excuse his obscurity. They said, that the Ambition of <hi>Alexander</hi> could not endure that all the World should know as much as he did; and that these Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways produc'd more veneration to the sublimity of the Matter. But why should any one Write when he has no mind to be understood? He thinks that this Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not well displayed, how fine soever it appears: <hi>Gravity is a Mystery of the Body, invented to hide the faults of the Mind.</hi> These Terms, a Mystery of the Body, are not altogether intelligible. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Thoughts resemble those Pits, whose depth surprizeth the Sight; or such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as have always their Masks on their Faces, so that they cannot be known.</p>
                     <p>Is not this to lead the Reader into by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, where perpetual Night Reigneth, or at least a very dull day? There are besides so great a number of fine things mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Work, that it appears to be made only for the Imagination, and to please the Ears; that one is dazled with the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Objects. It must be granted that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bouhours</hi> had the advantage of Youth in his Age, for he appears as Polite and Sparkling as in the Dialogues of <hi>Aristus</hi> and <hi>Eugenius,</hi> which was Writ Twenty years before. His Wit hath always the same advantages, and resembles not in any thing the Melancholly common to Old Age, which is an Enemy to the Graces and Charms of Raillery, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that it no longer becomes it: A great Wit, once said, that an Honest Man ought to be of all Professions, and to make no shew of his own. And here he may be pleas'd, for the Author does it without discovering his.</p>

                     <p>THis is a Second Work of Father <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet</hi>'s, who, after having given in his First Treatise an exact Idea of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the Famous <hi>Confucius,</hi> and of the Principal Sciences of the <hi>Chinois,</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in this, to instruct us in the Life and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103507:92"/>
excellent qualities of a Christian Lady of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi> to which he adds the Relation of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and particular Intreagues of some of the Missionaries, and of the Establishment of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> in this great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                     <p>Yet he first declares, that he pretends only to give here an Abridgment of the Life of this Illustrious Lady; and that he intends to edifie the Publick by a more Ample Relation of her Vertuous Actions; which if we Judge of them by this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment, ought to be very surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and the worthy Subject of an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theose.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Author begins his History with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, in a few words, who were the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors of this <hi>Heroine</hi>; their Life, their Manners, their Employments, and their happy Calling to <hi>Christianity,</hi> in spight of the blind Error and Idolatry wherein they were plunged for so long a time.</p>
                     <p>He insists most a Discourse upon <hi>Paul Siu,</hi> her Grandfather, who, he says, was not only the Introducer and Protector of the Missionaries at the Emperor of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s Court, but also the Apostle and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of his Nation, by the Translation of several Books and Treatises of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, and even by the Learned Apologies he made in its favour in the <hi>Chinoise</hi> Language.</p>
                     <p>He observes that <hi>Paul Siu</hi> was one of the <hi>Colao,</hi> which are the Chief Ministers of State, and the Great Officers of the Empire. From whence he takes occasion to speak of <hi>Matthew Riccius</hi> and <hi>Adam Schall</hi> Jesuites, and of their Entry into the Court of <hi>China,</hi> which was effected by the means of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and Reformation of the Calendar they undertook, whereof he relates the Particulars: adding, that after Five years labour of these good Missionaries, <hi>Paul Siu</hi> took the pains to Revise and Translate into his Tongue their Works, with all the Elegance that could be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the most able and intelligent Man of all <hi>China:</hi> Which sufficiently shews, that no Science ought to be neglected: since the simplicity of Evangelical Doctrine would have rendered useless the important projects of this Mission, if it had not been upheld by Astronomy, to which, with the Protection of this Great Minister, it owes its Establishment.</p>
                     <p>After that, the Author comes to the particulars of the Life, and Pious Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Grand-Daughter of <hi>Paul Siu,</hi> which he makes to consist almost wholly in Alms, building of Churches, and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Chapels, the particular Chapter of the Missionaries, which they commonly imbellish with the most pathetick Figures to touch the Consciences, and inspire the most harden'd hearts with compassion.</p>
                     <p>Yet that nothing might be objected against the great Liberalities of this Lady, who was a Widow indeed, but had many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; he saith, that her Work, and that of her Daughters, was sufficient to have furnished all her Charities, which were so prodigious, that at one time she gave 220000 Livers to the Jesuits. She was so scrupulous, that she could not suffer her Son to Employ for the Maintaining of the Mission, the Money he got by his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: fearing lest what he got in the Tribunals of Justice, should not be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by lawful means.</p>
                     <p>This Example would be dangerous to be proposed, if our Devotee's in the West had such tender Consciences on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as the Proselytes of the East.</p>
                     <p>He afterwards Treats of the different Congregations that were established in the Provinces of <hi>China,</hi> on the account of this Christian Lady, who is the Mother and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactress thereof; and plentifully fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes them with Pictures of the Passion, Images, Beads, <hi>Agm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s Dei's,</hi> Crosses, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, and other such things as may serve to the Instruction of New Converts.</p>
                     <p>And on this occasion he makes mention of the Conversion of the <hi>Bonzes,</hi> which would easily be effected in giving each Thirty Crowns a year, since the fear on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of seeing themselves miserable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd, hinders them from embracing the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> whereof in their hearts they acknowledge the Excellency and Truth.</p>
                     <p>These are the Efficacious Means with which our Modern Apostles Convert Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans as well as Hereticks. But it's much to be feared that this Character of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest does not agree with that of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>This was not the Motive to Madam <hi>Hiu</hi> (which was the Name of this <hi>Christian</hi> Lady.) The Fervor of her Zeal did not permit her to be one moment at rest. She went from City to City, and from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to Province, to re-establish desolate Churches, to build new ones, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, in all places, for the wants, and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Missionaries and new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts.</p>
                     <p>Her indefatigable cares were very useful in the time of a great Persecution, which arose against them in 1664, which Father <hi>Couplet</hi> gives here the particulars of.</p>
                     <p>They were accused of Inspiring into the People a Spirit of Rebellion; and of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103507:93"/>
persuading them to change their Religion; a Capital Crime in this Kingdom: and they would infallibly have suffered the rage of their Enemies, had it not been for divers Prodigies that appeared in their favour, and which the Reiterated Prayers of Madam <hi>Hiu</hi> obtained from Heaven.</p>
                     <p>We must not wonder at it, since her Devotion was so great, and so universal: she observed all Duties of Piety, from the least unto the greatest, which she acquitted admirably well.</p>
                     <p>Never was there a Life better employ'd. Women, Children, Old Men, the Poor, and chiefly the Jesuites, were the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Objects of her Care and Charity, without interrupting thereby her particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Exercises of Meditation and Prayer, which she Addressed to the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, to whom she Devoted her self.</p>
                     <p>From whence the Author takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to give us an account of the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Christians</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> which hath scarcely any other object but the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> the <hi>Angels,</hi> St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and Saint <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> and consists entirely in the frequent Rehearsal of <hi>Litanies,</hi> and upon the number and measure of sundry Adorations, and Reiterated Genuflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is as much as to say a kind of Idolatry, disguised under the Name of Christianity.</p>
                     <p>This Remnant of Pagan Superstition disperses it self through all their Acts of Religion, but particularly their Funeral Pomps, in which they express an ardent zeal to make them very Magnificent, for their Parents and Friends; whose Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Ceremonies last many years after their death. This is it wherein the Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners have not had any great need of their Complaisance.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Couplet</hi> therefore confesseth, that these Funeral days of <hi>Christians</hi> are days of Triumph for Religion; and that the Magnificence of the Images wherewith they adorn them, the Wax-Candles, the Perfumes and Incenses they imploy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, make the <hi>Chinois</hi> look on them with admiration, and as People of a singular Piety.</p>
                     <p>They have found by the Advice of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Hiu,</hi> the Secret of entring into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Provinces, where they never had any establishment; in burying there the Bodies of some of the Fathers of their Mission, having first asked leave to perform their last du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to them, which lasteth as long as the Devotion of Parents finds it convenient, and often as long as they live.</p>
                     <p>Upon this Subject the Author gives us an Account of a Stone Table adorned with the Figure of the Cross, and several <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> and <hi>Syriack</hi> Inscriptions, which were taken out of the Earth in 1625, in the Province of <hi>Kin-si.</hi> He pretends that the Names of Seventy Preachers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which went from <hi>Palestine</hi> into <hi>China,</hi> in the year 636, are Engraven thereupon, and amongst others those of some Bishops: which he pretends are an Authentick Testimony of their Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit, its Antiquity is considerable, and if the Truth on't was called into Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, that joyned to what I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, would suffice to shew, how Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous the Devotion is, when the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith is questionable.</p>
                     <p>He passeth from this to shew the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which the Missioners find in that Country, for the Instruction of the <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phytes,</hi> and chiefly the Women, with whom there is no Commerce in <hi>China,</hi> no more than in other parts of the East.</p>
                     <p>Which sheweth, that they must needs have extraordinary regards and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to succeed: to which the Charge of President of the Tribunal of <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and the Title of <hi>Mandarin</hi> that the Emperor of <hi>China</hi> hath given to Father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Schall,</hi> and to Father <hi>Ferdinand Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biest,</hi> successively, and which they accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, with the consent of the Pope, hath not a little contributed.</p>
                     <p>We must notwithstanding confess, if Father <hi>Couplet</hi> is to be believed, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has so much contributed to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of <hi>Christianity</hi> in this Empire, as the assiduous and charitable Cares of this Lady.</p>
                     <p>He imployeth the rest of his History to Relate some Surprising Particulars of her Zeal and Piety.</p>
                     <p>He saith that she hath Founded near Thirty Churches in her Country; that she also built Nine more, with Fine Houses in other Provinces; and that there is neither Chapel, nor Oratory, nor Mission, nor Congregation, that hath not had share of her Liberalities; that she would even Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond as far as the West, after divers Manners, to oblige, by her Example, the <hi>Christian Ladies</hi> to imitate her industrious Piety.</p>
                     <p>That which is very surprising in this, is, That in all these Foundations, and these particular Charities which she gave several Thousands of Persons, she only imployed the fruit of her Labour and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simony,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103507:93"/>
without prejudicing the Fortunes of her Children.</p>
                     <p>He ends with a Remark which the Death of Madam <hi>Hiu</hi> causes him to make, upon the particular care that the <hi>Chinois</hi> shew in all the Funeral Apparel of their Burials.</p>
                     <p>They cause Rich Coffins to be made a long time before their Death; and even the Children often do make a Present thereof to their Fathers and Mothers, as did the Lord <hi>Basil</hi> Son to Madam <hi>Hiu,</hi> who gave her a Coffin worth Eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns.</p>
                     <p>They buy Gardens; they build therein Houses and Chappels to be joyned to their Tombs: and the Great Mourning of the Parents who survive, answers well enough to the Care which the Dead have taken of 'em, to preserve their Bones, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate their Memory.</p>
                     <p>'Twas in one of these places that the Body of Madam <hi>Hiu</hi> was Interr'd after she dyed as she lived, to wit, as a Saint, whose Memory is blessed, to all the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> of <hi>China.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If her Death hath not obstructed the Progress of the Gospel, their Number at present ought to be very great; seeing the Author saith, that at that time there were Ninety Great Churches in one only Province, and that Fifteen Thousand Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were Baptized a year in all <hi>CHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this we have only the <hi>Author</hi>'s word for; be the whole true or false, it shews what the Spirit of JESUITISM is, and 'tis of Use to Expose their Ridiculous Principles.</p>

                     <p>THe Great Advantages that <hi>Holland</hi> hath drawn from the <hi>East-India</hi> Companies (which are become so famous throughout all the World) have caus'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther States to form a Design of Erecting the like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>France</hi> especially, by reason of its Power and Advantageous Scituation, conceiving great hopes from this Enterprise, form'd a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in 1664. for the Commerce of the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> They made a Fund of Fifteen Millions, whereof the King was pleas'd to advance Three; and his First Exploits were in the <hi>Isle of Madagascar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Isle, the greatest of the known Seas, was occupied by the Marshal <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> for his particular profit; and the Company then, by Orders from the King, took Possession of it. The <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guese</hi> call it the Isle of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they discover'd it on the Feast of this Saint; and the <hi>French</hi> called it the <hi>Dauphine Island,</hi> in 1665.</p>
                     <p>The Description that is here made of it, gives a very pleasing Idea of the same, whereas the Orange-Trees, and Trees co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Flowers, like the Jasmin of <hi>Spain,</hi> by their mixture, form natural Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which surpass all the Regularity of Art. It produceth all sorts of Animals, and particularly <hi>Chameleons,</hi> whereof Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists have so variously spoken. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor assures us, that they take by the eyes the colour of the Objects upon which they stay.</p>
                     <p>The Cloathing of the Inhabitants is Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick enough, and their Past-times gross and barbarous. He observeth neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a singular Ceremony amongst them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is, that the Master of the House offers the Fairest of his Women to the Pleasure of those that come to Visit him; It is an Incivility, and even a kind of Shame to make any Excuses. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, on her part, is grieved, when her Beauty acquireth only Looks.</p>
                     <p>The People of the Country are of a Large Size; they have a Proud Gate, and can Dissemble as well as the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Nations. Their Blackness is unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and proceedeth not from the heat of the Sun. The Cause is chiefly in their
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103507:94"/>
Blood; for the <hi>French</hi> there are Born as White as at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Author shews that these Black Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have the advantage of having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Beauty, because it hath not those inequalities and paleness of White Faces, which renders our Beauties variable.</p>
                     <p>Marriage is there accompanied with no manner of Ceremonies. The Virgins make none unhappy; and each takes a certain number of Women, according to his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or his Quality.</p>
                     <p>There are no Temples seen in the <hi>Isle</hi>; and Circumcision, which is in use amongst them, makes us judge, that the <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Mahometans</hi> have left there some footsteps of their Religion. They Adore an <hi>Oly,</hi> which is a kind of a Cricket, that they nourish with great care. When one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches them that they prostrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before a vile Animal, they Answer very seriously, <hi>That through it they respect the Author; and it being necessary to have some Object to fix the Mind on, the lowest best represents the Homage which they owe to the true and Soveraign Being.</hi>

                     <p>The Beginnings of the Company was not Prosperous at <hi>Madagascar.</hi> The Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie of Command divided the <hi>French</hi>; and that which hasted their Ruin in the Island, was, that the Catholick Zeal came in for a share. A Missioner, willing to Convert <hi>Dian Manangue,</hi> the most Valiant and full of Spirit of all the Princes of the <hi>Insulars,</hi> without staying for the tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Reasons and Persuasion, made use of Force and Menaces.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dian Manangue,</hi> that had been drawn into the <hi>Dauphin</hi>-Fort under pretence of a Deliberation of War, perceiving the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent designs that were formed against his Person, very cunningly feign'd to yield himself, and set a day apart to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. He returned very full of Trouble, and meditated the Cruel Tragedy that he Executed some days after. For he Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned the Missioner who went to him to perform the Ceremony; and Marching at the Head of a small Army, being Clothed with the Surplis of the Missioner, and wearing the Square Cap upon his Head, in an Insulting manner routed the <hi>French,</hi> and forc'd them to shut themselves up within the Walls of the Fort <hi>Dauphin.</hi> Their Affairs were never since re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>Dian Manangue</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving raised the Chief Men of <hi>Madagascar,</hi> drove away almost all the <hi>French</hi>; and those that were left were forced to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this Isle, which might have served as the Center for the Commerce to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Company not being dismayed at these Ill successes, went further into the <hi>Indies,</hi> and took Measures how to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish themselves at <hi>Suratte.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Puissant City is under the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and there are Inhabitants of all the Countries of the World. It is the Magazin of the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and perhaps the Chief City in the World for Traffick.</p>
                     <p>The Author makes some Remarks upon the Manners of the First Inhabitants of the Country, and Affirms a thing that without doubt will find many Incredulous Readers; <hi>That there are many Hermophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites</hi> at <hi>Suratte,</hi> who, with Womens Cloaths wear Mens Turbants, for distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and, to shew all the World, they have the advantage of both Sexes.</p>
                     <p>The Women for Decency and Honour are obliged to Burn themselves with the Body of their Husbands, and give them, after their Death, this sad Mark of their Love. Yet they ask permission of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who Grants it only according as he thinks fit.</p>
                     <p>They seem to believe that Old Women Ask it with all their Hearts, and they are permitted to Sacrifice their Sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Remainder according to Custom.</p>
                     <p>As for the Young, they are Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Comforted, and are acquitted for some Extraordinary Shew of Grief.</p>
                     <p>In short, the Company hath not made such progresses as answered what might be expected from a Puissant Kingdom, and the Cares that had been taken to render it Flourishing.</p>

                     <head>Of Nature it self: Or, an Ingenuous Disquisition into the received Notions of Nature: In a Letter to a Friend. By the Honourable <hi>R. Boyle,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> Fellow of the <hi>Royal Society.</hi> In Twelves, at <hi>London.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>ONE may see in the second Part of our Bibliotheque an extract of a Book taken from the English Journal: All the Matters which are treated on in this Work are well digested, but there is one thing wanting to render it conformable to our Method, that is, to make an Abridgment of one of the Matters, and also to give an Idea of it, and of the Author himself; but Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> having lately done us the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to send it to us, we shall now supply the Defect, and set apart the eighth Section for it.</p>
                     <p>After having explain'd by other Causes in the preceding Sections the greatest part of the effects which we attributed to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we shall here shew that though some of these <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> which some would have Nature to produce, could not be explain'd by Mechanick Principles; yet it follows not that we must have recourse to an Imaginary Cause which is express'd by that confus'd word <hi>Nature,</hi> which gives us not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand after what manner these effects are produced; and to shew that this pretended Principle of <hi>all Motions</hi> and of all bodily Operations, is a Chimera, we demand of all Naturalists, <hi>If it is a Substance or an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident?</hi> If they answer that it is an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, we continue to demand, <hi>What kind of Accident it is, and how it is possible that an Accident by it self and separate, can produce Effects so different and extraordinary</hi>? If they say it is a Substance, we ask of them, <hi>What sort of Substance? Created or Increated? Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or Spiritual?</hi> And as they shew which Side they incline, so they lose themselves in such Absurdities as they cannot disengage themselves from. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> has not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himself to maintain this <hi>System</hi> with so many Reasons, but he also ends this Section by shewing that 'tis not less profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than true. (1.) Because it seems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Opinion of those Heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, who would make God <hi>the Soul of the World,</hi> and who would imagine <hi>that the Soul of Man is part of his Substance</hi>; this is a Sentiment, which those who make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Profession of Christianity, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in our days under other Names, and which Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> stiles <hi>wicked,</hi> pretending that <hi>their God</hi> is very different to <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Iews and Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second Use which the Author draws from his Method, is, to justifie Providence and the Divine Wisdom against <hi>Atheists,</hi> who pretend that all things happen by pure Chance or Necessity, because of certain Events which they look upon as <hi>Imperfections and Disorders,</hi> such as Earthquakes; <hi>Innun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, Volcanos, the Plague,</hi> &amp;c. which he explains according to his own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. God being one perfect free Being who created the World as a pure effect of his Bounty, when there was no Being besides himself, there could be no Bounds put to his Works by any other Power, nor could he receive Laws of any Creature.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. And as the Divine Intellect infinitely surpasseth ours in Extension and Penetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we must believe that God created the World, and form'd its different Motions for various ends; some to serve for Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Creatures, and some for Spiritual ones; <hi>those</hi> which are discovered to us to exercise our Reason, and those which are hidden from us to make us adore the unsearchable depth of his Wisdom.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. We have Reason to think that this Infinite perfect Being has stamp'd his Works with a Character in which we may discover his Divine Wisdom; this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter is the Production of a great number of things, by a small number of Principles, simple, uniform and worthy his Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. According to these Suppositions, God having duly established among other parts of the World universal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Laws, and which should be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the ends he proposed to himself in creating them, did dispose of things in such a manner, that the universal Laws should not contribute to the good of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Beings, but so long as these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Beings should agree with the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and uniformity of these Laws, and with the designs of God. Thus laying aside Miracles and Events, wherein God acts after a particular manner, one might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably say that the infinite Wisdom, to whom all things are present, having weigh'd all the Consequences of these Laws and all their connexions in all their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, he always thought fit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer (Miracles and other Cases excepted) the universal Laws to the particular ones, the principal ends to the Subalternate, and the uniform Methods to an Inconstant Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration. He thinks not fit to change these simple and pure Laws, to prevent what Men call Irregularities, as Earthquakes, Innundations, Flux and Refluxes of the Sea, the Eclypses of the Sun and Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">V. He adds, That what appears Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to us, in comparing the Designs of God with what we know may be a very wise Method, to find out these other ends which are unknown to us; and 'tis very just to have this thought of God, since in those Works of his which we know least, we see clearly so much Order and so much Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; we should have at least in this search as much Equity, as a Man of a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing wou'd have, when he judges of a Book that treats of many Heads, and which is written in divers Languages and Characters whereof he understands but
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103507:95"/>
a part, if what he understands there pleases him, he imagines he should not be dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with what he does not, if he could find out the sense. Thus it must certainly be confessed, That the Eye was made to see, since all the parts thereof are so composed, that they concur to form the Organs of the the Eye.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. This Administration of God which discovers unto us clearly some of his ends, and hides others from us, is worthy of his Wisdom; and adapted to our Wants; for it convinces us of two Important Truths, <hi>That we are of our selves but Imperfection and Darkness,</hi> and that <hi>'Tis God which is the Light of our Minds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In fine, Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> believes that there may be drawn from this <hi>System</hi> this Use, which is of great consequence in Religion, to wit, <hi>To look upon God as the only Governor of the World, and to attribute to him the great variety of Effects, which are falsly assigned to a Chimera of Nature.</hi>

                     </div>
                     <div n="2" type="book">
                        <head>BOOK II.</head>
                        <p>The Intellect being suppos'd void of all sorts of Natural Ideas, comes to receive them by degrees, as Experience offers them to it. If we will observe them, we shall find that they all come from two Sources, to wit, from <hi>Sensation</hi> and <hi>Reflection.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. It's evident that the outward Objects in striking our Senses, give divers Ideas to our Minds, that they had not before. Thus it is that we have the Ideas of Red, Blew, Sweet, Bitter; and all the rest that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in us by <hi>Sensation.</hi> I believe that these Ideas of Sensation are the first Ideas of the Thought, and that until such time as the outward Objects have furnished to the Mind these Ideas, I do not see that there is any Thought.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Mind in attending upon its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Operations, which regard the Ideas that happen to it by <hi>Sensation,</hi> comes to have Ideas of these same Operations which are in it. And this is the other Source of our Ideas, that I call <hi>Reflection</hi>; by whose means we have our Ideas of <hi>Thinking, Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Reasoning,</hi> Doubting, Resolving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its from these two Principles that all the Ideas come to us that we have; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I may boldly say, that our Mind hath absolutely no other Ideas, but those which <hi>our Senses</hi> do present to it, and the Ideas that it hath of its proper Operations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the <hi>Senses.</hi> This clearly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by those that are born Deaf or Blind. It followeth, Secondly, That if we could suppose a Man that had been always desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all his Senses, he would have no Idea, because he never would have an <hi>Idea of Sensation,</hi> the exteriour Objects having no way to produce any in him but by the means of his <hi>Senses</hi>; nor an <hi>Idea of Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> because of the want of all manner of Sensation, which is that that exciteth first in him these Operations of his Mind, which are the Objects of his <hi>Reflection.</hi> For there being in the Mind no innate or natural Idea, to suppose the Mind occupied by Ideas, before it hath received them from without, is to suppose a thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory.</p>
                        <p>For the better understanding of what I would say, when I affirm that we have not, nor can have any Idea, but from the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations or from the Operations of the Mind upon its Ideas, we must consider that they are of two kinds; <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Complex.</hi> It is of the Simple that I now speak, such as are the whiteness of this Paper, the sweetness of this Sugar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the Mind perceiveth no variety, nor any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, but a perception only, or a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Idea. I say that we have none of these Ideas but by <hi>Sensation,</hi> or by <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> The Mind in this regard is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly passive, and cannot produce to it self any new Idea, though of those that it already hath it may compose others, and so make thereof <hi>Complex Ideas,</hi> with a very great variety, as shall be seen in the following Discourse. Therefore though we cannot deny but it was as possible to God to give us a sixth Sense, as it was to give us the five we have; nevertheless we cannot form to our selves any Idea, that might come to us by the sixth Sense; and that for the same Reason that one <hi>born Blind</hi> hath no Idea of Colours, because it cannot be had but by means of one of those five Senses, whereof he hath always been destitute.</p>
                        <p>I do not see that it is necessary to make here an Enumeration of all the Ideas that are the particular Objects of each of the Senses; because it would not be of any great use for my Design, to give a list of Ideas, whereof the most part present themselves of their own accord, and because the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part have no Names; for Colours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and some few Qualities that are perceived by the <hi>Touch,</hi> to which Men
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103507:95"/>
have given particular Names (although a great deal less than their great variety would require) Taste, Odours and Sounds, whereof the diversity is not less, have but seldom Names, except in general Terms. Though the taste of Milk and the taste of Cherries, are as far distant as white is from red; notwithstanding we do not see that they have particular Names. Sweet, Sour, Salt, Rough and Bitter, are almost all the Names we have for an infinite number of different <hi>Sapors</hi> that are found in Nature. Therefore without applying my self to make an Enumeration of the simple Ideas, that belong to each Sense, I shall only mark that some of these Ideas are carried to the Mind by one only Sense, as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours by that of the Sight, the Sounds by the Ear, the Hot and the Cold by the Touch. Besides these, are others that come to the Mind, by more than one Sense, as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Rest, Space and Figures, which are apprehended by the Sight and the Touch. There are also <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Reflection</hi> alone, as those of Thinking, of Willing, and of all their different manners. In fine, There are others that we receive by all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Sensation and Reflection; as Numbers, Existence, Power, Pleasure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These in general are all the simple Ideas, or at least the most part, whereof we are capable, and which are the Subject of all our Notions, of which all the other Ideas are composed, and beyond which we have neither Thought nor Knowledge. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters 3, 4, 5, and 6.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. I shall yet remark something about <hi>simple Ideas,</hi> after which I shall shew how the <hi>Complex</hi> ones are composed, <hi>viz.</hi> That herein we are easily mistaken, and that we often judge that they are Resemblances of some things which is in those Objects, that perform them in us; but for the most part they are nothing like, although they lead us to the consideration of the manner whereby Bodies operate upon us by means of the <hi>Senses.</hi> I only pretend to expound Historically the Nature of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to mark the way and manner by which our Mind receiveth the subject of its Notions, and by what degrees it comes at them; I should be unwilling to engage my self here, into a Physical Speculation. It's notwithstanding necessary to expound briefly this subject, to avoid Confusion and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity. For the better discovering the Nature of sensible Ideas, and making 'em more intelligible, 'tis necessary to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish 'em as they are <hi>Perceptions, and Ideas of our Mind,</hi> and as they <hi>form in Bodies the Causes of those Perceptions that are in us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I call an <hi>Idea</hi> every immediate Object, every Perception that is in our Mind, when it thinketh. I call <hi>quality</hi> of the Subject the power, or the faculty it hath, of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a certain Idea in the Mind. Thus I call Ideas, Whiteness, Coldness, Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they are Perceptions or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations in the Soul; and when they are in a Ball of Snow, that can produce these Ideas in us, I call them <hi>qualities</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The original qualities that may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked in Bodies, are Solidity, Extent, Figure, Number, Motion or Rest. In what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever quality the Bodies may be, these qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities cannot be separated from them, and therefore I call them original or first qualities.</p>
                        <p>What we ought to consider after that, is the manner whereby Bodies act upon one another. For my part, I conceive nothing in it but an Impulse. When therefore they produce in us the Ideas of some of their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal qualities, which are really in them, as those of the Extension and the Figure that Senses perceive, when the Object we look upon is at a certain distance, they must needs press our Organs by means of some insensible Particles which come from the Object to our Eyes, and which by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of Motion that they have caused therein, shake our Brains and produce in us these Ideas. Thus we cannot find any thing but the Impulse and the Motion of some insensible Bodies which produce in our Mind the Ideas of these original quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Thus we may conceive after what manner the Idea of the Colour and Odour of a Violet can be produced in us, as well as that of the Figure. 'Tis by a particular Motion produced in the Organ by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse of Particles of a certain bigness, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, Number and Motion, and continued even unto the Brain: For it is not more difficult to conceive that God can stick the Idea of a Colour, or of an Odour, to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to which they have no resemblance; than it is to conceive that he hath applied the Idea of pains to the Motion of a bit of Iron, which divideth our Flesh, to which Motion the pain bears no resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</p>
                        <p>What I have said of Colours and Odours may be applied to the Sounds and Tastes and to some tangible qualities, as the Heat and Cold; for the Ideas of these qualities and some others like them, being perfectly distinguished from every perception of Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Figure, Motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances of any thing, that may be really in the Object which produces in us these Ideas. Therefore I call second <hi>qualities</hi> the power that Bodies have of producing them in us, according to the order God hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, by the different combinations of their first qualities, which are impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to us.</p>
                        <p>Hence we may draw this Consequence, that the Ideas of the first qualities of Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es do resemble them; but that the Ideas produced in us by the second qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble them not in any wise, and that there is nothing in Bodies themselves, that can have any conformity with these Ideas; there is only in them the power of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in us <hi>Sensations,</hi> like unto them. That which is blew, sweet or hot in the Idea, is nothing else in the Bodies, to which these Names are given, than the Bigness,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103507:96"/>
the Figure and the Motion, of <hi>insensible Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. The operations of the Mind, are ideas harder to be known, than those that come from the exterior Objects which strike our Senses; I have treated at large of some of the principal ones in other Chapters, I shall here speak of <hi>perception</hi> which is the first of all.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. In the following I have considered what I name <hi>Retention,</hi> which is two-fold: The first I call <hi>Contemplation,</hi> which retains a present Idea in his Mind, who considers it without dis-continuation. To the second, I give the Name of <hi>Reminiscence,</hi> which recalleth and bringeth back to the Mind an Idea that had been there once, but which it had ceased to consider. The Power or Faculty of renewing and re-establishing an Idea which is no more present with us, is that which is called <hi>Memory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. I also consider the operations of the Mind upon its Ideas: 1. <hi>To discern or distinguish them:</hi> 2. <hi>To compare them:</hi> 3. <hi>To compose</hi> and <hi>extend</hi> them: 4. <hi>To</hi> form <hi>Abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> therefrom.</p>
                        <p>Having said how the Soul receiveth all these simple Ideas, I shall shew after what manner these Ideas are as the subject of all our Notions, and compose by their divers combinations all our compleat Ideas.</p>
                        <p>Although the Mind cannot produce to it self any simple Idea, besides those which it receiveth by the means of Sensation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, where it is purely passive; yet these Ideas being placed in the Memory, it can, by repeating and composing 'em of divers matters, produce a very great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of other Ideas, as well as it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive like Compositions by the Senses. I shall give some Examples of this in things that appear most abstruse, after which I shall consider others.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. I believe no Body will deny that the Sight and Touching do furnish us with the Idea of Space. We can neither open our Eyes nor move our Body, nor lean it against any thing whatever, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced hereof. Having, by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of some Bodies, which often present themselves to us and which are well imprinted in our Memory, the Idea of the greatness of a Span, of a Foot, of a Cubit, or some other Measure that is familiar to us, we can repeat this Idea in our Minds as oft as we please, and so magnifie it; adding thereto the like Extent, or another double to that of the Precedent. In this manner, though the Sensation furnishes us but with the Idea of a Foot, we may by this Repetition form to our selves, the Idea of a Space as great as we will. And as we feel in our selves the power to repeat these Ideas of Space, we may form to our selves thereby the Idea of <hi>Immensity,</hi> which is founded nevertheless upon the Idea of Space that we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Senses.</p>
                        <p>I shall not relate here what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at large, to shew the clear difference which is betwixt the Idea of a Body and that of Space, which some have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confound. It shall suffice to say, That when we consider by Abstraction the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that is between two Bodies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having regard to those that may fill this Interval, it may properly be named <hi>Space</hi>: And when we consider the distance that is between the extremities of a solid Body, we may give it the name of <hi>Extent.</hi> If we apply, as it should be, these two Terms, that will perhaps serve to avoid Confusion, which we meet with in Discourse concerning <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Space.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">13. Time and Duration have much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with Extent and Space. If Men had well considered the source whence the Idea of Duration cometh to us, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded they would never have defined it <hi>mensura motus,</hi> since it hath no Relation with Motion, and should be always the same, though there should be no Motion in the World. Those that are willing closely to consider, and mark what passeth in their Mind, shall find that divers Ideas will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and dis-appear to them successively, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time they are awake. And that is so true, that though we never are without some Idea, whilst we are awake, it is not one Idea alone that remains in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of our Mind, but there are several which succeed incessantly one another. If any one doubt hereof, let him make a tryal of fixing his Mind upon one only Idea, without any other coming between: For if the least change is made in the Thought, by Addition or Substraction, or any other manner whatever, it is a new Idea.</p>
                        <p>It's by this perpetual change of Ideas that we make Remarks, and by this chain of new appearances, that we have a clear Idea of the <hi>Succession.</hi> We call <hi>Duration</hi> the existence of a thing equal to some part of this Succession; and we give the name of <hi>Time,</hi> to the distance which is between two points of Duration. It's visible that the Ideas we have of Time and Duration, draw their original from this Reflection; because the very Time that this Succession of Ideas ceaseth in our Mind, we have no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Duration, and it becomes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together null in respect to us. Therefore a Person, which hath no Dream in his sleep, perceiveth not the distance that there was between the moment he fell asleep in, and that in which he awoke. But if his Dream present him a Chain of different Ideas, the perception of the Duration accompanies it, and it is thereby he measures Time.</p>
                        <p>Although Mankind hath chosen the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of the Sun and Moon as the most proper measure of Time, by reason they may every where be seen, and because it is not easie to observe any Inequality in their courses; yet it is not because there was any connexion between Duration and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Every other periodick appearance, which would have been common to the whole Earth, would as well have mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured the Time, without any sensible Motion whatever.</p>
                        <p n="14">
                           <pb n="165" facs="tcp:103507:96"/>14. Although the word <hi>Time</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken for that part of Duration, by which the Existence of things natural, or the Motion of the Heavens does measure: Even as Extent is taken for the part of Space, which is measured and filled with Bodies; notwithstanding the Mind, having conceived the Idea of some portion of Time, as of a Day, or of a Year, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the same as often as it will, and thus extend the Idea that it hath of Duration beyond the Existence or the Motion of the Sun, and to have an Idea as clear of the 763 years of the <hi>Iulian</hi> period, which pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the beginning of the World, as of the 763 years that are since past. By this power which the Mind hath to extend and repeat the Idea of the <hi>Duration,</hi> as often as it pleaseth, without ever coming to the end, it formeth to it self the <hi>Idea of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> So likewise in the power of still extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Idea of <hi>Space,</hi> it findeth the <hi>Idea of Immensity,</hi> as we have already shewn.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. All the Objects, as well of Sensation as Reflection, furnish us with the Idea of Numbers. For we reckon our Thoughts and the actions of our Mind, as easily as of Bodies and their Qualities. Having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Idea of Unity, we only need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it, or to add several thereof together to make what product of Numbers we shall think fit.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. As the Mind never can come to the end of these additions, and that it findeth in it self the Power of always adding more, according to what proportion it pleaseth to make, so we come thereby to form the <hi>Idea of Infinite</hi>; which, whether it be applied to Space or to Duration, seemeth to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else than this Infinity of Numbers; with this difference only, that in the subject of Numbers, when we begin by the Unity, we are at the extremity of one line, which we may continue to Infinity on the other side. But in the Duration we extend the Infinity of Numbers or Additions on two sides, in regard of the Duration past, and in regard of that which is to come. As for Space, we find our selves as plac'd in a Center, whence we may add, from all Parts, Leagues or Diameters of the Earth, or of the <hi>Orbis magnus,</hi> with this Infinity of Numbers, which can never fail us.</p>
                        <p>Thus we form the Idea of <hi>Infinite</hi> by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which always leave an unfathoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble multitude of Unities when it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Numbers; and we have no positive Idea that comprehends Infinity. I cannot relate at large, in the briefness I have propos'd, the proofs I have thereof; but let every one examin his own Thoughts, and let him see if he has other Ideas of <hi>Infinite,</hi> than those I mentioned. I shall only say that if we did put any distinction betwixt the Idea of an infinite Number and that of the Infinity of Numbers, it would help to clear the Idea that we have of Infinity. We can have the Idea of the Infinity of Numbers, but we cannot have that of an infinite Number. The reason of that, is, that the Idea of <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> consisteth in an innexhaustible Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which never can enter into a positive Idea; and the Mind in this Remainder, which is always beyond its positive Idea, be it never so great, can always go further by the repetition of Ideas of the same kind, or whatever greatness it pleaseth. It suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces here, to have shewn how the Idea of <hi>Infinite</hi> is formed of <hi>simple Ideas,</hi> which draw their beginning from <hi>Sensation and Reflection.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="17">17. Although <hi>Solidity</hi> is a simple Idea, which we must constantly receive from a Body, and even so simple, that it is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any Modification, because every part of a <hi>Body</hi> which has no Pores, is equally solid; nevertheless it being that which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth the Idea of a Body from the Idea of Space, I shall again come to consider it, after I have examined that of Space, that it may the better be seen how these two simple Ideas, so different in themselves, do form a <hi>Complex Idea</hi> of a Body. This simple Idea is also called <hi>Impenetrability</hi>; and though this Name marks the same Idea as that of Solidity, I thought it was necessary here to make use of this latter, because a positive Name agreeth better with a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Idea, than a Name that is only Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Compositions formed of divers Ideas of the same sort, are those that I call <hi>simple Moods.</hi> It is not only Numbers of Extent and Duration that can form these Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions; but also all other simple Ideas, in which are considered divers degrees, whereof all that may therein be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, form distinct Ideas. Several of these Ideas joyned together, make a <hi>simple Mood.</hi> Thus divers Notes of Musick that compose one only Tune, or divers degrees of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which make but one Idea, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise simple Moods. But these Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being not of any great use, there are but a very few that have Names, excepting those of Motion, as <hi>to Slide, to Roul, to Turn round, to Crawl, to Walk, to Run, to Dance, to Leap, to Leap over.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="19">19. The <hi>Ideas of Reflection</hi> have also their <hi>simple Moods: Recollection, Attention, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,</hi> and a hundred others that may be named, are but divers Moods of Thought. But I shall only examin a few of them here, which are of a very great Importance.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. Among the simple Ideas that come to us by Sensation and Reflection, those of <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi> are not least considerable. They are to us of an infinite Consequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and often accompany our other Sensations and our other Thoughts. As there are but few Sensations of the Body, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not with them some Pleasure or some Grief; there are likewise few Thoughts that are so indifferent to us, as not to give us some Joy or some Sorrow. I comprise all under the Names of Pleasure and Grief, whether Satisfaction and Joy, Sorrow and Irksomness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which our Mind resents, since they come from without, or from some inward Thought.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="166" facs="tcp:103507:97"/>Every thing that is a proper Cause to continue and augment Pleasure in us, or to diminish and shorten any Grief, is called <hi>Good,</hi> and the contrary we call Evil. It's upon this Good and this Evil that run all our Passions; and the Reflections that our Mind hath made thereupon, produce in us the Ideas of the Passions. Thus any one reflecting upon the Thought he hath of Pleasure (which something present or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent may produce in him) is the Idea that we call <hi>Love.</hi> For when any saith in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, there are Raisons; and in the Spring, there are none, that he <hi>Loves</hi> them; he would say nothing else, but that the taste of Raisons doth give him delight. The Existence and Prosperity of our Children and Friends affording us constantly Delight, we say we love them constantly. On the contrary, the thought of Sorrow, which a thing present or absent may produce in us, is that which we call <hi>Hatred.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Irksomness we feel when a thing is absent, which would give us Pleasure if it were present, is that which is called <hi>Desire,</hi> which is more or less great, according as this Longing augmenteth or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ioy</hi> is a Pleasure that the Soul feeleth, when it considers as certain the Possession of a good Present, or to come. Thus a Man half dead feeleth Joy when Succour arriveth to him, even before he receiveth the Effect thereof. We are in possession of a Good, when we have it so in our Power that we may enjoy it when we please. A Father, to whom the prosperity of his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren giveth Joy, is in possession of this Good, as long as his Children are in this State, for he only needeth to think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that he may take Delight.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fear</hi> is an Irksomness of the Soul, when it thinketh on an Evil to come, which may befal us.</p>
                        <p>I will not run over all the Passions; it's not the Subject I propose. What I have said sufficeth, to shew after what manner the Ideas we have, draw their beginning from Sensation and Reflection.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. I shall now speak of a simple Idea, to shew how it is formed, and to give Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of some of its Modifications; after which I shall end this part touching simple Ideas and their Moods. Every one feeleth in himself that he can move his Hand or his Tongue, which were before at rest: That he can apply his Mind to other Thoughts, and abandon those with which he was at present taken up. Hence is formed the Idea of <hi>Power</hi> or of <hi>Faculty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Every Power respecteth an Action, and we have no Ideas as I believe, but of two sorts of actions, <hi>to move</hi> and <hi>to think.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Power that we find in our selves to prefer the presence of a particular Thought to its absence, or of a particular Motion to Rest, is that which we call <hi>Volition</hi> or Willing.</p>
                        <p>The Power that we find in us to act or not to act, conformly to the preference that our Mind hath given of Action, furnishes us with the Idea of that which we call <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="22">22. Having thus briefly remarked the Source of our simple Ideas, and shewn in some Examples how the Soul can, by the means of their Modifications, come to those that first seem to be very far off, and which draw their beginning from some Idea received by Sensation, or from some ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Mind upon these Ideas; I now proceed to the <hi>Complex,</hi> and I shall shew that all the Ideas we have, whether of Natural Things or Moral, Corporal or Spiritual, are only Combinations of simple Ideas, that come to us by Sensation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, beyond which our Thoughts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach, though they should raise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the highest Heavens.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Complex Ideas</hi> we have, may, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, be reduced to these three sorts. 1. The <hi>Moods</hi>: 2. The <hi>Substances</hi>: 3. The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives.</hi> What I call <hi>Moods</hi> are nothing else than certain Combinations of simple Ideas, which do not include the obscure Notion that we have of <hi>Substance.</hi> Of these Moods are three sorts; the one is a Combination of simple Ideas of the same kind, as <hi>four, five,</hi> which are formed by the Conjunction of a certain number of Units. The other is a combination of Ideas of different kinds, such as are the Ideas that are marked by words of <hi>Obligation, Friendship,</hi> &amp;c. I shall give the Name of simple Moods to the first kind, whereof I have already brought divers Examples; and to the second that of <hi>mixed Moods.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although there is an infinite variety of <hi>mixt Maods,</hi> notwithstanding they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of nothing else but simple Ideas, which draw their Origin from <hi>Sensation</hi> or <hi>Reflection,</hi> as every one may remark by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining them a little attentively. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if by the word <hi>Lie,</hi> we understand Discourse contrary to a known Truth; it compriseth simple Ideas: 1. From the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulated Sounds: 2. The Relation that is betwixt these Sounds and the Ideas whereof they are Signs: 3. The Union of these Signs, different from that which is between the Ideas that they represent in the Mind of him that speaketh: 4. The Knowledge, he that speaketh has, in that he abuseth these Signs. These are but simple Ideas, or such as may easily be reduced thereto. So it is with all the other mixt Moods which consist but in Combinations of simple Ideas. We should never have done, and it would be also unprofitable to undertake to make an Enumeration of all the mixt Moods which are in the minds of Men, seeing they include in their Extent all the matters that make the subject of Divinity, Morality, Law, of the Politicks, and divers other Sciences.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. No body doubts but that there is in the World a very great variety of Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Let us then see what Ideas we have of Substances: Let us begin with the most general ones, as are those of the Body and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103507:97"/>
Mind. I ask if any thing else be seen in the Idea that we have of the Body but <hi>Solidity, Extent</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are the simple Ideas that come to us by the Senses? It may be some Body will say, that for to have a compleat Idea of a Body, the Idea of a Substance must be added to that of Motion and Extent. But I ask of those that should make this Objection, what Idea have they of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and whether they have a clear Idea of the Substance of Bodies, distinct from <hi>Solidity,</hi> Extent and Motion?</p>
                        <p>The Idea we have of the Mind is of a Being which hath the power of <hi>thinking</hi> and of <hi>moving the Body,</hi> whence I conclude, by the bye, That we have an Idea as clear of the Mind as of the Body. In the one we have clear Ideas of Solidity, Extent and Motion, though we know not what its Substance is. In the other we see with an equal clearness two Ideas, to wit, Thought, and the Power of moving, though we know not the Substance: For the Substance is in both of them the Subject in which is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be these Qualities, that is to say, <hi>some I know not what,</hi> which upholds them and in which they exist; so that all the Idea that we have of Substance, is an obscure Idea of what it maketh, and not an Idea of what it is. Thus all the Idea we have of the Substance of a thing, be it corporal or spiritual, being equally obscure, and the Motion and power of Moving being as clear the one as the other; we have nothing left to compare, but Extent and Thought. These two Ideas are both of them very clear, and the difficulty that some have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med against the Idea of the Mind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in that they said that they conceived not a thing that thinketh, without Extent. I maintain on the contrary, that they can as easily conceive a thing that thinketh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Extent, as they conceive a solid Extent. For to conceive a solid Extent, we must have an Idea of <hi>Cohesion</hi> of parts; but it is as easie to conceive how a Mind thinketh, as it is to conceive how solid parts do stay stickt the one to the other, that is to say, how a Body is extended. For where there are no parts that are tyed together, there are no parts <hi>extra partes,</hi> as Men speak, and consequently no Extent. If the Body is divisible, there must be parts that are united one with the other, and if there was no union betwixt them, the Body would be quite destroyed and would cease to be. Whosoever can tell what holdeth the united parts of Iron, or of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, shall expound to me one of the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal difficulties of Physick. <hi>M. Barmuli,</hi> who hath endeavoured to give the reason of the Cohesion of the Particles of all Bodies, by the pressure of the <hi>Ether,</hi> hath omitted two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hings of great Importance.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. He hath not considered that how great soever the pressure of a <hi>flued Ambient</hi> may be, if there is nothing else to keep joyned the parts of Bodies, though they cannot be distant the one from the other perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, nevertheless we may demonstrate that the one may be pushed off the other, as easily as if there was no pressure at all. The experience of two polished Marbles put upon one another (which the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Atmosphere hold in this state) sheweth to the Eye what I would say, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they can be very easily separated, in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing them on one side, whereas they cannot be so perpendicularly.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. He hath no regard to the Particles of the <hi>Ether,</hi> which being themselves Particles of Bodies formed of other Particles, ought to have something that may hold them united, which cannot come of themselves; for it is as difficult to conceive how the parts of the least Moth of matter stay united one to the other, as those of the greatest Masses. But without that, it is as difficult to conceive a Body as a Spirit, a thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a thing that thinketh.</p>
                        <p>But suppose the notion of the Mind is more or less obscure than that of the Body, it's certain we do not receive it by any other way, than that whereby we receive the notion of the Body. For even as after having received by our Senses the Ideas of Solidity, Extent, Motion and Rest, we form to our selves the Idea of the Body, in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that these four things are inherent in an unknown Substance: So in joyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the simple Ideas that we have formed, in reflecting upon the operations of our own Minds, which every day we feel in our selves, as, <hi>to think, to understand, to will, to know, and to be able to move Bodies</hi>: In joyning, I say, these Ideas, and supposing that these operations of our Mind and all others coexist in a certain Substance which we likewise do not know, we come to have an Idea of the Beings, which we call Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                        <p>The Ideas that we have of the <hi>Intellect</hi> and of the <hi>power</hi> formed by the Reflection, which we have made upon that which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in our selves, joyned to that <hi>Duration,</hi> and all that augmented by the Idea that we have of <hi>Infinity,</hi> gives us the Idea of the supream Being that we call God.</p>
                        <p>To convince our selves that all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex Ideas contain nothing but what the simple Ideas do, which come to us by Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation or Reflection, we only need to think on the different sorts of Minds which are existent, or might exist. For though it were likely that there are more different kinds of Spiritual Beings, in ascending from us to God, than there of Material, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending from us to Nought; because we are at a distance more great from the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Perfection, than from the lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Being; nevertheless it's certain that we cannot conceive any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the divers natures of Angels, saving different degrees of Intellect and of Power, which are but divers Modifications of two simple Ideas, formed by Reflection upon that which passeth in our selves.</p>
                        <p>As to what concerneth the Ideas that we have of natural Substances, it is evident
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103507:98"/>
that they are only Combinations of simple Ideas, which we have acknowledged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist together by Sensation; for Example, What is the Idea of Gold, but a certain bright Colour, a certain degree of Weight, of <hi>Malleability,</hi> of Fusibility, and perhaps, as the Chymists speak, of <hi>Fixation,</hi> or of other simple Ideas that our Mind uniteth as coexistent all along in the same Substance? This Complex Idea includeth more or less simple Ideas, according as he that maketh this Conjunction is more or less exact in the Observations he hath made touching Gold. Such are our Ideas of the different kinds of Substances, which are nothing else than different Combinations of the simple Ideas which come to us by Sensation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, and which we suppose coexistent in I know not what Substance.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. There is yet another sort of the Ideas of Substances, where the Mind joineth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether divers Substances distinct, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth but one Idea thereof. Thus an Army composed of 10000 Men, and a Flock of several hundreds of Sheep is as well one only Idea, as that of one Man or one Sheep. I call these Ideas, <hi>collective Ideas of Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and they deserve our Observation, tho' it were for nothing else, but to shew the Power that the Mind hath of re-uniting in one only Idea, things in themselves very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and distant the one from the other. To satisfie fully those that may have some difficulty upon this Subject, we need but simply to name the <hi>Vniverse,</hi> and to remark that this word signifieth but one only Idea, be it never so compounded.</p>
                        <p n="25">25, 26, 27. Besides the Ideas, whether Simple or Complex, that the Mind hath of things considered in themselves; it hath others that it formeth of the Comparison that it maketh of these things betwixt themselves, and which are called <hi>Relatives.</hi> A Relative therefore is the consideration of a thing that marketh, or includeth in it self the consideration of another. Seeing all our Ideas may be considered, in as much as they lead our Thoughts to something else, it followeth, that all simple and complex Ideas may serve for the foundation of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative.</hi> And whatever Extent those Ideas may have that are Relatives, it may be seen how they draw their Origin from Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Sensation, seeing they have no other foundation than the Ideas that come to us from thence. It's needless I should enlarge upon every sort of <hi>Relatives</hi> to shew it. I shall only mark that a Relative supposeth two Ideas or things, really separated the one from the other, or at least considered as distinct. We do not always regard these two things or these two Ideas, which is the cause why we pass over divers Terms for Signs of <hi>absolute</hi> Ideas which are effectively <hi>Relatives.</hi> For Example, <hi>great</hi> and <hi>old</hi> are Terms, as Relative, as <hi>more great,</hi> and <hi>more old,</hi> though it is not always believed. When we say that <hi>Peter is older than</hi> John, these two Persons are compared in the Idea of Duration, and we would say that the one hath more than the other: And when we say that <hi>Iohn is old,</hi> his Duration is compared with that which we look upon as the ordinary Extent of the Life of Men. Hence it cometh that we should be offended to hear one say, That a Diamond or the Sun are old, because we have no Idea of the length of an ordinary Duration that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to them. So we have no Idea to which we may compare it as we have in respect to the things which we commonly call old. There is a great deal of these Terms, which under an <hi>absolute</hi> Form or Termination, hide a relative Idea; and to examin nearly our Ideas they are in a great part a Relative.</p>
                        <p>This is what I briefly conceive of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent sorts of complex Ideas we have, and which may all be reduced to these three, <hi>Subctances, Moods</hi> and <hi>Relatives.</hi> As they include nothing else than divers Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of simple Ideas, that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Sensation and Reflection, so I conclude that in all our Thoughts, Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations and Reasonings, how abstract and extended soever they be, our Mind never goes beyond the simple Ideas that we have received by the way of Sensation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>
                        <p n="28">28. One thing may be considered in all the Ideas I have spoken of, whether Simple or Complex; it is that they may be clear and distinct, or obscure and confused. The simple Ideas are clear, when they are very lively in the Mind, such are those which we have from the Senses Object: Again, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans being in a good disposition, and all the circumstances requisit for a clear Sensation; it is this clearness that rendreth the Ideas distinct. The complex Ideas are distinct not only when the simple Ideas whereof they are composed are clear; but also when their Number and their Order is clearly fixed and regulated in the Mind. Then the Mind seeth after a clear and constant manner, when his complex Idea as often as it's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as often as it's thought upon, perfectly distinguisheth from all the others to which it may have any resemblance.</p>
                        <p n="29">29. <hi>Real Ideas</hi> are those that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to that which is considered as their Architypes, or to the real existence of things. <hi>Phantastick</hi> or <hi>Chimerical</hi> Ideas are those in which is not found this Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                        <p>According to this Rule, 1. No simple Idea can be Chimerical, because they all answer to that Power of producing them in our Minds, which God hath placed in things; and that this is the reality which is proper unto them: 2. The Moods and Relatives, unless we joyn incompatible Ideas, cannot be Chimerical, because they themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Architypes, they cannot but resemble their Originals: 3. The Ideas of Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be and often are Chimerical, to wit, when the Mind forms them of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Combination of Ideas, which are not ally'd to Nature. For the Ideas of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances being formed, to represent them
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103507:98"/>
such as they are, really existent without us, these Ideas cannot be real but in as much as they agree with their Originals. So the Idea that we commonly have of a Man or of a Horse, is a real Idea, and the Idea of a Center is a chimerical Idea.</p>
                        <p n="30">30. Among real Ideas some are <hi>Compleat,</hi> (in Latin <hi>adaequata</hi>) and some other <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat</hi> (<hi>inadaequata.</hi>) The simple Ideas and those of the Moods and of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are all compleat, for nothing is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there that may render them more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and more conform to their Originals. But the Ideas of Substances are all incompleat, because they include but one part of the Qualities which really are in the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances their Architypes.</p>
                        <p n="31">31. Though, to speak exactly, Truth and Falshood belong not to Ideas, but to Propositions; notwithstanding because we often call the Ideas <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false,</hi> it is good to consider which are true and which are false, and why these Names have been given them. We must therefore first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark that when we look upon any thing as true or false, there is evermore some kind of a Proposition, though it is not expressed in formal Terms, and whereof no heed is taken. Secondly, we often do refer our Ideas to Architypes, which we think they represent, and consequently when some among them agree with their Architypes, they may be called true, as they are called false when they resemble them not. Of these Architypes are two sorts; the one is <hi>real,</hi> and the other <hi>mental.</hi> Real Architypes are those that exist really in the very things. In this respect there are but the Ideas of the Substances that may be false: The Architypes of the other sort that we call <hi>mental,</hi> are the Ideas that are in the Minds of others. For in Language, Men often do refer the Ideas signified by their Words, to the Ideas that are in the Minds of other Men, and which are marked by the same Words. For Example, when we make use of the word <hi>Gratitude,</hi> we pretend that the Idea that is in the Mind, and whereof this word is the sign, is conform to the Idea that others have in their Mind, and to which they apply the Name of <hi>Gratitude</hi>: The same way that we pretend that the Idea of a Horse ought to be conform to this very Animal. Of the first of these two sorts of Ideas dependeth the reality of our Notions, and of the latter the property of Language. Every manner of Idea may be false, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of this second sort of Architypes.</p>

                        <p>After having considered the Ideas where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Mind of Man is full, and found out how they come to us; and of how many sorts they are; I soon thought that I might pass to the examination of our intellectual Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to see what use the Mind maketh of these materials, or of these Instruments of our Notions which I had collected in the preceeding Book. But when I came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider a little nearer the nature and manner of the Notions of Man, I found they had so much connexion with Words, and their Words are so much confounded, either by custom or necessity, that it is impossible to treat clearly of our Notions, without first saying something of Words and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. The Ideas that are in our Mind are so absolutely out of the sight of others, that we could not communicate our Thoughts without joyning some sign to our Ideas.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The most convenient signs for vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and promptitude whereof Men are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, are articulated Sounds, which we call <hi>Words.</hi> Words then are the signs of Ideas, but as there is no sound which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hath any connexion with any Idea of our Mind, except the Idea of this same sound; Words are signs of our Ideas but by an arbitrary Institution, and they cannot be properly and immediately signs of any thing but the Ideas which are in the Mind of him that maketh use of these Words. For in employing them to express what he thinketh, he cannot make use thereof to mark Ideas that he hath not, seeing thus he would render them signs of nothing. It's true, we commonly make use of Words in two other Suppositions. 1. We suppose for the most part that Words are the signs of Ideas that are in the Mind of him with whom we discourse. This is supposed with reason, because without that he that speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth could not be understood. But as it doth not always happen that the Ideas that are in the Mind of him to whom we speak, answer exactly to those, to which he that speaketh applieth his Words, this significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not always true.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It's commonly supposed that Words are substituted not only in the place of Ideas, but also of things themselves; but it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible they should signifie immediately the things themselves. For seeing they cannot immediately be the signs of any thing but that which is in the Mind of him that speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, where there is nothing but Ideas only, they cannot hold the place of things, but where there are Ideas whereto they are conform.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Words are of two sorts: There are general Terms, and Names to particular things. All that Exist, some will say, being particular, what need have we of general Terms? Where are these universal Natures that these Terms signifie? for the most part of Words that are imployed in common, are general Terms. To answer to the first of these Demands, we must remark that there is such a great number of particular things, that the Mind cannot retain as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Words, as would be necessary to mark them all; and though the Memory could retain them, they would be unprofitable; because particular Beings known to one Man are often absolutely unknown to another. So their Names could not serve us, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate our Thoughts, because they would not be signs of Ideas common to him that speaketh and to him that heareth. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103507:99"/>
the progress we make in Knowledge, being got by means of the general Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we have need of general Terms. As to the second Demand, General Natures, whereof general Terms are signs, are but general Ideas, and Ideas become general on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by abstracting time, place, and other particularities, which are the cause that these signs only represent individual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. An Idea formed in this wife by Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, and by being disengaged from all that rendred it individual, is capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present equally many individual things: And as much as each of them hath all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in this abstracted Idea, 'tis in that alone that consisteth the general Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, upon which so many unprofitable Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions have been proposed, and so many vain Subtilties published. Ideas come thus to represent not a particular Being, but a sort of Things; and the Names of these Ideas signifie that which the Logicians usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally call <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> whereof it's sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed each hath its particular Essence. Tho' there be great Disputes touching the Genus and Species and their Essences, the truth is, That the Essence of each Genus and each Species, is nothing else than an abstract Idea in the Mind of him that speaketh, and whereof the general Term he makes use of is the sign. It's also true that each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Thing has a real constitution, by which it is what it is and it is that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is called <hi>Essence.</hi> But this Word ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving changed its first signification, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied to the Species and Genus of Schools, Essences have been commonly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, as belonging to the different or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Beings, ranged under divers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral denominations. In this sense, Essences are truly nothing else than abstract Ideas, whereof general Terms are signs. We may call the first Essences, whereof we speak <hi>real,</hi> and the second ones <hi>nominal</hi>; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are the same, and sometimes they are quite different the one from the other, in the same thing.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. We shall more clearly conceive the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Signification of Words, if we consider the Relation they have with these three sorts of Ideas whereof I have already spoken; to wit, the <hi>simple</hi> Ideas, the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> and the <hi>Moods,</hi> under the which I comprise the <hi>Relatives</hi>: 1. The names of simple Ideas and of Substances denote some Beings really existent, whence they are drawn as from their Original. But the name of the <hi>mix'd Moods</hi> do terminate in the Mind; and I believe it's for that reason that they are particularly called <hi>Notions.</hi> 2. The names of simple Ideas and of Moods always signifie the real Essence, as well as the nominal. The names of Substances sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom signifie (though sometimes they have another signification) any thing else but the nominal Essence. 3. Of all things the names of simple Ideas are the least doubtful and uncertain. 4. But what I believe to be of a great use, and that no Body, as I know, hath remarked, is that we must distinguish the Terms that can and that cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. I observe therefore that we cannot define the names of the simple Ideas, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we may those of the complex. For to <hi>define,</hi> being no more than to make known an Idea, which is mark'd by a certain Word, by means of some Terms, that are not synonimous, the Definition cannot have place but in the complex Ideas. It's well known how much the Peripateticks, and even the modern Philosophers, not knowing what Names could or could not be defined, have vainly discoursed, and published such Gallimauphry, whilst they went about to define the Names of some few simple Ideas, because for the most part they thought it not for their purpose to undertake the same thing. Though they have defined Motion and Light; they have nevertheless waved the definition of the greatest part of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Ideas, and the definitions of Light and Motion that they have hazarded to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, will appear, if they are throughly examined, to have as little sense, as what may be said in expounding the terms of Red and Sweet. When a Man born blind shall be made to understand what Idea the word <hi>Blew</hi> will bear, we may likewise make a Man to comprehend, by the means of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, what Motion and Light signifie to a Man, who till then shall not know what it is, but by another way. The Names of simple Ideas have but a very few subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in that which Logicians call <hi>Linea Praedicamentis,</hi> because these Ideas being not composed, nothing can be retrenched from them, to render it more general and to give it more extent. Therefore the word <hi>Colour,</hi> which comprehendeth Red and Blew, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only maketh a simple Idea, which we have by means of the Sight.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. As to the Names of mix'd Moods and of Relatives, which are all general Terms, we must note, 1. That the Essence of their different sorts are all formed by the Intellect: 2. That they are arbitrarily and with a great liberty formed, the Mind not rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting here to the real Existence of any Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal: 3. Though the Essences or the Kinds of mix'd Moods are formed without Models, yet they are not formed at all Adventures and without Reason.</p>
                        <p>It is not only the signification of Words, but also the brevity, which is one of the greatest advantages of Language. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end that we propose to our selves, is, not only to imploy the Sounds signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant of signs to certain Ideas, but also to make use of short Sounds, to signifie many distinct Ideas, which by their combinations form thereof one <hi>Complex</hi> Idea conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hereunto, Men do reunite in one only <hi>complex</hi> Idea several separated Ideas, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of one another, and give it a name when they have occasion to think of proper Compositions, and of discoursing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon together.</p>
                        <p>Thus it is that Men do arbitrarily from different kinds of mix'd Moods, in giving names to certain Compositions of Ideas,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:103507:99"/>
which have no more connection in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, than others that are not united by any like denomation. This evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the diversity of Tongues, where is nothing more ordinary than to find seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Words in one Tongue, which have none to answer 'em in another.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The names of Substances signifie their <hi>nominal Essences,</hi> and not their <hi>real Essences,</hi> which in Substances are very different from the Nominals. For Example, <hi>Colour, Weight, Malleability, Fusibility, Fixation,</hi> and perhaps some other sensible Qualities, form a complex Idea, which we have in our Mind, and to which we give the name of <hi>Gold,</hi> are the nominal Essence of Gold. But the disposition of the sensible Particles, or the Constitution, whereof these sensible Qualities do depend, whatever it may be, is the <hi>real Essence</hi> of Gold. It is in nothing like the nominal, and would give us quite another Idea of Gold, if we knew it. But seeing we know it not, and that our words express but the Ideas that we have, the word <hi>Gold</hi> cannot signifie a real Essence. It is then by their nominal Essence, that we range Substances under different kinds, and under divers denominations. These nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Essences, being nothing else than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and abstract Ideas, formed of divers Persons of different combinations of simple Ideas, which they have observed or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to exist together, it is visible that the Essences of the kinds of Substances, and consequently the kinds themselves, in as much as they are ranged under different Names, are of the invention of Men. I do not say that Substances themselves, or the resemblance and conformity that is betwixt them have been made by Men; but only that the limits of the kinds, as marked by certain names, have been established by Men.</p>
                        <p>But notwithstanding Men are Authors of Essences, which limit and distinguish the kinds of Substances, they do not here make use of them so arbitrarily as in the Moods. In Substances they propose to themselves things really existing, as of the Models they design to follow. But by the diversity we find in their ability or in their attention, their complex Ideas formed of a mass of sensible Qualities, and marked with the name <hi>Specifick,</hi> are very different in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Persons, one comprehending therein a simple Idea, which the other omits. But the real Essence which we suppose to be in each kind of things, if there be any like Essence, would unalterably be the same.</p>
                        <p>If the first distribution of Beings in their lowest kinds depends upon the Mind of Man, as we have shewn, it's much more clear that it is so in the highest <hi>Classes,</hi> which we call <hi>Genus</hi> in <hi>Logical Terms.</hi> For they are but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect complex Ideas, whose divers Qualities are on purpose omitted, which are constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found in the things themselves. As the Mind, to form general Ideas, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise divers particular Beings, excludeth from it Time, Place, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which cannot be common to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Individuals: So to form Ideas still more general, and which comprise different kinds, the Mind excludeth from them the Qualities, that distinguish these kinds from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and includeth in this new combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ideas, those only that are common to different kinds. Thence it followeth, That in this matter of <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> the Genus that is most extended is nothing else but a partial conception of what is in the Species, and the Species is nothing but a partial Idea of what is in each indiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual. 'Tis conformable to the true intent of Language, to mark by a short sound a great number of particular things, in as much as they agree in a common concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species</hi> then seem to me to be nothing else but a distribution of Beings, to give them general denominations; and the Essence of each Genus and of each Species is but an abstract Idea, to which this denomination is applied. The least attention will shew us that there is nothing Essential in the particular or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Beings; but that as soon as they are ranged under a general Name, or that which is the same thing, reduced to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind, there is somewhat that becomes essential to them, to wit, all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the complex Idea, marked by this general Name.</p>
                        <p>We must further remark, in regard of the Substances, that they only have proper Names, to which we may add, that although the <hi>Specifick</hi> names of Substances can signifie nothing else but abstract Ideas, which are in the Mind of him that speaketh, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the Substances, in as much as they are conformable to these Ideas; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless it often falleth out that Men do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily substitute these Names to things, which they pretend to have the real Essence of the Species whereof we speak, and that they would have the names of Substances to signifie 'em as distinguished in kinds, by real Essences; which causeth a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and a great incertainty in the usage of Words.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Words have a double usage: 1. They help to Register (if we may so say) or retain our proper Thoughts, to which all manner of Words, whatever they be, may commodiously enough serve, provided we hold them constantly applied to the same Ideas. 2. The Words do serve to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate our Thoughts to others, and for that reason they must be common Signs, and applied on all parts to the same Ideas, by those that discourse.</p>
                        <p>They have likewise a double usage in the communication they have of our Thoughts. The one is <hi>Civil,</hi> and the other <hi>Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> The first serveth for the Commerce and ordinary Conversation: The Philosophical usage is to give precise notions of Things, and to expound in general Propositions cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and undoubtful Truths, whereof the Mind may be satisfied in the search of Truth. In this last usage particularly,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103507:100"/>
Words are subject to a great uncertainty, and much obscurity in their Significations.</p>
                        <p>Words signifying naturally nothing, it's necessary that their signification, that is to say, the precise Idea for which they are imployed, be fixed and stedfast; which is difficult: 1. When the Ideas, whereof they are Signs, are extreamly complex: 2. When the simple Ideas, whereof these Complex are composed, have no natural connection with one another; so that in Nature there is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ixt measure, nor any model to ratifie and regulate them: 3. When the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Word relates to an Original which existeth, but which is not easie to be known: 4. When the signification of a Word, or the real Essence of a thing, are not exactly the same. The names of the mix'd Moods are subject to Equivocation, for the two first of these Reasons, and the names of Substances, particularly for the two latter. Conformable to these Rules, as well as to Experience, we shall first find that the names of simple Ideas are the least subject to Equivocation, because they are simple, and that it is easie to form them and to retain them; and because they relate to nothing but to the same perception, which things that exist produce in us.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, We shall find that the names of mix'd Moods are very equivocal, because the complex Ideas, whereof they are the signs, having no fixt and existent models in Nature, upon which we may regulate their Architypes, are nowhere but in the Minds of Men, and for that reason are uncertain. Moreover these Ideas being often very much compounded, its very difficult for them to agree exactly with one another, though they all are marked by the same name. Neither is it easie for a Man to keep the same precise Idea constantly applied to the same name, when it's very much compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Where shall one find a Conjunction of all the Ideas that the word <hi>Glory</hi> signifieth at once? The complex and precise Idea, which the word <hi>Iustice</hi> marketh, is seldom fixt, or always the same.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The names of Substances are very equivocal, because their complex Ideas are not arbitrary Compositions, but rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted models that are existing; nevertheless it is impossible to know after any other manner, even very imperfectly. 1. We have shewn that sometime it was suppos'd that the names of Substances do signifie themselves, in as much as they have certain real Essences. Every thing having a real constitution, by which it is what it is; it hath been usual to call this constitution its Essence, as if it were the Essence of a kind. But whether that be so or not, its certain that it being altogether unknown, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to know what the signification is of this word in this usage, or what thing it noteth: 2. Sometimes those Ideas, which the names of Substances denote, are formed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like Qualities, which are observed in Bodies in which they solely do exist. And though that be the proper usage of these names, it's notwithstanding very easie to make true remarks of their significations in that sense; because the Qualities that we find in Substances, and whereof we form the complex Ideas that we have thereof, being for the most part Powers, or Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they are almost infinite. The one having no more right than the other to be included in our complex Ideas, which are the Copies of these Originals, it's very difficult to mark justly by means of these models, the signification of their names. And therefore the same name of a Substance, seldom denoteth in the Mouth of two Men the same complex Idea.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Besides this natural Imperfection of Language, Men do herein commit divers voluntary Abuses that are observed. 1. They make use of Words, to which they apply any clear and determinate Signification. All Sects in Philosphy and in Religion, are very often guilty hereof, there being very few but by an affectation to singularity, or to hide some weak place of Systems, make use of some Terms to which it's visible they have applied no clear and determinate Idea. Besides these Terms that have no signification, and which are proper to each part, there are others whereof we make use in our ordinary Language, though in the Mind there be no precise Idea, to which they are applied. It sufficeth to have learned the Words, that are in use in every one's Country, and that they may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Conversation, though Men take but little pains to apply thereto a clear sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification. If it were asked of those who have at every moment in their Mouths the words <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> what they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand thereby? It should often be found that they have in their Mind no distinct Idea, which may answer to these or other like Words.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Another Abuse that is committed here, is, That in the same Discourse, one only Word is at one time the signification of one Idea, and at another time that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There is nothing more common in Controversies, wherein seldom we miss finding the same word in divers significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; not only in incident matters, but in places that are most essential, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the Question in dispute is.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We may add to that an affected obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, suppose in the usage of Words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or in the invention of some new Terms. There is nothing that hath so much contributed to that as the Method and Instruction of Schools, where all hath been accommodated to Dispute. This Method unavoidably casteth into a multiplication and strange entangling of obscure Terms. This dangerous Abuse of the Language having passed for Subtilty, and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the reputation and recompense due to true Knowledge, hath hindred Men to make true progresses in Sciences, as we all sufficiently do know.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Language is yet abused, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Words for things, which particularly
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103507:100"/>
happeneth in relation to the names of Substances: For Men having formed to themselves particular Ideas and without ground, as they have thought it fit, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or uphold certain Physical Systems, have accommodated thereto certain Words. After that, these Words becoming familiar to them have, been lookt upon by their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, as signifying something real, and as necessary signs of things themselves. Thus <hi>substantial Forms, intentional Kinds,</hi> and a great many such Terms, by a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and uncontested usage, have made several People to believe that there were real Beings meant by these Terms. It did not appear credible to them that their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, their Masters, their Divines, and their learned Men, had made use of words which signifie nothing but meer Chimera's, and which have no relation to any real Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World. I have already spoken of the abuse that is committed, in suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that Words do signifie the real Essences of Substances.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Another more general abuse of Words, though less considerable, is, to suppose that their signification is so clear and constant, that one cannot be mistaken in the Idea that they signifie. Hence it is that Men find it strange, that they should be obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves of the signification of Words which they make use of, or that it should be asked of them; though it be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that very often the sense cannot be assuredly understood in which a Word is taken, how they can tell in what precise Idea it hath been used.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Figured Terms, and all the sought for Ornaments of Rhetorick, are likewise a true abuse of Language: But with this it is even as it is with the fair Sex. Eloquence is sustained with too powerful Charms, to be endured in speaking against it. In vain should we mark the defects in certain deceiving Arts, by which Men delight to be deceived.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The imperfection and abuses of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage being the principal sources of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and Errors, which are come into the World, it would not a little contribute to the Truth and Ease of Men, if they would seriously apply themselves to speak after a more exact and serious manner. I shall shew here for this word, some easie Precautions to those that pretend to Sincerity; for I am not so vain as to imagin I can reform so rooted an Abuse, and where so many would be found in the account. I believe nevertheless that no Body will deny, 1. But that every one ought to take care that he make not use of a Word without a signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; or any sound, without having some Idea in his Mind that he would express thereby: 2. That the Idea that we mark by this sign should be clear and distinct, and that all the simple Ideas whereof it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, if it is complex, should be fixt and constant. This is necessary in the Names of all complex Ideas; but we ought to take a particular care in Words that express the Ideas of Morality, which being composed of divers simple Ideas, are not as they should be, till we have fixed in our Mind the complex Idea, which we would denote by every Word. We ought to endeavour to be in a capacity of an easie Enumeration of all that entreth into this Idea, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve it into all the simple Ideas which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it. For want of this it happeneth that our Words become so obscure and equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, that neither others nor our selves can tell what we would say. 3. One ought to accommodate his Ideas as much as possible to the common signification that the words have in the ordinary usage. The usage is that which determineth the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Words, and every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Person ought not to make such change as he pleaseth therein. But because the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon usage hath left a great part of Words, not to say the most part, in a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant signification, and Men often are constrained to make use of a common word, in a sense somewhat particular, it's often necessary to mark in what sense we make use of Words, especially when they belong to the principal Subject of the Discourse or of the Question. This Interpretation of our Terms, if we would be correct, ought to be conformable to the different kinds of the Ideas that they signifie. The best and even, in several occasions, the only way of making known the signification of the name of a simple Idea is to present it to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. The only means to mark the sense of the most part of the names of mix'd Moods, at least of the Words that belong to Morality, is <hi>Definition</hi>; and the best means to understand the names of the most part of Bodies, is to shew the Bodies we discourse on, and in the mean while to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the names whereof we make use; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause on the one side several of the Qualities, which distinguish them from other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, are not easie to be expressed by words; and on the other, since many other things among them cannot, without much pain and preparations, be discovered by the Senses.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. I have shewn what the signification is of Words, and what care we ought to take, that we may not suffer our selves to be thereby deceived, that being necessary before we enter into the consideration of our Notions, which maketh the subject of the following Book. Before I finish this, I shall say only one word of the common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Terms, because I believe it may serve for the clearing our Ideas. It is the distinction of the Terms <hi>Abstract</hi> and <hi>Concrete,</hi> upon which we may mark, 1. That two abstract Ideas are never affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at once. 2. That simple Ideas and Moods have concrete Names, as well as abstract; but that Substances have but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes, saving some few abstract Words affected by Scholasticks, which they never could bring into common use, as <hi>Corporeity, Animality,</hi> &amp;c. The first of these two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks teacheth us, as it seemeth to me,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103507:101"/>
that two distinct Ideas are two distinct Essences, which cannot be affirmed both at once. The second includeth a clear Assertion, that Men have no Idea of the real Essences of the kinds of Substances, seeing they have in their Tongues no Terms to express them.</p>

                     <div n="4" type="book">
                        <head>BOOK IV.</head>
                        <p>We have treated in the two preceeding Books of the Ideas and Words; in this we treat of Knowledge.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It's shewn in the first Chapter, That Knowledge is nothing else but the percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Agreement</hi> or of <hi>Dis-agreement,</hi> which is between two Ideas. This convenience or dis-convenience may be reduced, for a greater clearness, to these four, 1. <hi>Identity.</hi> 2. <hi>Coexistence.</hi> 3. <hi>Real Existence.</hi> 4. <hi>Relation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first and principal act of our Intellect is to perceive the Ideas it hath, to see what each of them is, and in what they differ from others. Without that the Mind could not either have variety of Thoughts nor Discourse, nor judge nor reason upon what it thinketh. It's by this faculty that the Mind perceiveth what Idea it hath, when it seeth a Violet, and by which it knoweth that Blew is not Yellow. Secondly, our Idea of Substances consists, as I have shewn, in a certain mass of simple Ideas, which is noted by a <hi>Specifick</hi> Name. The most part of our disquisitions touching Substances, tends to know what other Qualities they have, which refer to this; to wit, what other Ideas do coexist, and are found uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with other our complex Ideas. Thus to seek, if Gold is <hi>fixed,</hi> is to seek if being able to be in the fire without being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, is an Idea that coexisteth in the same subject with the Ideas of yellow Colour, of Weight, of <hi>Malleability</hi> and <hi>Fusibility,</hi> whereof our Idea of Gold is composed. The third sort of <hi>Agreement,</hi> is to know if a real existence agreeth or not to some thing, whereof we have an Idea in our Mind. The last sort of <hi>Agreement</hi> or <hi>Dis-agreement</hi> of the Ideas, consisteth in some other <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> which may be between two Ideas. Thus this Enunciation, <hi>Sweetness is not Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness,</hi> marketh a dis-convenience of Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity: Thus, <hi>Iron is susceptible of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the Loadstone,</hi> signifies an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of coexistence: These words, <hi>God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isteth,</hi> inlcude an agreeing of real Existence: This Proposition, <hi>Two Triangles whereof the Base is equal, and which are betwixt two paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel Lines are equal,</hi> marketh a convenience of Relation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. According to the different manner wherewith we perceive the convenience or the dis-convenience of our Ideas, the evidence wherewith we know them is different. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Mind perceiveth the convenience or dis-convenience of two Ideas immediately. Thus it seeth that Red is not Yellow, that a Circle is not a Triangle, that three is more than two, and is equal to two and one. That is, what may be called <hi>intuitive Knowledge,</hi> or of a simple view. It is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this simple view that is founded all the certitude and all the evidences of our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and indeed every one findeth that this evidence is so great, that he cannot imagin nor consequently require a greater one. For no Body can believe himself capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a greater certitude, than to know that an Idea which he hath in his Mind is such, as he perceiveth it, and that two Ideas, among which he seeth a difference are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and are not really the same. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the following degree of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which I call Demonstration, this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition</hi> or simple view, is necessary in all the connections of middle Ideas, without which we cannot come at any general Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor to any certainty. 2. When the Agreement or Dis-agreement of two Ideas cannot immediately be perceived, but the Mind maketh some other Idea to intervene, to shew it, this is that which is called De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration. Therefore the Mind not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to joyn three Angles of a Triangle with two strait ones, so that it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive immediately their Equality, it maketh use of some other Angles to measure them.</p>
                        <p>For to produce a Knowledge of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we must know with a simple view, the Agreement or Dis-agreement of two middle Ideas, whereof we make use in each degree of Deduction; for without that there can be no Demonstration, and one cannot shew the Agreement or Dis-agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two Ideas that he considereth. For either the Agreement or Dis-agreement of two Ideas is not evident by it self, that is to say, cannot be perceived immediately, we still need Proofs to shew it. This kind of Knowledge may be called a <hi>reasoned</hi> or <hi>demonstrative Knowledge,</hi> and how certain soever it may be, it's never so clear nor so evident as the Knowledge of a simple view. The reason of it is this, The Memory must intervene, to retain the connection of all the parts of a Demonstration together, and we must be sure we omit none thereof; which in a long Deduction demandeth an extraordinary Attention, if we design to avoid Error. I will not speak in this little Abridgment of what is commonly believed, That Demonstration belongs but to Ideas which regard Quantity.</p>
                        <p>These are the two sorts of Knowledge that we have of general Truths. As for the Existence of some particular finite Beings, we perceive 'em by our Senses, and we can call this Knowledge, <hi>sensible Knowledge.</hi> Though it hath not all the certitude of the two first degrees of Knowledge, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it must be granted that it hath something more than simple probability.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From what hath now been said it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, 1. That we can have no Knowledge, where we have no Idea. 2. That our Knowledge of a simple view extendeth not it self so far as our Ideas, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not compare the greatest part of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a manner so immediate, that we may discover the Agreement that we look for. 3. That our <hi>reasoned Knowledge</hi> cannot make us to perceive the Agreement or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103507:101"/>
of all the Ideas, where the knowledg of a simple view faileth us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot find middle Ideas that may unite them after an intuitive manner. 4. That the sensible knowledge not extending it self further than the actual presence of the particular objects that strike our Senses, it has a great deal less extention than the two preceding ones.</p>
                        <p>What I pretend to conclude from all this, is that our Knowledg is not only infinitely below the Extent of Beings, but that it also faileth us in the greatest part of the disquisitions that we can make upon the Ideas we have. First of all, as to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the whole Extent of Beings, if we compare this small Corner of Earth upon which we are confined, with this part of the Universe, whereof we have some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we shall find that the Earth is but as a Point; but if we carry our thoughts yet further, we shall find that 'tis more than probable, that this part of the Universe whereof we have some knowledge, is in it self, how immense soever it seems, but as a Point in regard to that which is altogether beyond our discoveries. And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the vegetable, the reasonable and corporal Animals (not to speak of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent orders of Minds) and the other things with their different qualities, more propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable perhaps to others Senses than ours, and whereof we have no Notion; if we make, I say, a little Reflection upon the number, the variety and excellency of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that may exist, and which without doubt do exist in an Extent as immense as is that of the Universe, we shall with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son conclude, that the things whereof we have some Idea, are in a very small number, in comparison to those that we do not at all know. In the second place, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider in what a small number, how imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and superficial are the Ideas, that we have of the things which are near us, that we can know them better, and which in effect are the best known to us. In fine, if we mark, by how little, we can discover by those Ideas we have, of Agreement or Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we have cause enough to infer from thence that our Minds are extreamly limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they are no way proportionable to the whole extent of Beings, and that Men are not capable of knowing all things.</p>
                        <p>Its true, that in regard of <hi>Identity</hi> and of <hi>diversity</hi> our Knowledge of a simple view is as much extended as our very Ideas: But on the other side, we scarcely have any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral knowledge of the coexistence of Ideas, because not being able to discover the causes whereof the second qualities of the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do depend, nor to see any connection between these causes and our Ideas, there are very few cases in the which we can know the coexistence of any other Idea, with the complex Idea that we have of some sort of substances; and thereby the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have of Substances is reduced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to nothing. As for what concerneth other <hi>Relations</hi> of our Ideas, it does not yet appear how far our Knowledge can reach I believe nevertheless that if we studied well Morality, which consists in the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Moods, it would be as capable of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration as the Mathematicks, as to the Existence we have our own, a knowledge of simple view, a demonstrative knowledge of the Existence of God, and a sensible knowledge of the Existence of some few other things.</p>
                        <p>I shall not put in this little Abridgment the particular Examples that I gave to shew the small extent of our Knowledges. What I have said here sufficeth, I think, for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us that there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The abstract Ideas are the Essences of Kinds, what names soever are given them, and are the foundations of the general and eternal Truths.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It will perhaps be said that this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which we make to consist in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of Ideas, may be Chimerical, and leave us in an entire ignorance of what things really are in themselves; seeing we see that Men can, and even often have, Ideas altogether extravagant. To that I answer, that our Knowledge is as real, as our Ideas are conformable to things, and no more. To be able to know what Ideas are conformable to the reality of things, we must consider the different sorts of Ideas whereof I have spoken above.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We can not doubt but simple Ideas are conformable to the things (I do not mean a conformity of Resemblance, but the conformity that is between a constant effect and its cause) because the Mind being not able to form any simple Idea, those it hath must be conformable to the Powers of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them, which are in things; and this conformity is sufficient to give a real know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Nevertheless our Complex Ideas, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting those of Substances, are conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the reality of things; and we can assure our selves, because they are Archity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, which the Mind hath formed, and not Copies by which it pretends to represent something existent out of it self: We have a design in our discourses and in our reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, touching this sort of Ideas, to mark any thing that existeth, but only as it is conformable to these Ideas.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But our complex Ideas of substances being formed upon design to represe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t the Architypes existent without us, we cannot be assured that our knowledge touching these Ideas is real, but in as much as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth by the real Existence of things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, (which the simple Ideas included in a combination, such as is that whereof our complex Ideas are formed) it may coexist together. The reason of this is, that not
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103507:102"/>
knowing the real constitution whereof these qualities depend, we cannot know but by experience what qualities can, or cannot exist together in one same subject. If we gather in a <hi>complex Idea</hi> other qualities than those that can exist together, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the substance which this Idea shall represent, shall be only the knowledg of a Chimera, which we shall have formed our selves, and not of any real Being.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. According to this Description of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we may come to discover what Truth is, which is nothing else but the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or the separation of Signs, according as things themselves agree or disagree. By conjunction or separation of the Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap> use, are of two sorts, <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>words</hi>; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions are likewise of two sorts, <hi>Mental</hi> and <hi>Verbal.</hi> Truth is likewise of two kinds, <hi>real</hi> or <hi>purely verbal.</hi> A real Truth is found in a Proposition when it is Affirmative or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, according as the Ideas themselves are conformable to their Architypes. A Verbal Truth is included in a Proposition, when it is Affirmative or Negative, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the agreement or disagreement of our Ideas, tho these Ideas have no agreement with their Architypes.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Truth represents it self commonly to our Mind, or in being considered as included in certain Propositions: Its of importance to examin what Propositions are capable to bring into our Mind a certain knowledge of general Truths. 1. In general Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where we suppose that the Terms signifie <hi>Kinds</hi> which consist in real Existen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and distinct from <hi>nominals,</hi> we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of no certain Knowledge, because not knowing this real Essence, we cannot know what qualities have an agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with this unknown Essence; nor even ever discover that the Beings belong to this <hi>kind.</hi> And this is it which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth often in the Propositions which regard Substances, and not in those that concern the other things, because we do not suppose that the other things have a real Essence distinct from the Nominal. 2. In all the general Propositions, where are substituted Terms in place only of the Nominal Essence, or from the abstract Idea, so that the kind is determined by that only, we are capable of Certainty as far as we perceive the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or disagreement of these abstract Ideas. But this very little regards Substances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot discover but in very few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incounters the necessary coexistence, or the incompatibility of the other Ideas, with those that compose the <hi>complex Idea</hi> which we have of some kind of Substances.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. There are certain Propositions, which are called <hi>Maxims,</hi> which some do look, upon as born with us, and which the most part look upon as the foundation of all Knowledge. But if we consider well what we have said touching the knowledge of simple view, or self-evidence, we shall find that these Axioms, so much boasted of, are not <hi>innate,</hi> and have no more evidence by themselves, than a thousand other Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, whereof some are known before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> Axioms, and whereof others are known as readily and as clearly; whence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they are not <hi>innate,</hi> and that they are not the foundation of all our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and reasonings, as some believe.</p>
                        <p>It is allowed that these Maxims are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in themselves: <hi>All that is is,</hi> and <hi>'tis impossible a thing should be, and should not be at the same time.</hi> But if we consider the nature of the Intellect, and of the Ideas it hath, and if we think that the Intellect cannot but know its proper Ideas, and not know that the Ideas that are distinct in it are so, we shall of necessity remark, that these Axioms, that are believed to be the fundamental Principles of Knowledge and Reasoning, are no more evident in themselves than these Propositions, <hi>One is one, Red is Red, and it's impossible that one should be two, and that Red should be Blew.</hi> We also know evidently and even sooner these Propositions, and a thousand such others, that those that are commonly called Maxims. Is there any one that could imagin that a Child knoweth not that a Seed of Herbs against Worms is not Sugar, but by vertue of this Axiom, <hi>It is impossible that the same thing should be and not be at the same time?</hi> Our knowledge of simple view extends to all our Ideas in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Agreement or disagreement of identity, and consequently all the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which regard this sort of agreement or disagreement, whether they be conceived in more or less general Terms, if the Ideas that they signifie are known; these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I say, are equally evident by themselves.</p>
                        <p>As we know very few things with a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a simple view, in respect to the Agreement or Disagreement of Coexist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; so we cannot form thereupon but very few general Propositions evident by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and a very small number of <hi>Axioms.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the third sort of agreement, to wit in the agreement of <hi>Relation,</hi> Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians have formed divers general Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, touching the equality, to which they have given the names of Axioms; tho these Propositions have no other certainty than that which is found in all the other general Propositions, evident by themselves. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though when one hath rendred to himself these Axioms familiar, Men often make use thereof, to shew the absurdity of false rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings and of erroneous opinions, in the less general Ideas; notwithstanding the manner, wherewith our Mind has acquired Knowledge, is not by beginning with these general Propositions, and thence drawing Consequences; but on the contrary, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning by particular observations, and thence extending by degrees its knowledge to more general <hi>Views.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. Besides these Propositions, there are others, whereof several are certain, but it teacheth us no real Truth, because they regard only the signification of Words.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103507:102"/>
1. When we affirm some part of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex Idea of the name of this same Idea; or, which is the same thing, when we affirm a part of a Definition of the name of the thing defined; this Proposition only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth the signification of Terms, and such are all the Propositions, in which the most general Terms are affirmed by Terms which are so less; as when we affirm the <hi>Genera</hi> of Species, or of the Individuals. 2. When two abstract Ideas are affirmed by one another, the Proposition includeth no real truth, but only regards the signification of Words. If all these ridiculous Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions were banished from discourse, the way to come at some knowledge would be much less entangled with disputes than it is.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Universal Propositions which include a truth or a certain falshood, concern the Essences only. The knowledge of Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence extendeth not it self beyond particular Beings. It is visible we have <hi>a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of simple view</hi> of our Existence, and that nothing can be more evident.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. There is a Demonstration of the Existence of God, that we may find with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being obliged to go out of our selves, to seek proofs, 1. Although God hath given us no Idea of himself which is innate, tho he hath not imprinted in our Souls any ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Characters, that may make us read his Existence, having given to our Minds the faculties they have, yet he hath not left himself without Testimony, seeing we have Senses, Intellect and Reason, which cannot want Proofs of his Existence whilst we sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. We cannot justly complain of our ignorance in this regard, seeing he hath furnished us so abundantly with means whereby to know him, as much as it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the end for which we exist, and for our Felicity, which is the greatest of all our interests. But tho the Existence of God be a truth the most easie to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Reason, yet his own evidence is equal, if I am not mistaken, to that of <hi>Mathematical Demonstration</hi>; nevertheless it requireth attention, and the Mind must apply it self to draw it from some uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable part of our knowledge by a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deduction. Otherwise we should be in as great an uncertainty and in as great an ignorance in respect to this truth, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the other Propositions, which may evidently be Demonstrated. To shew that we are capable to know, and to know with certainty that there is God, and to shew how we come to this knowledg, I believe we only need to reflect upon our selves, and upon the undoubted knowledg we have of our own Existence.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I believe it is Uncontestable, that Man knoweth certainly that he Existeth, and that he is something. If there be any that can doubt thereof, I declare it's not to him that I speak, no more than I should be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to dispute against pure Nought, and to undertake to convince a <hi>Non-Being</hi> to be something.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Besides, Man knoweth by a knowledge of simple view that pure Nought can no more produce a real Being, than the same Nought can be equal to two strait An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles. If there by any that know that <hi>Non-Being,</hi> or absence of every Being can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be equal to two strait Angles, its impossible he should conceive any of <hi>Euclides</hi> Demonstrations. If we know that some real Being Existeth, and that Non-Being can produce nothing, its by a Mathematical evidence that there is something from all Eternity, seeing that which is not of all Eternity hath a beginning, and that every thing that has a beginning hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by some other thing.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is by the same evidence that every Being, which draweth its Existence and its beginning from another, deriveth also from another all that it hath and all that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to it. We ought to know that all these Faculties draw their Origine from some place: Therefore the Eternal Source of all the Beings, must also be the Source and Principle of all their Powers or Faculties, so that this Being must be Almighty.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Besides, this Man findeth in himself some perception and knowledg. We may therefore yet advance from one degree, and assure our selves, not only that some Being exists, but that there is in the World some intelligent Being.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. There hath then been a time in which there was no intelligent Being, and in which Knowledg hath begun to exist; or there also hath been an <hi>intelligent being</hi> from all Eternity. If 'tis said, there hath been a time, in which <hi>No Being</hi> had knowledg, and in which the eternal Being was destitute of intelligence; I reply, that it is then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that any knowledg should ever have existed. For its as impossible that a thing absolutely destitute of knowledg, and which blindly acteth without any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, should produce an intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as its impossible that a Triangle should make for it self three Angles that should be bigger than two strait ones. It is so contrary to the Idea of a matter without sense, that it should produce to it self sense, perception, and knowledg, as it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Idea of a Triangle that it should make to it self Angles which should be big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than two strait ones.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Therefore by the consideration of our selves and of what we infallibly find in our Nature, Reason leadeth us to the knowledg of this certain and evident Truth, <hi>that there is an Eternal Being,</hi> most powerful and most intelligent, what name soever we give it; whether we call God, or otherwise, there is nothing more evident; and in consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well this Idea, 'twill be easy thence to draw all the Attributes that we ought to acknowledg in this Eternal Being.</p>
                        <p>It seemeth clear to me, by what I have said, that we have a knowledg more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Existence of a God, than of any thing else whatever, that our Senses have not immediately discovered to us. I
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103507:103"/>
believe I may say even that we know more certainly that there is a God, than that we know there is something else without us. When I say that <hi>we know,</hi> I mean that we have in our power this knowledg which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail us, if we apply our selves to it as we do in other disquisitions.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. We cannot know the Existence of other things but by the Testimony of the Senses. In this our knowledg extends it self not beyond that which we perceive by their means. The Existence of any other thing whatever having no necessary connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with any of the Ideas which are in our Memory, we cannot infer thence the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of any particular Idea, and we can have no knowledg thereof but by an actual perception of our Senses.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. To augment our knowledg, we must regulate our Ideas in the same method whereof we make use in a search of truth. As to the substances, where our Ideas are but imperfect Copies, we can have but a very little general knowledg of 'em, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause few of our Abstract Ideas have an Agreement or Disagreement of a Coex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence that may be discovered; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon this consideration, we must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to augment our knowledges by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Experiences and Observations. But when we speak of <hi>Moods</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> our Ideas being Architypes, and being the Real as well as the Nominal Essences of <hi>Kinds,</hi> we may acquire a general knowledg by the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consideration of our Abstract Ideas.</p>
                        <p>And as to these Ideas, our Searches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding not the Agreement or Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Coexistance, but respecting other <hi>Relations,</hi> more easy to be discovered than that of Coexistence, we are capable of making further Progresses. To augment this knowledg, we must establish in our Mind clear and constant Ideas, with their Names, or Signs, and after that exactly consider their Connections, their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and their Dependencies. As to know, if we could not find some Method, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in regard to the other Moods, as <hi>Algebra</hi> in regard to the Ideas of quantity, to discover their <hi>Relations.</hi> 'Tis they that cannot be determined aforehand, yet we ought never to despair of it. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I doubt not but Morality may be brought to a much greater degree of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, than it hath been hitherto, if after having applied the Term of Morality to clear and constant Ideas, we examin them freely and without prejudice.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Knowledg is not innate, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents not it self always to our Intellect. We must often bring in our Searches both Application and Study, and 'tis that which depends upon our Will; but when we have examined some Ideas with their Agreements and Disagreements, by all Means that we have, and with all the exactness where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are capable, it depends not upon our Will to know, or not to know the Truths that concern these Ideas.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Our knowledg extending not it self to every thing that belongs to us, we supply it by what we call <hi>judgment,</hi> by which our Mind concludes that Ideas agree or disagree, to wit that a Proposition is true or false, without having an evidence that may produce a certain knowledg.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. The foundation upon which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive these Propositions as true, is what we call <hi>probability</hi>; and the manner wherewith the Mind receives these Propositions is that which is called <hi>Consent, Belief</hi> or <hi>Opinion</hi>; that which consisteth to receive an Opinion as true, without having a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that it is so effectively. Here are the foundations of probability. 1. The confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of something with that which we know, or with our Experience. 2. The Testimony of others founded upon what they know, or what they have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. In this Chapter we treat of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees of Assurance, or of Doubt, which depend upon these two things, diversified by Circumstances that concur with others, or that counterbalance them; but they are in too great a number for to be noted in particulars in this Extract.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Errour is not the failure of knowledg, but a fault of judgment, which causeth Men to give their consent to things that are not true. The causes ares, 1. Want of proofs, such as may or may not be had. 2. The little ability Men have to make use thereof. 3. The want of Will to make use thereof. 4. The false rules of probability, which may be reduced to these 4. Doubtless Opinions supposed as Principles; Hypotheses receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; unruly Passions, and Authority.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Reasoning, by which we know Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations and probabilities hath, as it seems to me, four parts. The first consists in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of proofs: The second in ranging them in such order as is necessary to find the truth: The third in clear perception, or an evident connection of Ideas in each part of the Consequence: The fourth, in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strait Judgment, and drawing a just conclusion from the whole. It appeareth by this, that <hi>Syllogism</hi> is not the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of Reason; that is serveth but in the third part, and only to shew to others that the connection of two Ideas, or rather of two Words, by the interposition of a third one, is good or bad. But it is not at all subservient to Reason, when it seeks for some new knowledg, or would discover some unknow Truth, and the proofs upon which it is grounded, which is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal use which we ought to make of Reason, and not to Triumph in Dispute, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to silence those that would be Liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. Some Men oppose so often, Faith to Reason, that if we knew not distinctly their limits, we should run a hazard to entangle our selves in our Searches about matters of Religion.</p>
                        <p>The Subject of reasoning is Propositions, which we may know by the natural use of our Faculties, and which are drawn from
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103507:103"/>
Ideas that we have by Sensation, by Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The matters of Faith are those which are discovered to us by a Supernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. If we carefully consider the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Principles of these two things, we shall know in what Faith excludeth Reason, or imposeth Silence to it, and in what we ought to hearken to Reason as a lawful Judge of a matter.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A Proposition, which we pretend to have received by an original and immediate Revelation, cannot be admitted as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted matter of Faith, if it be contrary to the clear and evident Principles of our natural Knowledges; because that though God cannot lie, notwithstanding it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that a Man, to whom the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, should know it comes from God with more certainty, than he knows the truth of these Principles of Reason.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But an original Revelation can impose Silence upon Reason in a Proposition, wherein Reason giveth but a probable assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; because the assurance that we have that this Revelation comes from God, is clearer than the thing that is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If it cannot be granted that original Revelation may contradict our clear and evident natural Knowledg, it can yet be less granted to what we know by Tradition only, because that although that which God reveals cannot be called in Question, nevertheless he to whom the Revelation hath not been immediately made, but who holds it from the Relation of other Men, can never know that God hath made this Revelation; nor that he understands well the Words in which they are proposed to him, nor even that he ever had read or heard this Proposition, which we suppose to be revealed to another, with as much certainty as he knoweth the truths of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which are evident by themselves. It hath been revealed, <hi>That the Trumpet shall sound and the Dead shall rise</hi>; but I see not how those that hold that Revelation only is the object of Faith, can say, that it is a matter of Faith, and not of Reason, to believe that this Proposition is a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it be not revealed that such a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition advanced by such a Man is a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Question recurs, to wit, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I understand this Proposition in its true Sense?</p>
                        <p n="20">20. In fine, conformable to these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, I conclude, in dividing the Sciences into three kinds. The first, which I call <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, is the knowledg of Things, whether Spiritual or Corporal, or some of their Proprieties, in their true Nature: We propose in this no other end than sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Speculation. The second which I name <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, contains the Rules of all our Operations, comprehends the things that are in our power, and chiefly that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the conduct of our Manners. This second Science proposeth the action for its end. The third, to which I give the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, is the knowledg of Signs, to wit, of Ideas and Words, as also serving to other sorts of Sciences. It may be, if this last was well considered, it would produce a Logick and Critick different from those we have seen till now.</p>

                     <head>That Beasts are meer Machines, divided into two Dissertations: At <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> by <hi>J.

                     </head>
                     <p>IF any thing can mortifie the Mind of Man, it is certainly the Controversie which hath been raised not long since be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Cartesians</hi> and other Philosophers, touching the Soul of Beasts. All Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, without contestation, until the time of Mr. <hi>Descartes,</hi> That Beasts had Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. Philosophers in that had no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Thoughts from the People; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, as well as the Vulgar, that there was the utmost evidence for it. They only disputed among themselves, whether the Knowledg of Animals extended it self to Reason or no, and to universal Ideas? Or if it was limited by the perception of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Objects? Most of the ancient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have believed that Beasts reasoned; but among Christian Philosophers, the most common Opinion was the contrary. They were contented almost all to attribute a Sentiment unto them. I say <hi>almost all,</hi> for there have been always some, who have maintained, that they were not deprived of the faculty of Reasoning. Mr. <hi>De la Chambre,</hi> one of the most illustrious Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks of this Age, hath openly declared for this Party, in which undoubtedly he hath been incomparably more judicious than any other of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Followers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause perhaps never any Opinion was more unlikely to be maintained than this, That the actions of Beasts issue from a knowing Principle, and nevertheless that Beasts have not the Strength to conclude one thing from another. However it is in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Dispute, all Men were united in this fix'd point, and in this Article of Belief, <hi>That Beasts have a Sentiment.</hi> The most Subtle would have engaged, That there would never have been any Man so foolish, as to dare to maintain the contrary.</p>
                     <p>There hath nevertheless been one in the last Age, who durst assert this Paradox in a place, wherein it would be the least sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that so new a Doctrin should take Birth. I shall be well understood if I add only, That it was a Spanish Physitian that published this Doctrin, a <hi>Medina del Campo</hi> in 1554. in a Book which had cost him 30 years Labour, and which he Entituled, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniana Margarita,</hi> to honour his Fathers Mothers Name. Who should ever guess that <hi>Spain,</hi> where the liberty of Opinions is less suffered, than that of the Body is in <hi>Turky,</hi> should produce so rash a Philosopher,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103507:104"/>
as to maintain that Animals feel not? It deserves to be spoken of here and every where for the Rarity of the Subject; and it is just that we should not suppress the Name of this Gallant Man, who hath been the first Author, as we know of, of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard Paradox. He was called <hi>Gamesius Pereira,</hi> and lived in the last Age, and not in the twelfth, as a Doctor of Divinity hath affirm'd, who places the quality of <hi>Abbot Gerard</hi> at the head of his Discourse, upon the <hi>Courtiers Philosophy.</hi> This <hi>Gamesius Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reira</hi> was briskly attacked by a Divine of <hi>Salamanca</hi> named <hi>Michael de Palacios,</hi> and answered him as sharply without losing any Argument that he had advanced, <hi>For Beasts being Machines.</hi> But he made no Sect, his Opinion immediately fell. He had not the Honour done him as to fear him, so that he was not much more known to our Age, than if he had never come into the World; and there is a great Likelihood that Mr. <hi>Descartes,</hi> who read but little, never heard talk of him. Yet Men will have that he hath drawn from this Spanish Physitian, the Opinion which he had concerning Beasts; for in saying so, People think to take away from him the Glory of the Invention, and that it is still so much gained upon him.</p>
                     <p>But what is most certain is, That <hi>Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Pereira</hi> having not drawn his Paradox from true Principles, and not having pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated into its Consequences, could not hinder Mr. <hi>Descartes</hi> from finding it first by a Philosophical Method. It is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing very probable that he found it without seeking for it; very likely he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and ended his Meditations, without thinking upon the Soul of Beasts, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abandoning the Opinion which he had receiv'd thereof in his Infancy; and it was only in considering the sequel of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, concerning the distinction of the <hi>Cogitive Substance</hi> from that of the extended <hi>Substance,</hi> that he perceived the knowledg of Animals overturned all the oeconomy of his System. It may perhaps be, that he had then need that this Objection should be made him, and that before it did not come into his Mind. It is therefore thro' meer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that he maintained that Beasts cannot feel. If he could have defended his Principles without it, he had never concerned himself with an Opinion, which not only had always appeared undoubtful to all the World, but which was also cloathed with almost an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Evidence. This Evidence made me say at first, That there is nothing more likely to mortifie the Mind of Man, than the Controversie concerning the Knowledg of Beasts.</p>
                     <p>For in fine, what can be more mortifying, than to see the State wherein this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie is now? On the one side by Mr. <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> an Opinion upheld which never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before in the World but once, and which took Birth rather through Caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness than Reason; (for, as I have already said, <hi>Gamesius Pereira</hi> knew not very well himself, why he maintained it) which Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath been adopted by Mr. <hi>Descartes,</hi> only because he was constrained to throw himself into this Precipice, to confirm what he had once advanced. In fine, what so readily contradicts the natural light of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Persons, that it is said openly in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Places, it is a shame for <hi>France</hi> and for our Age, to have produced a Philosopher, who hath been able with Success to put off that monstrous Opinion, that Beasts are Machines? What do we see on the other side? An Opinion generally approved of all Men who have been since <hi>Adam,</hi> until these latter years, and which so possesseth our Minds by I know not what Evidence that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies it, that Men are not more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, that they enjoy a pleasure in eating, than they are, that Beasts do feel some like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise when they feed. Yet in spight of all these great advantages of the Opinion which the <hi>Cartesians</hi> have been forced to strive against, they boast of having after three or four years Dispute, reduced it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so poor a condition, that it can be no longer preserv'd but by an Appeal to the People, and to what Hunters and Fisher-Men will say on't. As for Philosophical Reasons, they say it cannot bring any, either for its Defence, or to oppose the contrary. This is very humbling, and what may make us trouble for Opinions, which appear the most certain to us. A time will come, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that those who will maintain them, shall see themselves more incumbred, than the Peripateticks at this day are, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Soul of Beasts.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cartesians</hi> (I am here but a simple Historian of their Thoughts) say that it will appear, that they use no exaggeration, if the Preface be read which hath been put by Mr. <hi>Schuyl,</hi> before his Latin Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Monsieur <hi>Descartes</hi>; the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of <hi>F. Pardies</hi> of the Knowledg of Beasts; another Treatise of Mr. <hi>le Grand, de carentia Sensus &amp; cognitionis in Brutis</hi>; and a Book of the Soul of Beasts which was Printed at <hi>Lyons,</hi> in 1676. approved by two Doctors of Divinity, and composed by a Priest of <hi>Ambrum,</hi> named <hi>d' Illy,</hi> who died a little while after. All the World suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>F. Pardies,</hi> of designing to establish the Opinion of <hi>Descartes,</hi> in only pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to refute it. And in effect he answers so well himself to his Objections, and those which he leaveth without Answer are so weak, that it is not hard to guess what he intended. And Mr. <hi>d' Illy</hi> having answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Reasons which this Jesuit had not refuted, it followeth that nothing hath been left undone, that could destroy the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Descartes.</hi> But those who maintain that Beasts have Senses, cannot boast of it, for they do not solidly answer the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Cartesians</hi> if we belive the latter. It is a wonderful thing, that the Tenet of the <hi>Automata</hi> should so speedily come to perfection. It must needs have fallen into good Hands, and that 3 or 4 good Wits make more progress in 10 years, than others have done in divers Ages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:103507:104"/>Religion was immediately interested in this cause by the hopes that the <hi>Anti-Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> conceived of ruining thereby the Machins of Mr. <hi>Descartes</hi>; but the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage cannot be related which hath accrewed from thence to the Sect of this Philosopher. For they think they have shewen that in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beasts a Soul capable of knowledg, all the natural proofs of the Immortality of the Soul are ruined. They have shewen that their opinion had no other obstinate Enemies than the Impious, and Epicureans, and that no greater diskindness could be done to those Philosophers, than to disarm them of all the false reasons, which they borrow from the Soul of Beasts, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there is betwixt them and us, the difference only of the greatest to the least. It is a certain thing that there are no Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who affect more than the Impious do, to make Beasts approach near to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Man. Thus Mr. <hi>Descartes</hi> hath cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly Engaged Religion in his interest. But they are not satisfied with this reason. They have exalted their Search unto the nature of God, for invincible arguments against the knowledg of Beasts, and it must be confessed that they have found pretty good ones. The Author of the Disquisition of Truth hath spread the Draught thereof in some places of his Works. <hi>F. Poisson</hi> of the Oratory hath throughly treated of that which is founded upon the Principle of St. <hi>Augustin, that God being just, misery in a necessary proof of Sin</hi>; whence it followeth, that Beast having not Sinned, are not subject to misery, but they would be subject thereunto, if they had a Feeling, therefore they have no Sense.</p>
                     <p>The Book of <hi>Darmanson,</hi> which occasioned our making these general Remarks, chiefly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to destroy the knowledg of Beasts, by Reasons borrowed from Divinity. For this effect he sheweth in his first discourse, that if Beasts are not <hi>Automata,</hi> it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth first, that God is not God; secondly, that our Soul is not Immortal. He hath the equity of remarking that these Consequences ought not to be imputed to those who hold the Doctrin from whence they arose. It is another thing to make a certain Judgment and to admit of all the Consequences, which may be thence deduced in good Philosophy.</p>
                     <p>For to prove the First of these, observe, that if Beasts have such a Soul as is imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it followeth, First, that God loveth not himself; Secondly, that he is neither constant nor wise; Thirdly, he is cruel and unjust.</p>
                     <p>He proves the first of these three things by some Principles which <hi>F. Malebranch</hi> hath exposed in his Treatise of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and elsewhere; for Example, that God would have never Determined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing without himself, if his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wisdom, and his Word had not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Creatures by his Oblation, worthy of the Infinite Action of God; whence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults, that God refers to his Glory, all that he doth, But he would not do it, if he created Souls capable of knowledg, and love, without obliging them to love him and to know him; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Reason will appear stronger if we consider, that in the common Opinion the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity which Beasts have of knowing Things, and to Love them, is terminated solely in the Body; whence it followeth, that God hath created them but to enjoy the Bodies; yet according to the Principles of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> Sin is nothing else but <hi>aversio a Deo &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versio ad Creaturam,</hi> or else <hi>uti fruendis &amp; frui utendis,</hi> to wit, to swerve from God to turn towards Creatures, to stop at the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as our utmost end, and to make use of God himself, as a means whereby we may enjoy Creatures when as all thing ought to serve us only as a help to our enjoyment of God; therefore Beasts have been crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the State of Sin, and Consequently God would have dispensed with the Law of order, which is notwithstanding the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain and Indispensable Law of God. The Author sheweth how dangerous it is to let the Impious believe that God can Create Souls in disorder, to wit, without any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of loving him, because if that was once supposed, it would be no more possible to prove unto them, that our Soul is in a disorder. It is certain that the Principles of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> are incompatible with the ordinary Doctrin, concerning the Soul of Beasts, as <hi>Ambros Victor</hi> hath fully prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>As to the two other things, the Author proves 'em in shewing that the Soul of Beasts perishing when they dye, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys his proper work, which is a mark of inconstancy according to this Author. Moreover, as the Soul of the Beasts is more perfect than the Body, and that the Body never ceaseth to exist, tho the Soul is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, it followeth that God preserves the Substances less perfect, whilst he An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilates the most perfect, which is not like a wife Agent, no more than to unite two Substances to produce but the same effects, which one of them could do without the help of the other. But he pretends that the Machin of the Animals alone sufficient to produce what is necessary to their beings, therefore it would be a Superfluity unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a wise Agent, to joyn a Soul to this Machin. It will easily be guessed in what manner he proves that God would be cruel and unjust if Beasts had a Soul, for we may perceive that it can be only by the Reason which we have heretofore mentioned; to wit, that this Soul never having offended God, would notwithstanding be subject to all manner of miseries, and that without ever expecting a recompence for the Evils, which they should have suffered. For again, could one conceive, that God imprints sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of grief in an innocent Creature, provided it was with a design to make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Eternal Felicity, by it's acquiescing in the pain. To this the Author adds this consideration, that the Soul of Beasts being innocent, would nevertheless be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all the unmeasured desires of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103507:105"/>
Man, which is a disorder contrary to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light. Which will be easily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended if we imagine two different Kinds of Men, whereof the one, to wit the Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Adam,</hi> should have reserved his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and the other become criminal. If the Posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> being innocent, was submitted to the desires of these Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Men, so that they should treat us as we treat Beasts, that they should make us tear one another for their pleasure, that they should kill us to feed their Bodies, that they should seek into our Entrails during our Life, to satisfie their curiosity, and all this in Vertue of the Empire which they should receive from God over us; who is it that does not herein easily perceive a disorder which offends all the Principles of sound Sense? We must then conclude (say the <hi>Cartesians</hi>) that if Beasts had a Soul, God would not have given to sinful Man the Empire which he hath over them. Let it be denied as much as they will with a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian of <hi>Paris,</hi> named <hi>Lami,</hi> a provoked Epicurean, That Man hath over Beasts any other Empire, but that which Industry or strength procures unto him, it will be still true, and this Physician hath not the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to deny it, that God hath suffered Man after the Flood to kill Beasts to feed upon them. Which is to grant him an Empire, great enough, to preserve all the force of the Objection of the <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to what concerns the second Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to wit, that if Beasts have a Soul, the Immortality of ours can no more be proved; the Author clears it very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently. He expounds the Equivocation of the Word Immortality, and sheweth that in a certain Sense, Bodies partake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but that there is another signification according to which Immortality belongs but to the Soul. It were to be wished that this Author should refute those who give an Immortal Soul to Animals; for it is unto this that some of those are now reduced who embrace not the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of Mr. <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Cartes,</hi> being Combated by the purest Ideas of Divinity, and forced in their Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they say that the Souls of Beasts perish not. As that enervates the greatest part of the Reasons of this Author, his interest is to refute this new Hypothesis. The <hi>Cartesians</hi> would willingly have Men to examin if it be just to make so much ado against their Doctrin concerning the Soul of Beasts, seeing they maintain it by Reasons, which reduce their Adversaries to the greatest Extremities; the Publick may judge whether they have Reason or not. This is what concerns the first Conference.</p>
                     <p>The second contains the Mechanick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of several actions of Animals. <hi>Descartes, de la Forge, de Cordemoy, d' Illy</hi> and <hi>Rohault</hi> in their Discourses, have spoken of the same thing much finer; therefore I shall omit it.</p>
                     <p>If there is a second Edition made of these Conferences, it will be a great deal better to correct the Trials. 'Tis advice which the Dutch Stationers have great need of.</p>

                     <head>A Collection of some curious Pieces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Philosophy of Mr. <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> in <hi>12.</hi> At <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> Sold by <hi>Henry Desbordes, 1684.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis Collection contains six Pieces. The first is an Extract of the Acts of an Assembly of the Fathers of the Oratory, which was held at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Month of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> 1680. This Assembly willing to give us an undoubted proof of their Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the King, caused a Writing to be presented unto him, by which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to Teach nothing which should smell of <hi>Iansenism,</hi> or <hi>Cartesianism.</hi> They observe in this Writing after what manner they think, Grace should be taught <hi>in Seminaries, Colledges, and in other Houses of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi> And as they would have it on the one Hand permitted to every one to Teach Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, and Efficacious Grace by it self, they desire on the other, that Men have a particular care to shew that the Efficacy of Grace leaves Man in his Power of Acting, or not Acting, and that in every state there are Graces truly sufficient. As for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Philosophy, the same Writing dictates unto them certain things which they ought, or ought not to teach. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that in Phisick Men take great heed not to swerve from the Principles of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> commonly received in Colleges, and that they teach that the Essence of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consists not in the extent; That there is a substantial Form really distinct from the Matter in each natural Body; That there are absolute Accidents; That a <hi>Vacuum</hi> is not impossible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is what was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by this <hi>Concordat</hi> of the Jesuits and the Fathers of the Oratory, of which there hath been so much talk, and whereof there were no more Printed Copies in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second Piece contains remarks upon this <hi>Concordat.</hi> The Author pretends that the Fathers of the Oratory have done great wrong to the Doctrin of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> in that which they had given for a Model to their Professors, in the preceeding As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies. He maintains that they have been taken for Fools, and that they have not seen the Artifice of some Clauses inserted in their Writings. He sheweth also it is dangerous to Captivate the Mind of Man, in regard to natural Truths, and to give an occasion to think that the Catholick Church, and <hi>Aristotle</hi> are really tied together, that the one cannot be overthrown without shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other.</p>
                     <p>The third Piece is Entituled, <hi>An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the Book of Mr. de la Ville.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bernieris</hi> the Author thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Mr. de la Ville</hi> pretends that all new Philosophers, whether
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103507:105"/>
                        <hi>Cartesians</hi> or <hi>Gassendists,</hi> ruin the Mystery of Transubstantiation, by maintaining that the Essence of Matter consists in the Extent. As his Book dedicated to the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> made a noise, and injured the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesians.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bernier</hi> who is known to be a great follower of <hi>Gassendus</hi> was afraid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and Composed the Explanation whereof we speak, in which he endeavours to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Principles of his Philosophy with the Decisions of the Church. He pretends that Real-presence may be more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously expounded by the Hypothesis of the new Philosophers, than by the Principles of Schools, and assures us that he hath made the experience thereof in the <hi>Indies, For,</hi> saith he, <hi>when I saw some of those new Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in trouble about the mystery of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, as not being able to conceive that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar where there seemed to be Bread with all its Extent, and being no Bread, that the same Body of Iesus Christ, which had been stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Cross, was upon the Altar, and his not appearing to be there; Do you think, that I stood to tell them all that in all Bodies there are small Entities vulgarly called Accidents, and that amongst these Entities there is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally one called Quantity which extends the Body, without being always extended it self of the Body, or the Essence of the Body, or the Moods of the Body, and that God in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist depriving the Body of Iesus Christ of this Entity, made it to stay without Extention? Do you think, I say, that I went to tell them all this fine Discourse? Truly I was far from it: I should have embraced them again; and even as they have a very subtil Wit, &amp; more fit for Sciences than we, when they are minded to apply themselves thereunto, it may be I should have given them a distast. I was satisfied to tell them simply and in three Words,</hi> That God who had made that World of nothing, could as well make that a Body should appear where there was none, and that there should appear no Body, where there was one. He adds, that these good People went away with this more contented, and more submissive, than if the Thing had been expounded to them after the ordinary manner. He is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to defend himself, he besides attacks the <hi>Cartesians,</hi> upon the infinity of the World, the Soul of Beasts, the cause of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Free-Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth Piece is the Work of a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesian</hi> against the same Mr. <hi>de la Ville,</hi> and in favour of the excellent Philosopher who hath made the <hi>Disquisition of Truth.</hi> Mr. <hi>de la Ville</hi> had witnessed some particular Spleen against him, and had by the by attackt his Exposition of Original Sin. He is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and accused of relating the passage fasly. After that he is told, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels have not decided all the particular Tenets; that the Philosophers of Schools have advanced to expound the Mysteries of the Eucharist, and that one may be a very good Catholick without adopting all these Tenets: That also it is not apparent that the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi> spoke thereof in exposing the Doctrin of the Church. It is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against him that these Tenets were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Ancient Fathers, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that Tradition and Reason are for those who are called <hi>Cartesians.</hi> There is added a Memorial to expound the possibility of Transubstantiation. It deserves to be read, for it is a different manner of expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to all those which have been seen hitherto.</p>
                     <p>After these four Pieces in <hi>French,</hi> comes a Dissertation in Latin Composed by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant against the same Mr. <hi>de la Ville,</hi> The Protestant is so wife as to intrude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dispute which the Catholicks have amongst themselves upon the Tenet of the Real presence. He lets them go on, he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth that his mediation would displease both of 'em, and that it would be thought he rather endeavoured to put the evil for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than allay it. He is content to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin that place of the Book of Mr. <hi>de la Ville</hi> where this Author endeavours to prove by natural Reasons, that the Extent is not of the Essence of the Body; and because Mr. <hi>de la Ville</hi> to bring this about only weakeneth as much as he can the Reasons by which <hi>Cherselier, Rohault,</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Disquisition of the Truth</hi> have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that the Extent is the Essence of the Matter: The Protestant is contented to Restablish the Reasons of these Gentlemen in all their strength, in ruining all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and all the subtility of Mr. <hi>de la Ville.</hi> He applieth himself chiefly to shew that the penetration of Matter is impossible. The Printer hath added to this Dissertation some <hi>Theses</hi> of Philosophy, which come from the same Hand, and where it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained amongst other things, that Place, Motion and Time have not as yet been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined but after an unexplicable manner. It is also remarked that the Reflection of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies must needs proceed from their Elastick Vertue, being Motion is Divisible to Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that by Reason of this Divisibility any fixt Body cannot hinder that which is in Motion to continue in its Motion in a right Line. Mr. <hi>Descartes</hi> had not taken care of this.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, at the end of this Collection are the Meditations upon Metaphysicks, which appeared in 1678. Under the name of <hi>William Wanduis.</hi> In this is the quintessence of the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Metaphysicks, and all the best things which are in the Meditations of Mr. <hi>Descartes:</hi> It even appears to be much better digested in it, more short, and pertinent than in that of Mr. <hi>Descartes,</hi> and that he is surpassed in it. The <hi>French</hi> Author of the Learned <hi>Mercury</hi> of the Month of <hi>February</hi> speaks of these Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>William Wanduis,</hi> and refutes some places thereof; but his Remarks tho good in his System, have no very great strength, when they are used against the Principles of the Author of the Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                     <head>Of the Agreement of Specifick Remedies with the Corpuscular Philosophy: To which is added, A Dissertation about the various usefulness of Simple Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments: By <hi>Robert Boyle,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> Fellow of the <hi>Royal Society.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WHEN the Ancient Philosophers were asked the Reason of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Effect, their Custom was, always to have recourse to certain occult Qualities, whereof they had no Idea at all. It was but in this latter Age, that People began to Discourse according to the Rules of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to explain by Properties; by which we clearly conceive the different Effects of Bodies, the most universal Properties of Body and Extension, Figure and Motion. And whereas Bodies do not always act by their whole Bulk, but sometimes by their insensible Particles, it is necessary to speak of the Figure and Motion of these Particles. There have been an infinite number of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures made upon these little Bodies, and some have made it their endeavour to draw hence Consequences, not only for Natural and Experimental Philosophy, but also for Medicine. As for Example, when some were satisfied that the mass of Blood was in a disposition that disagreed with its Nature, they thought that particle of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Shape and Figure should be made use of, to bring this Blood back to its due and natural Temper. And there were some that believ'd that universal Remedies might be found out which would produce this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, let the Distemper be what it would, and so have insensibly fallen into an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That what is said commonly of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificks, is but meer Fancy, and an effect of our own Brain.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> intends to shew in the first of these two short Dissertations, That the common Opinion concerning Specificks, is not at all incompatible or inconsistent with the Modern Philosopher's Thoughts of the Operation of the insensible Particles of Bodies. To avoid Obscurity and Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> takes notice from the very beginning, That three kind of Remedies may be termed Specificks. 1. Such as may serve for the Cure of some Member of the Body. 2. Such as purge out some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Humour, as it is believed. 3. Such as ease or cure certain Distempers, tho' we do not know how they operate. It's in this last Sense that the Author takes this way of Speaking.</p>
                     <p>Then he goes on, and proves that there are Specificks, against those which deny that there are any; after which, he makes it his Business to shew, That this agrees very well with those that give Mechanick and Sensible Reasons of the Effects of insensible Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
                     <p>Here are his chief Reasons to prove that the first are mistaken: 1. Because <hi>Gallen</hi> and all the ancient Physitians, and an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of the Modern, have constantly assured it. And tho' in Matters of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, Authority ought not to be made use of, yet great Prejudices are derived hence in favour of Specificks, because they are things whereof the fore-mentioned might have had many Experiences. Besides this, there is no more reason to deny that there are Specifick Remedies, than there is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that there are Poysons that cause certain Diseases and Symptoms: These Poysons act in such small quantities, that their Effect cannot be attributed to any sensible cause, much less to the first, second or third Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, speaking like a Physitian, which they themselves cannot explain clearly. It's well known, what terrible Symptoms the biting of a Viper causes, tho' perhaps a Pin's-head is a hundred times bigger than the quantity of Venom that it casts in the Wound. And Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> relates as strange an Example, which he says he has learned of an Occulist: It is of a Man into whose Eye a Spider let fall a small drop of Liquor, which without causing any sensible Pain, took away his Sight immediately.</p>
                     <p>If there are Poysons which produce in so short a time certain Effects, and whereof we cannot understand the Cause, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable but there may be Remedies that may work after the same manner, and it is what Experience shews clearly. The bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Scorpion is quickly cured, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting some of the Oyl of Scorpion, or bruis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body of the Scorpion on the Wound. There are Serpents in <hi>America</hi> which make a noise with their Tayl, and for that reason are called <hi>Rattle Snakes</hi>; their biting is very dangerous, but is happily cured by an Herb, which is for that reason called <hi>Serpentaria</hi> in that Country. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the <hi>Kinkina</hi> is a Specifick against Agues, and especially against the Quartan. It's true, they say, that Specificks which are taken in small quantities, will lose their force by the digestion of the Stomach; and that if any Particle has any Vertue left, that this Vertue is so little, that it is quite insignificant; but there is no necessity of a great deal of Matter to act with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Violence. It's true that the Smell of Civet or Musk produces strange Symptoms in Hysterical Fits, which are immediately cured by other Smells, as of that of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> &amp;c. and yet the Particles that cause the Smell and ascend to the Nostrils, are not perhaps the hundredth nor the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth part of a Grain.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> makes a great quantity of Emetick Wine without the least diminution of its Weight: Quick-Silver communicates to Water by infusion, a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue against Worms, without changing its Taste or Colour, and without losing or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing its own Weight.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> applies himself after this to prove, That the Opinion of those that are for Specifick Remedies, does agree well enough with the System of insensible
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103507:106"/>
Particles, in giving a Sensible and Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Explication of the manner that Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks do Work.</p>
                     <p>First of all he supposes a Principle, which he has proved in another Work, and which is of the greatest Importance that can be, both in Natural Philosophy and Physick, which is, That the Body of a living Man is not to be looked upon as a simple Structure, consisting of a lump of Flesh, Blood, Bones, Fat, Nerves, Veins and Arteries; but as an admirable Machine, wherein the solid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid and spirituous Bodies are disposed, with so much Art for the uses they are desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to, that the Effect of any Remedy upon Man's Body is not so much to be judged of, in relation to the intrinsick Vertue of the Remedy it self, as to what comes of the mutual action of the parts of this living Machine in one another, and of their posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if one may properly speak so, when they are once put in Motion.</p>
                     <p>This being so, one may perceive, that according to Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> Specificks work sometimes in disposing the Matter which causes the Distemper, so that this Matter may be divided with the proper Excrements, or be vented by insensible Transpiration: As for Example, The Blood impregnated with certain Particles may become a proper <hi>Menstruum</hi> to dissolve the morbifick Matter, as Water impregnated with <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> is proper to dissolve Brass and Iron; and all such <hi>Menstruums</hi> act by their Figure, Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Solidity, or by some other such like sensible Property, which is manifestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in our Notion of a Body, and not by certain sensible Qualities of their Humidity and Acidity. An infinite number of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences persuade us that this is so; for whereas cold Water dissolves the White of an Egg, which the Spirit of Vinegar, of Salt, or the Oyl of Vitreal coagulates; the Spirit of Urine dissolves in a trice the filings of Brass, which the Spirit of Vinegar does but slowly; and on the contrary, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vinegar dissolves Crabs Eyes in a moment, upon which the Spirit of Piss had no Effect at all: Quick-Silver, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipid, dissolves Gold, which <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> leaves entire; and on the contrary, Quick-Silver cannot dissolve Iron, which <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> does easily. Common Oyl, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dissolve a very Egg-Shell, dissolves Brimstone, which is more than <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> can do. If there was nothing but Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Acidity required for the dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bodies, <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> and <hi>Aqua regalis</hi> would be universal Dissolvers, whose Force few Bodies could resist. They wou'd dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve all such as are not extraordinary So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. Whereas the quite contrary happens, because Dissolvers act by the figure of their Particles, it is not always proper to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite the Particles of all sorts of Bodies.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> concludes, That since Specificks may work in the same manner in our Bodies, that it follows, That the Opinion of those who admit them, is not at all contrary to our Modern Philosophy. Nor does he only place among Specificks such as are taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but also external Medicines, which are applied to the Arms, or hung about the Neck, as Camphyre, Amber-greece, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for these Bodies work by the little Particles that dis-engage themselves from them, and enter our Bodies by the Pores.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Specificks may act in mortifying Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that are too acid, or that are hurtful by some other Excess; and they mortifie by the different Figures of their Particles as <hi>Alcalis</hi> mortifies Acids; or in covering the mortified Parts with a kind of cover. It's thus that <hi>Cinnaber</hi> dulls the Spirit of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and that quick Lime destroys the aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and Calamine that of the Spirit of Nitre and Salt; the Particles of these Acids engaging themselves in those that mortifie them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They sometimes precipitate a pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Matter, which may happen otherwise than by the combat of Acids and <hi>Alcalies,</hi> as when after the dissolution of Siver by <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> the Silver falls to the bottom, when a piece of Brass is dipped in the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and it is so that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> sweetens a very stinking Water, and makes it very clear, by means of a Body which he does not name, that only precipitates a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind of Mud, which being taken away, leaves the Water without the least ill Smell; and what is very remarkable, is, That this precipitant is neither Bitter nor Acid, nor Urinous.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They may straiten the Heart or part affected, in joyning themselves to them, and in lancing the morbifick Matter, and casting it out of the Body, or in strengthening the Fibres of the distempered Part, or dilating the Pores, or irritating the infirm part, as <hi>Cantharides</hi> do the Bladder, tho' it does not irritate other parts that are quite as tender. And the Example of <hi>Ostecolla</hi> is mentioned as an experienced Specifick Remedy, to engender a thick Skin over broken Bones.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Sometimes they correct the Disorders of the Blood, as when they quicken its motion with Cordials, or correct its bad consistency in thickning or attenuating it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Sick need it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They may unite to this peccant Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and alter its Nature so much, that it will not have the same sensible Qualities, and make it cease to be hurtful, and dispose it to that, so as it might be easily carryed off; as when the Spirit of Wine and <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> are mix'd together, of these two vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Liquors is made a third, which is Sweet.</p>
                     <p>It is thus that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> reconciles the ancient Opinion concerning Specifick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, with the Mechanical Explications that our Modern Philosophers will have, and the Effects of Nature. He cites all along a great number of Experiences, which could not be mentioned here, without tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing almost a whole Dissertation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all is useful, and where the abundance of the Matter answers very well the Solidness of the Discourse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="tcp:103507:107"/>The second Dissertation of the <hi>Benefit of simple Remedies,</hi> is, an Advice to Physitians; wherein the Author exhorts them not to use other but simple Remedies, or at least very few Compounds; and to observe this Method as much as they can possibly. These are his Reasons for it.</p>
                     <p>In the first place it is easier to guess what Effect a simple Remedy will produce, than a compounded one; for Compositions change so much the nature of Medicines, that it is not easie to foresee the Effect. A Glass of <hi>Antimony</hi> dissolved in the Spirit of Vinegar, does not Purge or cause Vomiting; but very seldom unprepared <hi>Antimony,</hi> which some take without either being Purged or Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by it, if it be mix'd either with <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> or <hi>Tartar,</hi> it becomes a violent Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative and causes great Vomiting; and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Tartar</hi> becomes Diaphoretick and sometimes Diuretick.</p>
                     <p>In the second place simple Remedies are the surest; but what made them lose part of their Reputation and their Use, is, That those who have writ of them, applied themselves wholly to speak of their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and good Qualities, without mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the least the Evil they do on certain Occasions, which makes People not to be able to foresee always their Effect when mixed with other Ingredients. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> was acquainted with a Person of Quality, whom Hony disordered almost as much as Poyson would have done: Worm-wood which is very wholsom for a great many, is found by Experience, to annoy the Sight of others; and there are an infinite of such sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Remedies, which are not always whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.</p>
                     <p>In the third place one may take a greater Dose of a simple Remedy; when it is taken alone, it does not cause so much distast nor inconveniency to the Stomach. <hi>Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>at, Rye, Barley</hi> and <hi>Oats,</hi> are all nourishing, but if there were Bread made of these four Grains for a Sick Man, it would not be so good as Bread made of Wheat only. If one had a mind to make Strong Waters, that should recover People from Sounding Fits in small quantity, he would not mix the Spirit of Wine with new Wine, or such as did not purifie it self by Working, nor would he mix it with strong Beer. It is affirmed that <hi>Gum Arabick</hi> is very excellent against the Heat of Urine; but if it be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a little Quantity among other Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, it will do nothing; but if it be given alone, and to the Weight of a Drachm, it will produce great Effects. The Juice of <hi>Wild Thyme</hi> or <hi>Mother Thyme,</hi> is admirable for Children's Coughs; and the Infusion of the Herb called, <hi>Paronychia foliis rutaceis,</hi> or <hi>Whitlow Grass,</hi> dissipates the Swelling of the King's Evil.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth place all other things being equal, 'tis easier to find simple Remedies than such as are made of many Ingredients. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> shews some of these Remedies that are easie to be had, and serve to cure very desperate Distempers. <hi>Linseed Oyl</hi> is excellent to ripen pluritick Imposthumes; that of <hi>Turpentine</hi> to stop the Blood in Wounds, and conduceth infinitely to their Cure, and cures Gangreens; <hi>Oyl of Nuts</hi> is good against the Stone, as <hi>Spanish Soap</hi> is against the Jaundise.</p>
                     <p>In fine, one may draw from the use of simple Remedies, a more perfect Knowledg of the true Effects, than of such Remedies as are used now. It is very hard to know the Vertue of each Drug, when there are many mix'd together; since it is not easie to know it, when each Ingredient is examined by it self. The Soyl, the Clymate, the Seasons, and many other Circumstances, cause a very great change. The Author has experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced that some Seeds which are used in Physick, yield an acid Spirit when distill'd at one time of the year, and an Urinous when distill'd at another time.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> pretends that the most part of these Arguments used in favour of simple Remedies, which are now mentioned, ought to be applied to Chimick Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which tho' simple enough, produce ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Effects. What is particular in these Remedies, is, That the change of Operation may supply the place of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. According to the different prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Antimony, it is Vomitative, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, Diaphoretick and Diuretick,<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if one did mix two or three such like Things, and that it were done dexterously, one might make far better Remedies than are compos'd with much Ostentation, and with a great number of Drugs. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vinegar corrects the Emetick and purging Vertue of the Glass of <hi>Antimony,</hi> much better than all the Cordials, Elixirs, and other difficult preparations. Quick-Silver makes such a considerable change in the Corrosive Sublimate, that of a most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Poyson, it becomes a very good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and among other Vertues may be of great help in the Cure of Dyssenteries.</p>
                     <p>Some object against this Opinion of Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> that simple Remedies cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against Distempers that proceed from the concourse of divers Causes, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many and differing Symptoms. But it is answered first to this, That it is not designed to throw away all manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Medicaments: And secondly, That simple Remedies do not fail in the Cure of Diseases that proceed from different Causes, as is seen by the <hi>Kinkina</hi> which cures <hi>tertian</hi> and <hi>quartan Agues</hi>; and that the cause of the Distemper being taken away, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Symptoms cease; as the different Symptoms of the Rickets cease, the cause being taken away by a Remedy drawn from <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> calls <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s Veneris.</hi> 3. That Nature it self has formed the Bodies which we call Simple, of divers parts, endowed with different Qualities whereof some are Refreshing, others Hot, some Sweet, others Sour, as in <hi>Rhuharb,</hi> there are parts that purge, and others that bind. In the same <hi>Marcarito</hi> or Excrement of Metal, are found an acid Salt, two sorts
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103507:107"/>
of Sulphurous Earth, some Brass and some Iron, which are all composed of different parts. 4. The Dissolutions of Chimistry shew that the Bodies that seem to the Eye the most <hi>Homogenial</hi> and all of the same nature are extreamly composed; and this is what may be proved with an Infinite number of Experiences. And its perhaps for this Reason that Remedies thought by some to be the most simple, are often proper for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Distempers. Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> brings for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample Mineral Waters, <hi>Bolearmeniack,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>By this extract may be seen that Mr. <hi>Boyle's</hi> two Treatises concerning Specifick and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Remedies, may be very useful to all sorts of People: But it would have been received better beyond Seas, If the Latin Interpreter had taken more pains to express the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal better; for there are not only Baba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risms in the Translation, but also Words taken in a Sense far from their own signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. The Author says, that Limon-Iuyce hinders the cutting of a Knife; but the Translator tells us, that a <hi>File is very contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or injurious to the Edge of a Knife. Lima cultri aciei contraria est,</hi> p. 14. <hi>Elkium</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him what others call <hi>Alce,</hi> a kind of little Coal. p. 95. <hi>Morbus comitialis</hi> and <hi>Morbus regius,</hi> the Falling-sickness and the Yellow-Jandies, are but one and the same thing in his Dictionary. 121. and p. 101. he calls Cornelian <hi>Lapis Cornelianus.</hi>

                     <p>THe Inclination Princes had to make great Collections of Books, made them without Distinction give great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to all who brought them in the Books of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> tells us: On that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count such was the Industry of Book-sellers that Quarto Volumes of <hi>Analyticks</hi> bearing the name of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> were Collected, though he never Composed but 4. which confusion was the Cause the Interpreters of that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher were so puzled about the true Distinction of his Books.</p>
                     <p>The antient Philosophy is more founded on Authority, and the modern on Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the antient is simple and natural, the modern artificial and elaborate; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is more modest and grave, the latter more imperious and pedantic: The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is peaceable and calm; for it was so far from Disputing, that it would have the Minds of Youth prepared by the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, that they might be accustomed to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Demonstration without Hesitation; the modern is of a strain of Disputing every thing, of training up Youth to noise and the tumult of the Schools. The antient enquires into Truth only out of a sincere desire to find it, the modern takes pleasure to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it, even when it is discovered: The one advances more securely in its Method, because it hath always the Metaphysics for a Guide; the other is unsure in its Steps when 'tis once deprived of that Conduct. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, Fidelity, sound Iudgment,</hi> and <hi>Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness,</hi> were that which Men called Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy in the Days of <hi>Plato</hi>; and the dislike of Business, Peevishness, and the renouncing of Pleasures, when the use of them is lost through the Conquest of the Passions. I know not what Authority that is which is derived from the Gray Beard, counterfeit Audacity, flegmatic Sullenness, moderation, and all that Wisdom which springs from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Age and Constitution, which is the Philosophy of a great many now-a-days: The antient is universally more learned, it aims at all: Tho the modern confines it self to the sole consideration of Nature resting sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied to be a mear Naturalist. In fine, the antient is more addicted to Study, more laborious and indefatigable in what it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes; for the primitive Philosophers spent their lives in Study: The modern is less constant in its Application, more super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial in its Pains, and more precipitate in its Studies, and the Precipitation accustoms it self by little and little to ground too easily Reasonings not very exact, upon uncertain Rumours, Testimonies of little credit, and Experiments not well agreed upon. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces boldly upon Doubts and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to satisfy in some manner the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that it sometimes hath to vent its imaginations, and to give Vogue to Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: So that to make a decision between both, I am of the Opinion of an intelligent Philosopher of these last Ages, who, all things being well considered, was resolved to stick to the Antients, and leave the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns to themselves: For the plain common Sense of the Primitive Philosophers, is preferable to all the Art and Quaintness of the New. Tho from what part soever Truth comes, it ought to be esteemed. Then let us not distinguish Antient Reason from New, for on what side so'ere we find it, and what colour soe're we give it, 'tis still the same. For in thinking nothing Truth but what is Truth, and nothing probable but what is so, saith <hi>Epicurus</hi> in <hi>Cicero,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists all the prudence of the wise Man.</p>
                     <p>Through their various Opinions Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation became the fruits of Philosophy, and 'twas more made use of to try the Wit than to Cure the Mind.</p>
                     <p>It is greatness of Soul, to speak as one thinks, and think as one speaks.</p>
                     <p>Logic may be said to be the first Ray of evidence, and the first Draught of Method, that is displayed on Sciences: Because its busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is to form the Judgment, which is the usual Instrument the Mind employs in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning truly, and in discerning Truth and Falshood exactly, by distinguishing what is simple from what is compound, and what is contingent from what is necessary. And since this Art is the Source from whence flows Certainty, there is little security in all
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103507:108"/>
the Reasonings of Men without its assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcuinus</hi> who explains exactly enough the Dialectick of <hi>Plato,</hi> says, that that Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher made use of Division, Definition, and Induction, to come back to the Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of first Truth, from whence he drew his Principles, to the end he might think and speak wisely of every thing; and that was his most usual Method. Division was as a Ladder, whereby to ascend from sensible things to things intellectual. Definition was a way to lead from things demonstrated, to those that were not: and Induction the means to find the Truth by the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Suppositions. For by Division he came to Definition, and by Definition to Induction and Demonstration.</p>
                     <p>The Two Rules which <hi>Aristotle</hi> Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the perfect composition of a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism, are, That there ought to be nothing false in the Matter, or faulty in the Form.</p>
                     <p>The Principles of <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Doctrin are, 1. That Sense cannot be deceived; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Impression that it receives from the Object is always true, being wrought by a sensible Species: but that the Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the Soul makes upon that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression may be false. 2. That the Opinion which is drawn from sentation may be true or false. That it is true, when the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Senses is made in form, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Let, and with such Evidence as Reason cannot resist; and that it may be false when it wants that Evidence. These are the Principal Maxims of the Logick of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>; upon which he grounds the different reasonings of the Soul that are made in the Mind, according to the Sympathy that there is between the Spirit and the Senses.</p>
                     <p>I hold with <hi>Plato,</hi> who saith in his <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus,</hi> That the end of Moral Philosophy is to purifie the Mind from the Errors of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by the Reflections that Philosophy sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests to one. The two most Essential Points in it, are the End and the Means to attain it.</p>
                     <p>Not to receive for Truth, what is but probable is a necessary Caution, to make one walk discreetly, in so obcsure a Path as is that of natural Philosophy, the Ways where of are uncertain.</p>

                        <hi>Descartes</hi>'s first Principle is, <hi>I think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am,</hi> which he proposes as the first evident and sensible Truth; but narrowly examined hath in it somewhat defective: For the Proposition, <hi>I think,</hi> being to be reduced to that, I am thinking; that is to say, I am, therefore I am, makes frivolous Sense. <hi>Descartes</hi>'s Natural Philosophy is one of the most learned and accomplished Pieces of Modern Physics; in it there are Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Idea's, and quaint Imaginations; and if minded well, there is to be found in it a more regular Doctrin, than in <hi>Galilaeus</hi> or the <hi>English</hi>; and even more Novelty and Invention than is <hi>Gassendus</hi> himself. It is a Work whereof the order is not excogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: His Method is alltogether Geometrical, which leads from Principles to Principles, and from Propositions to Propositions. However this is a fault in him, that he settles for the Principle of a natural Body, Motion, Figure and Extension, which are much the same with the Principles of <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus.</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mersenne,</hi> who was resident at <hi>Paris,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one day given out in an Assemoy of the learned, that Monsieur <hi>Descartes,</hi> who had gain'd reputation by his Geometry, was projecting of Natural Philosophy, wherein he admitted Vacuity: That Project was hissed at by <hi>Robertval</hi> and some others, who from thence forward thought it would prove no great Atchievement. Father <hi>Mersenne</hi> wrote to him that <hi>Vacuity was not at a-la-Mode at Paris</hi>; which obliged <hi>Descartes</hi> to devise measures to keep in good Terms with the new Naturalists, whose Suffrage he courted, and to admit the Plenitude of <hi>Leucippus:</hi> So through Policy the exclusion of Vacuity became one of his Principles. This made <hi>Gassendus</hi> start new difficulties to him; shewing that if there were no Vacuity, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was one of his Principles, would be impossible; because nothing moves if there be no Void for it. <hi>Descartes,</hi> to save that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, invented his <hi>thin subtile matter,</hi> whereof he made a kind of Engine which he apply'd to many things; and thereby he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled the Opinion of Plentitude and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, according as he stood in need of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But as Plenitude, and that thin sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Matter got place in the System of <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi> mearly out of complaisance to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of the Age, and as an after-game; so his Philosophy seemed weak in respect to Motion, which is one of his Principles. For that Philosopher taught that <hi>all Motion was created with the World, that there was no new Motion produced, and that it did no more than shift from one Body to another; that the thin subtle Matter by its impulse, caused all the gravity or levity of Bodies; that the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heavy Bodies towards the Center, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the same impulse; that Heat was nothing but the agitation of the particles of the Air put in Motion by the subtle Matter,</hi> which in his Doctrin was a Kind of a Spring fit for all things. <hi>That the Vegetation of Plants, and Generation of Animals is performed only by a fortuitous Motion of his little Bodies, as a Palace might be erected by a heap of Stones moved by Chance; that there is no sentation in Animals; That these Demonstrations of joy, Sadness, Amity, and Aversion, and the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of pain and pleasure, that appear in them, are but the effects of a kind of Spring and Engine, that plays according as the Matter is disposed; that Heat is not in the Fire, Hardness in the Marble, Humidity in the Water; That these things are only in the Soul, which finds Fire hot, Marble hard, and Water humid, by its thought, and not at all by these qualities which are but Chimera's.</hi> In fine, <hi>Descartes,</hi> who would have us begin, by doubting of every thing, to lay aside all our Notices, strip our selves of our Sentiments, Custom, Education, Opinion, of our very Senses, and all other Impressions, that we may but learn some small inconsiderable matter, demands more than he promises. And when, to give the Reason
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103507:108"/>
of things, he says, they happen by a certain Figure, Motion, or Extension, he hath said all; for he dives into nothing; for all he pretends to be so great a <hi>Democritist,</hi> he understands not the true Doctrin of <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus, His System of the Loadstone with these little hooked Bodies, these hallowed Spiral parts, is without Foundation. His Opinion of the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, by the Impression and Atmosphere of the Moon, is found false by experience; for the parts of Water that are under the Moon, swell instead of sinking, us he saith.</hi> The Explication which he gives to all the Motions of the Soul in its passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the Conjunction of Nerves and Fibres (which are inserted in the <hi>Glandula Pinealis</hi>) is a Dream; for there are no Nerves which terminate at that <hi>Glandule.</hi> He says nothing rational concerning <hi>Sounds.</hi> In short, he may be said to be like those <hi>Pithagoreans,</hi> of whom <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaks, who did not so much endeavour to give a Reason of the things they explain'd, as to reduce every thing to their own Principle and System.</p>
                     <p>The natural Philosophy of the <hi>Chymists</hi> with their three Principles, <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> hath no solidity: They are narrow Spirited Philosophers, who being unable to comprehend Universal Philosophy, have stinted themselves to limited Subjects, and their own <hi>Genius.</hi> They may be reduced to three orders. The first, such as pretend to the knowledg of Nature in general. The second, those who prepare Remedies. The third, those who apply themselves to the finding out of the Art of changing Metals, by giving them Figures, new Colours, or new Consistence: The first and second may be rational, as <hi>Albertus Magnus, Vanhelmont,</hi> and the Distillers are. The third are extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant; for to pretend to make new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is to invade the Right of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. And as for the <hi>Cabalists</hi> and <hi>Iudicial Astrologers,</hi> there is nothing more frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than their natural Philosophy.</p>
                     <p>Unhappy are the Philosophers of that <hi>Genius</hi> who subtilize on the knowledg of the Creature, and stick at the belief of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. That was not the Character of the Ancient Philosophers, who had not only higher Thoughts than we, but raised them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves above themselves, that they might acknowledg a Soveraign Reason, which they made the rule of all their Reasonings, and to which they submitted their Minds.</p>
                     <p>The end of Metaphysicks is the finding out of pure and abstracted Verity: Thereby it perceives things in their Original; that it may fully know them it ente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s into the Retail of all particular Species, which it reduces to their Principles; and that Retail is almost infinite: This is the Reason that without it all the Knowledges of Men are but Superficial and Imperfect, because there is not almost any true Demonstration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Principles.</p>
                     <p>It is not that one must needs be a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to be a Christian; nor that the Wisdom of the World is a Rule to the Wisdom of Heaven; but that this Reason of Man being submitted to Faith, Faith how Divine soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, condescends to make use of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reasoning, to bring Reason to its obedience. Wherefore, that we may not mistake our selves, let us begin to study what is to be believed, before we set our selves on Reasoning.</p>
                     <p>Let us regulate the use of our Faith, that we may regulate the use of our Reason: Let us be <hi>Christians</hi> before we be <hi>Philosophers</hi>: Let our first Wisdom and our chief Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy be our Religion: Men learn to Reason by Philosophy; but they learn to submit their Minds to Reason and eternal Verity, by <hi>Christianity.</hi> Religion is then the first Principle, according to which human Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is to take its Measures: So that all the different Methods of Ancient or Modern Philosophy, all the new Systems of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and all the new Maxims of Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, may be good, if they be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. For the Gospel ought to be the Rule of our Sentiments. And what's not conform to that Rule, leads to Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                     <p>MR. <hi>Graevius</hi> Professor at <hi>Vtretcht</hi> and the Author of this Commentary, is so famous amongst the Learned, that our Praises would add nothing to the Opinion that the Publick have conceiv'd of his desert: His Works and the Liberalities of the King which came to seek for him into the end of these Provinces, bear an Illustrious Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Capacity. He doth therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue here to give us his Corrections and his Notes upon all the Works of <hi>Cicero</hi>; and truly he could not make a better use of his Ability in these Sorts of matters, than in exercising it upon <hi>the Offices</hi> which are so fit to qualifie the Mind and Heart for the reception of Vertue. As his Works will be put in the Rank of the <hi>Dauphin's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,</hi> so it is dedicated to the <hi>Dauphin</hi>; and in his Epistle he assures him, that how famous soever his Ancestors have been, the Beauty of his Nature, and the Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Education he hath got, do promise to the Universe, that he will add a new Luster to the Glory of his Predecessours. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to him, that the true Happiness and most solid Glory of Kings consist in rendering their People happy; and that under him is expected a Reign as that of <hi>Titus,</hi> who was the love and delight of a Mankind.</p>
                     <p>The Author admonisheth us in this short Preface that he hath joined to the Offices of <hi>Cicero, Laelius, Cato, the Paradoxes and the Dream of Scipio.</hi> His first care was to reestablish the purity of the Text, and then to Illustrate it every where, by what Ancient and Modern Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103507:109"/>
have Writ most fine upon this part of Philosophy. For this purpose he made use of the Edition of <hi>Lange,</hi> which is the most correct; and he also hath consulted several Manuscripts, whereof he gives here the detail. He by the bye inveigheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those who despise the pains that is taken in correcting ancient Authors, and against those that entirely destroy the sense of them by too bold Corrections. These are two Extremities that must equally be avoided. We owe respect enough to the Ancients for not to pull asunder their Thoughts and Sentiments, and not to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute our Suspicions and Conjectures. But there is Superstition scrupulously to keep all their Words, or to spend our selves in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fine Sense in their most obscure Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. Notwithstanding it hath been seen that Expositors were more proud for re-establishing one Word in the Text of an Ancient Author, after having sweated much upon a Manuscript, than if they had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered some secret of Nature, or put forth some fine Precept of Morality.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Graevius,</hi> who perceived the Study of Scholiasts to be commonly dry and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, has intermixed with his Notes, very fine Lessons for the Conduct of Life; and to render the Matter more airy, he adds some Tracts of Literature. For Example, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> saith, That Anger ought to have no share in the correction of Superiors: Upon this the Author tells us this fine saying of <hi>Plato</hi> to his Man, <hi>I would beat you if I were not in Anger.</hi> He teacheth us that we must look upon Person's Faults with much Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and hate the Crime, without hating him that commits it: Upon these Words, <hi>Quae Natura occultavit eadem omnes qui sana mente sunt, removent ab Oceulis</hi>: He tells us, Modesty is given to Man to preserve his Honour and Reputation, because it includes a secret fear of Contempt and Infamy. And this fear is very often a stronger Bar than love to Vertue. Such is he, who feareth not the Reproaches of his own Heart, yet dreads the Judgments of the Publick; Shame perplexeth and presseth him, and this Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im is as true as it is Ingenuous, That Vertue would not go far, if Vanity did not keep her Company. He adds very curious things upon Nakedness, which offends Decency only by Custom, and that Idea that Men have of this State. In fine, the Reader is not wearied by perpetual Corrections, and a certain variety is found here which occurs very seldom in these sorts of Works.</p>

                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> The second Edition, at <hi>London, 1687.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THERE are many among the Ancients who have Writ upon the Lives of Philosophers, and we have explain'd their Sentiments; but there are very few whose Writings are come to our Hands, besides the Titles of Works which have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished upon this Subject, by <hi>Aetius, Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides, Antigonus, Antisthens, Aristocles, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoxenes, Callimachus, Clitomachus, Diocles, Heraclides, Hermippus, Idomeneus, Nicandre, Panaetius, Paphiras, Sotion</hi> and <hi>Theodorus.</hi> There remains only three entire Works on the History of Philosophy, <hi>viz. Diogenes Laertes,</hi> upon the <hi>Old, Eunapius</hi> upon the <hi>New,</hi> and an alphabetical Abridgment of <hi>Hesychius de Milet</hi> upon both together. 'Tis an hard Task to form a compleat History out of these three Authors, who have not spoken of all the Celebrated Philosophers of <hi>Greece,</hi> and who have not mentioned every thing that might be said even of those Lives which themselves have chosen to write upon; nor have they once menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the Eastern Philosophy, to which the <hi>Greeks</hi> have, according to their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, been indebted for all their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> Nephew of the famous <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham,</hi> Author of the <hi>Aegyptiac Canon,</hi> has undertaken to supply the defect as far as is possible, by collecting out of ancient Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings all that he cou'd find touching the Lives and Opinions of the ancient Philosophers, and joyning 'em to the Collections of those three Authors we have already mentioned: Our Author treats of the Philosophy of the <hi>Caldeans, Persians</hi> and <hi>Sabeans</hi>; the History of <hi>Egypt</hi> is only wanting to compleat the Eastern Philosophy; but he wou'd not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with that, since his Uncle (whom we have spoke of) has largly handled it in his <hi>Aegyptiac Canon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Work is divided into 14 Parts, in every one of which our Author treats of some Sect, whereof he makes an History, and explains their Opinions. The 1. treats of the <hi>Seven Sags,</hi> of <hi>Sosiades</hi> who collected their Precepts, and of <hi>Anacharsis.</hi> The 2. treats of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Sect, whereof <hi>Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandre</hi> was the Chief. The 3. of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and his Followers. The 4. of the <hi>Cyreneick Megarick, Elian</hi> and <hi>Eretrian</hi> Sects, which had but few Followers. The 5. of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and New <hi>Academy.</hi> The 6. of the <hi>Peripateticks.</hi> The 7. of the <hi>Cinics,</hi> of which he relates Nine, whereof <hi>Antisthenes</hi> was the first. The 8. of <hi>Zenon</hi> and other <hi>Stoics.</hi> The 9. of the <hi>Italic Sect,</hi> to which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> gave place. The 10. of <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the <hi>Ephesian Philosopher,</hi> whose Writings were so obscure that he had no Followers. The 11. of <hi>Zenophares, Parmenides, Melisses, Zenon</hi> of <hi>Elea, Democrites, Putagores,</hi> and of <hi>Anarchus.</hi> The 12. of <hi>Sceptic</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. The 13. of the Epicureans. The 14. and 15. following, of the <hi>Caldean, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> and <hi>Sabean</hi> Philosophy, which we shall be more large on; but to be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in these we have named, especially the 12 Sects, of which we shall begin with the <hi>Ionic,</hi> whereof <hi>Thales</hi> his Scholar <hi>Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menos</hi> was the Chief.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="191" facs="tcp:103507:109"/>Therefore we shall speak in the first place of <hi>Thales,</hi> who first deserved the Name of <hi>Wise</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi> Cities had as honourable a Quarrel for him, as that which fell out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Homer</hi>; for they disputed of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of having given birth to him. <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> saith that he was a <hi>Phoenician,</hi> but <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> wou'd have it that not one of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Wise Men</hi> should be born in <hi>Greece</hi>; and the most common Opinion is, that he was of <hi>Milot.</hi> He would never Marry, because without it Life is divided by a sufficient number of Cares, without entring into a Bond which draweth so many Sorrows after it. His Principle was, <hi>That Water is a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whose first Cause formed all Things</hi>; and he figured to himself this great Universe as a floating Vessel upon the Extent of Waters. He believed there was a God who had given Motion to every thing in Nature, and who animated the whole <hi>Machine.</hi> According to him there were two sorts of Souls, and his Sentiments thereupon were so obscure, that he gave a Soul to Amber and the Loadstone. To him it is that the Glory of the first Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Geometry is due, and the Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of measuring the Pyramides of <hi>Egypt</hi> by their Shadow. He it was that made the division of the five <hi>Zones,</hi> and that first gave natural Reasons for the Eclypses which so lone a time passed for fatal Signs of the Anger of Heaven. They also add, That he foretold that which ended the War betwixt the <hi>Lydians</hi> and <hi>Medians</hi>: For these People frighted at this Accident, believed that the Sun would no more give Light to their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and lay'd down their Arms. He found out very fine Sciences for the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and among others, the <hi>Art of Writing,</hi> which is pretended to be an Invention of this People, as Mr. <hi>Brebaeuf</hi> hath so pompously expressed in his Translation of <hi>Lucan.</hi> He was one day asked, What Recompense he would have for his rare Discoveries? And he declared, with the Gravity of <hi>Wise Men,</hi> That he expected but that of taking share of it with the Publick. Another asked him, What was most strong in Nature? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>Necessity</hi>: 'Tis a hard Law more powerful than Reason, which draggeth with Violence and Rapidity. He lived in the 35 Olympiad, which answers, as I take it, to the year of the World 3310.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>Anaxander,</hi> who began the Stoic Sect, was Disciple to <hi>Thales</hi>; tho' he admitted not of the Principles of his Master, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cleared well his Sentiments. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that he discovered the obliquity of the <hi>Zodiack.</hi> Mr. <hi>De Saumaise</hi> contests with him about <hi>Clocks,</hi> and maintains that Hours were not in use till a long time after.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>Socrates</hi> was the Head of the second Sect, and the first that cultivated Morality, that part of Philosophy, so necessary for the ruling our Manners. He was the Son of a Statuary of <hi>Athens</hi>; but he raised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self above his Birth by the Beauty of his <hi>Genius.</hi> He had an Opinion of God very pure, and withstood with all his Might the Plurality of Gods. It was in effect the principal Accusation that his Enemies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med against him, and we may say that he was one of the first Martyrs for the <hi>Vnity of God</hi>: Wherefore some Fathers of the Church have believed that he is saved. And learned <hi>Erasmus</hi> saith very pleasantly, That at every time he read the fine end of this Philosopher, he was ready to cry out, St. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates pray to God for us.</hi> So he dyed with a Tranquility which marked the Calmness of his Soul, and the Empire of his Reason over his Passions. Notwithstanding some have said, That he being by Honour enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not to fear Death, he out-braved it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly, that the Emotion he inwardly feit might not outwardly appear: He was very much laughed at by <hi>Aristophanes</hi> upon the Theatre of <hi>Athens,</hi> and he dyed in the 88 Olympiad, to wit, in the year of the World, 3522.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>Aristippus</hi> was the Head of that which is called <hi>Cyrenaick,</hi> and Disciple to <hi>Socrates.</hi> He would have the Soveraign Good to consist in Pleasure, and he led his Life upon these Sentiments, for he passed it in Delights and Pastimes. He fell in Love with that famous <hi>Lais,</hi> who would sell so dear one Nights Lodging to <hi>Demosthenes.</hi> So being one day Imbarqued to go to see her, and seeing the Ship terribly tossed by foul Weather, he gave up himself to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations and Complaints: As an Amorous Design conducted him, perhaps he would have greived less to dye at his Return. Howbeit the Pilot less frighted, began to make him Remonstrances, and to propose himself as an Example of Firmness, which made this Philosopher ashamed. But <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stippus</hi> scornfully answered him, <hi>Thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardest but a vile and mercenary Soul, but I hazard a Soul of the first Degree, and a Life accompanied with Prosperities.</hi> He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged but two Passions as two great Springs which give Motion to all the rest, <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi>; and these two Passions are diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified in all Men according to their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments. He would reject the Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soul so much boasted of by other Philosophers, as an Imaginary good: 'Twas according to him a <hi>tedious Indolence.</hi> Doth it not seem that he had Reason? For what is there more Languishing, than to wish for nothing and even to fear nothing? The Passions do spread a certain Fire over all the Actions, which render them more lively and more acceptable. In a word, nothing was so offensive to the Gust of this Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, than that austere Vertue which makes the Soveraign Good to consist in the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Evil, and in a certain Firmness which deserveth but the Name of Insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>Plato</hi> was the Head of the Academists, who have drawn their Name from the place he first established his School. Some relate, That his Mother conceived him by strength of Imagination, because she had looked on a Statue of <hi>Apollo</hi> with too much Curiosity: Others have said, That as Women often had the Art to make their Husbands believe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103507:110"/>
that Gods were willing to accompany with Mortals, the Mother of <hi>Plato</hi> failed not to make her self Honour by a Visit from <hi>Apollo</hi> in her Husbands Mind: That is to say, he was a Young Man as handsom as <hi>Apollo.</hi> Howbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t, it's most certain he was of a most Illustrious Birth, and as he had not much hardship of Fortune, his Heart was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the more peaceable and his Conduct the more vertuous. After having sometime heard <hi>Socrates,</hi> he travailed every where to hear the most famous Orators. It's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd that he had much Light out of the Books of <hi>Moses</hi>; therefore he was named the <hi>Athenian</hi> Moses, and that he was the Inventer of the <hi>Dialogue.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> maintains that he only refined it, because it was then very dry and insipid; he conceived the Earth to be of a round Figure; he found out that it was necessary there should be <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and invented the Name of it. He distinguished the Elements, which <hi>Thales</hi> had confounded, and was the first that made use of the Term <hi>Providence.</hi> He said that God was an Eternal Principle, ineffable, and the immoveable source of Truth. And that which caused this great Veneration which Men had for him in the first Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, is, That he attributed to God a Son, whose Power reached over all Creatures. He added, That God had formed the World of a Matter before confused, but Eternal, and setled this fine order in the Elements. Yet he gave the World a Soul which from the Centre reaches unto Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. Finally he held, That as Man was the Master-piece of the Works of God, so he had taken a particular care to form him. He furnished him with the five Senses, to procure him Pleasures and to defend him from exteriour Bodies; and hath placed the Soul in the Brains as upon the Throne, to rule over the Senses and Passions.

His Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures have been so various, that it's a hard thing to comprehend that so different Judgments have been given on the same Men. He saw himself, in a manner, raised unto the Clouds, and afterwards precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the lowest Stations. According to the Relation of <hi>Baronius,</hi> the <hi>Aetians</hi> were excommunicated for having made their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to read him. Yet he is come into so high a degree of respect with Men, that Doctor <hi>Ramus</hi> was banish'd by the King's Declaration, for having written against him. <hi>Boileau</hi> jeers at the Understanding of our Age, in which a thousand People think that without <hi>Aristotle, Reason can do nothing, and good Sense is Madness.</hi>

Yet how great Glory soever Antiquity would have for this Philosopher, he can be scarcely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired seriously. The common Abode he made in a Tub, and the Lanthorn he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at Noon-day to look for a Man of Worth, have something so conceited, that a very high Idea cannot be conceived of his Sentiments.

                     <p n="7">VII. <hi>Zeno</hi> was the head of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and taught in the Porch of <hi>Athens.</hi> This Philosophy hath formed great Men, and hath charmed many by the Haughtiness and Pride of its Sentences. It pretended to render its Proselytes happy in the midst of Torments, and unshaken against all the Darts of Fortune. <hi>Zeno</hi> did establish a God, whose Vertues are all expressed diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently according to the different Idea of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He was Neptune at Sea, <hi>Mars</hi> in Battles, and <hi>Vulcan</hi> in the Fire. In his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion Vertue was the Supream Good, because it hath goods more lasting, and that 'tis it only that renders Men Immortal. He held that the Machin of the World will be one day destroyed, and that it will perish by Flames. The proud Empire he gave Man over himself and Reason, was the Source of this dangerous Maxim, <hi>that Men may kill themselves.</hi> We must notwithstanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that in this was some I know not what grandeur of the Soul, capable of dazling those who seek but the brightness of Pagan Vertues. Must not one have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage to insult Death, this frightfull image that terrifieth the most resolute? After what way did <hi>Zeno</hi> instruct his followers for Glory and Vertue? He would have 'em wrestle against Evils, and to harden themselves under Stripes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Invincible: As Prosperities were only proper for low Souls, so it belongs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to great Souls to trample under Foot all Calamities and Disgraces. He dyed in the 129. Olympiad, about the Year of the World, 3690.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Phythagoras</hi> was the head of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans</hi> or the <hi>Stalian Sect.</hi> It's believed he was of <hi>Samos</hi> and a Jew by birth. He lived a long time with the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to be instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Mysteries. Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> relates that he was made Prisoner there by <hi>Camby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> who sent him into <hi>Babylon,</hi> where he had a great commerce with the <hi>Magi</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and even with the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel.</hi> He was of all Men the best shaped and drew the Veneration of all People by his fair appearance. He of all Philosophers had the greatest number of Disciples. His Principal Opinion was the <hi>Metempsychosis</hi> or Transmigration of Souls. As he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Soul Immortal, he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it could subsist separate from the Body. Therefore he thought expedient to make the Souls of Men to return into Beasts, and them of Beasts into Men, tho these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions had no certain order. We know the Ridiculous History that he told of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he had been <hi>Euphorbes</hi> at the War of <hi>Troy.</hi> He particularly applyed himself to the study of Mathematicks, as a Science sit to give extent to the Mind. He tryed his Disciples by a Rigorous Silence of two years, to make 'em more grave and retentive. Temperance was the Vertue he recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with most care, because it is necessary to tame the Body. Therefore he used to get a Table full of Dainties for his Disciples, and making them to sit down, they should rise from it without touching any thing, to exercise their Vertue by so strong a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He lived in the time that <hi>Brutus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered <hi>Rome</hi> from the Tyranny of it's Kings in the Year of the World 3440.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> had so fine Temper that he had all his Learning of himself without the help of any Instruction. But he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived so high an Opinion of himself, that he had nothing but contempt for the rest of Men. His Humour being accompanied with Pride and Distast, gave him so much hatred for all Mankind, that he retired all alone unto a Mountain to be free from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of any. Therefore he was called the Dark <hi>Philosopher. Darius Hydaspis</hi> writ to him to come to Court; but he answered him after an abrupt and saucy manner. Such a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as is troublesome to other Men must be afflicting to it self; a sad Delicatness suffers every where. It is better to have a tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vertue, and let things go as they will, than on purpose to quarrel with all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. <hi>Democritus</hi> was the Head of the <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Sect. He had a Countenance always smil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and made the Sovereign Good consist in a Position of Mind that was always at rest. It hath been said, that he looked on the World with a Jearing Laughter, which made his Wisdom to be doubted of, and caused his Fellow-Citizens the <hi>Abderites</hi> to send for <hi>Hypocrates</hi> to cure him. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving shewn his <hi>Diacosmus,</hi> the finest of his Works, the Opinion that they had of his Folly was turned into Admiration. The cause of his immoderat Laughters was the vanity of this World, and the pains that Men take to run after perishable things. It was he that invented Atoms, adding that they wandred in a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and were afterwards entangled with one another, whence the Universe was composed. So that Atoms and a Vacuum were the beginning of all things.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. <hi>Pyrrhon,</hi> chief of the <hi>Pyrrhonians</hi> or <hi>Scepticks,</hi> pretended that Man only judged of all things by the appearance of Truth and Falshood. Upon that he established a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension of Mind that hindred himself from determining. It seems that all his Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty consisted in finding out pretty Reasons of doubting: But there was danger that this incertainty should extend it self to things which are not permitted to be Questioned, as the <hi>Power of the Laws.</hi> He lived in the time of <hi>Epicurus</hi> in the 120. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> to wit the year of the World 3650.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. <hi>Epicurus,</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> head of the Sect which bore his name, hath composed more Books than the other Philosophers. He made the supream Good to consist in the Pleasure accompanied with Vertue. His Opinion is ill interpreted, and his Disciples have abused it, which hath made this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103507:111"/>
to be discried as a Source of Debauch and Impurities. But, saith Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> the weakness of his Complexion, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Sobriety, drive away altogether such unjust Suspicions. The Altars that were builded to him after his Death do not agree with the Repute of <hi>Voluptuous.</hi> It's true he attributed much to the Empire of Sense, and maintained that when the Sense judged of simple Objects we ought not to doubt of their fidelity. But he would not have Reason to be subject to their Will. He used to moderate the severity of Wisdom by honest Recreations, to render it amiable, and would not have Vertue to be painted with an Austere Face and with a Forehead always wrinkled. In short, the Soul is so engaged in Sense and Matter, that this Philosophy is too fine, which in a manner, unmans a Man, and deprives him of all his Senses. This hath made his followers nothing but <hi>Idea</hi>; for they often perceive that they have a Body as other Men have, which troubleth and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth them so much the more as they have a desire of giving all to the Mind. It must therefore be allowed that Wisdom it self may sometimes Laugh without offence. Every one knoweth that he admitted for Principle a <hi>Vacuum</hi> and <hi>Atoms.</hi> The <hi>Vacuum,</hi> because if all was full, there would have been no Motion. The Atoms, because according to him, <hi>nothing is made of nothing.</hi> He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that the World cannot be eternal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it bears sensible Marks of Novelty: We know, for Example, the birth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of Arts and Sciences. He pretended that Providence medled with nothing, but leaves all things to Chance.</p>
                     <p>The Ancients agreed not amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about the time in which <hi>Zoroaster</hi> lived, and our Author relates all along and at the same time resutes their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: After all he subscribes to the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those which place it 600. Years before the Expedition of <hi>Zerxes</hi> against the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which goes back to the Year 3634 from the <hi>Iulian</hi> Period, that is to say, about the times of <hi>Samuel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Very little as yet is known concerning the Life of <hi>Zoroaster. Plato</hi> calls him the Son of <hi>Oromazes,</hi> but this is the Name which <hi>Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> gave to the <hi>Divinity,</hi> (whose Son tis said he was.) for the Veneration he had for him. <hi>Plin.</hi> lib. 36. c. 1. says, that he laughed the same day he was born, and that his Brain beat with such Violence that it lift up the Hands of such as toucht it; a presage of Learning which one day he was to be Master of. He liv'd 20 Years in a Desart without growing aged; for having wish't to dye by Thunder, Heaven heard his Prayer: But before that, he advertiz'd the <hi>Syrians</hi> to keep his Ashes very carefully, assuring them, that their Empire should continue so long as they regarded that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. <hi>Suidas</hi> attributes this Advertisment to <hi>Zoroaster</hi> of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Cedrenus</hi> to him of the <hi>Persians.</hi> He composed two Millions of Verses, which were delivered in Greek, and upon which <hi>Hermippus</hi> made a Commentary. But some say, that the Oracles upon which <hi>Syrianus</hi> wrote 12 Books, made some of these Verses. There are some other Books attributed to him, which are evidently supposititious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Africanus</hi> says that 'twas <hi>Belus</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Astronomy, and that this Prince lived in the times of <hi>Deborah</hi>; according to this Author, <hi>Belus</hi> began his Raign <hi>Anno Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi> 2682. There were yet some other <hi>Magi</hi> of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> who were sufficiently cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated amongst the Greeks, but the Names of 'em are only remaining.</p>
                     <p>He who first brought the Sciences of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> was <hi>Berose,</hi> a Priest of <hi>Belus</hi>; he taught 'em Astronomy and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy in the Isle of <hi>Co,</hi> and composed three Books, in which he finisht the History of the <hi>Medes. Iosephus preserved</hi> some of his Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his Books against <hi>Appion</hi>; they were dedicated to <hi>Antiochus</hi> under the name of <hi>GOD KING OF ASSYRIA,</hi> under whom he liv'd, as Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> believes; tho other Authors say that he lived under <hi>Antiochus Soter.</hi> We ought yet to take care, that we confound not this <hi>Berose</hi> with that of <hi>Annius</hi> of <hi>Viterbe,</hi> which every Body knows to be fictitious and full of <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi> Fables.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> assures us, that the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Sybil,</hi> who gave her Oracles at <hi>Cames,</hi> was his Daughter; if it is true, then there was another Sybil besides that which lived in the times of <hi>Tarquin the Old,</hi> who lived two hundred and fifty Years before <hi>Berose. Onuphrius</hi> proves that there had been many Sybils.</p>
                     <p>Altho the name of <hi>Chaldeans</hi> properly belonged to a whole Nation, yet it was given in particular to certain Philosophers who liv'd retir'd in separate places, and were exempt from Imposts and publick Charges: They were particular Families which communicated their Knowledg to their Children, after such a manner, that it spread not to other Families, but only passed from <hi>Father to Son.</hi> They might thus perfect their Sciences better than by admitting Strangers in their Schools; and 'tis said that this practice is now used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Chinese</hi> in respect of their Trades.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greeks,</hi> who have spoken thereof, as <hi>Strabo,</hi> distinguish the different Sects of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> according to the places where they lived. There was of 'em at <hi>Hipparena, Orchoe, Babylon</hi> and <hi>Borsippa,</hi> Cities of <hi>Meso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia</hi> and <hi>Chaldea.</hi> They were not all of the same Opinion, if we may believe <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Lucretius,</hi> who says (<hi>lib.</hi> 5.) that in case there was no fault of the Copiest in this Work, the <hi>Babylonians</hi> refuted the Doctrin of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> touching Astrology

                     <p>The <hi>Babylonians</hi> gave diverse Names to these Sects, and some of 'em may be seen in the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> but the signification

                        </hi> tells us, that <hi>Zoroaster</hi> divided all <hi>Beings</hi> into three Orders. There is one, saith he, which is Eternal without beginning or end. Some have had a beginning, which will never end; But others shall have an end as they have a beginning. Divinity hath for its object the two first Orders; And Natural Philosophy the last.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> affirm'd but one only Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all things, full of Goodness, and Wisdom. To represent its perfections they gave it the Name of <hi>Fire</hi> and of <hi>Light,</hi> which is the Reason that in those Oracles that yet remain amongst us, we often find God spoken of in these <hi>Synonimous</hi> terms, <hi>The Light, the Rays, the Brightness of the Father, Paternal Fire, the only Fire, the first and supream of all Fires.</hi> When any one demanded of 'em af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner they apprehended the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, He Answered, <hi>that his Body resembled Fire, and his Soul the Truth.</hi> From whence it may be, they understood that God was Goodness it self, or the <hi>Chaldean</hi> word which they Translate for <hi>Truth,</hi> signifies <hi>Goodness</hi>: and that it appeared adorned with Fire. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> speak after the same manner, when they say God is a <hi>Consuming Fire,</hi> that he is full of Goodness <hi>and Truth,</hi> as is plain by many places of Scripture. It seems its for that Reason the Ancient <hi>Persians</hi> ador'd him under the form of a Fire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out erecting any Statue to him, as will evidently appear by what follows.</p>
                     <p>Besides the Unity of the first Fire, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd a kind of Trinity; and were us'd to say, that there was a Triple Trinity, each whereof had a <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Power,</hi> and a <hi>Spirit.</hi> They call'd the first kind of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>Teletarques.</hi> The Oracles which remain amongst us call these <hi>Iyngues, Ideas</hi>; and say, that they were the Intelligible Models upon which the World was made by other <hi>Idea's,</hi> which were call'd the <hi>second Ideas,</hi> as also the first, <hi>Original Ideas.</hi> The <hi>Synoques,</hi> which the Oracles called <hi>Anoques,</hi> are also of three orders, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the three Worlds which they Govern; the <hi>Empirean,</hi> which Govern the <hi>Empirean World</hi>; the <hi>Ethereal,</hi> which Rule the <hi>Ethereal World,</hi> and the <hi>Material</hi> which animate the <hi>Material World.</hi> A little after we shall explain the Nature of these Worlds. 3. The third Degree contains <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent things,</hi> which were also call'd <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogogues,</hi> Governors of the World. There were divers Ranks of 'em, according to the <hi>Chaldeans. The first Supreme; Hecate, the second supreme</hi>: The three <hi>Amilictes,</hi> that is to say, <hi>which cannot be softned,</hi> and the last called <hi>Hypezoces,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Girt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,</hi> which the Oracles call'd <hi>Flower of Fire</hi>: These are in the <hi>Material World</hi> to preserve it and give it those regular Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which it hath. Under these <hi>Cosmogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> are other Intelligent Beings, which the <hi>Chaldees</hi> call <hi>Fountains</hi> or <hi>Sources.</hi> In the Number of which they agree not. Under these <hi>Fountains</hi> are the <hi>Hyperarques,</hi> or <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities.</hi> They call some of these <hi>Spiritual Beings</hi> the <hi>Fountains</hi> or <hi>Architypes of Souls and Vertues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the <hi>Hyperarques</hi> are the <hi>Gods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Zone,</hi> and the <hi>Gods ty'd to a Zone,</hi> both of 'em are in the Material World; but the first have an equal Power above all <hi>Zones,</hi> whereas the last, are confin'd in a certain Extension in which they Circulate with Matter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chaldees</hi> place next, the <hi>Angels and immaterial Demons.</hi> They believe that of these there are both good and bad; they say that the good are <hi>Light,</hi> and the bad <hi>Darkness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In fine, this last Range of Beings contains <hi>Souls</hi>: There are of three sorts in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, the <hi>Celestial Intelligences,</hi> which are never united to Matter; others which are united to Matter, and which are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, being Indivisible and Immortal, capable to will and determine of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And lastly, others, which depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Matter, and which may be destroyed with it.</p>
                     <p>There are two Causes or Origines of Humane Souls, <hi>the Paternal Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Fountain of Souls,</hi> which produces them by order of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> As they believ'd that there were places in the World distinct for the habitation of <hi>Intelligences,</hi> which we have spoken of, so they say that Souls come from Spaces which are above the Moon, and which are wholly replete with Light; whereas the Region of this Planet is partly Light and party Dark, as an Extent which is always covered with Clouds and Night.</p>
                     <p>'Tis from these places of Darkness that Humane Souls descend, because their Wings have lost their force; that is to say, because these Souls have not kept their Primitive Perfection, and obey'd the Will of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> they never leave an Ethereal Body in which they are invested, and which is as their Vehicle. This Body is yet animated by another Species of Soul, which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reason, and which contains the Sense,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103507:112"/>
the Imagination, and all the Faculties which do not necessarily belong to Reason; the Sages call'd this Soul an <hi>Idol</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> of the Rational Soul. 'Tis by this that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Soul is untied to the Body, which we take from our Mother's Breasts; this unites the Ethereal Body to that of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> to which it stays conjoyn'd until the grosser Body be destroy'd.</p>
                     <p>Thus if the Souls thrown Headlong down from the Spaces which are above the Moon into the Places which we inhabit, do well acquit the Duty they owe to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Divinity, then they are restor'd unto the same place from whence they came. On the contrary, if they corrupt themselves more, they are sent into yet darker Aboads.</p>
                     <p>We have said, That these Intelligences had Places destin'd for their Habitation: And thus 'twas the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> divided the World, and the Limits where they plac'd those Eternal Spirits. They believ'd, That above the Corporal World was in Infinite extended Light, which they call'd, <hi>The Light above the World,</hi> that was properly the residence of Spirits. This Light they call'd an Image <hi>of the Paternal Profundity,</hi> that is, the Immensity of the first Being.</p>
                     <p>Temporal, or Corporal Things, held the third and last Rank in the general division of Beings. All included in seven corporal Worlds, situate under that Light just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, according to this Order, 1. The <hi>Empyrean,</hi> or World of Fire: Three Etherial Worlds. 2. The Supream Aether. 3. The Sphere of the fixt Stars. 4. The Orbs or Planets: Three Sublunary Worlds. 5. The Air. 6. The Earth. And 7. the Waters. Some Christian Divines have confounded the Empyreal Heaven, which they make the Abode of God and of the Blessed, with that Light above the World; but the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> distinguish them very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. According to their Opinion, the Empyreal World is very different from the Ethereal, altho' this last is less pure and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle than the Precedent. As for the Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Worlds, <hi>Psellus</hi> tells us, That the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> sometimes gave them a Name which the <hi>Greeks</hi> translated by the word <hi>Hades,</hi> or Hell.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> acknowledg'd two sorts of Demons, one Good, the other Bad; <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanus</hi> a Persian Magi, call'd the first, <hi>The Ministers and Messengers of God,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in his Presence. But the second, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Demons, who incessantly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Error in this Sublunary World, and which are Enemies to Mankind. They call'd their Head <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>Ariman,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>The Enemy of Men</hi>; for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which properly signifies a <hi>Vessel,</hi> may Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally signifie a Man.</p>
                     <p>There are six sorts of 'em, 1. Those which they call <hi>Fiery,</hi> inhabiting the upper Region of the Air, above which they cannot ascend, altho' they are chas'd by the Intelligences which reside about the Moon. 2. Those that are in the Inferior Air in which we live, and which is call'd <hi>Aereal.</hi> The Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. 4. Those of the Sea, which abide in the Water. 5. The Subterraneous. 6. Those that sly the Light, and such as are very seldom visible. Altho' they are all Enemies to God and Man, some are much more Wicked than the rest. The three last kinds particularly are very pernicious, and not only deceive Men by Fantoms and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, but also sometimes even enter into 'em. Those of the Water, causing Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecks; such as are under the Earth, and who fly the Light, often possess Men, causing Epilepses and Frensies: The Terrestrial and Aereal Spirits precipitate Men into unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Passions, and deceive them by appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.</p>
                     <p>They act, saith <hi>Psellus,</hi> by disturbing our Imaginations, entertaining us without any Voice or Noise. Those which speak to us afar off must raise a Voice to move our Ears, but such as are near may make us hear by speaking very low; but those which can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess our Brain make us understand without any Noise, tracing certain Objects into our Imaginations without affecting our Ears. That is, that Souls separated from Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Bodies, entertain themselves without Voice or Words.</p>
                     <p>They make their Bodies what they please, and assume what Forms most agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 'em; some enter into Beasts, not that they hate them, but because the Natural Heat of Animals please them as well as the Humidity they meet with there, for their ordinary Habitations are cold and dry Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Subterreanean Spirits cause those Persons to speak which they possess, and make use of their Mouths to give out their pretended Oracles. Those which fly the Light render their Patients Deaf and Dumb; and often make them fall into Soundings.</p>
                     <p>All have not the same Extent of Power, but it's diminish'd much according to the degrees I have observ'd. The Demons that fly the Light have the least of all. They transfer themselves so much the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly as their Power is less or more: It's believ'd that from one of these Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations proceeded what the Greeks relate of <hi>Proteus,</hi> the <hi>Nexeiades, Naides,</hi> and other Nymphs. The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> fanci'd the Demons suffer'd when they hurt their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, altho' the Wound was cur'd again immediately; for their Bodies are like the Water, the parts whereof are no sooner separated but they joyn again in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>We may see by these Particulars of the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Divinity, that their Thoughts concerning Good and Evil, were not very different from the Opinion of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> For Example, in respect to the <hi>Good</hi> they had divers Orders of them, <hi>As Angels, Arch-Angels, Thrones, Dominations, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Powers,</hi> which are spoken of in the New Testament. The <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as well as the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> gave Kingdoms and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Extents of the Earth, to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103507:112"/>
of Angels, as appears by <hi>Daniel.</hi> And like to them they plac'd the Evil Spirits in the Air, from when they are call'd <hi>Powers of the Air, Princes of this World,</hi> that is, of the sublunary World, <hi>Princes of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Hebrews</hi> also determin'd the ordinary abode of the Divinity to be above the fix'd Stars, and represented God dwelling in <hi>an inaccessible Light,</hi> environ'd with Ministers, which they call'd, as the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> did, <hi>Angels of Light.</hi> They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd three Heavens or three Worlds, so the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> divided the Universe into the <hi>Terrestrial, Ethereal,</hi> and <hi>Empyreal.</hi> As for the Evil Angels, its well known that the <hi>Iews</hi> believed divers Orders, and that they formerly attributed unto them the cause of many Diseases, as is evident by the great number of the <hi>Demoniacks,</hi> which is spoken of in the Evangelists, where also several other things may be observed concerning Demons, which agrees not ill with the Doctrin of the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> According to the Conjectures of some learn'd Men the <hi>Iews</hi> receiv'd these Opinions, and some resembling ones from <hi>them</hi> in the <hi>Babilonian</hi> Captivity. All that can be objected against this supposition is, that perhaps the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Oracles, whereof we have spoken, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways suspected by the <hi>Iews</hi> and Christians and that the Explication of <hi>Plethon</hi> and <hi>Psellus</hi> were not true. This may be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly opposed to this last authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is said to have learnt from a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Chaldean,</hi> what we have related of the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Divinity. But for the Oracles we shall afterwards shew the Reasons why our Author believes they were not Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sititious; and as for the Doctrin, it may easily be prov'd that the <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophers who made Voyages into the East, brought Opinions from thence perfectly like the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>: As may be demonstrated without much trouble in respect to <hi>Pythagoras</hi> &amp; <hi>Plato.</hi>

                     <p n="3">III. To return again to our Author, he afterwards gives an Abridgment of the <hi>Astronomy</hi> and Physicks of the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> As the Heavens in that Country are very rarely troubled with Mists or Clouds, so the Learned applyed themselves to <hi>Astronomy</hi> which they pretend to have invented. But if what <hi>Diodorus of Sicily</hi> says is true, they were not so expert in the Art as the <hi>Greeks</hi> were, after they'd learnt the Principles of 'em. Because the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> gave very ill Reasons for the Eclipses of the Sun, and durst not predict, nor reduce them to certain Periods. For <hi>Astrology,</hi> or <hi>Apote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesmaticks,</hi> that is to say, the Art of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, wherein it was more easie to impose upon the Credulous, if they attributed it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their Knowledg, and boasted to have read such and such Events in the Stars.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Stanly</hi> gives here an Abridgment of their Doctrin drawn from <hi>Diodorus of Sicily,</hi> and fom <hi>Sextus Empiricus.</hi> They believed there was a great <hi>Sympathy</hi> between the Stars, and what inhabits the Earth, so that <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Bodies depended upon the Course and Vertue of the <hi>Celestial.</hi> They joyn the Planets, sixt Stars, and Signs of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> together; And maintain that our whole life had a dependence thereon, and that nothing happened to us, whereof they were not the Cause. The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> placed twelve Gods in the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> to each of which they assign'd a Month, and a Sign of the <hi>Zodiack.</hi> They said also that there were twenty four Constellations, one half where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was in the Northern Hemisphere; and the other in the Southern. The twelve which appear'd upon our Hemisphere, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided over the living, and the twelve which were invisible, over the Dead. They call'd these last <hi>the Iudges of all things.</hi> But they had a great regard to the Planets, the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual course whereof, according to their Opinion, caused the inequality of Life. They much observed their rising, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and their Colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to predict all things by that. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Planets they held there were thirty Stars, which they call'd <hi>the Counsellers of the Gods</hi>: Whereof one half that was under the Earth, presided over what passed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and the other half that was above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded what was done in Heaven and upon the Earth. Every tenth day one of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Gods, went to relate to those below what was done above, and they made use of the same Conveniency on the other side. These Stars had these regulated Motions according to the Eternal Revolutions.</p>
                     <p>In our Author are the particulars of their Opinion concerning the divisions of the <hi>Zodiack</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the agreement they thought it had with the Planets from their Aspects, and with their manner of drawing <hi>Horoscopes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides the Art of foretelling by the Stars, the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> knew how to Divine by the Flight and Notes of Birds, by Dreams, Prodigies, and Entrails of Victims, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the report of <hi>Diodorus. R. Moses Son</hi> of <hi>Maimon</hi> affirms the same thing in his <hi>More Nebochim,</hi> and also attributes to 'em other ways of divining, the Names whereof are in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11.</p>
                     <p>The Physicks of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> was call'd Magic. There was two Sorts thereof, one <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> and the other <hi>Theurgick</hi>; The first was only a knowledg of the Virtue of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, of the disposition of Animals, and of the Power of Minerals. But this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg was mixt with many Superstitious Opinions, if we may believe <hi>Maimonides,</hi> who hath discoursed their Operations at large, and in our Author we may read his Words. Such was their Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Talismans,</hi> which are certain Figures, or Letters graved at certain times, that they believed 'em able to defend 'em from divers Evils. In the Persian Tongue they are called <hi>Tsilmenaja,</hi> and in <hi>Arabick Tsalima,</hi> Words that come from the same root with the <hi>Hebrew Tselein,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies an Image. This may be seen in <hi>Gaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farel</hi>'s Book, entituled, <hi>Vnheard of Curiosities</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. One may reduce the Religion of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to three kinds. The first is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the true God, but after an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Manner. The second, the Worship of <hi>Demons</hi> and Spirits; and the third is that of Celestial Bodies, and the Elements.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> as hath been already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, acknowledging one only Principle of all things, all powerful and good, it follows, that they must acknowledg the true God: and 'tis for this Reason that an Oracle that <hi>Porphiry</hi> cites, joyns them to the Jews, <hi>and</hi> says, <hi>that there's none but the</hi> Chaldeans and <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>that adore that God and King who subsists by himself.</hi> But the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> adored him under the Name of an Idol, that they call'd <hi>Bel,</hi> which is the same as <hi>Baal</hi> of the <hi>Phenicians.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> also Worship'd him under the same Name, in the time of the Kings, and were reprehended for it by the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> who tells them in the Name of the God of <hi>Israel, you shall no more call me, My Baali,</hi> Ch. 2.16. Those who instructed the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the Opinions and Customs of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> wou'd have it that they call'd the Supream Divinity <hi>Bel,</hi> they gave him the Name of <hi>Zeus,</hi> which was the Name that the <hi>Greeks</hi> gave to the Chief of their God's.

                     <p>In the third place they believed, that the seven Planets were animated by the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which they made use of, as if they were Bodies; the greatest were those which inhabited the Sun and Moon; they had the same thoughts in respect to the sixt Stars. But they confest they cou'd not prove this Worship of the Stars so distinctly as the rest; as the Readers may see more at large in Mr. <hi>Stanley.</hi>

                     <p>Some Ancients say that they Worshiped the Air and the Earth, as <hi>Iulius Firmicus</hi> and <hi>Macrobius</hi>; but these Authors, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the last, do very much Confound the Divinity of all Nations without either Reason or Necessity, and might have attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Sentiments of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> Even some of 'em to maintain <hi>Paganism</hi> have taken great pains to shew, that all the Worshippers of many Gods did agree, and they also hop'd to answer the Objection of the Christians who accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them of the Diversity of Opinions.

                        <hi>Suidas</hi> relate something to this effect, which deserves to be taken notice of here. 'Tis, that in the times of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> certain <hi>Chaldean</hi> Priests ran through all the Empire, to shew to other Pagans, that the God of <hi>Chaldea</hi> was mightier than all the Gods, because the Fire that they Worship consum'd all the Statues of other
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103507:113"/>
Gods. In fine, being come into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and having deify'd the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests to expose to the Fire the Statues of their Gods, one of these Priests triumphed over their Vanity by this Artifice. He took a Statue of the <hi>Nile,</hi> made it hollow within, and pierced it in divers Places: He clos'd up these Holes with Wax, so exactly, that they cou'd not be perceived, and fill'd the Statue with Water. Afterwards he took the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> at their Word, and surrounded his Statue with Fire, so that the Wax melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left free passage to the Water, which soon issued out and extinguished the Fire.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> employs the 16th and 17th Part of his Work, in giving an Account of the Philosophy of the <hi>Persians,</hi> which we shall make an Abridgment of in few Words.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In speaking of the Origin of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> it was observed there were many <hi>Zoroasters:</hi> And so it was they call'd the ancient Sages of the <hi>Persians,</hi> who Instituted the Order of the <hi>Magi. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chrysostom</hi> in his <hi>Dorysthenick</hi> Harangue, said,
<q>That the <hi>Persians</hi> affirm'd that <hi>Love, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> had quitted the Commerce of Men, and that they were retir'd into a Mountain, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there alone a long time: But when they had quitted it, a great Fire came down from Heaven, which inviron'd it from all Parts: That the King and Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Persians,</hi> going thither to invoke the Divinity, <hi>Zoroaster</hi> came out of this Fire, without receiving any Damage, and offer'd a Sacrifice, as if God had been present with him: That from that time he conversed no more with any sort of Men, but only those that were naturally more enclin'd to seek the Truth, and capable of knowing the Gods, as were those that the <hi>Persians</hi> call'd <hi>Magi.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The certain time of this <hi>Zorasters</hi>'s Life is not known. Another wise Man call'd <hi>Hystaspes,</hi> that liv'd in the Court of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> much augmented the Learning of the <hi>Magi</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> by the Sciences that he learnt of the <hi>Brachmans,</hi> when he went into <hi>India.</hi> He that discover'd these Sciences to the <hi>Greeks</hi> was one <hi>Otanes,</hi> who accompany'd <hi>Zerxes</hi> in the Enterprise he made upon <hi>Greece.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophers that frequented the <hi>Persians</hi> before that time, either conceal'd what they had learnt, or else had not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated into their Mysteries.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Magi</hi> were apply'd wholly to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Gods, and their Name accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some Ancients signifies the same as that of <hi>Priest.</hi> They mingled not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with other <hi>Persians,</hi> nor never Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd but to Persons of their own Sect, and liv'd in Towns separate from others. They were in very great Esteem; they Instructed the Kings before they took the Government upon them, and were call'd to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. Their Life as to the rest, was very simple: They liv'd only upon Milk, Wheat, Fruits and Bread.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to what regarded the Supream Divinity, they seem'd to have had the same Thoughts of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>; for <hi>Zoroaster</hi> in his <hi>Sacred Collections,</hi> affirms, according to the Report of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> That God is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, Eternal, Indivisible, most Wise, most Good, Father of Equity and Justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He divided all Things into three Orders: The first Eternal, without Beginning or End; others that have had a Beginning, but shall have no End: The last, which are Corruptible. <hi>Oromazes</hi> was the Head of the first: <hi>Mithra,</hi> or the Sun, presided over the Second; and <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> over the Third.</p>
                     <p>'Tis <hi>Plutarch</hi> that tells us that of <hi>Zoroaster</hi>; but 'tis dangerous to trust wholly to the <hi>Greeks</hi> in these sort of Things which they understood but by halves, and wherein they might easily confound the Doctrin of a People with that of its Neighbours.</p>
                     <p>However, be it as it will, the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor relates, That the Sages of <hi>Persia</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd two Principles, the one opposite to the other, whereof one was Good and the other Evil. He call'd the first <hi>Oromazes,</hi> and the second <hi>Arimanes,</hi> and said, That among sensible things, nothing so well represented <hi>Oromazes,</hi> as <hi>Knowledge and the Light</hi>; nor <hi>Arimanes,</hi> as <hi>Ignorance and Darkness.</hi> They made certain Sacrifices to this last, that he might not afflict them; and to the first to obtain Happiness and good Fortune.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> also said that <hi>Oromazes</hi> was Son of the Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Arimanes</hi> Child of the Night, and that they had a perpetual War: That <hi>Oromazes</hi> had made six Gods, The 1. the God of Benevolence. The 2. of Truth. The 3. of Equity. The 4. of Wisdom. The 5. of Riches. The 6. of Pleasure; Divinities, which all submitted to him that made 'em. That after that, <hi>Oromazes</hi> became three times greater, and was as far from the Sun, as the Sun was from the Earth: That he made Heaven and the Stars; and established the Dog-Star to keep the rest: They say likewise that he made twenty four Gods, which he plac'd in an Egg, but that <hi>Arimanes</hi> had made as many; but they broke the Egg, and from thence it happen'd that the Evil Ones were mingl'd among the Good: That the time drew near in which the mischievous Beings, and <hi>Arimanes</hi> himself shou'd be entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd by Pestilence and Famine; and that the Earth should be wholly united; and that there shou'd be only one manner of Living, and one only Society of all Mankind; and there shou'd be but one Language among 'em.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Magi</hi> pretended they knew the Art of Divination as well as the <hi>Chaldeans. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> tells us, They had neither Temples, nor Altars, nor Images, and that they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon all such as had 'em as Fools: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>Strabo</hi> says the same. <hi>Herodotus</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd that the occasion of this Custom was, because they did not believe with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> That the Gods had Human Shapes; and <hi>Cicero,</hi> because they hold that the whole World was but a House or Temple for
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103507:114"/>
them, and therefore they cou'd not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd within Walls. Nevertheless <hi>Strabo</hi> often speaks of their Temples, their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars and their Statues, which perhaps only regarded the time that they were submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in which they learnt part of their Customs; whereas in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they had nothing resembling them, as appears by that Action of <hi>Zerxes,</hi> in burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Temples of <hi>Greece,</hi> for Reasons which have been related.</p>

                        <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogonia,</hi> by the means of which they believ'd they might prevail with the Gods. In short, he that sacrificed, carry'd away the Flesh of the Victim, and did what he pleas'd with it. <hi>Strabo</hi> says, That the Magus who officiated, having cut the Victim in pieces, each Person that assisted took his part and went his way, without leaving any thereof to the Gods. <hi>For they say, God wou'd have only the Soul of the Victim.</hi> Others left upon the Fire a part of the <hi>Omentum.</hi> As may be seen in the same Book of <hi>Strabo,</hi> with divers of their Religious Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>He tells us also, That the Magi ador'd <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the Sun, the Moon, <hi>Venus,</hi> the Fire, the Earth, the Winds and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But that which is the most perplexing in their Relations is, That they give the Names of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Gods to those of the East, because they conjectur'd they were the same Gods with theirs. Wherefore we shall not stand to relate what our Author says thereon, but the Curious may consult them if they think it to the purpose.</p>
                     <p>The 18th and 19th Parts of this Work, contains an Historical Abridgment of the Philosophy of the <hi>Sabeans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Sabeans</hi> were a People of <hi>Arabia,</hi> who have had among them great Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, if we may credit some <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Iewish</hi> Authors. But these Authors are not of an ancient date, and living in a time wherein this Philosophy was extinct, it is not easie to know whether they were mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or no. Some say, That the Head of the Sect of the <hi>Sabeans</hi> was named <hi>Zara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dast,</hi> which seems to be the same Name with <hi>Zoroaster</hi>: Others say, <hi>Tachmurat</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> was the first Founder thereof: There are also many other Opinions about it. The <hi>Rabbins</hi> pretended 'twas in a flourishing condition in <hi>Chaldea</hi> from the time of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and fail not to relate the History of that time, with as great an Air of Assurance as if they had been Witnesses thereof, or had drawn it from Contemporary Authors. Some of which may be seen in the 2d and 18th Chapters of Mr. <hi>Stanley.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maimonides</hi> says, he had seen divers of their Books which our Author gives the Names of, that were full of Superstitions, conjurations of Demons, secrets for the <hi>Talis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and other Extravagancies of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Liv.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Hottingar</hi> in his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the East, assures us, That he had some of 'em in his Possession, compos'd by <hi>Abulfark</hi> Son of <hi>Abi-Iacub,</hi> and he wish'd that it had been made publick.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Sabeans,</hi> according to the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> believ'd the Stars to be Divinities, but that the Sun was greater than all the rest, and govern'd both Worlds, Superior and Inferior. They attributed their Opinions to <hi>Adam</hi> and to the first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, and thereupon related Histories like to those that we find in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and in divers <hi>Mahometan</hi> Authors; which is a very good Reason to make us suspect those Books to be Supposititious, partly from the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> Superstitions, and partly from Cheats, which have often affix'd the Names of the first Patriarchs, the better to sell their Books to the Credulous.</p>
                     <p>They gave to each Day of the Week the Name of one of the seven Planets, to which they render'd certain Worship every Day and every Month. Their Monthly Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are described at length in the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of <hi>Hottinger,</hi> whereof our Author gives a very circumstantial Extract. They are only Fasts, Sacrifices, and Anniversary Solemnities in Honour of the Planets, and particularly in Honour of <hi>Belta,</hi> to whom the sixth Day of the Week was Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so that this Name mark'd the Planet <hi>Venus,</hi> and of <hi>Sammael,</hi> a Name that the <hi>Iews</hi> to this day give to the evil Angel, whom they call, <hi>The Angel of Death.</hi> They call'd their Months after the same Names as the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> did, whose Language they much speak, or one very near it, because they were Neighbours. This also hath been the reason that the Ancients gave the Name of <hi>Arabia</hi> to one part of <hi>Mesopotamia</hi>; and that the Eastern People comprehended the <hi>Nabatheans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans,</hi> under the general Name of <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> as our Author observes in his Preamble to the 18th Part.</p>
                     <p>In the last Chapter he relates divers Cust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms of the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> contrary to many of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103507:114"/>
the Injunctions of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as <hi>Maimonides</hi> observes. But those that wou'd be instructed in the Original of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> may read the second Book of that Work of the Learned <hi>Spencer,</hi> Entituled, <hi>De legibus Hebraeorum Ritualibus.</hi> Since what has been said of the Divinity of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> is only founded upon those Oracles that yet remain among us, it is necessary to relate here the Reasons that persuaded Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> they are not Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sititious. 1. These Fragments are not drawn from one Book only, which might have been composed by any Ancient Heretick; but from divers Platonick Authors, who had them in great Veneration; whereas they shew the falsness of some Books writ by the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> under the Name of <hi>Zoroaster.</hi> This <hi>Porphyry</hi> hath acknowledg'd in the Life of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> where he makes a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between these Oracles and those that were Supposititious.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are all full of Crack'd and East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Expressions, altho' it is true there are many also that are purely Greek, which ought to be attributed to those that Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it from the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Picus de la Mirandula</hi> in a Letter to <hi>Marcilius Fieinus</hi> says, he had these Oracles in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Tongue much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleater, and larger than those they had in the Greek, with some Explications of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in the same Tongue. This Manuscript was found in his Closet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Death, but so spoil'd and difficult to be read, that nothing cou'd be decifer'd of them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. 'Tis probable that these Oracles were Extracts of the Books of <hi>Berosus,</hi> who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Philosophy and Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into <hi>Greece,</hi> or at least of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Son who had publish'd several of the Oracles and Secrets of the <hi>Theurgy</hi> in Verse, for <hi>Proclus</hi> cites some of 'em under his Name.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It may be the Name of Oracles was not given to these Verses only to mark their Excellency, but because they thought t'was the proper Terms of an Oracle. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus</hi> affirms that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had one of them, for which they had not less Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the <hi>Greeks</hi> had for the Oracle of <hi>Delphos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Opinion may be confirm'd by the esteem some Platonicks exprest of this Verse, as <hi>Proclus,</hi> who calls them in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary upon <hi>Timeus: The</hi> Assyrian <hi>Divinity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd from God, a Divinity receiv'd from God.</hi> In other places he also attributes them directly to the Divinity.</p>
                     <p>Some of these Oracles that had escap'd the Barbarity of pass'd Ages, were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd by <hi>Louis du Fillet</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> in 1563. under the Title of the <hi>Oracles of the Magi,</hi> descended from <hi>Zoroaster,</hi> with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary of <hi>Gemisthus Plethon.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Translated by <hi>Iames Marthamus,</hi> and publish'd by <hi>Opsopaeus</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> in 1607. with the Commentary of <hi>Psellus. Francis Patricius</hi> had also published them with many Additions drawn from <hi>Proclus, Hermias, Simplicius, Damascius, Synesius, Olimpiodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Nicephorus,</hi> and from <hi>Arnobius,</hi> so that he augmented them unto the number of 324. He reduced them likewise under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Heads, and put them into Latin in 1593. <hi>Otton Heurnius</hi> Translated and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished them also in his Book, Entituled, <hi>Philosophia Barbarica,</hi> in 1619. but under a pretext of putting them into better Latin, and making a following Discourse upon them, he corrupted the Sense of 'em. He was laughed at for adding Fragments drawn from different Authors, which had no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to each other. Thus <hi>Heurnius</hi> spoil'd what <hi>Patricius</hi> had well done, altho' this last did not take sufficient care to publish them correctly, but wholly neglected the Measure of the Verse; even without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, except in the beginning, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors from whence he had taken them, so that it was not easie to re-establish them. Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> has mentioned some which are Translated into <hi>English,</hi> and also adds his Conjectures upon such Places as are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
                     <p>Some of these Oracles appear'd so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and intricate, that they seem'd absurd: But we ought to consider that <hi>Psellus</hi> and <hi>Plethon</hi> have explain'd many, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that wou'd not have appear'd more reasonable, and those that find them good, may very rationally presume that those they understand not, have not less reason to be supposed so. This made some believe they might publish them among the rest, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diminishing the high Esteem which was formerly had of the Wisdom of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi>: And 'tis this also engaged the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to Translate the Commentaries of <hi>Psellus</hi> and <hi>Plethon</hi> into <hi>English.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Oracles are placed under eleven Titles, the five first whereof regard the Supream and Subaltern God; and the rest the World, Man, and the Sacrifices. To make the Reader sensible of the Eastern Stile of these Fragments, I shall relate some here as exactly as I can. For Example, what they say of the Spirit (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) that is, the second Being: <hi>Light is born of the Father. 'Tis it only that has drawn the chief of the Spirit, in great abunance to the Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power. The Paternal Spirit having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd its Works, disperses through the whole an ardent Love, to the end that all Things lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one another, they might subsist for a time without any Restriction. The Consequences of the Fathers Thoughts were not discovered to the Eyes of all things, because the Elements of the World subsist, being preserved by Love. It might by thinking, give Intelligence of its Father to each Source and Principle. It is the limits of the Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>oundness of its Father, and the Source of intellectual Things. It goes not out from, but continues in the Paternal Depth, and in his Sanctuary, by a silence wholly Divine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Another Being is also spoken of in these Terms: <hi>Vnder two Spirits is the quickning source of Souls, and the Artist who himself made the World, being all Fire, cloath'd with

Fire, preserving the most refin'd part of his Fire, to qualifie the Sources of Vnion.</hi>

                     <p>It's easily discern'd by this, That the Stile of these Oracles bears no resemblance to that of the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets, nor to that of the Oracles of <hi>Delphos.</hi> There's a kind of Light and Obscurity very particular. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it's easily seen that there's neither the Sentiments of the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> nor those of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but I know not what something very singular, which has entirely the Air of the Original, as will be more easily granted by those that read the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Plethon</hi> and <hi>Psellus.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>MR. <hi>Boyle</hi> composed this Work several years since, at the Entreaty of Mr. <hi>Oldenburgh,</hi> Secretary to the <hi>Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</hi> It remained among the Author's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers until 88. when he Publish'd it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding to it any new Remarks, which he might have drawn from the Discoveries that have been made in Anatomy since it was composed, because he believed that what he had said, was sufficient to decide the Questions which are proposed. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly of a great Consequence to know if the Final Causes of Natural Things can be found; that is to say, to know why Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are formed after a certain manner, and upon what design they are dispos'd in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Places? If in this there was a design, and we should neglect to inform our selves thereof, we run the risk of not rendring unto the Author the Honour due for that Reason; and of not drawing from those Beings the Uses which we should, both in regard to Philosophy and Religion. If there was no design in all this, it is very profitable to know it, that we may not lose our time in vainly seeking for the same. <hi>Epicurus</hi> denyed there were any in the Thought he had, That all Things were formed by chance; and <hi>Descartes</hi> hath main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, That it was impossible to know any of the ends of God, unless he had himself revealed them to us. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> undertakes not here directly to refute <hi>Epicurus,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth himself solely to <hi>Descartes</hi>; whose Opinion cannot nevertheless be refuted, without destroying at the same time that of <hi>Epicurus.</hi> To proceed more Methodically, he hath divided his Work into four Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in each of which he examins a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Question; after which he concludes, That the Disquisition of Final Causes ought not altogether to be banish'd from Physick, tho' in this there must be certain Precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons used which he observes.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The first question is, if <hi>(generally speaking) Physitians can know the end and design of corporal Beings</hi>? If <hi>Descartes</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed simply that we cannot know all the ends, which God proposed to himself in the Creation of the World, or that we ought not to imagin that they all relate to Man, Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> would not undertake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him: But as <hi>Descartes</hi> speaks in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Terms, its maintained that his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is false, taking him without exceptions. The Reason of it is, that suppose God is an intelligent Being, and that some of the things he hath made be perfectly proper to produce a certain considerable effect, and that they produce it necessarily, we ought to judge that God, who hath foreseen this effect, hath produced his Work, at least partly, for that Reason. So when the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable disposition of the Eye is considered, and the effect it produceth, to wit <hi>Vision,</hi> there is nothing more reasonable than to say that the Eye was made for to see, tho it may be it was made for some other end, which we know not. So also the Sun, which is, according to <hi>Descartes,</hi> disposed in a proper place to illuminate all the Planets that turn in its Vortex, and which unavoidably produceth this effect, has been undoubtedly created partly to give us Light and Heat. It cannot be said here that all the ends of God are hidden in his Wisdom, because that would be to allow that we have no Testimony of his Works which should teach us that <hi>God is Wise.</hi> Yet this is no impediment to Physitians seeking out the mechanical reasons of these effects, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders but that we may say a Clock hath been made to shew the Hours, and to expound at the same time mechanically, how its Wheels and its Springs produce this effect. Thus <hi>Descartes</hi> himself after having said that the Immutability of God requires there should be always a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Motion in matter, sheweth how that may suffice to render a Reason of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural effects.</p>
                     <p>Altho Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> is not of that Number who believe that <hi>Descartes</hi> had a design to favour Atheism, since he finds his proof of the Existence of God, to be conclusive, he maintains, that to say none of the ends which he proposed to himself can be known, is to deny that we can see his Wisdom and Goodness in the Creatures, and consequently to take from Mankind the proof of the Existence of God, which is drawn from the order of the Universe. It is moreover to take from Men one of the greatest Reasons which they have of blessing and admiring the supream Being. For in fine, according to <hi>Descartes,</hi> God perhaps proposed to himself in the Creation none of these admirable effects, which are observed in the Universe; and if we enjoy any good therein, it doth not teach us that he design'd to do us any.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103507:115"/>
So that we cannot from thence conclude, that God is either wise, or a benefactor to us, and we have no Reason from thence to admire and praise him.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <note n="(*)" place="margin">p. 39.</note> The second Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in these Terms, <hi>Suppose we should affirmatively answer to the first, whether the ends of God can be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all sorts of Bodies, or only in some</hi>? To resolve this Query, we must divide Bodies, into <hi>inanimate</hi> and <hi>animate,</hi> The most considerable inanimate Bodies are the Sun and Stars. When we consider their Motions so regulate, and so necessary to the Earth: And on the other hand we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose with <hi>Descartes,</hi> that they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by an intelligent Being, why should we not believe that we may place the use we draw from them amongst the Causes for which this Being created them?</p>
                     <p>But there is much wanting in inanimate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to render them as perfect as animate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The Disposition of our Muscle, is much more admirable than that of the Celestial Orbs; and the Eye of a Fly, includes a thousand times more Art than the Body of the Sun. Tho there is no absurdity to think that Stones, Metals and other Bodies of this Nature are made for the use of Man; their inward Disposition is so simple, that it might be believed they were formed by the Simple Rules of Motion, even as we see that the <hi>Cristallizations,</hi> and <hi>Sublimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>Chymistries</hi> produce effects sufficiently wonderful. But there is no comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these sorts of things, and Animals, as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> proves at large; <note n="(*)" place="margin">
                           <hi>p.</hi> 45. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> for not to enter into an examination of the entire Bodies of Animals, he chiefly applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the structure of the Eye, by which its clearly seen that it was made for to see. And this not only in regard to the Eye of Man that it may be proved; but we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides observe particular Dispositions in those of other Animals, which render this truth very plain. Frogs, for example, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what their Eyes have common with ours, have also a Membrane or Gristle, wherewith they cover them, without it's hindering their sight; for tho this Membrane is very strong, it is transparent, and may pass for a kind of Horny Movable. These Animals living not only in Water, but also upon the Water side, where there are often Shrubs and Bull-Rushes, and moving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by Leaps; if they had not these Fenses to their Eyes they would be in danger of putting them out at all times. It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd by holding a Frog so that it cannot turn his Head, if one strives to put out it's Eyes, 'twill soon be perceiv'd that at the very instant it will cover them with this Membrane, and that as soon as the danger is over the Frog will draw it back without trouble. The same thing is found in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral small Birds who Fly and hop in thick Trees and Bushes whose Thorns might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put out their Eyes without an Horny substance wherewith they cover them.</p>
                     <p>We know that Men, and the most part of four Footed Beasts and Birds, have divers Muscles, by means of which they turn their Eyes where they please, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the occasion they have for 'em. Flies on the contrary have none, but in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense have on their Eyes, which are convex enough, a great number of little <hi>Eminences</hi> capable of receiving the Rays which come from all Parts. These Inequalities are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly observed in the Eyes of Flies, (which fly upon Flesh) by making use of a good <hi>Microscope.</hi> Altho' Bees and other great Flies have immoveable Eyes, yet the same thing is not seen in them.</p>
                     <p>To these Remarks may be opposed, That the Eyes of Men being the most perfect, the Eyes of all Animals should resemble it. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> answers to that first, That since divers Organs of Animals are perfectly well disposed for the Uses for which they are destined, we ought to believe at least that it may be the same with Organs, whose Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and Use are not well known to us. Secondly, we ought not to consider the Eye after an abstract manner, and simply as the Instrument of Vision, but as the Organ of a certain Animal to whom it ought to serve in certain Circumstances. And this, far from doing any wrong to the Creator of the Universe, renders him on the contrary much Honour, if we consider that in the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite variety of Animals which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, he hath given them such Eyes as were needful, to preserve themselves in such places of the Earth as they live in, and to nourish themselves after the manner that's most natural to 'em. Thus tho divers Beasts, as Horses, Oxen, and some others, have a seventh Muscle to turn their Eyes, besides the six which they have common with Men; we must not conclude that their Eyes are more perfect than those of Man, or that they have any superfluous part: For these Animals having their Head stooping, to seek out the Forage they eat, could not have their Eyes turn'd downwards so long to the ground without great Weariness, if they had not this seventh Muscle which serves them for that purpose. But Men having no need thereof, such another Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle would but trouble them. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it ought not to be thought that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, whose Eyes have not all that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in that of Men, are destitute of any part that may be necessary for them. Moles, for Example, have Eyes so little that it is commonly believ'd they have none, although those who have made a Dissertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, have found they had Eyes. But being obliged to remain in the Ground, they needed not great Eyes, which would be in danger of receiving Injury.</p>
                     <p>It is known that the Camelion, among several remarkable Things which it hath in its Eyes, can move them independently the one from the other; so that he can look with the one on what is before him, and with the other on what is behind, to see with one what is above, and with the other
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103507:116"/>
what is below, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore he is a sloathful Animal, which lives upon Trees or Shrubs, where Flies are nourished, which he can see coming what side soever they are. Fishes have a Crystalline Humour almost Spherical, because the Water in which they live, causing in the Sun-beams a Refraction much greater than the Air, they would see nothing in the Water, if the Convexity of the Crystalline Humour caused not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction in the Light great enough, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite these Beams in the bottom of the Eye.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> is persuaded, that those who might have Time and Means to examine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner the Eyes of a greater number of Animals, would without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty observe that they have them so dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as that the Places wherein they keep, and their manner of Living require it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, he makes a Remark upon the form of the Eye-ball of some Animals, which serves to confirm his Thought; which is, That altho' Horses, Oxen, and divers other Creatures, have a long Ball as well as Cats, yet in the first it is placed transversely, and extends from the right to the left: Whereas in Cats, it is situate perpendicularly. A Friend of Mr. <hi>Boyles,</hi> well skil'd in Opticks, conjectured upon this Observation, that the reason of this is, That Horses and Oxen seeking their Food upon the Ground, can thus receive more easily the Images of the Forage, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it self to them from divers Parts in their transversal Ball: As Cats living upon Mice and Rats, which run along the Walls, can more easily observe them by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular situation of their Balls, than if it was otherwise disposed.</p>
                     <p>Thus this variety of Dispositions, in the Eyes of Animals, is far from giving us any disadvantageous Idea of him that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, we cannot but admire his Power and Wisdom: For it cannot be doubted but that a Mechanist who makes a great number of Machines, is of a greater Capacity, than another who could make but one sort. There is even much likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, according to Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> considering Things but as a simple Philosopher, that the Author of the Universe hath produced so great a variety of Animals, but to let in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Creatures see his Power and his Wisdom. Therefore doth Revelation teach us, that this was one of the Designs of God in the Creation of the World, as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> shews, from p. 78. unto the end of the Section.</p>
                     <p>But before that, he makes some Remarks upon that which is called <hi>Chance,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves our Observation. As to the corporeal World, it's easily believed that nothing falls out in it by <hi>Chance,</hi> but all by the Rules of Motion, when any free Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence comes in for a share. But because we consider certain parts of the World, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particularly govern'd by the Divinity, or at least by what others call Nature, and as being destined to certain ends; if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that by the Intervention of some other Causes, which we foresee not, the things in Question produce a contrary Effect to that which we believe they were destin'd, we are accustom'd to say, That this Effect is produced by Chance. Thus Chance is nothing else but an Idea of our making, and which only subsisteth in our Brains. There is therefore no Reason to wonder why the Philosophers, which lived before <hi>Aristotle,</hi> have not put Chance among Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Causes, as we learn of <hi>Aristotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who justly reprehends them because of this pretended Omission.</p>
                     <p>Those who favour <hi>Epicurus,</hi> are used to bring for Examples Things that are formed by Chance, of certain Stones whose Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is admirable, as the <hi>Astroites.</hi> But besides what we have said of Chance, its answered, that Learned Men have of late maintain'd, with likelihood enough, That curious Stones of this Nature are really Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, petrify'd by some Moisture in which they have lain. But by supposing that these sorts of Stones are formed in the Ground, it might be said, without advancing any Absurdity, That there are Seminal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in some of the Fossils, whose dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is most composed, not to mention that there is no Comparison betwixt this Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and that of Animals. We ought in it not only to consider the solid parts, but also the Liquors, the Spirits, the Digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Secretions, the Regulations and Motions of the whole Body; and tho' it were allowed that the Stones, which we speak of, are formed by Chance, it could not be infer'd that Animals are thus formed, for if a Smith shall give a certain Shape to a piece of Iron without thinking of it, yet it cannot be concluded that this Smith can, without thinking, make a Clock.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The third Question is, <hi>If it may be said that a Being destitute of Intelligence acteth for some end, and in what Sense it may be said?</hi> It's said that a Being tends to certain ends, in two Senses. The one is when the Agent knoweth a certain end, and that he acts purposely, to arrive at it. The other, when the action of the near cause is directed to this end, yet by an Intelligent Cause more distant. It's evident that we cannot say, in the first of these Senses, that any Cause destitute of Intelligence acteth in order to some end; therefore it must be the second: To which the Sentiment of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> has Relation; which is, That God having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to himself certain ends hath produced a World proper for the producing such ends. For Example, an able Mechanist who proposeth to himself to make a Mill to turn round, and to raise Hammers to forge Iron, by the means of Water, he forms thereof an Idea which he afterwards executes, and whose Execution produces the Effect he had proposed to himself: Even so God having proposed to himself certain ends, hath created the World, so that he inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly comes at it that way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="205" facs="tcp:103507:116"/>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> admonishes here <note n="(a)" place="margin">p. 81.</note> That if he hath said any Thing by the bye against the common Opinion, <hi>That all the Material World was made for Man</hi>; he thinks only that this Question ought not to be decided after a too Dogmatick or Exclusive Manner. Altho' the Reasons which are brought to shew that all the World, and particularly the vast Extent in which the fixed Stars are placed, was not made for Man alone, yet it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him more probable than those which favour the contrary Opinion; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he willingly granteth that among the ends which the Author of Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to himself in divers of his Works, as Plants, Animals, Metals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to produce them for the use of Man, and that this perhaps was his principal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. He hath even an inclination to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there being a great many Things made for our use, and which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we do not know; and that the Things whereof we actually make use, may have other uses which are besides unknown to us.</p>
                     <p>Libertines have long since objected, That if other Animals had been made for Man, they would not come into the World in a better State than he: Whereas there are several produced in a condition of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves from the Injury of the Air, and of seeking their livelihood without the help of another. To these slight Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is opposed that of Reason, which hath enabled Men to form Societies, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Masters of all other Animals by their Policy. This Reason evinces, That Man is more excellent than the whole Globe of the World, or an Extent of much greater Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without Intelligence. So that do but look upon the outside of Things with regard only to the littleness of the Body of Man, deny that the Earth and some of the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Bodies were made for him, because they are infinitely greater, and because an Intelligence, such as the Soul of Man, is much more excellent than all these Bodies.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> moreover draweth from this Consideration an important Consequence, which is, That tho' Man receives no use from some distant parts of his Body, he can nevertheless receive a very great one in regard of the Intelligence which animates it; which raiseth it self by the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the more distant Objects to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of their Author, and acknowledgeth in a thousand ways his Power and his Wisdom, and also renders him the Homage that is due unto him. Why should we not believe that among the ends of God, in producing these vast Bodies, which their excessive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance hath not robbed from our Sight, he hath proposed to make himself known to the innumerable Intelligences, which he hath covered with Human Bodies? This is the most probable Inference that Men have ever made thereof, as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> sheweth.</p>
                     <p>But if we will yet consider Man, as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a Body, we must take heed of committing a gross Fault, whereinto we fall by Imagining, That nothing can go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of having been made for Man, but that which all Men have always made use of; we ought to look upon Man, from his Origin upon this Earth, until his Dissolution, he changes Habitation, as does a Family, which in divers times makes use of divers things, altho' none of his Members do immediately participate of these Uses. Thus an Infinity of Things, whence much Profit is drawn of late, have notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been made for Man, tho' he made no use of them some Ages before us. We may see particularly Examples thereof in the Original.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <note n="(a)" place="margin">p. 103.</note> The fourth Question is to know, <hi>With what Precaution Physicians ought to make use of the Supposition of Final Causes?</hi> Thence two sorts of Consequences may be drawn; the one relates to the Author of Nature, as when from the constant use of a thing, it is concluded that it was made for that. So after having acknowledg'd the use of Eyes, we ascend to the Creator, by saying that in creating the Eyes, he had a Design to make a Machine, as proper to produce that which we call Vision. The other Consequences conclude from the Supposition of certain ends, That Bodies ought to be disposed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a certain manner, because otherwise they would not be proper to produce the Effect for which they are created.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> reduces what he has to say upon this Question, to five Propositions, upon which he makes divers Remarks which are briefly there; as also some of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Reflections which are made upon them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <note n="(a)" place="margin">p. 107.</note> 
                        <hi>As for Coelestial Bodies in general, it is Folly to conclude any thing about their Nature, from the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position that God hath produced them for the use of Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Those who say, That the Earth being the Place which Man Inhabits, and the Sun having been created to light this Earth; it follows from thence, That the Sun turns round the Earth, and not the Earth about the Sun, against the Rules we have related. They suppose that the only end which God proposed to himself, in creating the Sun, is to light the Earth; and tho' that was so, their Consequence may be denyed. As to what regards the fixt Stars, whereof some are so distant that there is no use of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescope to discern them, it is yet more rash to suppose that they were only produced for our Earth; tho' we do not deny but that we may draw from them both Moral and and Physical Uses.</p>
                     <p>It would be also a meer Presumption, to conclude from thence that they are disposed after such a certain manner, because that would seem more commodious for the use of the pretended King of the Universe. It is much more reasonable to think, that God might have proposed Ends which we see
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103507:117"/>
not in the Symmetry of the World. Can it be said that the Angels, which are more excellent Beings than we are, take no share therein, and that God in creating it had no regard to them? On the contrary it's well known, that several Divines have conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> That the Angels were created before the Material World, that they might render God the Praises due to him, for the Creation of the Universe. It may be these Intelligences perceive at first sight in this part of the Heaven, what we discover only with difficulty by the Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope, and in other Bodies which we know not, a profound Wisdom, and as admirable Ends, as those which we observe in Bodies which are nearest and most known to us.</p>
                     <p>To descend from Heaven upon Earth; tho' it is very rationally believed that God made, for the use of Man, Metals and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals being such Things as he can procure; there would be no Reason to believe, that that which is round the Center of the Earth, more than fifteen hundred Leagues below our Feet, is made for us, and even only for that end. There could never yet a thousand Steps be dugg into a strait Line, nor is there any appearance that the Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of Men shou'd ever find the means to peirce the Earth Diametrically for a Mile; and without that they can neither see, nor apply to their use what it hides in its Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre. We may notwithstanding judge, by the knowledg we have of some other parts of the World, that what the Earth includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in its Bulk, may contribute something to the Order and Symmetry of its Vortex wherein it is placed. It might also be said, that there are divers Things in the World, which were produced, not for themselves, or upon a Design of immediately receiving some Benefit; but because they were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Subjects of what God had directly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to create. So God it may be is the remote cause of Eclypses, but yet they are a necessary Series of the Motion of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and he did not think but that this Motion should be changed, to avoid Eclyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>

                        <hi>It is permitted to a Physitian to gather from the use of some parts of the Body of Animals, some of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ends to which they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined. We may even, in some occasions, upon the Knowledg which we have of Nature, and of the Disposition of certain Parts, establish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Conjectures about the use of these Parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> speaks here only of such ends which regard the good and preservation of Animals in particular. Those who have any Knowledg in Anatomy cannot doubt of it if they consider the whole Machine of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bodies and the regular Functions, which an infinite number of Parts perform therein, without the one hindring the other, tho' their Offices are very different. It evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears that several Parts are desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to certain Effects, and that they are justly disposed, as they ought to be to that intent, because if there happens any change, this Effect either ceases entirely, or is not produced without much difficulty.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Epicureans</hi> object, That Men make use of their Members in many things, not that they had them given 'em for that Design, but because we have found out by Experience that they were proper for them.</p>

                     <p>But chiefly there are several Parts of our Body, which perform their Functions, without our being sensible of it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our knowing how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such are our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Parts, the Heart, the Liver, the Spleen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as to the Members which we move as we please, altho' we cannot imploy them before they are formed, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not in any respect from thence that a blind Power hath presided over their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, without knowing what they should be good for. That is only a Supposition as little reasonable, as that of a Man wou'd be, who should maintain, that a Book was not made to be read, but that we read it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Chance has formed it and writ it, after such a manner as we have Power to read it.</p>
                     <p>Suppose we knew well the Structure of one part, we might often affirm or deny certain Uses which are attributed to it. Those who writ formerly of Anatomy and Opticks, believed, as well as the Philosophers of the Schools, That Vision is made in the Cristal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Humour; but the Jesuit <hi>Scheiner</hi> hath shewn, the first Thing in his Treatise of the Eyes, That this part of the Eye, not being proper for that purpose, another should be sought for, which might be only the Coat or Membrane of the Eye. My. <hi>Boyle</hi> affirms, that having demanded of the famous <hi>Harvey,</hi> a little before his Death, what it was that might have given him occasion to find the Circulation of the Blood? He answered him, That it was the Disposition of the <hi>Valvulae or Folds,</hi> which permit the Veins to bring back the Blood to the Heart, but suffer it not to go to the Extremities of the Body, only by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</p>

                        <hi>There are Things so proper and so well disposed for certain Vses, either in the Vniverse, considered in its utmost Extent, or in the Bodies of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, so that we may justly conclude, that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were made by an Intelligent Being, which hath thus designedly disposed them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> demonstrates this Thesis by a great number of Examples drawn from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Animals of <hi>Europe, America</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi>; where he examins only the exterior Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without engaging himself into any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Disquisition, because what we see is sufficient to convince a rational Man, that an Intelligent Being formed the World.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103507:117"/>
We shall not stop at it, because every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can present to himself an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of convincing Examples, and like unto those which our Author relates. There is no Body this day in <hi>Europe,</hi> who hath any Learning, that believes pure Chance was able to produce Animals; but there are Men who believe that they are formed by the known Rules of Motion, or at least by Rules which we know not. Yet they must grant, that an Intelligent Being established these Rules, as <hi>Descartes</hi> does, or say that they are from all Eternity, in Matter as well as in Motion; whence it would follow that there have been Animals on Earth from all Eternity, which is contrary to History and good Sense; moreover the supposing that Matter moveth of it self, is to suppose as incomprehensible a thing as the greatest Absurdities of the most ridiculous Religion. So that the Proofs of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> may serve to destroy this Sentiment, tho' it does not directly aim at it.</p>

                        <hi>We ought not precipitately to conclude, nor assert too affirmatively that a Thing is, or ought to be the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular end, for which any Body hath been formed, or the Motive which induced the Author of Nature to produce it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, there are some Ends that were designed in the Creation of Bodies, which are so clear and remarkable, that it cannot be doubted but these Bodies were effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively formed for these Uses, as the Eye to see; but there are several Effects either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary or profitable for the conservation of Animals, to which Effects one part is not sensibly more proper than the other. It is very difficult likewise to observe the chief and the most considerable Use of each Part, as appears by these Reasons. 1. The whole Animal, whose Members are examined, is itself but a part of the Universe, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it cannot be affirmed that his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have no Relation but to himself only, and not with the whole Creation, whereof it makes a Part. 2. There is Danger in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That a Member was not designed to such an Use, because it seems as if it could better perform this Function, if it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise disposed, without considering whether this Structure, which is judged the best for this particular Effect, would not be more disadvantagious to the Animal, in some other regard; or if it would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to some other End that the Author of Nature might have proposed to himself, in the Production of this Animal: 3. It is hard to determine what the principal Use of a Member is, because it may be equally destined to several. 4. Nature can accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the same End, by divers ways, equally sufficient for that Intent, though they are not all equally commodious. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, That these two Considerations ought to be joyned together, because they are often found to be united. We imagine sometimes, without Reason, That Nature employeth but a Part in some one Function, whereas the Effect which she proposeth to herself is oft produced by a Series of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which succeed one another, and to which different Members do diversly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contribute. Besides, that an Animal cannot subsist only by the means either of the Solid or Liquid Parts, which are seen in it when it is opened. It is a Machine that may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hydraulico-pneumatick,</hi> whose Functions (and perhaps the principal ones) are not simply performed by means of the Blood, or other sensible Liquors, because they are Liquors; but partly by their Motion, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by an Invisible Fluid, which is called the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and partly, perhaps by little Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which are suddenly loosened from the rest, or by a Portion of Air enclosed in our Body, or by some kinds of Ferments; all which things cease to act with Life, and cannot be discovered by the means of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>A Physician ought not to apply himself so much to the Disquisition of the Ends of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature, as to neglect examining the manner whereby Natural Effects do happen, and the Causes which produce them more immediately.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In effect the one is not incompatible with the other; as nothing hinders us from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by what Springs and Wheels a Watch playeth, when we have learned for what Design it was made. A Physician, who would not be unworthy of this Name, ought to add the first of these Knowledges to the second.</p>
                     <p>The Book whereof we have given an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, though full of Matter (being little enough) Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> hath added <note n="*" place="margin">p. 245.</note> fourteen Curious Observations, about divers Infirmities of the Eyes. It hath been already observed, That he insisted much upon this part of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, to prove that their Bodies were form'd designedly; so that these Remarks may serve only to confirm what he hath said: There is but one Power, and one Wisdom so great as is that of God, which could have includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so many things in so little an Organ: And we have an occasion still to admire his Providence, in that this Organ being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of so many Parts, and so easie to be spoiled: It nevertheless is found to remain in the greatest part of Mankind in the same state from their Birth to their Death. The Observations which Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> gives us here, are so much the more remarkable, because he hath seen most of those Persons, whose Unhappiness he relates: This is the last, which was translated Word for Word.</p>

                        <p>Men, it may be, may be persuaded, That those who perceive Objects in a Light much less than it ought to be, for others to discern it, may rather be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to have an excellent Sight, than to have infirm Eyes. But although this Delicacy of the Organs of the Sight, may be looked upon as a Perfection in Bats and Owls, which cannot take hold of their Prey but in the Twilight; yet in regard to Man, who ought principally to act in full Day, or in a Light almost equivalent; we
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103507:118"/>
may be sensible of the Bounty of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature, in that he hath given him Eyes so qualified as they commonly are; if he had the Coat or Membrane too ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it would be an Imperfection, or at least a great Inconveniency, as appears by the following Observation.</p>
                        <p>In the Army of <hi>Charles</hi> the First, King of <hi>England,</hi> there was an Ingenious Gentleman, who was Major of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and being forced by the Victory of the Usurper to go seek his Fortune out of the Kingdom, hazarded himself, at <hi>Madrid,</hi> to render his Prince a Service of very great Consequence, after such a manner as was judged in <hi>Spain</hi> to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether void of Prudence; he was seized and put into a Dungeon, where there were no Windows, but only a Hole in the Wall, by which they gave the Prisoner his Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, after which they shut it, although perhaps not very exactly. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man remained some Weeks without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing whatever, and in a very deep Melancholy: But after that it seemed to him as if he saw a weak Light, which afterwards augmented from Day to Day, so that he could discover his Bed, or any thing of a like Bigness. At last he came to discern Objects so little, that he saw Rats, which came to eat the Crumbs of his Bread that fell on the Ground, and distinctly observed their Motions. He related several other effects of his Sight in this obscure Place: Which shews that this proceeded chiefly from his Organs, which became tender, staying so long a Time in such a dark Place, as it was. But his Affairs being changed, and having recovered his Liberty, he durst not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately expose himself to a full Sight, fearing left a too sudden Brightness should make him lose his Sight, but thought he should accustome his Eyes thereto by little and little. I add here, continueth Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> this strange History with much the less Difficulty, because I have it from the very Mouth of this Gentleman. He told me besides, other Particulars, which I dare not to mention here, because I have not those Memorandums I took of'm to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh my Memory.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of a Letter, written from <hi>London,</hi> about the Description of a Ship, built after a new Form, by Sir <hi>William Petti.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AS all Men expected the Success of Sir <hi>William Petti</hi>'s Enterprize, of Building a Ship after a new Make; so there ran a multitude of People to the <hi>Thames</hi>-Side, to see this Ship Launched, being empty when it was tryed: It drew Water but seven Foot and an half. They were going to name it <hi>Gemini,</hi> because it was composed of two small Ships, but at last it was called the <hi>Experiment,</hi> because of the uncertainty of the Event it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
                     <p>To apprehend its Structure we must imagine two little Ships joyned together by a Plat-form, so that between the two there may be a Space almost as large as the two Ships together, through which the Water has an entire Liberty to pass. The Keel of each Vessel is eighty Foot long: The bigness with the Platform is only thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Foot: The height from the Keel unto the Platform is fourteen Foot.</p>
                     <p>If this Ship is used in War, it will carry fifty Pieces of Cannon, two hundred Men, and three Months Provision. If it be used as a Merchant Ship, it will carry three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Tuns.</p>
                     <p>The Advantages which are expected from this Ship, are First, That it will be swifter than those hitherto used. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it will carry twice or thrice as many Sails as others do. 2. Having no Ballast, it will be lighter, and consequently swifter.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They pretend that this Ship will be surer than others. 1. Because the Figure of its Sides, with the Water which runs between the two Ships, will keep it from running aground. 2. And having no Ballast, it cannot sink, what Breaches soever it may meet with, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if it be assisted by some Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. 3. Its Keel being supported by a great many streight Planks, will defend it, if it should touch the Ground with all its Weight. 4. Because it will not carry its Noses under the Water, and that its Mast will be sooner Break in the Tempest.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They say, this Ship is still more commodious than others. 1. In that the Water passing with its full Force to the Rudder, along its direct Sides, it will make the Ship turn more speedily than others do, whose Rudder receives only the broken Water by the Sides of those Ships, which are rounder. 2. This Ship not being so round as others, will toss less in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest; and as it will not Rise or Fall but very little, so they may make use even in a Tempest of its Cannons, which are plac'd very low, which cannot be done in other Ships. 3. When it is calm the Ship will go with Oars betwixt these two little ones, beneath the Platform: Besides the Oars, which may be used without-Side, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth every Day to others. 4. Because this Ship will be equally proper to serve in War or Merchandise: And as it will be lighter than others, it is very useful to carry News to any Place, that they have occasion to convey it to; Relieve a Besieged Place, or go to spy out the Enemy, and even in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it will have many Advantages as easily may be imagined.</p>
                     <p>That which is the most feared in this Vessel, is breaking asunder: For, in fine, a considerable Space being betwixt the two Vessels (whereof the Ship is composed) it is feared the Waves which meet there
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103507:118"/>
with great Force, will separate them. But as this Objection was made as soon as the Structure of this Ship was proposed; he that undertook it, hath, as he says, taken such Care to provide against this Accident, that he thinks it is the least thing to be feared. And certainly if there is no secret Cause that retards its Course, or renders its Navigation more perilous, there is no apparent Reason which hinders the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Enterprise. In this Case a great many things must be changed in Naval Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, which hath been hitherto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served: And Wits will have Subject enough to exercise themselves in the Disquisition of the Causes of the Motion, which will meet in the Agitation of this Ship.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of two Letters, one written from <hi>London,</hi> and the other from the <hi>Hague,</hi> concerning the Vse of Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums, to find out the Longitude upon the Sea.</head>
                     <p>BEfore I give the Extract of these two Letters, we must say two or three Words of the Longitude, in favour of those who are not well acquainted with these kinds of Subjects.</p>
                     <p>One of the greatest Philosophers of these latter Ages has observed, That of all Arts, Navigation is the most Perfect, and that which can receive the least Addition: Yet, nevertheless, there are many Defects ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in it. The chief is, That Pilots having lost sight of the Land, and knowing not where they are, run the hazard of loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves; for if the Compass and the height observed teach at what Distance they are from the North and South, and that so the Latitude is easily distinguished, yet no means could hitherto be invented, by which the Longitude could be precisely known; <hi>viz.</hi> what Distance one is from the East or West. Nevertheless, seeing it would be impossible to Navigate, if there was not at least an imperfect Knowledge thereof; Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots are reduced to make a Journal from Hour to Hour, to mark what Wind they have made use of, and observe the Violence and Impetuosity of Currents, through which they have passed. Therefore they hold a very exact Register of these things; and afterwards computing their Journals, they judge by the Estimation of the Way which they have gone towards the East or West; and thus they conjecture at what Distance they are from it. But as this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is very uncertain, and that the best Pilots agree but very seldom in their Reckoning, they often lose themselves in Places against Rocks, which they think themselves very far from: So that it may be judged of what consequence it would be to discover a certain Means to find out the Longitude, seeing after that the Place may be precisely known in what part of the Sea soever one is; and so we might Sail in great Security. This is what Mr. <hi>Huggens</hi> hath found out, by means of the Pendulum. All the World knows its Exactness, that it fails not one Moment: And as soon as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was not doubted but it would serve to find out the Longitude, provided a means could be invented of carrying it on the Sea, without its losing any thing of the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of its Motion. For suppose this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness, it is certain, that if in parting from the Port, the Pendulum's adjusted to the Hour it is in the Port, from which the Longitude and Latitude is known, when one is on the Main Sea, it will be easie to know by the Sun or the Stars the Hour of the Day, at the Place where one is; and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring this Hour with the Hour it was at the Port whence one parted, as it is given by the Pendulum, the Longitude will be found without Trouble: For as it is known how many Degrees of Longitude the Sun makes in one Hour, one may infallibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine by the Difference of the Hours, how far one is towards the East or West; and then to judge by the Map of the Distance of the Place where one is, from all the other Places, which are marked in the Map.</p>

                     <p>CAptain <hi>Holmes</hi> is at last arrived, and the Relation he made us of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of the Pendulums, makes us confident they will succeed. He parted from the Isle of <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> which is under the Line, accompanied with four Vessels: He was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to gain the Wind proper for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, toward the West, and to sail six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Leagues without changing his Road: After which, finding the Wind favourable, he drew towards the Coasts of <hi>Africk,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to North-North-East. But as he had made about four or five hundred Leagues upon this Rumb, the Pilots of the three Ships, which were under his Conduct, fearing they should lack Water before they arrived at the Place intended, proposed to him to go and take Water in at the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos.</hi> Hereupon this Captain having assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them, and made them bring their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, they found themselves distant, in their Reckoning from his, one eighty Leagues, the other one hundred, and the other one hundred and twenty; for this Captain judged by the Pendulums, that he was not much more than thirty Leagues from the Isle of <hi>Fuego,</hi> which is one of those of the <hi>Green-Cape,</hi> which these Pilots judged then to be very far off: And because he had an entire Confidence in these Clocks, he maintained that they should continue their Road; and the next Day in the Morning the Isle appeared, according to his Expectation.</p>

                     <p>CAptain <hi>Holmes,</hi> at his Return, hath given such Relations concerning the Usefulness of Pendulums, as surpassed my Expectation. I did not imagine that the Clocks of this first Construction would suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed so well, and I reserved my chief Hope for the New. But seeing those have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been so successful, and that the others are more exact, I have the more reason to believe, that the Invention of the Longitude will be in its utmost Perfection. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less I shall inform you concerning what you desired to know of the manner wherewith the Gentlemen of the States received my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, when I asked them for the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of New Clocks, and such a settled Price on the Invention, in case of Success, that they have without Difficulty granted me my Request, and willed that I should cause one of these Clocks to be carried into their Assembly, to expound the Invention thereof unto them, and then the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Longitudes: Which I did with great Approbation. I have published this Week, That the same Clocks will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to Sale, with necessary Instruction to use them at Sea; and thus I have opened the way. The Objection was made me here, which had also been made by you, against the Exactness of the Pendulums, to wit, though they agreed together, they might both fail, because the Air at one Time would be more thick than at another. But I answered, That this Difference, if there be any, is not at all felt by the Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums; seeing the Observations made from Day to Day, and continually from Winter to Summer, always shewed that they agreed with the Sun. As to the printing the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of my Clock, I shall defer it as yet for some Time; yet it shall appear never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless with all its Demonstrations, and a Treatise of Pendulums, which I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten some Days past, and which is of a very subtle Speculation.</p>

                     <p>A Butcher having killed a Cow, found she was big with a Calf, which began to be Hairy. Its Hind-Legs had no Joynts, and its Feet were divided like the Claws of a Dog. His Tongue was triple, and after the manner that <hi>Cerberus</hi>'s is described, one in the middle of its Mouth, and two others on the Sides. Between the Fore and Hind Feet, there was a great Stone, upon which it was laid: This Stone weighed twenty Pounds and an half; its Colour was greyish, like to a Cut Stone, which is commonly called the <hi>Grison</hi>; the Superficies thereof was unequal, and full of little Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities; when it was broken they perceived small Grains of Stone, of an oval Figure, and its Colour was mixed with Yellow and Black Veins, which were all over it. Dr. <hi>Haughtein</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi> keeps very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully this Stone, of which he hath sent a Part to Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> who hath shewen it to the Royal Society.</p>

                     <p>MR. <hi>Moray</hi> hath told the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> That Brimstone and Vitriol are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the same Minerals, and that it hath some resemblance of the Lead-mine, which often separate by rubbing when they meet together. Sometimes the Mine is digged fifteen or twenty Fathoms or more, according as the Vein leads the Work-men, or the Subterranean Waters permit them.</p>
                     <p>When Men are minded to make Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, it is broken by little bits, which are put into little Pots of Earth five Foot long, of a Pyramidal Figure, the two parts whereof must be disposed after a leaning manner, and are plac'd one upon another: There are eight underneath, and seven above, ordered so that there is an emptiness betwixt, thro' which the Fire passeth, which by this means toucheth them all. The Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, which is melted thro' the violence of the Fire, droppeth, and coming out by the lesser end of the Pot, falls into a Trough of Lead, which is common to all of them, and thro' which there continually runs a little Brook of cold Water, carried thither by Pipes, to congeal the liquefied Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, which is commonly four Hours melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When that is done, the Ashes are drawn out with an Hook of Iron, they are carried in an Iron Wheel Barrow without the Place, and are broken to bits, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with other Lye-Ashes which are dry, to keep them the warmer, which is done so long as they yield Brimstone.</p>
                     <p>When Persons are minded to make Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras or Vitriol, they take a quantity of these Ashes, which are put into a square Hole made in the Ground, about four Foot deep and eight Foot in bigness, which is every where covered with Boards of Wood well joyned together. After that, they throw Water upon it till it swims, and so it's commonly lest twenty four Hours, or
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103507:119"/>
else until an Egg swims on the top of it, which is a mark that the Water is strong enough. So when they are minded to boyl it, they make it run thro' Pipes into Kettles, and add thereto one half of the <hi>Mother Water</hi> (as they call it) which is that which remains when the Vitriol is made. These Kettles are of Lead, and are four Foot and an half high, six Foot in length, and three Foot broad; and they lay 'em on Iron Grates, and boyl this Liquor in the Kettles with a great Cole Fire, for twenty four Hours or more, according as the Grounds are stronger or weaker. When the Water is well consumed, the Fire is taken from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; they let it cool a little, and draw it from the Kettles by holes which are on the sides, and by wooden Pipes whereby they make it pass into Recipients, which are three Foot deep and four long, where they leave it fourteen or fifteen days, and longer if it may be necessary, until the Vitriol is separated from the Water, becoming clear and hard. The Water which remaineth, when the Vitriol is drawn off, is that which is called the <hi>Mother Water,</hi> and the Lye-Ashes which remained at the bottom of this boared Hole, are the Faeces which the Water leaves, when the Vitriol is made.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal.</head>
                     <p>'TWas attempted a long while ago, to take the Whales which are in the <hi>American</hi> Sea near to <hi>Bermudas,</hi> but the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was altogether given over as Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, because of the Fury and extraordinary Swiftness of these Fishes. But it was begun again sometime since with more Success, as a very able Mariner told us, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the taking of some of 'em: The last time he was at Sea, two old Females were taken, and three young Males.</p>
                     <p>One of these old Whales was eighty eight Foot in length from the Head to the Tail; it's Tail was twenty three Foot in bigness, the Fins twenty six Foot in length, and it's Gills three Foot; it had great Beards hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Nose unto the Navel, and towards the end of the back Parts, a Crest upon its Back; within it was full of Fat like the leaf of an Hog.</p>
                     <p>The other was about sixty Foot in length; one of the young Ones was thirty three Foot, and each of the two others about twenty five and twenty seven Foot in length.</p>
                     <p>The Fish is of a very sharp Figure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, much like the ridge of an House; near the side of it's Head are several little Lumps, its Back is extreamly black, and its Belly white.</p>
                     <p>He saith that the Swiftness of these Fishes is incredible: And that having hooked one, it dragged the Vessel wherein he was, six or seven Leagues in three quarters of an Hour.</p>
                     <p>When these Whales are Wounded, they make a horrid Cry, to which all the rest that are within Hearing, immediately swim thither, but without hurting any Body.</p>
                     <p>He struck one of them one day, which by estimation was more than one hundred Foot in length. He believes that these Fish are like those which are called <hi>Iubartes</hi>; they have no Teeth, and are of a greater length than the Whales of <hi>Greenland,</hi> but not so thick.</p>
                     <p>They feed on the Herbs which grow in the bottom of the Sea, which is apparent by the opening of their great Sack or Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, in one of which there have been found two or three Hampers full of green Stuff, like to Herbs.</p>
                     <p>He thinks seven or eight Tuns of Oyl may be drawn from the biggest of these Whales, tho' all those he took, afforded him but eleven Tuns: But he believes the Reason was, because he had not a Skilful Cooper to hoop them well. The young Ones give but little, and it is more like Jelly than Oyl. That of the old Ones is curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and yet burns very well. That which is drawn from the Fat, is as clear as Whey; but that which is drawn from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larded Leanness, becomes hard as Tallow, and sparkles in burning. As to that which is made of the Leaf, it is like the Fat of an Hog. This Oyl, he says, hath a marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Quality; for tho' it is boyling hot, one may dip ones Hand in it without being burned. It is Soveraign for Wounds and several other sorts of Evils, being applied to the afflicted part.</p>
                     <p>Upon what he first said, That the catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Whales lasts from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>March</hi> unto the end of <hi>May</hi>; he was asked, where they might be the rest of the time, seeing they were not in the Sea? To which he replyed, That the common Opinion was, that they withdrew into the Weedy Caves of the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath been observed, that upon their Fins and Tails there were quantities of Viscosities, upon which there grew Shells; and there has been seen upon 'em Shells bigger than Oysters, many of which have been ranged upon the Palisadoes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Bermudas.</hi>

                     <p>THere are in several Places of <hi>America</hi> a kind of Serpents, most dangerous, which is called the <hi>Bell-Snake,</hi> because with the End of their Tail they make a Noise very like that which Bells do, when they are moved. This Animal is very big, about five Feet long, and of Brown Colour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mixed with Yellow: It hath a forked Tongue, and long sharp Teeth, and moves with as much Swiftness, that it seems to Fly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="212" facs="tcp:103507:120"/>As there was Discourse in the Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of this kind of Serpents, Captain <hi>Silas Taylor</hi> gave there the Relation of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how they are killed in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and afterwards gave it in by Writing, attested by two Persons worthy of Credit, in whose Presence the Experience had been made: These are their own Words.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>wild Pouliot,</hi> or the <hi>Dictam of</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, is about a Foot high, the Leaves are like unto those of the <hi>Pouliot,</hi> and little blue Knots, at the Places where the Branches are joyned to the Trunk; and though the Leaves are of a Red Colour, inclining to Green, the Water, which is distilled thence, is of a fine Yellow, and is like Brandy. When these Leaves are opened and put upon the Tongue, they seem very hot and pricking. They take of these Leaves, which they tie to the End of a splitted Stick, and some one puts it very near the Nose of the Bell-Serpent, which useth all its Endeavours to draw away from it, but the Smell, as it is believed, kills it in less than half an Hour.</p>
                     <p>This Experiment was made in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1651. at which Time it is thought the Venom of these Animals is in its greatest Strength. This Gentleman also assured the Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, That where ever the <hi>wild Pouliot</hi> groweth, or the <hi>Dictam of</hi> Virginia, there are no Bell-Serpents to be seen.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal, about a remarkable Spring, which is near <hi>Paderborn</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>NEar the City of <hi>Paderborn</hi> there is a Spring or Source, which is called <hi>Methorne,</hi> whence there comes three differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Brooks. There are chiefly two, which, though they are not distant from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther above about a Foot and a half, yet have very contrary Qualities; for the Water of the one is Clear, but blewish, Blood-warm and Boyling, which seems to partake of an Armoniac Salt, of Oker, of Iron, of Vitriol, of Alum, of Brimstone, of Niter and Ars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, which they usefully make Use of against the Epilepsie, the Pains of the Spleen and Worms. The other has a Water as cold as Ice, Muddy, Whitish, more Heavy, and of a Stronger Taste than the former, and imbibes much of Arsnick, Salt, Iron, Nitre, and a little of Armoniac Salt, Alum and Vitriol; and it is said, That all Birds that drink on'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But those which he made to swallow a little Common Salt, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after they had drunk, lived a little longer: Others, which he made to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Vinegar, lived almost seven or eight Days, being very much incommoded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and about that Time dyed. He had the Curiosity of opening all those which dyed, and found that they all had the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals and Lungs withdrawn, and gathered together. Notwithstanding, it is certain, that several Persons have been cured of the Worms in taking a little of this Water, which they mixed with other common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for though most of them became there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Sick, yet none of them d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As to the third Brook, which is a little below the others, about twenty Paces from them, it hath a Water Greenish, Clear, of an Acid Taste, and agreeable enough: It is not as Light as the first, nor so Heavy as the second, but it seems to keep a medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both; which makes those who have examined it to believe, That this Brook is formed, and comes from the Mixture of the others, which come to joyn together. This is principally known, in that if they mix an equal Quantity of the Water of these two first Brooks, and if there is a little Well-water put thereto, shaking them altogether, it falls out that after they settle, there is a Water which hath the same Taste and the same Colour as that of the third Brook.</p>

                     <p>THere happened a Difference betwixt these two Famous Philosophers Mr. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velius,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Auzout,</hi> upon the Subject of the Observation made by the former, upon the 18th of <hi>February,</hi> 1665. and afterwards some famous Astronomers of <hi>England,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Importance of this Dispute, resolved to examine it; we have thought, that those who have heard it spoken of, would not be displeased to know what they have done and remarked on this Subject. Having then compared the Printed Writings of these two Gentlemen with one another, and consulted carefully the Observations which have been made here with Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, by some of the most Learned Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers amongst them, who have exactly observed the Position of this Comet with the Telescopick Stars which are in its way; they have unanimously concluded, That whatever this Appearance was, which Mr. <hi>Hevelius</hi> hath seen, near the first Star of the <hi>Ram</hi> (of the Truth of which Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance they would not doubt) the

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Mine of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is in <hi>Frioul</hi>; and the manner of making Wind by the Falling of the Water.</head>
                     <p>THE Mines of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which are in <hi>Frioul,</hi> are situated a Day and a half's Journey, or thereabouts, from <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> drawing towards the North. The Mine, wherein we entred, which is the Richest and Greatest of all, is more than six hundred Foot in Depth. It is descended into with much Pains, by Ladders placed perpendicularly: But there is one of the Descents, where there are from Space to Space Boards laid across, to rest upon them. When we were at the Bottom, we saw the Mine, which is dug out with Picks, because it is for the most part as hard as a Stone. It is of the Colour of Livers, or of <hi>Crocus metallorum.</hi> In these Mines is a soft Earth, in which the Mercury is all by little parcels. There are besides, round Stones found in them like Flint of different Bigness, and resembling little Balls of Hair, which I have often seen taken out of the Bellies of Oxen in <hi>England.</hi> This is the manner how <hi>Mercury</hi> is got. They take the Earth, which hath been dug from the bottom of the Mine, and brought up in Baskets, which is put into Sacks, whose Bottom is made of Wyer, so disposed that one may put his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger betwixt two: Thence they carry it into a Brook of running Water, where it is washed until nothing more can pass through the Sack. The Earth which passeth not is put apart in a Heap, and that which hath passed through the Sack is put into the Hole, whence a second Man draweth it, and puts it into another Sack, and from that into ten or twelve others, which are more bruis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the one than the other. It happens often that there is <hi>Mercury</hi> at the bottom of the first Hole, whence the second Man draweth his Earth; but in any Place where the Iron Wyers of the Sacks are nearest one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they find <hi>Mercury</hi> in a greater Quantity. The Earth is laid in a Heap, which was set aside, and they begin again the same Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The fine and thin Earth which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth after that, and from which the <hi>Mercury</hi> can no more be separated, by means of the Water, is put into Retorts of Iron, proper for the luting of the Recipients, in which the Violence of the Fire pusheth on the <hi>Mercury.</hi> The Officer who had the Conduct thereof, deluted several of 'em in our Presence, to shew them to us; and I observed in all, that there immediately issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out perfect <hi>Mercury</hi> very fluently, and afterwards a black Dust, which being wetted with Water, appeared to be nothing else but <hi>Mercury,</hi> like the other. They piled up the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> and began again the Operation, until they can get no more <hi>Mercury</hi> from it. The Water which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibes the Qualities of the <hi>Mercury</hi> cures the Itch and Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>This is the manner they draw, what they call, Common <hi>Mercury</hi>; for that which they call <hi>Virgin,</hi> is found either perfect in the Mines, or drawn by Lotions and Washings of the Earth. The <hi>Virgin Mercury</hi> is much more esteemed than the other. I asked some of the Officers of the Mine, What Vertue it had in particular? they told me, That when Gold was mingled with <hi>Virgin Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> this Mixture being put over the Fire, the <hi>Mercury</hi> volatilizes the Gold, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Mercury</hi> doth not.</p>
                     <p>Common <hi>Mercury</hi> is in far greater Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity than <hi>Virgin Mercury</hi>; for we saw by the Account these Officers had given the Emperour, That of 695334 Pounds of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which was drawn out of these Mines, in the Years 1661, 1662, 1663, there were 667666 of Common <hi>Mercury,</hi> and only 27668 of <hi>Virgin Mercury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Machines which are used in these Mines are admirable; the Wheels are the greatest that I ever saw in my Life, and are all moved by the Force of the Water, which for little Cost is brought from a Mountain that is three Miles from thence. The Water which is drawn from the Mine, by the means of fifty two Pumps, twenty six on each Side, is employed to move other Wheels, which serve for different Uses.</p>
                     <p>The Workmen are paid but one <hi>Iules</hi> a Day, and stay not long at this Work: For although there is none who is more than six Hours under Ground, they become all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytick, and dye Hectical, some sooner, and some later.</p>
                     <p>We saw there a Man, who wrought at these Mines but six Months, so full of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> that immediately after he had put a bit of Brass into his Mouth, or that he had rubbed it betwixt his Fingers, it became as white as Silver, and as if he had rubbed it with <hi>Mercury</hi> it self. He was so very Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytick, that he could not carry to his Mouth a Glass half full of Wine, without spilling it. I have learned since, That at <hi>Venice,</hi> those who work behind Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:103507:121"/>
not observe that these Men had black Teeth, and it may be we unjustly accuse <hi>Mercury</hi> of spoiling the Teeth, when it is given in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Distempers. It is true, I did not make this Observation upon the Place; but as black Teeth are very rare in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, if they had been so I should undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have remarked it.</p>
                     <p>I am willing yet to impart to you an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention that I find new, which they make use of to blow the Fire in the Brass Forges of <hi>Friouli,</hi> near <hi>Rome.</hi> It is the Water which bloweth the Fire, not in moving the Bellows, as is commonly done, but by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Wind. There is a River, from whence proceeds a Fall of Water, which is received into a Tub; out of the Side of this Tub comes a Pipe, like the Nose of a Pair of Bellows; on the upper-side of the Pipe there is a Hole, with a Stopple, to stop or unstop it at pleasure; the Tub empties itself under Ground when the Hole in the Pipe is stopped; at its Mouth comes out incessantly a great Wind; and when the Mouth of it is stopped, the Wind comes out with such Violence, by the unstopped Hole, in the Top of the Pipe, that I believe it would make a Ball leap, as that does of <hi>Frescati.</hi>

                     <p>THE Design of the Royal Society, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to its Establishment, to apply it self to the Search of Nature, and conformably unto the Observations made upon divers Phoenomenas, and the effects thereof, which were observed by 'em, to compose a Natural History, that might serve for a Foundation to establish a solid and profitable Philosophy, they have from Time to Time given Orders to divers of their Members, not only to labour after the Search of Remarkable Things, which they might meet with in Foreign Countries, but also to give some Instructions for Private Men, who should have the same Curiosity. It is for this End, that considering the great Advantages which might be drawn from Voyages that shall be made for the future into all Parts of the World, Mr. <hi>Rooke</hi> was heretofore chosen and charged with the Care of giving some Advice to those who go to the <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West Indies,</hi> the better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to make such Remarks as might contribute to the Accomplishment of their Design. After which they desired the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners to keep an exact Register of these Observations, which at their Return they should give two Copies of, one to the High Admiral, and the other to <hi>Trinity-House,</hi> to be revised by the Royal Society. Therefore Mr. <hi>Rooke,</hi> before he dyed, acquitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of his Commission, and having made up a Memorial, according to the Order which he had received thereupon, it was thought fit to publish it, and to give a Copy thereof to all the Mariners, in the ensuing Form.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. To observe the Declination of the Compass, or the Variation of the Needle to the Meridian, marking as exactly as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, the Place wherein the Observation shall be made, and the Method which shall be used to make it.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That they should carry with them Needles of a good Temper, and well-touched with a Load-Stone, and to remark after the same manner the Inclination of the Needle.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. To observe carefully the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, in as many Places as they are able, with all the Ordinary and Extraordinary Accidents of the Tide, as what is the prefix'd Time of its Ebbing and Flowing in the Rivers, or Promontories or Capes, what way the Current of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter takes, what perpendicular Distance there is betwixt the highest and lowest Tide, what Day of the Moon, and what Time of the Year falleth out the highest or lowest Tide; so of the other Accidents which may be observed in the Tides, chiefly near the Ports, and about the Isles.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. To make Draughts and Descriptions of the Aspect of the Coasts, Promonto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Isles and Ports, marking the Approaches and Distances as exactly as possible.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. To Sound and Observe the Depth of the Coasts, Ports, and other such like Places near the Shore, as they shall think fit.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. To endeavour to know the Nature of the Earth, which is at the Bottom of the Sea, and to sound it after all the ways, to know if it be Mud, Sand or Rock.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. To make a Memorandum of all the Changes of Winds and Tides which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at every Hour of Day and Night, mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Point or the Place whence the Wind comes, and if it be strong or weak; as also the Rains, Hails, Snow, and such like Things, with the precise Time of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and continuance; but chiefly to have a great Care to remark regular Winds, in what Degree of Longitude and Latitude they begin at first, where or when they cease or change, and become stronger or weaker, and by how much; which ought to be done as exactly as possible.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. To observe and put in Writing all the extraordinary Meteors, such as are Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Thunders, Comets, and false Fires, always remarking the Place and Time of their Apparition and Duration.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. To carry about them good Ballances and Viols, that contain near a Pint, and have a very narrow Neck, which shall be filled with Sea-Water, in different Degrees of Latitude, as shall be thought convenient; and to remark carefully the Heaviness of the Viol full of Water taken at each Time, and especially the Degree of Latitude, and the Day of the Month.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining some Observations made by Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> and taken from one of his Letters, about the Baroscope, and the manner of Weighing the Air.</head>
                     <p>I Shall make no Difficulty to say, That I have hitherto found nothing that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages more certainly, and makes known so exactly the Changes of the Time, which happen after a long and constant serenity, than the Baroscope. I know not also whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the most clear and serene Climates this Instrument might not be absolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; for in these Northern Isles the Clouds are so little, and discharge some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so suddenly, that often the Weight of the whole Atmosphere of the Air receives thereby so small an Alteration, that we are deceived therein, and cannot find out the true Causes of the Constancy or Change of Air: Therefore I should desire to see some good Kalendar or Journal made at <hi>Tangiers,</hi> or in some other of our Northern Places or meridional ones of <hi>America.</hi> At least I can affirm, That after having tryed all sorts of Hydroscopes, whereof I have a great Quantity, and observed carefully the sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Marble, and as many other famous Prognosticks, as I have heard spoken of, I have at last found out, That there is none which comes near the Excellency of the Barometer, to signifie the Changes of the Times which are to happen</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To confirm what I have advanced, I am willing here to give some Remarks which I have made. The Weather appeared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly charged the fourth of last <hi>Ianuary,</hi> but yet more on the seventh, and it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the following Days so gloomy, that all the World believed certainly that we should have Rain; nevertheless, I observed then, That the <hi>Mercury</hi> of my Baroscope did not fall down, and that, notwithstanding the Mists, which sometime appeared pretty Thick, and some Drops of Rain which fell, it remained very high; which made me know certainly, That there would not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen any great Change in the Weather. It is true, that when there fell some small Drops of Rain, it would fall a little, but this was not considerable, and rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms my Assertion than destroys it. And in the last cloudy Weather, which we have had, I have not been Mistaken in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, upon this same Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another Time, seeing that after a small Rain, the <hi>Mercury</hi> rose very high, I thought that we should have a Serenity that would last; but, on the contrary, having remarked that it descended after it had rained, I was in much Doubt whether we should have Cloudy and Rainy Weather.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I believe that the Principal Reason for which we become more chilly and more weak when the <hi>Mercury</hi> appears at the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and the Air is the highest, is because the Air serves to our Bodies for Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even as Water serves for Aliment to Fish; when we are deprived of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Quantity of this Nuurture, it happens to us as it does with Fish, when Water faileth them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the lowest I ever saw the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> fall, since the Time I remarkt it, was the twenty eighth of <hi>October,</hi> 1665. towards Evening, for it appeared to me then fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len twenty seven Inches and an half, as I find it in my Remarks with these Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
                     <p>The twenty fifth of <hi>October,</hi> in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Mercury</hi> was twenty eight Inches and an half; great Storm and Rain.</p>
                     <p>The twenty sixth of <hi>October,</hi> in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Mercury</hi> was twenty eight Inches; Wind without Noise, with gloomy and very thick Clouds.</p>
                     <p>The twenty sixth of <hi>October,</hi> at Evening, the <hi>Mercury</hi> was twenty seven Inches and an half; that Day and the following ones an unconstant Time, and frequent Rains: The <hi>Mercury</hi> was lower than it used to be.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. To be still more exact, I laid over the Place where my Baroscope was, a Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, disposed so that one may easily take each of the thirty two Points of the Wind, from the half Points and quarter Points, pretty far off; otherwise all our Conjectures would be found false, as Experience inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us: By this means, when some Cloud draweth nigh, or some other Meteor gets higher or lower, or when there riseth some Storm or Fresh Wind, be it Night or Day a Servant may bring certain News of the Weight of the Air, as easily and surely as he might the precise Hours, after having consulted a Sun-Dial.</p>
                     <p>The Baroscope or Barometer, whereof we have spoken, is nothing else but a long Pipe of Glass, having about four Feet in length, and a large Cavity of about the fourth part of an Inch. This Pipe is her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically stopped at one of the Ends, and the other is filled with Quick-Silver: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it is prepared, turning down the End which is not stopped, and sinks into other <hi>Mercury,</hi> exposed to the Air, and contained in a larger Vessel, which is under it. By this means the Quick-Silver, which is in this Pipe, striving to escape, as much as it can, and to run into the <hi>Mercury,</hi> in which, as we have said, the Stoppage of this Pipe is thrust, it follows of necessity (as all those know, who have seen this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment) that what remains of the Quick-Silver stayeth suspended in this Pipe, at the height of about twenty eight or thirty Inches (more or less, according as the Air, to which this <hi>Mercury</hi> is exposed, is more Light or Heavy) leaving the Superior Part of this Pipe empty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That which the Iournal of</hi> England <hi>calls</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roscope <hi>or</hi> Barometer, <hi>is no new thing in</hi> France, <hi>where it is almost as Ancient as the Suspension of</hi> Mercury; <hi>for the Experience of the Tute, which having been invented in</hi> Italy

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a new Method, how to sound the Depth of the Sea without a Cord; and to discover the Nature of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at bottom of the Sea.</head>
                     <p>MR. <hi>Hook</hi> is the Author of these two new Inventions; from whence Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages may be drawn for <hi>Physicks</hi> as well as <hi>Navigation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. To found the depth of the Sea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cord, one must have a Globe, or Bowl of Fir, Maple, or some other light Wood; it must be rubd over with Varnish of Pitch, or some such like Matter, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it from the Water; then take a piece of Lead or Stone, the weight whereof must be sufficient to sink the said Globe, which must have a Staple made of Wire-Thread, and a Spring also of the same Wire, whose end must be crooked or bent; into this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple must be drawn the Wire-Spring, which presses the crooked or bended end, to which a Weight must be hang'd by its Ring, to let the Globe and all the rest fall into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Water, where the Weight touching, the Globe also stays there; whence it follows, that the Globe of Wood which is dragg'd to the bottom, only by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Motion which it acquir'd in descending, must also unbend the Spring, and set it self at liberty to ascend again to the top of the Water; so that if it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served how long this Bowl tarries under Water, 'tis easy to discover the depth of the Sea, by means of some Tackle that may may be made for that end.</p>
                     <p>He says we must take great care that the Heaviness and Figure of the Leaden Weight, be proportionable to the Bigness, Weight and Figure of the Wooden Globe, in such manner as Experience shall discover what is most covenient.</p>
                     <p>In some Essays which have been already made of this Instrument, the Globe, which was of Maple, and well covered with Pitch, was 5 13/16 Inches Diameter, and weighed 2 ½ Pounds. The Lead weighed 4 ½ and was Pyramidal, and 11 Inches in length, the Point turn'd downwards: The Basis was 1 2/16 Inches Diameter, and the Point was 1/16: In the <hi>Thames,</hi> where these Experiments were made, where it was 19 Foot deep, there was only six Seconds of an Hour betwixt the Immersion and Emersion of the Globe: And in another place, where the Water was but 10 Foot deep, 'twas but about two Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds and an half. When there shall be more Experiments of this Nature made, without doubt 'twill not be very difficult to find out a Method for the Computation of the depth of Water, according to the length of time which these Globes stay under Water.</p>
                     <p>It's also Remark'd, that in making new Experiments in the <hi>Thames,</hi> this Globe being cast into a place where the Water was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, it was not longer in ascending to the top, than in passing the length of two Boats from the place where it was cast in, being carryed so far by the Stream.</p>
                     <p>The other Instrument, which was to draw in the Water that was at the bottom of the Sea, was a Pail of Square Wood, whose top and bottom were made after such a manner, that a Weight coming to sink the Iron (to which the Pail is fastned by two Ears, 'having at both ends moveable Bottoms, in the form of two folding Doors) and by this means drawing in the Water at the bottom, the resistance of the Water taking hold of the Pail in such a Posture, so that the Water might easily pass over it whilst it descended. But so soon as the Pail is drawn up again by a Cord, the resistance which the Water makes to this Motion carries the Pail to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and keeps it in a close Posture, so that Water that is without cannot get in; nor that which is shut up within, cannot get out.</p>
                     <p>By means of this Instrument it may easily be perceiv'd, whether the Water at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea is salter than that on the Surface; as also whether the Water is fresh in any place of the bottom of the Sea, as the Industrious <hi>Iohn Hugh van Linschoten</hi> assures us, who in his Relation of the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> tells us, That near the Isle of <hi>Barem</hi> in the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf, with certain Instruments ( of which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he gives us no Description) they drew out of the Sea from under the Salt Water, four or five Fathom deep, some Water that was as fresh as that of a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of a Letter written by Mr. <hi>Peti,</hi> Intendant of the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to Mr. <hi>Galloys P.</hi> concerning the Depth of the Sea, the Nature of the Water which is at the Bottom of the Sea; and some other Curiosities.</head>
                     <p>IT will be hard to judge right of the Depth of the Sea by the Machine men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>English Iournal,</hi> and which was related in a Journal of the third of <hi>May:</hi> For neither the Figure nor the Discourse explain intelligibly the turning and situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spring, which ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent when the Lead toucheth the bottom, and how the wooden Bowl is disingaged from that of the Lead. But suppose, that the Lead remaining at the Bottom of the Water, the light Body should Ascend, and that the Time of the Descent and Ascent of these two Bowls together, was well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, as it is easie to do; besides that one ought to know many things which are yet unknown, to be able to judge of the Depth of the Water.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How much Time a Heavy Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to descend into the Water, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to such a certain Depth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If it descends with the same Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Swiftness as it would do in the Air: I do not say Swiftness, but only in the same Proportion of Swiftness; for Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shews us, That when a heavy Body falls in the Air, it falls unequal Spaces in the same Distance of Time; as for instance, suppose it falls twelve Foot for the first Second of Time, in the next Second it will fall thirty six Foot, in the third Second it will fall sixty Foot, and so on. By this means one may know the Highth of a Tower, or the Depth of a Well, in letting a Stone fall from the Top, or another heavy Body, and measuring the time of its fall with a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum of a String of nine Inches and a quarter long, which shall mark the half Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds; as a String of 37 Inches marks the Seconds, 60 whereof makes a Minute.</p>
                     <p>This is very near the proportion of the fall of heavy Bodies in the Air, according to the Observations which I have made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in times past. But to know whether the same Bodies falling into the Water, and in the Water of the Sea, and if they keep the same proportion, is the difficulty; and this difficulty is encreased, when a heavier Body than the VVater is joyned to the lighter.</p>
                     <p>We should besides this, know when a light Body ascends from the bottom of the Water unto the top, in what proportion of Time and Swiftness it mounts. For to assert that 'tis the same as that by which it descends in the Air, which I have now expounded, is what will never be determined. And tho', for my own Curiosity, and that of Father <hi>Mersenne,</hi> I have in times past made several Experiments, to know if a Dart perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly shot by a Bow, would descend in the same equality or proportion of Time and Swiftness in which it mounted; and if a Bomb or an Iron Ball as big as one's Fist, cast by a small Mortar, would take more or less time to fall in, than it wou'd to mount by the violence of the Powder, I can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine nothing on't, if I did not again make the same Experiments several times; tho' I remember there was but little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the one and the other, and that the time of the natural Descent of Arrows was to their Assent, as 7 is to 5: But for the Bullet of a Canon or Mortar, we judged that it descended almost with the same Impetuosity as it mounted; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our selves the better, we overturned the Mortar, and put it's Britch upwards, shooting into the Ground, and we found that the Bullet sunk but a little deeper by the violence of the Powder, than it did by its natural force, when it fell on the Ground. This proportion of swiftness of a Body mounting and descending, being not yet given by Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> nor known by the Experience which is related thereof, which marks but the time of the Motion of these two Bodies together, to wit, the Descent of the heavy joyned with the light, and the mounting of the light alone, there remain still many Things to be known, before any use can be drawn from this Invention.</p>
                     <p>Besides, it is not a new Invention. For several have written, that for to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound the depth of the Sea, one needed only to take a Lead of eight or nine Inches long, made into a Cone or a figure like a Horn, at the top of which there must be tyed a Spike of Iron about the length and thickness of a Finger, a little inclined upon the Lead. So that this Machine may represent a Figure of Seven, whose long Leg is a weight of Lead, and the Spike of Iron the Head. If in this Spike there is a Ring well fastned to a wooden Bowl, and this Machine is cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Water, as soon as the Lead comes to touch the Earth, it must fall, not being able to keep up, being pointed at the end like a Sugar-loaf, and the wooden Bowl be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rais'd up by the Water will make its Ring to disengage from the small Iron Spike, and then it will ascend with such proportion of swiftness as I believe to be unknown. Thus without other Artifice, one may, it seems, do the same thing, supposing the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom was firm, and that there should be no Vessel.</p>
                     <p>As for the other Invention, of drawing Water from the bottom of the Sea, it is so darkly expounded, that it can scarcely be understood; one must guess that there were Pails at the two Handles, that they were moveable, and made like a Spring. But without all this ado, I have done the same thing before now, with a Brasen Pump of about a foot long, which I let fall into the Sea with a Cord, and which had the same effect as your Pail with its Lead and all its Apparel; for the lower Pipes opened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in descending, and shut themselves in ascending; and brought up Water from the bottom of the Sea.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:103507:123"/>But I have always found this Water Salt, for five or six Fathom deep, having made no Experiment lower. And certainly if Experience and good Physicks were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted, the Sea should be more Salt in the bottom than at the Surface, seeing the Salt being more heavy than the Water, it wou'd stay at the bottom, and the lightest and sweetest wou'd always rise uppermost, as we see by the Rain, by Lembicks, and by all sorts of Evaporations; and I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that one can doubt of this. For the Authority of <hi>Iohn Hugh van Linschoten</hi> a Hollander, which says, in Chap. 6. of his Voyages (that writ in his own Tongue, not in English) That in the Isle of <hi>Baharem,</hi> which is in the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulph, there is fresh Water found four or five Fathom below the Salt. We shou'd doubt this to be Matter of Fact, had it not been related by this Author. For he knows it not by Experience, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it by Hear-say, as he doth many other false Things; were it nothing but what he saith of the Tomb of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whom he pretends to be in a Coffin of Iron suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Air, by a Vault of Stones made of Loadstone, which all the World knows to be false.</p>
                     <p>But tho' fresh Water shou'd be found at the bottom of the Sea near the Isle of <hi>Baha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> four or five Fathom under the Salt Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it follows not that one should find it else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. For the cause related by <hi>Texeira,</hi> in his Relation <hi>De los Reyes de Harmuz,</hi> where he saith, That the Isle of <hi>Baharem</hi> hath much Water, whereof the best is that of certain Wells, very deep in the midst of the Isle; and that there are great Veins of pure and fresh Water which spring in the next Sea, where the Divers go for it above three Fathoms, or thereabouts; and that they are of Opinion, these Fountains were in times past in fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So you see that it is a Fact altogether parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; from which we ought to not conclude, That under 4 or 5 Fathoms of Salt-Water, there is commonly sweet Water found; but only by such Causes, or by the Springing up of some Rivers which are lost under Ground, and come out into the Sea by Subterranean Chanels, which are sometimes to be found.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal, Communicated by Mr. <hi>Hook;</hi> how to cause a Plano-convex Glass of a small Sphere, to retort the Rays of the Sun upon a <hi>Focus</hi> of a greater distance than its Convexity requires.</head>
                     <p>TAKE two Glasses, whereof the one is perfectly flat on both sides, the other of one side only, and Convex of the other of what Sphere soever, so that the flat Glass may be a little larger than the other. Afterwards take a Ring of Brass made very round, in which you must cement these two so that their Superficies may be exactly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, and the Convex side of the Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convex Glass may be turned inward, yet without its touching the flat Superficies of the other Glass. Being thus well cemented in the Ring all round, pour into a little hole that must be at the brim of the Brass-ring some Oyl of Turpentine, Spirit of Wine, Salt and acid Liquors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and having filled the empty Space which is betwixt the two Glasses, stop this hole with a Vice, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different refraction of the Liquors put betwixt the two Glasses, the <hi>Focus</hi> of this Prospective shall become either longer or shorter.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> adds, That he wish'd he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined a Tryal, among several which may be made, upon the possibility of making a Glass wrought in a little Sphere to serve a Prospective of a very great length; tho' for fear of promising too much, he ought to add, That among the Spherick Objects those which are greatest, and whose Matter hath a greater Refraction, are the best.</p>
                     <p>It's long since that Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> proposed to Mr. <hi>Azout</hi> this Problem, to lengthen the <hi>Focus</hi> of Prospectives. Mr. <hi>Azout</hi> gave them a general Solution of it for every length given, by the disposition of a second Glass, whose Figure he determined; as may be seen in his Letters, printed by <hi>I. Cusson,</hi> and whereof mention was formerly made in the French Journals. But Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> having inform'd him, that the Invention which he had found was very different from what was before thought upon; Mr. <hi>Picard,</hi> very understanding in these sorts of Matters, proposed about five Months ago, the means of lengthning the <hi>Focus</hi> of Prospectives by Liquors, after the same manner as hath been seen in the Journal of <hi>England.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the Glory of this Invention is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways due unto Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> who hath had the first Thought thereof. It's true, there will not be much use drawn from it; yet it is very Fine and Curious.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of a Letter written from <hi>Oxford, May 12. 1666.</hi> by Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis;</hi> and inserted in the Iournal of <hi>England,</hi> about a Visit to a dead Body. struck with Thunder.</head>
                     <p>THERE was here a frightful Thunder the 10 of <hi>May,</hi> wherewith two Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, who were alone in a Boat without a Water-man, were unhapily struck, and cast out of the Boat into the Water. One of them was killed out-right, and tho' he was taken out of the Water, where he scarcely stayed one Moment, yet there appear'd no mark of Life, Sense or Motion in him: The other was very well, yet fallen down in the Boat, without being able any way to help himself, and as immoveable as a Stake; but
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103507:123"/>
there appeared no Wound in his Body; and all the harm he had, was, that he remained so troubled in himself, that he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how he fell into the Water; and whether it was the Thunder or some Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which was the cause. He remained in this State the Night following, and I know not what became of him since.</p>
                     <p>As for him who dyed, as soon as he was drawn up, we endeavoured to bring him to Life by all manner of Remedies, but all was in vain. Therefore he was brought the next Day Morning into the City to be Buried. Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> Dr. <hi>Mellington,</hi> Dr. <hi>Lower,</hi> and I, had the Curiosity to visit this dead Body, to remark the Particularities thereof.</p>
                     <p>We found no considerable Wound in all the Skin. His Face and Neck were black and livid; on the right side of his Neck there was a small blackish Spot an Inch long, and a quarter of an Inch large at most, like unto a mark made as if it had been with a hot Iron, an Inch long and a quarter of an Inch broad; there was another a little big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I think, on the other side of his Neck under the left Ear; and below on the left side of his Breast, there was a place which was about nine Inches long and two Inches broad; in some places more, in others less, which appeared burnt, dry, and like the Skin of a roasted Hog: On the fore-part of the left Shoulder, there was such another Spot almost of the breadth of a Six-pence, yet it was not so black nor so much marked as that of the Neck; from the top of the left Shoulder downwards towards this part of the Breast, there was a little place of the Skin which was, as it were, broiled, as if by that something entred into the Neck, which went down towards the Breast, and which afterwards extended further.</p>
                     <p>The most part of his Buttons were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, the Neck of his Doublet was broken in two, just before the left Shoulder, and in some places the Stuff of his Doublet appeared as if it were cut off or taken away by a blunt Instrument, but the Fashion with which it was lined, did not appear to be broken.</p>
                     <p>His Hat was strangely torn round about the edges; there was among other things on the Side, a Hole big enough to put ones Fist through. There were in other places deep Cuts to be seen, which appear'd to be made by an obtuse Instrument. As for the rest of the Cloaths we perceived nothing more, and they had no smell of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>
                     <p>The following Night we open'd the Head, where we found no sign of Contusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Brains were intire and in a good State, the Nerves whole and without any hurt, the Veins and Arteries sufficiently full of Blood, so that none of the Company could say any thing against it. It is true, that this was done by a Candle, and that each part could not be examined with all the exactness which could be wished for, partly because of the Concourse of People, partly because the Body was to be buried a little Time after: Notwithstanding, I believe if there had been a considerable Defect among so many Spectators some one would have discovered it. There were some who imagined to see a little Cleft on the Scull, and those who held him whilst it was sawed, said, That then they had felt some crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but it was such a small Business that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certain could be known of it by the Candle.</p>
                     <p>On the right-Temple were seen some Hairs, manifestly burned, and the lower part of the Ear was a little blacker than that which was round about the upper part of the left Shoulder; and the left Side of the Neck was yet Blacker than the rest of the Body, yet without driness, as if this Colour had not been caused but by the sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Blood.</p>
                     <p>After having thus examined the Head, the Breast was opened; and it was found that the Burning traversed almost the whole Skin, which was scorch'd in these Places, hard and like a Horn: Yet there appeared nothing else under the Skin. The Muscles were in their natural situation, and had lost nothing of their ordinary Colour. The Lungs and the Heart, which we afterwards drew out of the Breast, had their ordinary Colour, and seemed nothing altered.</p>
                     <p>This is what was chiefly remarked: To which I shall add, That in the Night the Body swelled much more than it did in the Morning, and that it had a strong and stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Smell; which, notwithstanding might come from the Heat of the Weather, and the multitude of People which was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Chamber.</p>
                     <p>We have carefully related all the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the Visit of this Body, because it being made by several most Learned and Experienced Physicians, it may serve for a certain Ground, to reason upon the Nature and the Qualities of Thunder.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal: An Experiment to examine what Figure and Swiftness of Motion Produces, or Augments Light and Flame.</head>
                     <p>THis Experiment was communicated by Doctor <hi>Beale</hi> as follows.</p>
                     <p>The fifth of <hi>May</hi> 1665. fresh Mackarels were boyled in Water with Salt and fine Herbs, and when the Water was cooled very well, the Mackarels, the next Day, were left in the Water to be seasoned.</p>
                     <p>On the sixth, other Mackarels were boyled, which were fresher, in a like Water, and on the seventh both the Water and Macka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels were put with the first Water, and with the first Mackarels. I relate particularly all these Circumstances, because whether it be the Mixture of the Pickle, made after one another, or something else that was
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:103507:124"/>
necessary was wanting, the Experiment suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not another Time with the same Trial.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the eighth, towards the Evening, the Cook moving the Water, to take some of the Mackarels out, observed, That at the first Motion it became very luminous, and the Fishes shining through the Water much encreased the Light, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this Water, by reason of the Salt and Herbs, which they had boyled in it, was rather Thick and Black than of a Clear and Transparent Colour; notwithstanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved, it was Luminous, and the Fishes appeared through it altogether whole, and very shining.</p>
                     <p>Where-ever Drops of this Water fell, they shone after they had been moved, and the Children took Drops in their Hands, as large as a Penny, and carried them up and down the House; and the lustre of this Light made each Drop shew far and near, as large as a six Penny-piece.</p>
                     <p>That Side of the Fish that was downwards was turned upwards, but there came no Light from it; and after the Water had rested long enough, it shined no more.</p>
                     <p>Tuesday Night we began the same Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment again, and we saw the same things. The Water shewed no Brightness before it was stirred, and it appeared even obscure and thick in the Day as well as by Candle: But so soon as a Hand was put into it, it begun to shew Bright. When it was strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stirred it shined so that those who looked upon it at some Distance from thence, even as far as the other End of the Chamber, thought it was the Light of the Moon which came in at the Window upon a Vessel full of Milk: And when it was stirred round more swiftly, it seemed to be a Flame, and there was a great Brightness both within and without these Fishes, but chiefly about the Throat and some other Places, which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be broken in Boyling.</p>
                     <p>I took a bit thereof, which shined most, and adjusted it the best I could, in the Night, to my great Microscope, and then to another that was less; but I could not find any Light by the means of these Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, neither in this Bit, nor in any of the Drops of Water, which shined before, and which I had put into Glasses.</p>
                     <p>The tenth of <hi>May</hi> I examined a little Bit of this Fish, with my great Telescope, at the brightest Beams of the Sun, which shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most of the preceeding Night, but we remarked nothing considerable. Its Surface seemed whitish and dry with deep Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; and the rest, as well as I, thought they saw a Vapor, rather obscure than lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, which raised from this Fish after the manner of small Dust and small Sparkles, which were almost imperceptible; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing we are very certain of having seen them, for we reckoned them, and we all agreed in their Number, their Order and their Place; yet I am not so assured of this Vapour, whereof I have spoken, but that I am afraid the Light of the Sun deceived us, and that this Vapour was the Dust of the Air.</p>
                     <p>Having made Trial, in the Day, with a great Microscope, upon this Bit, we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it at Night, but it gave no more Light, whether it was looked upon with Glasses or otherwise.</p>
                     <p>Seeing it was dry, I thought, that by wetting it with Spittle and handling it, I could make it shine a little, which also hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; but this Lustre lasted not long, and besides, there were seen some small Sparkles, which disappeared immediately: We perceived them with our Eyes, without making Use of Spectacles.</p>
                     <p>The Fishes as yet had no ill Smell, and had not lost their Savour, according to the Judgment even of the most delicate Palates; therefore I caused two to be kept, to make other Experiments two or three Days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when they should begin to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, hoping to find more Light therein; but I found nothing of what I expected, neither in stirring the Water, nor in drawing out the Fishes.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining divers Experiments about Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trification.</head>
                     <p>THough there hath been already much written of the manner how Stones are formed, notwithstanding we have not as yet a perfect History; therefore the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ought to apply themselves to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to perfect it, and to discover the Cause of this Transmutation; for besides other Advantages which might be drawn from this Knowledg, it would be of great Use to hinder a Stone from generating in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body, or to dissolve it when it is formed.</p>
                     <p>To this End there has already been given, in divers Places of the English Journal, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Relations touching this Matter, as the History of a Monstrous Calf, which was found in the Belly of its Dam, laid upon a great Stone, which weighed more than twenty Pounds: As also that a certain sandy Earth in <hi>England</hi> converts into a Stone such Wood as is put therein, although there is no petrifying Spring in it. There is also mention made of two Stones which were found in the left Ventricle of the Earl of <hi>Belcarras,</hi> one of which was of the bigness of an Almond, and the other was one Inch broad and two in length. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> relates in his <hi>Essay of Firmness,</hi> several such Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, upon which he makes very curious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. There are also several other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the Micrography of Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> and in the Book of <hi>Helmont,</hi> entituled, <hi>De Lithiasi</hi>; where, among other things, he relates what <hi>Pareus</hi> saith of a Child petrified, that was to be seen formerly at <hi>Paris,</hi> and which served for a Whetting Stone to him that kept it. There might several other
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103507:124"/>
Histories be added, still more surprizing, if they were suspected, as that of an entire Company of Men, and of a Company of Beasts, which, according to the Relation of <hi>Aventius</hi> and <hi>Purchas,</hi> were converted into a Stone; and what <hi>Acosta</hi> speaks, of a Company of Spanish Cavaliers, to whom a like Accident happened.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Beale</hi> tells us, upon this Subject, That there was an Inspection about the Time of <hi>Easter</hi> into the Matrix of a Woman, whence a Stone was drawn, which she car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried for eight or nine Years with unsuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Torments, of which she was since entirely well cured. He assures, That he hath seen the Stone, and that having then weighed it in excellent Ballances, he found it weighed near four Ounces, but that its Weight is since a great deal diminished, and is become very Light for a Stone of the Bigness. He adds, That it is of a whitish Colour, a little clearer than that of Ashes: He believes it is not much different from that which <hi>Scaliger</hi> speaketh of, and after him Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> in his <hi>Essay of Firmness,</hi> which being exposed to the Air, became like Plaister, as much in Consistence as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. It hath no considerable unevennesses, and its Figure is almost Oval, but one of the Ends is not so much like a Hen's Egg as the other, which is bigger and more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuse than that of a Goose-Egg. This Stone is now given to the Royal Society, with the Certificate of the Chirurgeon who made the Operation, and of several credible Persons, who were present thereat.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>ONE of the greatest Obstacles which is in the Progress of Natural Science, is, that the Ancients being entirely taken up to perfect Reason, have neglected the Knowledg of the Senses, having rather chosen to guess the most part of things, than to see them. Notwithstanding, as the Soul knoweth nothing, but by the Interposition of the Organs of the Body, the Operations of the Senses serve not less to acquire a perfect Knowledg of Nature than those of the Mind; and they are even more necessary, that the Wisdom of God being infinitly above the Reach of our Imagination, it is more easie to know what it hath done, than to imagine what he hath been will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make.</p>
                     <p>To remedy this Defect, the Moderns hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endeavoured to perfect the Operation, of the Senses, particularly that of Sight, which is the most necessary of all, as it is the noblest, have invented two kinds of Glasses, the Telescope, to draw near the Objects, which are invisible because of their Distance; and the Microscope, to magnifie those which are imperceptible, because of their Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And with these two Instruments they have discovered more things in a few Years, than the Ancients had done with all their Reasons for the Course of many Ages. By this means all Nature has appeared New unto us. For the Telescope hath shewed us in the Firmament new Motions, new Stars, and new Meteors: And the Microscope hath discovered unto us, upon the Earth, a little World, altogether new, and hath made us perceive in each thing an infinity of small Creatures, which are not less admirable than all those which have been known hitherto.</p>
                     <p>The Ingenious Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> having made several curious Observations with both the one and the other of these Instruments, but particularly with the Microscope, hath gathered them together, and communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the Publick in this Book, which he hath entituled <hi>Micrography,</hi> to wit, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of small Bodies, because he prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally examines what is least in Nature.</p>
                     <p>He begins with the Point of a very fine Needle, which though it seems imperce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, appears by the Microscope, which he made use of, as large as the fourth part of an Inch. The Extremity of this Point does not terminate in a Cone, as People imagine, nor is it round or flat, but obtuse, unequal and irregular, and resemble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Pin, whose End is broken. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over its Sides are not eaven, as our Eyes do represent them unto us, but knotty and full of little Cavities and Risings.</p>
                     <p>He saith also, That having considered, with his Microscope, the Edge of a Razor, well set, it appeared as thick as the Back of a Penknife, and observed several Teeth in it. That the Surface of a Looking-glass, well polished, appeared to him, before the Sun, to be full of Rays, and composed of an infinity of unequal Bodies, which reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Light of several different Colours. And that the best made Points, which serve in printed Books, at the separation of Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, appear like uneven Ovals, and not rounder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>han Chesnuts. And it is not to be wondred at, because the Files, the Stones and other Things, which are used to polish or to make round, being composed of une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Parts, they must also of necessity leave several unequalities on the Surface of those Bodies upon which they act.</p>
                     <p>He also examined some very fine Linen-Cloath, whose Threds, through the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscope, appeared unto him as great as Ropes; and he hath observed, That that which renders those thin Cloaths so transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, is, That there are many Holes betwixt the Thred, almost like to the Bars which are put in the Grate of a Window. He found out, That the Waves which appear in divers Stuffs, upon the highest Parts, cause a different Reflection of Light; and he remarked, That in the Syphons and Tears
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103507:125"/>
of Glass: There were several curious Things, which the brevity of this Journal will not permit to relate.</p>
                     <p>After having spoken of the Works of Art, he comes to those of Nature, to which the Microscope is much more advantagious than to the others: For there is this difference betwixt them, That the Works of Art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always very imperfect, and will be only seen afar off, and the more exactly they are considered, the more Defects are found in them: But as the Works of Nature are the Effects of an infinite Wisdom, they do not fear to be examined, and always appear the more admirable as they are the nearer lookt upon. Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> in this Treatise giveth several Descriptions thereof, of which there is none but what is surprizing; but as they cannot all be related here, I shall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark some of the most Curious.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He describes the Foot of a Fly, and expounds how these small Animals can su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spend themselves upon the top of a Ceil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thus to walk without falling. Some have believed, that their Feet were full of a sticking Moisture, by means of which they adhere to whatever they touch; but the true Reason is, as it hath been found out by the Microscope, That Flies have at the End of each Foot two Talons, which easily enter into the least Pores of all Sorts of Bodies; and moreover the Soles of their Feet are covered with an infinity of little Points, like to the Combs of Carders, with which they easily stick to the least unequality of the most polish'd Bodies.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing uglier than a Lowse, and yet the manner wherewith it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto us by a Microscope, is as curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as this Insect is hedious in it self. Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> hath drawn the Figure of it with the Microscope, because it being a Foot and a half long, if sheweth better than others how far this Instrument can enlarge Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Lowse hath two Eyes placed behind its Horns, quite contrary to other Animals; for as it hath no Eye-Lids, the Hairs through which it passeth, would hurt its Sight continually. It seems to have some Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chops. Its Paws are covered with a Shell, as that of Lobst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s, and have two Talons, with which it grasp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Hair, when it walks on the Head. It hath upon its Breast a light transparent Substance like unto Horn, and upon its Belly a Skin spotted, through which may be seen, that the white Spot, which perhaps is the Liver of this Insect, is agitated with a continual Motion. Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> having shut up in a Box one of these Animals for two Days, without giving him any thing to eat, and having afterwards put it upon his Hand, this Insect thrust its Snout into the Skin, without seeming to open any Chop, and immediately a little Torrent of Blood was perceived, which passed directly and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily from its Snout into its Belly by means of a kind of Pump, which seemed to be the Heart or the Lungs. Through the Scale of the Breast were plainly seen several Vessels, which swelled up with this Blood, which was carried and distributed into divers Parts. Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> remarks, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion is made in the Body of this Insect with a marvelous quickness: For the black and thick Blood was seen, whilst it sucked it; when it was in it's Guts, it appeared of a fair red; and the Part which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed in the Veins, was all white. He adds, that altho' its Snout was not the 25th part as long as Line, and that it did not thrust it quite through the Skin; yet the Blood was seen to come out not only in the Skin, but even unto the very Cuticle.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Structure of the Sting of a Bee, is not less marvelous. It is composed of two parts, whereof the first hath several Knots or Joints, and besides that several Pricks which perfectly resemble the Nails of a Cat, and which the Fly stretcheth or draweth in as it lists. The other part is the point of a Sting which is shut up in the first as a Sword in its Scabbord, and which is also armed on each side with Nails. It is they which stop the Sting in the Wound which the Fly hath made, and which hinder that it cannot draw it back. But that which chiefly maketh the Pain, is a corrosive and venemons Liquor which is shut up in the Scabbord, and which being pushed into the Wound gnaweth the Fibres, and causeth the Inflammation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Leaf of a Nettle hath much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with a Sting. For this Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, that it is covered with very sharp Pricks, whose Base, which is a little Sack or Bladder of a flexible Substance, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of the Figure of a wild Cucumber, includeth a sharp and venemous Liquor; but the Point is of a very hard and strong Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and hath a hole in the middle, by which this venemous Liquor runs into the part which is prick'd, and excites Pain therein: Which may be easily perceived with a Microscope, if one presseth with a Finger the end of these Pricks against its Base: For then through these Pricks which are transparent, this Liquor is manifestly seen to mount and to descend, as Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> assures he hath often made Experiment.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This Author having examined with the Microscope several of its Hairs, hath found that they were all almost round. That at the End they were bigger than towards the Root; that from one End to another they appeared transparent as a Horn; and that there are no Threds to be seen in their Root, as in that of several Plants. He adds, that they are solid, and that he hath disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered no Cavity in them, no more than in the Bristles of an Hog. But that the Beard of a Cat being cut, hath just as the Elder-Tree, a large Marrow in the middle; yet the Weaving thereof is so close, that there can be no appearance of Pores perceived therein.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. As the Opinions of Philosophers are very different, touching the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Fire is produced when one striketh Fire,

                        </gap>hor made several Experiments to find out the Truth of it. Having then for this Design struck Fire upon a leaf of white Paper, he found at the place where the Sparkles were fallen, little black Spots, but Luminous; and having considered them each in particular with a good Microscope, he found that they were little Bowls round and shining, among which there were two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the others; the one whereof was stuck by one end to little bit of Steel pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty long; the other was but a Blade of Steel very small. Thereupon this Author makes divers Arguments, and lastly he concludes, That these Sparkles are nothing else but Particles of Steel or of a Flint Stone, which are sometimes made red, sometimes melted, and even often vitrified, according to the different degrees of Heat, which Motion produceth. And to confirm this Opinion, he after having made some File-dust of Steel to pass over the Flame of a Candle, he saw shining Particles fall from them like unto Sparkles of a Flint, only that they were a little bigger.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But there is nothing more admirable, nor which better shews the Excellency of a Mircroscope, than what this Author saith of Mouldiness. It was never thought that it was a heap of small Plants, and that all the Things which appear mouldy, were as so many small Meadows enamelled with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Flowers. Some had round Buttons, and which seemed not to be opened; others were half Budded; some were altogether Flowered; and there were some whose end appeared to be broken, as if they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to cast their Flowers. Tho' they were very near one another, each had its Root apart. Their Stalks were red, long, cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindrick and transparent. Their Substance was very tender, and almost like that of Mushrooms; for in touching them with a Pin they broke easily, and being put to the Flame of a Candle three or four times, they remained whole. As for their Odour it was strong and unpleasant, as well as their Taste.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. A Flea hath six Legs, which hath three Joynts each, whose Disposition is altogether different. For the Joynts of the two fore Legs enter and are entirely trust into one another; those of the Thighs of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle have their Extent quite separate; but the hind Thighs have their Joynts folded upon one another as the Leg and Thigh of a Man. When the Flea leaps, it stretcheth at the same time all its Legs, and its diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Joynts coming to unbind together as so many Springs, cause this Leap, which some have attributed to Imaginary Wings.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. It is wonderful to see the quantity of small Pores, which the Microscope discovers in a Coal. They are disposed in order, and white all over, so that there is no Coal, how long soever it is, through which one may not blow; and if a bit of it is broken a little short, the Light is seen through with a Microscope. Their number is so great, that in a rank, the 18th part of an Inch long, Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> hath reckoned 150. whence he concludes, that in a Coal of an Inch Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, there ought not to be less than five Millions, seven hundred, fourscore and four thousand. It is to this great quantity of Pores, that he attributes the blackness of a Coal: For he saith, when a Body hath many Pores in which the Light is not reflected, it appears necessarily black; whereas Blackness is nothing else but a privation of Light, or a de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IN a late Journal we have spoken at large of the Observations which Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> made with the Microscope. Mr. <hi>Lewenha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>k</hi> imparts now those which he hath made with the same Instrument.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He examined certain yellow Grounds of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> near the City of <hi>Tournay,</hi> whereof <hi>China</hi> is made, and he found that it was composed of several small Globes a great deal less than the least Grains of Sand. Those of the Earth of <hi>Flanders,</hi> were less than those of the Earth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; but he observed yet less near <hi>Esphen,</hi> whereof they make pretty strong Pots, and which is easily changed into Glass. This Ground cannot be used to make <hi>China,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is too red; but it is good, being mixed with the two other Earths whereof we have spoken. This Earth is not so pure as the others, it is mix'd with other parts which it seems are of rotten Wood, and Particles of Sand.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He found that in the white of the Eye of a Beef there were some little Globes. That the Cristallin was also composed as round Scales laid upon one another; and that these Scales were composed also of small Globes. He discovered the Vitriol Humour was much fuller of little Globes than the Watry Humour. The Cartilage being dryed, he saw also that it was composed of Cristallin little Globes very even among themselves; and if this Membrane suffers some Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it seems to him as if it was wet. These little transparent parts appear white when they are laid upon one another, as Cristalling appears white when it is dry or
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103507:126"/>
broken, and appears so no more when it is wet. And he hath found out that all the other Tunicles were also composed of even little Globes united to one another.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Optick Nerves in which he hath remarked small Arteries, appeared to him to be composed of Threds pretty tender and a little strait. These Threds are like wise composed of little Globes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. What he hath remarked upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Water which is on the side of <hi>Berkelse</hi>-Sea, is also very Curious. The bottom of the Sea is very marshy in that place: In Winter it appears very clear; in the middle of Summer it begins to whiten, and in the midst are seen as it were small green Clouds. Mr. <hi>Lewenhook</hi> having filled a Glass with this Cloudy Water, and stirred it, after having let it settle a whole day, hath remarked in it as it were Strings of a Spiral Figure, and thick as Hairs, composed of small green G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="5">5. Finally, having exhal'd the Solution of Salt, he found that the Saline Particles were either Round, Pyramidal, or Quadrangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and very polished.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining some Observations made upon the Salts and Oyls of mix'd Bodies.</head>
                     <p>MR. <hi>Coxes,</hi> who made these Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, finds much probability in the Opinion of <hi>Vanhelmont,</hi> who saith, That the variety of Brimstone commonly makes the diversity of Species in the Mixt; and that the most considerable Changes are made by the Separation of a Sulphurous Nature, and by the Introduction of a new one. This Brimstone is not a simple Body, but infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable and in form of Oyl. This Oyl, which is drawn commonly with the Water, includes the principal Qualities of the mix'd. But the Salts, as well fix'd as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, restore the Earth and Water to their elementary Simplicity, if they retain not something of this Specifick Oyl. So the fix'd or volatile Salts are different among themselves, but proportionably as they yet retain some mixture of these Oyls.</p>
                     <p>Let one take some volatile Salt whatever, let it be sublimated in a Vessel of Glass high enough for a gentle Heat, let this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be reiterated several times, it shall be found that there still remaineth some Oyl at the bottom of the Vessel, and the Salts being deprived of this Oyl, shall become very homogenious. But because it is hard to rule the Fire so justly, that no Oyl shall be mixed with Salts, they may all be reduced to a certain Simplicity by a more easie way.</p>
                     <p>Spirit of Salt well rectified, must be poured upon a certain quantity of vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt a little purified. When there shall be no more Ebullition, and that the Salt shall be enough, the Phlegm must be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it, which is done with a mild Heat. This Phlegm will carry with it some portion of the volatile Salt. Sublimate what remains, and you shall have good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack Salt. Mix it with an equal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of good Alcali Salt well calcin'd, or pour upon it good and strong Grounds of an Alcali, because the volatile Salts do not so well mix with the fixed as the Acids do, the least degree of Heat shall sublimate the volatile Salt deprived of all its Oyl, and by this means all the volatile Salts are reduced to certain common Proprieties.</p>
                     <p>What all these Artificial Operations do, is yet more easily effected in the Air, which is full of volatile Salts which are sublimated from Subterranean Places, from Plants, from Animals. The Air depriveth these Salts of their Oyl; but being dissolved in the Rain or in the Dew, and carried in Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, they are specified by the other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, tho' they may be easily reduc'd by Nature or Art to their first Simplicity.</p>
                     <p>The same Uniformity is the Spirits that have the taste of Wine, which are nothing but the most subtle Oyl of Vegetables, which are as it were pounded by Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into lesser Branches than the Oyl: For before the Fermentation there is Oyl drawn from it, but not Winy Spirits; after the Fermentation there remaineth a little Oyl; and even after the Fermentation of a Plant, when you draw the Oyl from it, you'll scarcely have any thing of the Winy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. When this Spirit takes with it some part of this Oyl whose Branches remain whole, it puts difference among the Spirits; but when after several Digestions or reiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Distillations, these oleagenous parts are cut into lesser Branches, or that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Heat which raiseth the Winy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits cannot raise those grosser Oyls, what difference soever there was in the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, these Spirits became very homogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and this is seen in changing the Oyls of Vegetables into a Winy Spirit, which is done in several manners. Put upon an Ounce of the essential Oyl of a Vegetable, two or three Pounds of the Spirit of Wine well dephlegmed; the Spirit immediately, by a simple Agitation, devoureth this Oyl and changeth it in its Nature.</p>

                     <p>ONE of the principal Vertues of Salts which are drawn from Plants, is to make the Image of these Plants to revive and appear in all its Beauty. It hath been doubted a long time whether the Thing can
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103507:126"/>
be done. Some do even as yet doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: But the Experiments which have been made in <hi>France, Italy, Denmark,</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, suffer us no more to doubt on't. Mr. <hi>Coxes</hi> hath lately made some in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> upon this Subject, and he writeth that having drawn a great deal of Salt of Fern, and dissolved a part thereof by the damp Air, after having dryed it, the rest of the Grounds being filtred became as red as pure Blood. This colour denoted, that there remained many Sulphurous Parts. He put this Solution into a great Vessel or Bottle of Glass, where after it had rested five or six Weeks, a great part of the Salt fell to the bottom and became browner, whereas the upper remained white. And then it was that upon the Surface of this Salt, there was seen to rise up a Fern in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
                     <p>When the Fern was burned, it was as yet betwixt dry and green: So the Salt was, as it were, Tartarous and Essential; being dryed by a great Fire it diminished much in Weight, and became whiter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there had been before some Oyl and some Acid.</p>
                     <p>Having mixed equal Parts of these Ashes which came from the North, and which are called in English <hi>Pot-Ashes,</hi> with Armoniack Salt, there arose immediately a volatile Salt; and some time after he saw appear a Forest of Pines, Deals, and of another kind of Trees, which he knew not.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of a Letter of Mr. <hi>Hugens</hi> of the <hi>Royal Academy of Sciences,</hi> to the Author of the Iournal of the Learned, concerning the Catoptrick Glass of Mr. <hi>Newton.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Send you the Figure and Description of Mr. <hi>Newton</hi>'s Telescope. As to my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which you desire to know touching this new Invention, though I have not as yet seen its effect, I think I may say it is Fine and Ingenious, and that it will suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, provided there be Matter found for the Concave Looking-Glasses, which may be capable of a lively and even polishing, as that of Glass, which I do not despair of.</p>
                     <p>The Advantages of this Glass, over those wherein nothing but Glass is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are first, That the Concave Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Glass, though of a Spherick Figure, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth much better the parallell'd Beams towards one Point, than our Spherick Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses do; as this may be Geometrically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated. Whence it followeth, that of two Glasses of the same length, whereof the one shall be of this new manner, and the other an objective Glass as usual; the first bearing a greater opening, may unite much more Beams coming from the Objects, though the little Looking Glass hindreth some of them; and yet it may be made to magnifie much more than the other. So that with the half or the third part of the length of the old Glasses, or perhaps less, the usual Effect may be had.</p>
                     <p>The second Advantage, is, That by this Invention an unseparable Inconveniency of the objective Glasses is avoided, which is the Inclination of both their Surfaces to one another. For though this Inclination is little, yet it hinders the Beams which pass towards the sides of the Glass, and it would hinder still more, if we should make use of Hyperbolick or Elliptick Glasses, which would require greater Overtures.</p>
                     <p>I reckon for a third Advantage, That by the Reflection of a Metalline Looking Glass, there are no Beams lost, as in the Glasses which reflect a notable quantity thereof by each of their Surfaces; and besides that, do not intercept one part by the obscurity of their Matter.</p>
                     <p>And this Matter being also so difficult to meet with the Goodness which is requisite for long Glasses, because for the most part it is not altogether homogenious, is a fourth Advantage of this Catroptick Glass, that in the Metal there needed no other Goodness but that of the Surface.</p>
                     <p>Those who have seen Mr. <hi>Newton</hi>'s Glass, do observe, that there is a little difficulty to order it towards the Objects. But this may be easily remedied by fastning thereto a Glass which may be exactly parallel to it, by which the Object may first be sought for: It is true that for this there needeth a second Observator, if the Catropick Glass is big; because that he that looketh at it, ought to be at the end which is raised on high: But this Incommodity is inconsiderable, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the usefulness of the Invention. If instead of Spherick Looking Glasses, there could be had parabolick ones, exactly formed and polished, these Glasses would have the effect which were hoped for from the Ecliptick or Hyperbolick Glasses; and I believe it much easier to succeed in Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glasses.</p>

                        <p>He put common Water into a Vessel of Brass which was about 8 Inches broad and 6 high, and having exposed it to the Air

during a hard Frost, some time after he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that long Shreds of Ice begun to form, some whereof did go from the Top to the Bottom, others ran across, some more fastened to the Bottom and Sides of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and others crossed in divers Places. Afterwards he saw these Shreds to widen into very thin Blades; and having softly poured out the Water, by stooping the Vessel, that so he might the better see the Blades of Ice, which were formed at the Bottom, he found that they all had the Breadth of about three Lines, and that they were separated from one another by equal Intervals, whose Breadth was also about three Lines.</p>

                        <p>The same Vessel having been filled again with new fresh Water, and exposed to the Frost, there formed immediately Ropes and Blades of Ice as before; and afterwards the Blades of Ice, which were at the bottom, grew large by little and little, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed a continued Ice, which covered all the Bottom of the Vessel. The Blades of Ice which were on the Top of the Water, were also joyned together; but there was about the middle of the Surface of the Water a little Place which froze not, and the Ice was more than an Inch thick when this little Place not frozen. The Water went out by little and little through this Hole, and freez'd round it according as it was spread; so that the Hole became still narrower, and there was was made round about it a Rising of Ice, about an Inch high, which formed a little Channel. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the Hole being quite stopped, the Ice some time after broke with a Noise, before all the Water which was in the middle was frozen.</p>

                        <head>EXPERIMENT III.</head>
                        <p>To find out what made the Water come but by this little Channel, and what broke the Ice, Mr. <hi>Mariotte</hi> took a great Glass, of a Conick Figure, and having filled it up with Water, within three or four Lines of the Brim, he carefully considered the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of the Congelation. After that small Ropes were formed, and then small Bars of Ice, whereof some were cut like <hi>Parsley Leaves,</hi> and others dented as a Saw, several small Bubbles of Air began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the Bottom and at the Sides of the Glass, and magnified by little and little: Some of these stayed engaged in the Ice, others were loosed and raised up to the Top. The more the Water freezed the more Bubbles were formed; yet the Water came still forth by the little Channel, and as it freezed so it spread: The Ice in fine became so high round about the small Channel, that on one Side it passed the Brims of the Glass, so that the Water ran over it. Then he made another Channel with a Pin at the other Side, where the Ice was less thick, and the Water immediately went that way. This Channel was renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Time to Time, and the first Hole, by which the Water passed no more, was entirely shut up. Afterwards the Water stopped also the second Channel, which was no more renewed; and yet there were Bubbles that were formed in the Water, which was not as yet frozen, and raised unto the Top of the Water. Some time after the second Hole was stopped, he heard the Ice crack, and found that it was cleft at the Top at two Places; that about two thirds of the heighth of the Glass the Ice above was entirely separated from that which was under, by a Space of about two Lines; and that in the midst of the Ice there was a little Water, which was not yet frozen. He remarked also, That in all this Ice there was an infinite Number of little Bubbles, which ended in a Point, and which extended almost all towards the middle of the Glass; and that at the Place which the Water had frozen last, the Ice was whitish, and a little transparent, almost as Snow.</p>
                        <p>By these Experiments we judged, That the reason why the Water included in the Ice raised and spreaded at the Top, was, That the Bubbles which were formed, coming to stretch, pressed and pushed it out; that the little Channel had remained a long while without freezing, because the Water which continually passed through it, kept it open: That when the Ice had at last stopp'd this Passage, the Bubbles, whose number always increased, was at last too much press'd, and by the Strife they made to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themselves, had broke the Ice: That it was also this same Strife, which had made the Ice above to part from that beneath; and that the whiteness of the Ice, which was last formed, happened because there were many of these Bubbles mixed with it.</p>
                        <p>If it be asked, Whence these Bubbles come? he answers, That they are formed of an Aerial Matter, with which the Water is all full, as is seen by Experiment of the <hi>Void</hi>; for if there is a Glass full of Water put into a Recipient, there are seen many such Bubbles come out of the Water when the Air is pumped: And the same thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth when there is Water put to boyl on the Fire. It will perhaps be said, That in boyling Water these Bubbles come from the Fire: But Mr. <hi>Mariotte</hi> hath seen several of these Bubbles stay more than six Weeks at the Bottom of a Dish filled with Water, without any notable diminishing in bulk, although the Dish was no more on the Fire, but exposed to a pretty cold Air; whence he concludes, That these Bubbles are not Particles of the Fire. It might also be doubted whether they come from the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Vessel, or from the Air which is contained in these Pores. This Doubt, which seems pretty well grounded, gave him an occasion of making a curious Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment: He poured Oyl into a little Vessel, and with the Head of a Pin he put softly a Drop of Water over this Oyl. Having afterwards put the Vessel on the Fire, he
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103507:127"/>
saw no Bubbles come from the Oyl, but he saw a great many come from the Drop of Water: When the Oyl was more warmed, the Drop of Water fell to the Bottom, and Bubbles continued to come from it. But what is wonderful, a little after there fell out a kind of Fulmination, and at the same instant the Top of the Oyl was all covered with Bubbles, whereof some were bigger than the whole Drop of Water. This Experiment made him to judge, That the Matter, of which the Bubbles were formed was contained in the Water, and that it changeth into Air when the Water is frozen, or boyled, or that the Air about it is pumped out, in making the Experiment in the <hi>Void.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It remains to know how the Bubbles are formed, why they swell, and how the Ropes are made, which appear at the beginning of Freezing; which he also easily expounds, according to the same Principles. He saith, There is a great likelihood that the fluidity of the watry Liquors comes from that their Parts are continually agitated by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Aerial Matter, and that this Motion is maintained by Heat; whence it followeth, that when there happeneth a great Cold, this Motion becomes so weak that it can no longer agitate the Parts of the Water, so that they stick to the Vessel, and then they joyn to one another; and thence comes these Ropes and Bars of Ice, which are seen to appear when the Water begins to freeze: Then the Aerial Matter is disingaged from the Water, which freez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and as the Spirits of new Wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing separated from the Gross Matters of the Wine, put themselves into Motion, and make the Wine come out by the Bung-Hole or Break the Barrel, if they have not Passage given them; so this Aerial Matter in dilat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes the Water come out by the little Hole, which remains open, and where this Hole is stopped, it breaks the Ice, which keeps it too pressed. To shew that there is no other Cause of this Rupture, Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotte</hi> made the following Experiment.</p>

                        <p>He put fresh cold Water into the Vessel, which he had made use of in the two first Experiments, and when the Water was altogether frozen above, so that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained no Channel, he pierced the Ice with a big Pin; there came immediately out a Spout of Water more than two Inches high, which took away the Pin which remained in the Hole. He continued to pierce the Ice from Time to Time, until the water was altogether frozen, and after that he left it exposed to a very cold Air, two Days and two Nights successively; but the Ice burst not, though other Ice which had not been pierced, burst just by it.</p>

                        <p>He was minded to see if there needed many of these Bubbles to break the Ice; and for that end having set another Water to freeze in the same Vessel, he pierced the Ice from Time to Time: When the Water was frozen almost all over, he drew the whole Ice out of the Vessel, having heated it a little, and left it exposed to the Air, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out piercing it any more. A quarter of an Hour afterwards he heard it break, and found it separated into two Parts, almost equal; in each of which there was a Cavity of about an Inch diameter, which was the Space oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by the Bubbles, and the rest of the Water which remained unfrozen. The Ice was above the Fingers thick, all round about; and yet the Bubbles which were formed of the little Water which remained, did nevertheless break it.</p>

                        <p>Many Persons have endeavoured to make Burning-Glasses of Ice, but it is hard to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, because Ice is commonly imperfectly Transparent. Mr. <hi>Mariotte</hi> having judged by the precedent Experiments, That if the Aerial Matter was exhausted, which is in the Water before it was exposed to the Frost, one might have very pure Ice; and he was minded to make a Trial of it: Wherefore he boyled some clean Water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fire, for about the Space of half an Hour, to make the Aerial Matter evaporate, and then exposed it to a very cold Air. Very near this hot Water, he put as much cold into another Vessel, to compare them together: The cold Water begun to freeze before the hot Water had as much as cool'd, and there were formed a great many Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. The hot Water also freezed at last, but the Ice was two Inches thick on all Sides, afore any Bubles were formed, so that it was perfectly transparent: He put a bit of this Ice into a little Concave Spherick Vessel, and having set this Vessel near the Fire, he made the Ice on one Side to melt by little and little, until it had taken a Convex Spherick Figure: He did as much on the other side, turning the Ice often, and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Water on it from Time to Time, according as the Ice melted. When the Ice had a Convex Figure, pretty uniform, he took it by the two Edges with a Glove, that the heat of his Hand might not so soon melt it; and he exposed it to the Sun. This Experiment had the Success he expected, for in a very short Time, by the Heap of this Ice he made some fine Powder to take Fire, which he had placed in its <hi>Focus</hi> or Point where the Rays met together. It is true, that notwithstanding all the Care which may be taken, it is impossible to make all the Aerial Matter to evaporate from the Water, and to hinder that some Bubbles do not form in the middle of the Ice; yet there is always a considerable Part on't which is perfectly Transparent.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of a Letter of Mr. <hi>Hugens,</hi> of the <hi>Royal Accademy of Sciences,</hi> to the Author of the <hi>Journal of the Learned,</hi> touching the Figure of the Planet <hi>Saturn.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE last Conjunction of this Planet with the Sun happened the twelfth of <hi>March</hi> past of 22 Degrees 35 Minutes of <hi>Pisces,</hi> and the great Obliquities of this Place from the Zodiack to our Horizon, when it riseth, is the Reason why it was almost three Months before it was seen in a clear Morning; for it was but the fifth of <hi>Iune</hi> when Mr. <hi>Cassini</hi> observed it the first Time, the Arms of <hi>Saturn</hi> being already vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and large, it was judged they were re-established a long Time before. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked also upon the North Side of the <hi>Descus</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> a little Tract of Shadow, which agreeth as well as the re-establishment of the Arms, with what is mentioned els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, concerning the Ring with which, I suppose, <hi>Saturn</hi> is surrounded. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Hypothesis is chiefly confirmed by the Observations which have been lately made, whereof some have not been as yet published, you will suffer me to relate them on this occasion, with the Reflections I have made thereupon.</p>
                     <p>In the Year 1671. <hi>Saturn</hi> appeared round, without Arms or Handles, as I had foretold it fourteen years ago, when I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished my System; though this happened two Months sooner than I expected, to wit, from the beginning of the Month of <hi>May.</hi> Afterwards an Intermission was perceived in the round Figure, which I had not seen before, and it had been hard for me to do it, having observed <hi>Saturn</hi> but for one Year only, when I writ these Predictions: But you know that as soon as I heard that the Arms were returned, which Mr. <hi>Cassini</hi> observed on the eleventh and fourteenth of <hi>August,</hi> I said, that assuredly he would take them up again in a little Time, which was also found to be true; for about the fourth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the Arms of <hi>Saturn</hi> were to obscure that I doubted whether they appeared as yet, though Mr. <hi>Cassini</hi> assures he had seen them the thirteenth of <hi>December</hi> following, after which the round Figure continued until <hi>Saturn</hi> hid himself in the Beams of the Sun. This Last Eclipse of the Arms proveth chiefly the Truth of my Hypothesis, seeing it may well be judged, it would have been hard for me to foresee this second Change so near the first, if I had not known what had been its true Cause. Besides, that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it self wherewith the Arms were lost this second Time, was precisely such as I have established in my System; for they were seen to lose by little and little their Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, though they remained always large enough to be seen; which was a certain Mark that the Beams of the Sun lighted very obliquely the Surface of the Ring of <hi>Saturn,</hi> which was turned towards us, and that at last they lighted no more, but the other opposite Surface. In the Precedent Apparition of the round Figure, from the end of <hi>May</hi> unto the fourteenth of <hi>August,</hi> the Arms were not become invisible for want of being lighted, but because our Sight was very little or not at all raised upon the Surface of the Ring, which the Sun looked upon.</p>
                     <p>All these Reasons cannot be understood but by those who have taken the Pains to examine attentively what I have written thereof in the System of <hi>Saturn</hi>; and it is for them that I shall adhere yet, that as to the Lines of the Equinoxes or of the round Apparition of <hi>Saturn,</hi> which Line is made by the Intersection of the Ring, and of the Draught of the Orb of this Planet, there have been hitherto no Observations made, which oblige me to place it elswhere, but at the 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Degree of <hi>Pisces</hi> and the <hi>Balance,</hi> which is the situation I have given it in Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the System. Every Time that the Place of <hi>Saturn</hi> meets in these Places of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, it ought to appear round and even, it is only two Degrees or thereabouts from it. For the Observations of the last Year, 1671. oblige me to straiten thus these Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, which I had in Times past established six Degrees; which I had done to save some Observations of <hi>Galileus</hi> and <hi>Gassandus,</hi> whose Prospects have been of less effect than I had dared to suppose them. According to these last Limitations the Appearances of the round Form of <hi>Saturn</hi> ought to last less than by my former Predictions, so that in 1685. it will not be at the beginning of <hi>March</hi> but only at the Month of <hi>Iuly,</hi> about the End of the Appearance of <hi>Saturn,</hi> that he shall be seen to lose his Arms, which he shall recover in the Month of <hi>November</hi>; and so in the Year 1701. it cannot be seen round but in <hi>Iune,</hi> at the beginning of his Appearance, and from the Month of <hi>August</hi> his Arms will begin to grow again.</p>
                     <p>Before I end, I shall add, That the Table which I have given of the Motion of the small Moon or Star, which accompanieth <hi>Saturn,</hi> and which turns round about him in sixteen Days forty seven Minutes, hath been hitherto found so conformable to the Observations, that I cannot as yet see whether I ought to add to it or diminish from it.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of the Registers of the <hi>Royal Accademy of Sciences,</hi> containing some Observations which Mr. <hi>Perrault</hi> made concerning two remarkable things which were found in Eggs.</head>
                     <p>THE first Observation is upon a little Egg, which was found in a great one, and was about as large as a little Olive; it was also of the Form of an Egg, only a
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103507:128"/>
little longer in Proportion than Eggs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are; but the End which is the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in Eggs, was so much more in this: When it was first found in the big one, which inclosed it, it had no Shell; it was only covered with a hard and thick Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, which became hard in a very small Time as the Shell of all Eggs. The Matter wherewith it was filled was not Yellow, as it is common in other Eggs, but White and Serous, such as is that of Eggs which are found in an Ostrich, when she is near laying, or such as are those that are Barren and Corrupted.</p>
                     <p>Another Observation is, of an Egg, in which a Pin was found inclosed; and the Place by which it got in was not to be seen. This Pin was covered with a whitish Crust, of the thickness of the third Part of a Line, which gave it the Form of a Bone of a Frog's Thigh. Under this Crust the Pin was Black and a little Rusty.</p>
                     <p>The great Number of Examples which we have of the easie Penetration which Living Bodies are capable of suffering by the Dilatation of their Pores, may make it credible, that the Small Egg entred the Covering of the Great one without Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, notwithstanding the little Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which its blunt Figure gave it for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating; and that the Pin passed through the Body of the Hen without wounding her, though its pointed Figure was very cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of doing it.</p>
                     <p>It appears that the insensible Motion of Things which are pushed by little and little produceth these two marvelous Effects. It is seen, that the Parts of the Plants, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though blunt (such as the Points of Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-grass) penetrate the most hard Earth by the slow Strife they make; and there are Persons who thrust sharp-pointed Pins up to the Head in their Arms and Legs, without Pain, because they are used to it by little and little. It seems, nevertheless, That nature finds more safety to make blunt things pass, which are capable only of dilating the Pores of Living Bodies, than those which by their Figures are more sharp; and this is seen by the Care it hath to make, as it were, a Case to the Point of a Pin, which we speak of: And we have, moreover, observed a like Providence in the Dissection of a Duck, in whose Ventricle we have found a great Knot of Ribbons, made of Thred and Gold-Lace, which being a Weaving of small Bars of Metal, capable of tearing the Skin of the Ventricle and Intestines, each Bar was covered as with a little Leather, which took the Roughness away; yet we have further remarked in the Ventricle of an Ostrich, That two coyned Pieces, which it had swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, seemed only to have been kept a long Time, and were not covered with this Crust, so much as in the very Places of their Cavity, because perhaps these Pieces of Metal were not capable of hurting the Body their Figure; there being some Reason to believe, That things which hurt the Parts by their asperity, make a Salt come out capable of causing the Coagulation of the Humour, whence this Crust is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit the Examples of Penetration, which blunt Bodies may make, and the Histories which we have of this Nature, about Bodies swallowed and entred, by Places where there is no apparent opening; render this Thought probable, That the little Part, which was found harder about the Point than the Film of an Egg is, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to descend into the Channel called <hi>Ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductus,</hi> might penetrate these Films, being pushed on softly and insensibly.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining some very Curious Remarks made by Dr. <hi>Grew,</hi> about the Structure and Vegetation of Plants.</head>
                     <p>THE First of these Remarks is, That in Plants there are organick Parts, somewhat like those of Animals; so that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him one may say, they have En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails, a Heart, a Liver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. That the whole Body of a Plant, in respect to its Structure, is like a Piece of Lace, in the same Form as it appears upon the Cusheon. The Substance of the Liver and the Parts which are about it, are like so many small Threds; those which are nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="4">4 That the Juice supplying the Place of Blood in Plants, there is a continual Profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion made on't, and a Circulation very much like the Blood in Animals.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the Motion of the Air in Plants is not less necessary for their Vegetation than the Motion of the Juice; that it enters into it by the Trunk, and particularly by the Root, from whence it is distributed into all the Parts of the Plant.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That the Juice is not always the same, that it is at first like Oyl, afterwards like Milk; and that it is apparent from the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Parts of the Juice, which are thus found, the Matter of Rosin and Gum are produced upon the Body of Trees.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That the Motion of the Juice ascends up to the Top of the Branches by the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Fibres, which compose the last Circle which is formed in the Body of the Tree; and he pretends, That there are so few of them in the oldest Fibres, that it may be said they are rather filled with a kind of Vapour than a true Liquor: Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

as this Vapour moistens the sides of these old Fibres, yet it doth not nourish them; and it is for this Reason that Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and other such like Roots, being only plac'd in a moist Air, encrease and grow.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of a Letter written from <hi>Florence,</hi> concerning a prodigious Fire in the Air.</head>
                     <p>AN Hour after Sun-set, there appear'd in the City of <hi>Florence,</hi> in <hi>Tuscany,</hi> so great a Brightness, by the means of a prodigious Fire which run in the Air, that it was thought, by a new Miracle, the Day would re-appear. Every one spake as he thought of this new Prodigy, and gave it a Name according to his Fancy. Some affirm'd they had seen a Flying Dragon which vomited Flames, and heard his Hissings; others call'd it a Column, a Beam, or a great Club of Fire; others gave it the Name of a Fatal Comet, which foretold very great Misfortunes. But intelligent Persons agreed, that in the middle Regions of the Air there was seen, at the beginning, a little whitish Flame like unto a little Cloud, which immediately darkned the Moon, and which kindling still stronger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in a little time of a considerable great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and thickness.</p>
                     <p>It's Course lasted not long. It first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared under <hi>Arcturus,</hi> thence running with a surprising Impetuosity against the Motion of the <hi>first Mobile,</hi> and whistling after a frightful manner it came to the vertical Circle, and travers'd the <hi>Zodiack</hi> under the Lines of the Lobsters and <hi>Gemini</hi>; but coming at the right Shoulder of <hi>Orion,</hi> it fell into a Cloud which was at the West, as if it had been entirely quenched, there was no more Fire nor Brightness seen; but during the Space of eight Minutes a great noise was heard, much stronger in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces than in others, and which might pass for an Earthquake.</p>
                     <p>This Prodigy ought not to go for a new one in <hi>Italy</hi>; for we find that in the same City of <hi>Florence,</hi> in 1325. a Figure, as it were a Spindle of Fire, was seen to fly at Night in the Air, which was very big. In 1352. there was likewise seen in the Air after Sun-setting, a great Mass of gathered Vapours, which was accompanied with a noise as great as a Thunder-clap. In 1353, and 54. there appeared two more: The first as a great Serpent all in Fire, about one of the Clock at Night; and the other about six at Night, like flying Fire. Finally, in 1557. there appeared in the Air a great Vapour kindled, which was seen throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> and which was follow'd by three different Noises.</p>
                     <p>There may be a Physical Reason given for this Meteor, which ought to be put into the number of those which are called burning Torches. It arose from the great Heat which was at <hi>Florence</hi> about the end of that Winter, which had less of the rigour of this Season than of the mildness of the Spring, and was warmer than usually. For the preceeding Summer having been almost without any warmth, the Exhalations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained spread in the low Region of the Air, not being able to rise up to the middle one. They were balanced and preserved in this first Region by the great Humidity of Autumn. But the last forty days of the Winter having been very dry, as we have already said, there was Heat enough for these Exhalations to be raised higher, where they were easily inflamed, and aided by the violence of the Winds which reigned then, by means of which they made a violent Passage through the Clouds, which inclosed them.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Cassini</hi> had Advice that the same Phoenomen was seen at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Bologne,</hi> and <hi>Imola,</hi> and several other Places, the same Day and about the same Hour that it appeared at <hi>Florence.</hi> The Relation which Mr. <hi>Vittori</hi> hath sent him from <hi>Bologne</hi> upon the Observation which he made of it himself, is almost like to that of <hi>Florence</hi>: But as it specifieth many things which the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Florence</hi> does not, it will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to give here a little Abridgment of it, which Mr. <hi>Cassini</hi> hath had the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to communicate to me.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Vittori</hi> observed this Phoenomen at <hi>Bologne,</hi> at a quarter past one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Clock, which was then an hour and three quarters after Sun-setting. It was as large as the Moon in its full, of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of pale Fire, and inclining a little to Green, bright as the Sun when it is among Vapours after Rain, with a long Tail as a sparkling Flame, its Head being a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, as if it were lighted Iron. It had a very quick Motion from the East to the West. It lasted but a Minute of Time, and in less than a quarter of a Minute it passed from the Constellation of <hi>Orion</hi> to <hi>Venus</hi> which was at the West, it augmented in apparent bigness, and made a noise like to that which several Serpents do when they are cast into the Air. Several Persons smelled an odour of Brimstone and Bitumen.</p>
                     <p>The Tail of the Phoenomen was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with some black Clouds, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards covered the Heaven, and the same Night there hapned a small Rain which was much expected for four Months.</p>
                     <p>What Mr. <hi>Cassini</hi> finds remarkable in all this, is, that this Phoenomen was seen at the same time from <hi>Bologne</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> to pass through the Constellation of <hi>Orion</hi>: Whence he conjectures that it was very much raised, yet it could not be said how much, because the Constellation of <hi>Orion</hi> is great, and the Observation of <hi>Bologne</hi> marks not the Star by which it passed, as that of <hi>Florence,</hi> even as the latter telleth us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Clouds, wherewith the Tail of this Phoenomen was followed, as we learn by that of <hi>Bologne.</hi>

                     <head>An Extract of the Iournal of <hi>England,</hi> containing some new Experiments made and communicated by Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> concerning the Course of the Air weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the Change of Colours which are produced by its Operation, in some Dissolutions and Precipitations.</head>
                     <p>THESE Experiments are but a Series of the Design which Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> had proposed to himself in the Conjectures which he gave us upon some Qualities of the Air which had not yet been observed. The two principal Things which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in these new Observations, are, to discover, 1. If even as the Corruption of some Bodies inclosed in Vessels makes the Air to augment, as he hath already marked elsewhere, so some other Corruptions might not also weaken it by some contrary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If in some Dissolutions or Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Air might not produce some new Phoenomen, by some Quality which had not as yet been observed.</p>
                     <div n="1" type="experiment">
                        <head>EXPERIMENT I.</head>
                        <p>Having taken some Leaves or Dust of pure Brass, and put them into a Cristal Glass of a Conick Figure, into which very good Spirit of Salt had been cast for about the height of three Fingers above the Brass, the Glass was neatly shut with a Stopper which had been made for this effect. Then it was left for some Days upon a Window without stirring it, and some time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was perceived in the Liquor a brown and obscure Colour by the Dissolution of the Brass. But this Colour being vanished, the Liquor appeared like clear Water; which is also a certain considerable Phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and then taking away the Stopper without troubling the Liquor with any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and giving thus a free axcess to the exterior Air, the Surface of the Liquor regain'd in a few Minutes its first Colour, and having insensibly penetrated more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the Body of the Liquor appeared a quarter of an Hour after, coloured after the same manner. The Glass being well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopped, the Menstruum in a few Days lost its Colour; and when it was again unstop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, it retook its first Tincture.</p>

                        <p>The Liquor became more clear than usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this second Experiment, which was made after the same Method as the first; but the Glass having been unstopped and the Liquor thus exposed to the exterior Air for half an Hour, the Surface of the Liquor was found more coloured than the rest: This perhaps was not because it was expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the exterior Air, but because it might be doubted whether the Air had made some Operation upon the rest of the Liquor, tho' it appeared not at first to try it.</p>

                        <p>The Vessel was stopped, and having left it thus two or three Hours, there was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Liquor a Colour something like Green, pretty thick, and indifferently transparent, which it lost not, even when it was exposed to the open Air after that the Glass had been unstopped, and that it had been left so 24 Hours. But because they might, in part, attribute this slow and imperfect Success to the Season of the Year, which was a little too late, since 'twas to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle of <hi>October,</hi> he made the following Experiment, for better Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                        <p>A little of the strong Spirit of Salt being preserv'd upon the Brass until the Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was come to a Colour intermingled with red and black, he put about three Spoonfuls of it into a Recipient which held eight times as much: The whole having been preserv'd in a <hi>Void</hi> for about half an Hour, kept the same Colour; but the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel being open'd, and the exterior Air ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving free Access, the Dissolution appear'd in half an Hours time turn'd to a very clear and transparent Green, although we saw no precipitation of the Substance disturb'd by the Faeces.</p>
                        <p>As for the Influence of the Air, and the Knowledg of weakning and diminishing it, by any other Method than that of Cold and Compression, just as we see it encreases by Heat and Dilatation; having often found the Menstruum which breaks and spoils some Metals after such a manner, that it produces small Bottles or Bubbles capable of exciting the Spring of the Air, shut up in Vessels where the Dissolution is made: Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> found it worth his Labour to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether in some Metalic Dissolutions, where he only observ'd a few Bubbles almost imperceptible, the Springs of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring inclos'd Air might be satisfied.

                        <p>After having taken some thin Pieces of Brass, and put them with Mercury into a Conic Glass stop'd up exactly with a Clod of Earth, he turn'd so much of the fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirit of Urine upwards, that it swam above to the height of three or four Fingers, and then he carefully clos'd up the Glass. After this he perceiv'd that the Mercury was much depress'd, and the Stoppage ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been taken out for the Admission of the exterior Air, he saw that by this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Air it had a manifest Effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mercury.</p>

                        <head>EXPERIMENT VI.</head>
                        <p>A certain quantity of good Brass being put into a Conic Glass, with as much Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of fermented Urine as will make it swim above the Brass the breadth of a Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he stop'd up the Glass very exactly, placing a crooked Pipe about it, wherein there was Mercury after such a manner as it lean'd upon the bottom and sides of the Glass: And they observ'd that the Quick-Silver was set down in the side of the Pipe seal'd Hermetically; and that the Menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um began to operate very slowly upon the Brass in a very silent manner, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any Noise or sensible Bubbles, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a very agreeable green Colour, which continued so the space of two or three days; but every day afterwards became pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler till the Glass was unstopp'd, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Air having a free Access, the Surface of the Liquor in four or five Minutes time reassumed an agreeable and livly Green, which gently insinuated it self to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and in ten Minutes space changed into a rich blue Colour which work'd through all the Liquor, and intermix'd it self so with the Green, that in a little time it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very dark. The Glass being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stop'd again, the Liquor began to lose some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its Colour; this Experiment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter several Repetitions, always produced the same Effect, even during the Night: Without one might attribute it to the Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Liquor when the Glass is shook, following the Opinion of some, that one might raise a fine and subtle Powder, which being precipitated from the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and thus mingled again with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor gives it its first Colour.</p>

                        <p>The strong Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> made without Quick Lime operates also more easily and strongly upon the Brass than Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Urine. An Experiment having been made after the same manner as we just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore related, the same Phoenomen was not only observed for Colour, but also that the same Mercury, which was plac'd according to the precedent Experiment, descended, although very slowly, for two or three days in the seal'd side, until it appear'd to be the fourth part of an Inch lower than it was; and probably the descent of Quick-Silver wou'd be greater if the Glass had not been touched, by which the compleating of the Experiment was hindred. The Event whereof, nevertheless, seem'd sufficiently to declare, that the Spring of the Air inclosed in the Concavity of the Glass, and mixing with that which is contained in the open side of the Pipe where the Mercury was, was weak in respect to that which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed, where it could have no Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, since the Quick-Silver hindreth it on one side, and the Glass that was seal'd Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically, on the other.</p>

                        <p>The same Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> made without quick Lime, produces the same Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon Leaves of Brass; the Glass in which they are both put being stopt up, the Liquor assumes a gross blue Tincture; which it lost in a little time, becoming pale and almost like common Water; whereas the Glass being open'd, the top of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor appear'd of a perfect Blue in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and this Tincture was not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed throughout the whole Liquor, but also continued for many days after the Glass was stop'd.</p>

                        <p>The Experiment being often shew'd to Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> that the Spirit of Vinegar with Minium of Lead, works very gently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out producing any Scum, altho' upon Coral and many other Bodies, it causes not only a great quantity of Bubbles, but also a kind of strong Elasticks; He had a mind to prove if this gentle and quiet Dissolution of the Minium wou'd be attended with a permanent changing of the Spring of the Air.</p>
                        <p>He one day placed the crooked Pipe with the Mercury in a Conic Glass, the bottom of which was cover'd with beaten Coral and stop'd it very carefully, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pour'd some Spirit of Vinegar upon the Coral; and there appear'd a quantity of Bubbles, which for some little space of time were very considerably produced, as soon as the Menstruum began to operate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Coral. But these Bubbles successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dissipated in the concavity of the Glass, and this continual Succession so strongly shut up the Air, that that which was in the seal'd side of the Pipe also felt the Effect. After the Corrosion had ceas'd, and the Compression that this new Air had made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came manifestly more feeble, and the Air shut up within the Pipe forc'd its way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Mercury to a certain Mark, it continued the space of five or six Hours; so that in this Operation, it seem'd as if Nature exercised a double compressive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The first might be call'd Transitory and of little duration, through the agitation of Exhalations and Vapours: The other Permanent, by the means of the Air and of the Parts which went out, and were produced from it, excited by the Action of the Spirit of Vinegar upon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal. Some natural and remarkable Particularities taken out of a Letter written from Dublin.</head>
                     <p>WE every day see new Effects of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But Mr. <hi>Havard</hi> relates one that was not a little surprizing. He says, that in a Vessel that went to the <hi>Barbado's,</hi> the Compass was strangly disordered by a Clap of Thunder, which however touched it not, but threw down one of the Masts, broke the Cords and tore the Sails, so that this Vessel changed its Course and return'd again for <hi>England,</hi> just as they were in sight of <hi>Burmudas; Grofton</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, always conducting it by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, in which he cou'd not observe the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration that was made in the Needle, whereof the position of both ends was chang'd. He had thus continued his Course, if Mr. <hi>Havard,</hi> in the Company of whom he made his Voyage, and whose Vessel had not been injur'd by Thunder, had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd him, and corrected by his Compass the Change that the Thunder had made in those of <hi>Grofton.</hi> But what was yet stranger in this Accident, was, that the new turn which the Thunder had given to all the Needles that were in <hi>Grofton</hi>'s Vessel was so strong, that tho' they were turn'd with ones Finger to the first Situation, it wou'd always return with great violence to that Position which it received by means of the Thunder, and these Compasses cou'd never be recover'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. 'Twas observable that there was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Change in the Temperature of the Air of <hi>America,</hi> since the <hi>Europeans</hi> went thither, and especially such Places as the English have rendred themselves Masters of: Either it is to be attributed to the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down of the Wood, or the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Earth, which the Savage Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants took no care of, or to some unknown Cause: As it has happen'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which being less cultivated than it was before the late and bloody Wars of <hi>England,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fewer People than there was, is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever much more Temperate; for it has been sometimes two or three Year without either Snow or Ice during the Winter; whereas before that, it used to be two or three several times in a Winter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue fifteen Days or three Weeks together, with so much Violence, that not only the Lakes, but the most rapid Rivers, were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Ice.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is nothing more rare than a Horned Beetle. That which is found in the Woods of <hi>Virginia,</hi> has this Particular only proper to it self, That where it tarries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Body of a Tree, or ordinarily rests it self, it begins to sing with a very shrill Voice, raising it by little and little with so much force, till all the Wood ecchos with the sound; and afterwards it diminishes with the same proportion until it makes so gentle a Murmur that it seems almost asleep; and then flying upon another Tree, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and ends his Song after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="5">5. <hi>M. Iosselin</hi> affirms, That the Testicles of the Animals that we call <hi>Musquash,</hi> smells as well as Musk it self; and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to maintain it by Experience.</p>

                     <head>The Art of Navigation demonstrated by Principles, and confirm'd by many Observations drawn from Experience: By Father <hi>Deschalles,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>IT cannot be deny'd that the Ancients allow'd the Loadstone to attract Iron: But it is certain they were Ignorant of its propriety in causing the Needle that is touched with it, to turn towards the North and the South. This Wonder of Nature was not observ'd till towards the end of the twelfth Age; and one may affirm, that the true Science of Navigation begun but since this happy Discovery. And this is likewise the Reason why we have no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Ancient Authors that writ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject.</p>
                     <p>The time is not precisely known in which they begun in <hi>Europe</hi> to make use of the Loadstone for Navigation. Some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Paul Venetian</hi> having made a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into <hi>China,</hi> about the year 1260. he brought this Invention from thence: And that which confirms their Opinion, is, That in the beginning they made use of 'em in <hi>Europe</hi> after the same manner; that the <hi>Chinese</hi> did also about the end of the last Age; which was a kind of little Frog made of Linnen, upon which they let the Loadstone swim in the Water, to give it the more facility to turn towards the North. The general Opinion is, That <hi>Iohn Gira,</hi> Native of <hi>Amalphi,</hi> who was a Citizen of <hi>Naples,</hi> by searching into this new Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, invented the Compass about the year, 1300. This Author pretends that its like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he might find out the manner of using the Needle; but that the <hi>Flower de luce,</hi> which in all Countries is placed beneath the Compass to mark the North, sufficiently shews that the French have brought it to this Perfection. Let it be how it will, it's certain that the great Navigations were made only in the following Ages, by <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher Columbus,</hi> in 1492. by <hi>Americ Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putius</hi> some time after; and by <hi>Magellan,</hi> in 1519. but never endeavoured with more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103507:131"/>
than in these two last Ages, to bring the Art of Navigation into its utmost Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>F. Deschales</hi> hath collected all that has been said of it, and hath treated of it in Latin in his <hi>Mathematical Course</hi>; but as this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is not always familiar to those who have the Conduct of Vessels, no more than to many others who are curious to have some Intelligence of this Art, he hath vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily render'd it into French much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than those who have written since <hi>Petrus Nonus,</hi> that famous <hi>Portuguese</hi> Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician, who began in the year 1530. and have done it after an obscure, perplext and untelligible manner.</p>
                     <p>He first establishes four Principles, upon which the whole Science depends. The 1. whereof is the Course or Rumb that the Compass corrects, which must be given very exactly. 2. How much way the Ship makes. 3. The Observation of the height of the Stars. And 4. to describe the Line that the Compass makes. In explaining these Principles, he touches all other things that regard this Matter, so well, that in seven Books whereof this Treatise is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, it contains whatsoever is necessary for the Knowledg of Navigation.</p>
                     <p>He teaches, for Example, in the second Book, the manner of observing the height of the Stars with the common Instruments, and with others which may be very ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable upon the Sea: To which end he gives, in the beginning of his Book, the Principles of the Sphere necessary to Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                     <p>In the third, he forgets nothing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Compass; and in the fourth, he explains the Nature, Proprieties and Use of the Loxodromick Lines, that is, the secret Principle of this Art, which few Persons understand. How to make a right estimation of the way which the Ship steers, is the Subject of the fifth Book. In the sixth, this Author explains all the Methods of correcting it, by the different manners of observing the Latitude. Upon which he likewise proposes the famous Problem of the Longitude, for which the French, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish and Dutch, have profer'd so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Recompence; and examins the Means that have been made use of all along to accomplish it.</p>
                     <p>In fine, in his seventh, he teaches many practical Rules very useful upon the Sea, as the Method of keeping a Journal, of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Plan of a Port, or of a Coast all entire, the means of knowing the Hour when it is full Sea on each Coast, the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Periodic and running Winds, that of the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He stops particularly upon this last Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and after having examined and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Opinions of all those that have yet treated on it, he establishes his, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes the Flux and Reflux of the Sea to one of the most common Principles, which is that of Fermentation, made in the Sea like all others of Levin, of Wine, of Beer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Spirits that agitate it and throw it up. He says, that the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Agitation of these Spirits ought to have its Periods even independently of all exterior Causes, as we see in Critical Days, and in all sorts of Fermentations: So Winds blow by Gusts and the Surges of the Sea are unequal, the tenth being more violent than the others. And by that he gives a Reason why Lakes have not a Flux and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux, the Water being very pure, and by consequence have not these Spirits that agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it from time to time; and why Tides are greater in some places than others, is more difficult to conceive, in his Opinion, than the Reason why Vines thrive more in some places than in others.</p>
                     <p>The Moon, according to his Judgment, may determine these Spirits, and contribute to their Agitation; from whence it comes that the Periods of the Tides agree so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly with those of this Planet: And he pretends 'tis as probable as to say, That the Moon concurs to the Effects which cause Melancholy in Lunaticks, by the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it produces in the Air, which is dispersed every where; but he does not think that the Moon excites these Spirits precisely by its Heat; for we see that an extraordinary Heat often hinders these Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations. It may be, adds he, that it mingles some Spirits with the Light which are devolved with those of the Sea: Thus we see 'tis not Cold only which produces Ice upon the Water, but that certain Vapours mingling themselves therewith, assist in the Coagulation.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining many Experiments made with <hi>Phosphorus,</hi> prepared by Dr. <hi>Slare,</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THere are two Sorts of <hi>Phosphorus,</hi> the Liquid and the Solid, which are not materially different, being both drawn from the Body of Man.</p>
                     <p>That which is Liquid is a Substance mixed with a Liquor, which although burning, when it is in a Solid Mass, cannot spoil, nor even heat a Hand, how delicate soever it may be, when it is washed therewith.</p>
                     <p>If this <hi>Phosphorus</hi> be stopt very close, it preserves not its Light much longer; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, in one of those Experiments that I have made, I observed for five or six differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and successive Times a kind of Darting, although the Vial was close-stop'd; which made me conclude, The Experiment was the same with the shining <hi>Phosphorus</hi> of Dr. <hi>Esholt,</hi> its Darting bearing some Resemblance to Lightning.</p>
                     <p>The Solid <hi>Phosphorus</hi> is not materially different from the Liquid, as I have already said, being made chiefly of Urine. I am convinced one might do as much with the Blood, if it could be had as easily, and in as great a Quantity, since Urine is only the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood, passed by the Reins.</p>
                     <p>The Substance of this <hi>Phosphorus</hi> may be made as Transparent as any Rosinous Body, and melts in hot Water like Wax. When it is covered all over in Water, it ceaseth to shine, but as soon as any little part thereof escapes, and gains the Air, it shines again, although the Vial was sealed Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically.</p>
                     <p>I have kept it without Water many Days in a very large Vial, and although it always shined, its Brightness or Weight diminished not at all, or so little that it was not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable.</p>
                     <p>The Pieces of this solid <hi>Phosphorus</hi> are some of 'em much more inflamable than others. Some of'em one may take in ones Hand without Danger; but others, that take Fire and burn as soon as ever they are touched, if the Hand be never so little warm. We have seen a Piece weighing about two Drachms, which taking Fire in a Chamber, where there was no Candle, and distant from us, light like a Faggot, and burnt the Carpit and Table whereon it was laid. This Sort of <hi>Phosphorus</hi> ought to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged only by Men of Experience and Wisdom.</p>
                     <p>With that which is not so inflamable one may make Characters upon a blank Paper, which in the Dark appear like Rays of Light; but if it comes near the Fire these same Characters, as soon as they are warm change Dark, and continue so for as long a Time as good Ink will.</p>
                     <p>This Light is very diffusive of it self. I have made with this new manner of Pencil above an hundred Characters, without wasting a twentieth part of it. Half a Grain laid upon my Hand, communicated its Brightness to the utmost extent of it, and so continued all Night, the Hand shining also the next Day. A Grain of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance exposed to the open Air flamed for seven or eight Days, so that during the Day, shutting the Windows of my Closet, I cou'd always perceive it stiring, and when I look'd very earnestly, I could see a whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Flame come out of it into the circumam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Air.</p>
                     <p>After all the Matter was consumed there remained no Cinders, but only a little Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, which had an acid Taste; but having left off to consume the more gross Portion, there was found much more Moisture, which had the Taste of the Oil of <hi>Sulphur</hi>: This made me remember, That the greatest part of my Friends, who saw this Experiment, called it a <hi>Sulphurous Flame.</hi> Indeed it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in all its Proprieties it had more relation to <hi>Sulphur</hi> than <hi>Saline Concretes,</hi> chiefly because of its inflammability, and because it did not destroy itself nor dissolve in Water.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the manner how, with many singular Experiments of Preserving Fish, Butter, Flesh, Fowls, Fruits and Roots in a very good Estate, and for a long Time.</head>
                     <p>THis is done only by the means of Salt; upon which he observes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That refined Salt is the best of all to salt Fish, because that by that it loses its Hot, Dry, Burning, Corrosive, Mortifying Quality, so that it will never give any Ill Taste to the Fish: And as this Salt, on the contrary is more Lively, Sharp and Pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than if it were not refined; it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the Fish more Fresh and Cool; and even in the Hottest Country prevents its Fermenting, which is so apt to spoil the Fish.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Brine in which they keep Herrings ought to be strong enough to bear them up upon it; for then this Pickle surmounts and overcomes the Nature of the Herring so strongly, that it makes it very stiff and preserves it: Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if it is weaker, then the Nature of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:103507:132"/>
this Fish, it is overcome by it, and so the Herring wasts and is spoil'd.</p>
                     <p>As for the Experiments, some have been made of Eggs, Flesh, Wine and of Fruits. Eggs being put intoa Barrel of Salt keep a long time; whereas those that are kept in Meal soon decay and grow Musty.</p>
                     <p>Having put a Leg of Mutton and a whole Salmon into a heap of Salt, they kept good, agreeable and fresh, for three Months together.</p>
                     <p>Wine is preserved so even in Bottles for a long time, because that the Salt defends it in the Winter against Frosts, in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer against the Heat, and at all times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such Particles of Air as are very well known to corrupt and decay all Material Bodies.</p>
                     <p>One may, by the same means, preserve Fruits, as Oranges, if they are wrapt up in Paper and so put into Salt.</p>
                     <p>Some have, after this manner, also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Artichokes, Sparra-grass, and other such Things.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Some Curious Observations upon Insects.</head>
                     <p>ABundance of very fine Remarks may be made upon Insects; we shall only speak here of the different manners they make use of to preserve themselves from the rigour of the Winter.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Insects continue all the Winter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Motion; so that if they are cast out of their Places where they hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Winter, they have not strength enough to transport themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thither again; but if they are a little warm'd they assume their Motion, and rest not till they find some place where they may continue in Security; or that the cold Air again ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Bodies stiff, hinders them from Moving. This Cessation from Motion or Rest, is not common to all Insects. For Bees open and shut the Gates of their little Habitations all the Winter; and even the coldest Weather hinders them not from seeking Food for their young Ones, which they breed in that Season. Therefore we see their young Ones in the beginning of the Spring, which has made some say that has kept them, that little Bees appear'd in the same time as Swallows did.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They continue in the form of Worms not only upon and under the Earth, in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Trees, between Leaves which stick to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and in Fruits, but even in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, under which they are often found to be Froze and without any Motion. But what is still more surprizing, is, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects are of a much stronger Constitution when they are in the form of Worms, than after their changing, and when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come peculiar to their kind. Hence it is that the Aquatick Worm, whereof the Fly Ephemeris is engender'd, is so vigorous, that after having been run through with a Pin it nevertheless lives some Days; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as after its Change without receiving any hurt, it cannot live four Hours.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When Insects cannot find a place that agrees with their natural Constitution, they suffer not that little Strength they have, to decay presently. Thus we see it happens to Worms which are found in Nut-shells. For unless they are kept in moist Sand or Dirt, where they are hid for the Winter, they dye not only in a little time after, but in one Night in the Air become so hard and dry, that they may easily be reduced to Powder: The same thing happens to the Worms that are upon the Leaves; but they make no holes in the Earth, they only spin a kind of a Web which serves to cover them, and defend them from the Severity of the Cold.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There are some which subsist in the Water only, where they continue three en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Months without taking any Food: But if they are not capable of taking Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it proceeds from the Weakness of their Members, or that the Coldness of the Air congeals them, or else that the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Humidity that environs them, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sufficiently agitated, renders them inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of taking any Food. From thence it comes also that they eject no Excrements; because they taking no Nourishment, have no superfluous Humours to evacuate.</p>

                     <head>Tentamen Porologicum, sive ad Porosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem Corporum tum Animalium, tum Solidorum detegendam: Auth. <hi>R. Boyle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Lond. 1685.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Observations of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> in proving the Existence of Pores in Animate Bodies is very Curious; as also what he has said about the Pores of solid Bodies.</p>
                     <p>He observes, that an equal quantity of Powder of Brimstone, <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> and good quick Lime, being pulverised and mix'd together in a Horn, and pounded by little and little, until the Dust become red, it raises a Spirit, the penetrating Fume where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, changes the colour of Brass or Silver, altho' covered with a double Skin: And the same Vapour has penetrated through a Skin glued upon Egg-shells, tho' there is nothing so close; and made a piece of Brass black, which was inclosed in it. It has had the same Effect also upon this Metal, on a piece of Silver covered with a Calves Bladder that was wet; which has not happen'd when the Bladder has been dry.</p>
                     <p>A notable Example, according to this Author, of the Porosity of the Membranes of a Man's Body, is, that of a young Gentleman, that <hi>Harvey</hi> gives the Relation of, who had a received such a Wound in the Breast that a Hole was made thereby,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103507:132"/>
through which one might see the Motion of the Heart. He nevertheless recovered his Health, and was afterwards a General of an Army. Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> to whom he one day shewed his Breast, which gave him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to perceive the Motion of his Heart, said that this Gentleman gave him to observe, among other things, that as from time to time an Injection of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain vulnerary Liquor was made into this Hole, the Smell and Taste of this Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ascended immediately to his Mouth; and that his Breath was always touch'd with the Odour of some Aromatick Powders, which he wore in a Bag upon this place, to preserve the neighbouring Parts, and keep it warm.</p>
                     <p>This agrees with what <hi>Galen</hi> himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served of the Injection of a <hi>Hydromel</hi> into a Wound in the Breast, that the sick Person vomited up again with a Cough: To which Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> adds, that a strong and vigorous Man being strangled, it was believed upon it, that there was observed in him no other Indisposition than a little dry Cough, that he found some putrefaction in one of the Lobes of his Lungs; but that he found them very healthful, and only in one place of the <hi>Pleura</hi> there was white purulent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about the breadth of a Crown, shut up between the <hi>Pleura</hi> and the Sides; which gave them occasion to suppose, that the corrupted Humour had penetrated the <hi>Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and produced in the Branches of the Lungs the Irritation that had caused this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dry Cough.</p>
                     <p>The two following Matters served also as Proofs to Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi> The first is, That a Person that had the Dropsy, attributed his Sickness to a <hi>Schirrus</hi> in the Spleen, having been counsell'd by a Surgeon, to whom he complain'd, to apply upon it a Sponge dip'd in Lime-Water, and afterwards squees'd out, was cured in a little time by this means. And the second, That <hi>Mercury</hi> has been found in the Bones of some of those that have been cured of the Venereal Distemper, by the Frications of Quick-Silver; and even in the Teeth, which a certain Person had caused to be drawn out, after he had used some of the same Remedy.</p>

                     <p>AS the Effects of the Loadstone were discover'd before the Reasons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were sought after, so the Author of this Treatise believ'd he ought first to relate the most considerable Experiments that have been made concerning the Vertue of the Loadstone; and afterwards proposes the most probable means that may be made use of to explain these Effects. He had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to give us a new Hypothesis for this, nor to shew us any new Properties in the Loadstone; but only to relate with as much clearness and brevity as he could, the most curious and likely Arguments that have been hitherto Written by all the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers that have treated on it. Indeed we have not yet seen any Treatise upon this Matter, so short, compleat, and clear all at once.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">p. 1. c. 1. &amp; Seq.</note> After some Reflections upon the Names that the Greeks, Latins, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Italians, Spaniards, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and French, have given to the Loadstone, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, altho' it is to be found where-ever there are Iron Mines, yet it is not every where of the same Colour. He saw some which had the Colour of Iron before it is forg'd, some reddish, and some that were blackish, but 'twas very rare to find any which had much Power. The Ancients had some Knowledg of it, and agreed that it joyn'd it self to the Iron, but were entirely ignorant of the Propriety it had of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the Pole, because they never spoke a word of this Propriety, and often made mention of the first. He affirms al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that the Inventer of the Needle was one <hi>Iohn Goia de Melphi,</hi> a Citizen of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> near <hi>Salern</hi>; that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved about the year, 1300. Others attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the Invention thereof to the Chinese, from whom <hi>Paul Venetian,</hi> a famous Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that lived in the year, 1260. brought it into Europe.</p>

                        <note n="*" place="margin">c. 5. and so on to the 17.</note> This is what is known concerning the Original of the Compass; he afterwards passes to the propriety of the Loadstone, which shall be related here in brief. 1. <hi>The Loadstone's uniting it self to the Iron,</hi> which is falsly call'd its Vertue of attracting the Iron, since this Union is made by a true Impulsion, and that proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaking there is no <hi>Attraction,</hi> as the Author proves. But that is not true that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> said, <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 7.</note> that there were Isles in the <hi>Indies,</hi> where Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, which have in some Parts been joyned together with Nails, have stop'd, because of the great quantity of the Stone of <hi>Hercules</hi> (a Name that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Loadstone in Greek) that is there to be found. The Author reprehends <hi>Gonzales d'Oviedo, &amp; Olaus Magnus,</hi> with many others, that have said something like it. 2. <hi>The Loadstone can keep Iron or Steel suspended at a certain distance, altho' it never touches it.</hi> Its false however, that the Mosque wherein <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Body is kept, is incrusted with a Loadstone; and that his Tomb is suspended in the middle, as some fabulous Voyagers have related: Whereas on the contrary, this Tomb is placed upon a piece of Earth in the middle of this Mosque. The Author believes what gave Birth to this Fable was this, that in the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:103507:133"/>
same Mosque there is a great Loadstone fasten'd to one of the sides of the Wall, to which hangs a piece of Silver across, that's kept there by a Chain of Steel. 3. <hi>That the Vnion of the Iron to the Loadstone is reciprocal, and that one may as properly say that the Iron unites it self to the Loadstone, as that one piece of Loadstone unites it self to another.</hi> He proves it by divers Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that he makes very clear and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Figures, which he has taken care to give, as often as he relates any Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 4. <hi>The Loadstone always presents one side to the North, and the other side to the South.</hi> It seems this Property of the Loadstone had not been discovered, only by chance, leaving it floating upon the Water in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Gondula.</hi> Having thus observed the Poles of the Loadstone, he confirms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his Thought, by throwing upon it the Filings of Steel, which are otherwise dispos'd towards these places than others; and by other Experiments, whereof the Author relates some. 5. <hi>The Poles of the Loadstone are ordinarily unequal in respect to their Power, and also very often diametrically opposite,</hi> altho' it sometimes happens that they are situated irregularly enough. 6. <hi>The Loadstone communicates its Vertue to Iron that it is rubbed with, altho' removed from it to a certain distance.</hi> The Author shews what Method must be taken to touch a piece of Iron well with the Loadstone. 7. The Loadstone does not only communicate to Iron its Property of drawing other Iron, <hi>but also gives it Poles which direct it towards those of the World,</hi> as is clearly seen by the Compass: Upon which he observes, that these Poles differ from those of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, that is, that the point of the Needle which should be touched on that side of the Loadstone, which they call the North, as the Loadstone does, but towards the South, and so the other on the contrary. 8. <hi>When a Loadstone is cut in two Parts following its Axis, when they joyn it together again, one part turns almost perfectly to a Situation oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to what it did before it was cut, and when it is cut perpendicularly to the Axis, new Poles are made in the Faces of the Section.</hi> 9. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving presented to the Poles of one Loadstone the Poles of another Loadstone, they joyn themselves together, offering the opposite Pole it seems to shun it</hi>; this happens also in respect to Needles touched with the Loadstone. 10. <hi>A Needle being in</hi> Aequilibrio <hi>before it be touched, it loses this Property, after having been touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Loadstone.</hi> Of this side of the Line the Point which respects the Northern Pole is inclined towards the Earth, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happens as soon as it is passed the Line: Which obliges Pilots to add to that side which appears to be the lightest, a little Wax, to render the Needle in <hi>Aequilibrio,</hi> and for the augmenting or diminishing the weight of the Wax, as they are nearer or more distant from the Line where the Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le hath no need of Wax to keep it in <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librio.</hi> The Author gives some Methods to find out how many degrees the Needle is inclined, and observes that in Countries that are 49 or 50 degrees of Elevation, the Needle is enclin'd to the Horison about 70 Degrees. 11. <hi>The Power of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone may be augmented or diminished,</hi> by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers means which the Author observes, <hi>but if it is entirely lost it cannot be re-established.</hi> 12. In fine, altho' the Needle always turns one of its ends towards the North, 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served <hi>that they often decline in some degrees towards the East or the West.</hi> 'Twas above a hundred years that it declined six degrees towards the East; sixty years after, its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination was hardly one degree of the same side. Mr. <hi>De la Hire</hi> of the <hi>Royal Academy of Sciences,</hi> and Royal Professor in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, observed at <hi>Paris,</hi> towards the end of the year, 1684. that it declined four Degrees ten Minutes North-West: Now it declines there but a little more than one Degree.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. These are the Experiments which he relates concerning the Loadstone, here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the chief Generals by which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains <note place="margin">Ch. 1, 2.</note> all these Effects. 1. That the Earth is made after such a manner, that out of its Poles continually issues a very subtle Matter, both impalpable and invisible, which circulates within and about it self, till it re-enters by the opposite Pole to that which it went out of, and passes by parallel Pores ito its Axis. 2. That the Pores by which this Matter pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, are furnished with certain Particles like small Hairs, which are so disposed as easily permits this Matter to pass over after a certain manner, but which stands upright and stops the Pores, if the Matter presents it self to pass over after a contrary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. 3. That each Loadstone hath two Poles like the Earth, and is disposed after the same manner as it is.</p>
                     <p>Those who have any knowledg of the manner whereby the <hi>Cartesians</hi> apply their Supposition of an effluvious Matter to the effects of the Loadstone, may without any trouble apply the Principle of the Author to the Phoenomena's that have any relation thereto; and those who are not sufficiently acquainted with this Matter, to be able of 'emselves to make an Application of this Principle, may in less than two hours time read all that the Author hath said of it. As the Chapters of the second part answer to that of the first, so Things are there more at large explain'd than in the first, with an addition of divers new Experiments concerning the same things. For Example, there is in the XIII Chapter the particular manner of arming the Loadstone, that is, the furnishing each of its Poles with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle plate of Iron, to augment the force thereof.
<q>From this place also may be learnt something of the Configuration of the insensible parts of Iron and Steel. The Author observes, that when the Iron is forged, the little parts whereof it is composed, dispose themselves at length, and range themselves like little Needles all of the same manner the length of the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:103507:133"/>
Iron, and that they must take the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Loadstone, in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the length of its little parts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the extremity of the Armour, which must lift up the other Iron that they shall present unto it. The Author having made one after this manner, and taken an other and applyed it directly contrary, that is, in which the little parts were travers'd, found that the first rais'd up a fourth part heavier than the other. <note n="*" place="margin">p. 97.</note> He also observed that a Blade of Iron which is not soak'd in Water, breaks very difficultly, and when it is broken the place where it breaks, look'd upon with a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscope, appears like the small points of Needles, which pierce the Hand with the least touch. The other on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary (adds the Author) is easily broke, and the broken place resembles little Balls or Cubes, and is not sharp at all. He afterwards gives Philosophical Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons thereof, which is best read in the Original.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the declination and varation of the Loadstone can only be perceived by the means of a Meridional Line, so the Author hath in the XV Chapter given six different manners of tracing it. The first is, to cut a Body of a Tree that has been much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the Wind and the Sun horizontally, and to observe in what place the Excentrick Circles are closest, and the place where they are the most distant one from the other. The last notes the South, and the first the North. But as one cannot always rely upon this Experiment, so he only relates it by the by; and says also, that those who concern themselves with Agriculture ought to observe it, and that when they transplant a Tree, care must be taken to place it in the same Situation as it was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in respect to the North and South. The three following ways of finding out the Meridional Line, are done by the Points of the Shadow. The fifth manner is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by two Shadows of a Threed rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed perpendiculy; and taken with two equal Lights from the Sun. And in fine, he shews how the Meridional Line may be found, by two equal Heights of two Stars.</p>
                     <p>He finishes this Work, by the Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some Curious Machines made with the Loadstone; and those who desire to know more thereof, he sends them to <hi>Bettinus, Kirker, Schotus,</hi> and some others, that have treated of this Matter. I shall say no more of this Book, only that the Author endeavoured to proportion it to the Capacity of all sorts of Persons. He has not taken it for granted, that every one that reads his Book, should be a Physician or Geometer; on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he has endeavoured to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Intelligible, to those even that are Ignorant both of Physick and Geometry 100.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of an English Iournal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an Estimation of the quantity of Vapours that the Heat of the Sun exhales from the Sea: By <hi>Edmond Halley.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE quantity of Vapours that the Earth is charged with, is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, since the Rains and Snows fall sometimes in so great an abundance, that 'tis observed, that this Water descending from the Intervals, which the Particles of the Air leave among themselves, make a very sensible part of the Weight of the Atmosphere. But no Person that I know of, has examined to the purpose the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion that is between the Sea and these Vapours, which are the original, not only of Rains, but also of Fountains. This Search is nevertheless one of the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, of that part of Philosophy that treats of Meteors, and deserves to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Royal Society. I believe none will be sorry to know the manner how I essay'd to determine the quantity of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours which are exhaled by Heat.</p>
                     <p>'Twas thus: I took a Vessel full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the depth of four Inches, the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof was seven inches 2/10, in which I placed a Thermometer. Afterwards, by the means of a Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing-Dish full of hot Coals, I brought the Water to the same degree of Heat as we feel in the hottest Summer, as appeared by the Thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter. That being done, I ty'd this Vessel, without taking any thing out of it, to one end of the Beam of a Ballance, and put on the other side Weights exactly of the same heaviness. It was easy to preserve the same Degree of Heat in the Water, by the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing Dish of Coals, either drawing it nearer or putting it at a farther distance. I soon observed, that the Weight of the Water sensibly diminished; and in about 2 Hours space 233 Grains of Water was evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, altho' no Fume was observ'd to ascend, and the Water appear'd not hot to the touch. This quantity of Water evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in so small a time, seems very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; for it follows from thence, that in 24 Hours it wou'd evaporate six Ounces of Water from so small a Surface, which was a Circle of 8 Inches Diameter.</p>
                     <p>To draw an exact Computation from this Experiment, and to determine the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the quantity of the Water that is thus evaporated, I made use of the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> affirmed to have been made at <hi>Oxford.</hi> It is, That the quantity of Water of the bigness of a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic Foot, weighs 76 Pounds of <hi>Troy</hi> weight. This number being divided by 1728. which is the Number of the Cubic Inches contain'd in this Foot, gives 253 Grains and ⅓ or one ½ Ounce, 13 Grains ⅓ for the weight of a Cubic Inch of Water. The weight then of 233 Grains, is 233/253 or 35 parts of a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103507:134"/>
Cubic Inch divided into 38. Now the Area of a Circle, the Diameter whereof is 7 Inches, 2/10 contains 49 Inches square, by which dividing the quantity of the evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Water, <hi>viz.</hi> 35/38 of an Inch, the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is 38/1862 or 1/5.3; from whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the quantity of this Water is the 53 part of an Inch; but for the facility of the Calculation, we will suppose it is but the 60 part. If then the Water (as hot as the Air is in Summer) exhales the 60 part of an Inch in two Hours from the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face described; in twelve Hours it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale the 10 part, a sufficient quantity to furnish all Rains, Fountains and Dews. This Calculation may even suppose the Sea without its diminishing or overflowing, like the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, which is always of an equal height; and supposing also the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which they say is always in the Streights of <hi>Gibralter,</hi> altho' the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean Sea receives a great number of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Rivers.</p>
                     <p>To make an estimation of the quantity of Water which is exhaled by Vapours from the Sea, I believe one need only consider it during the time the Sun is up; for as for the Night, as much Water falls in Dews or even more, than it draws up in Vapours during that time. It is true, that the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer days are above 12 Hours, but this length of the day is counter-ballanced by the weakness of the action of the Sun when it is up, and before the Water is hot. Thus if I suppose that if it raises every day in Vapours 1/10 of an Inch (the Extent already observed) from the Sea, this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position cannot be rejected.</p>
                     <p>According to this Hypothesis, 10 Inches square from the Surface of the Water, will furnish every day in Vapours a Cubic Inch of Water; each Foot, the square whereof, produces <hi>half a Pint</hi>; 4 Feet square <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>; a Mile square, 6914 Tuns; and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree square, supposing it to be 60 English Miles, will exhale in Vapours 33 Millions of Tuns. If we give to the Mediterranean 40 Degrees in length and 4 Degrees in breadth, in respect to those Places that are broader and those that are narrower, the least without doubt that can be given, will be a 160 Degrees square; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, all the Mediterranean Sea, in a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers day, will emit in Vapours 5280 Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Tuns. This quantity of Vapours, altho' very great, is however the least that can be supposed, according to the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I have related. It is true, there is another thing that one cannot reduce to certain Rules; it is the Winds, which from the Surface of the Water, take more Particles than the Heat of the Sun evaporates; as may be easily conceived, if we do but reflect on the Winds which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times blow.</p>
                     <p>It is very difficult to make a true estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the quantity of Water that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean Sea receives from the Rivers that fall into it; unless one had some way to measure the Mouths of the Rivers and their Rapidity. All that can be done in this Affair, is, rather to give 'em a greater quantity of Water, than indeed they have, than to take from them; that is, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose 'em greater than they are, according to all appearance, and afterwards to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the quantity of Water that the <hi>Thames</hi> carries into the Sea, with that of those Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers which we shall calculate.</p>
                     <p>The Mediterranean Sea receives these nine considerable Rivers; the <hi>Eber,</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">The Author says nothing of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of <hi>Greece</hi> and of <hi>Asia,</hi> which are in as great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, altho' they are not so big nor ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, as those he names.</note> the <hi>Rhone, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> the <hi>Po,</hi> the <hi>Danube,</hi> the <hi>Nester,</hi> the <hi>Boristhenus,</hi> the <hi>Tanais</hi> and the <hi>Nile,</hi> others being neither so ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, nor so large. Wee'l suppose that each of these nine Rivers have ten times as much Water as the <hi>Thames,</hi> not that there are any that have really ten times as much, but to comprehend in our Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion other Rivers that are less, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselves into the Mediterranean, the bigness of which we can no otherwise make any estimation of.</p>
                     <p>To measure the Water of the <hi>Thames,</hi> I take it at <hi>Kingston Bridg,</hi> where the Reflux never happens, and where the Water always runs downwards. The breadth of it is 100 Yards, and its depth 3, supposing it every where equal; in which computation, I am certain I give it rather more Extent than it really has. The Water is then in this place 300 Yards square, that multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by 48 thousand (is I believe the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water that is drawn up, admitting 2000 each Hour) or 84480 Yards, give 25344000 Yards of Water which will be drain'd in a day, that is 2030000 Tuns each day. I am persuaded that by what I have added more to the Channel of this River than it really hath, I have sufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensated, by comprehending therein the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of <hi>Brent, Lea, Wandal</hi> and of <hi>Darwent,</hi> which are of some Consideration, and which discharge themselves into the <hi>Thames</hi> below <hi>Kingston</hi> Bridg.</p>
                     <p>Now if every one of these nine Rivers had ten times more Water than the <hi>Thames,</hi> it wou'd it follow that from each River wou'd every day run into the Sea, 203 Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Tuns; and that the whole will be but 1827 Millions of Tuns, which is but a little more than the third part of what I have shewn is evaporated out of the Mediterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sea, in 12 Hours time.</p>
                     <p>The Knowledg is still wanting what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of these Vapours when they are rais'd in the Air, and from whence comes that Current which always appears at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Straits of <hi>Gibralter</hi>; but Mr. <hi>Halley</hi> sends us back once more to examine it; only advertises the Reader, that to make the Experiment which he hath spoken of, he must make use of Water which hath been Salted, to the same Degree that the common Sea Water is, dissolving therein one fortieth part of Salt.<note n="rindx;" place="bottom">Next to this 3d.

require, and attend it, <hi>Hoc age:</hi> You are to have the Care of Souls, and to your Trust are committed the Oracles of God. Your great Concern therefore is, to know the Mind of God, as it is revealed in his Word, that you may teach it others, and defend it against all Opposers: This is all you are entrusted with, and shall be judged by, to wit, the <hi>Bible.</hi> This Word or Mind of God is contained perfectly in the <hi>Hebrew Bible,</hi> and <hi>Greek Testament</hi> only. <hi>Translations</hi> are no further God's Word, than they do express the sense thereof; which in all places they cannot perfectly do, without more words than are allowed to to be in a Translation: These Sacred <hi>Originals</hi> are the Standard and Rule of our Life, Worship and Doctrine; and the Fate of all Translations depends on their Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Hence, <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Commentaries of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> have been a great help to all that Translate or Expound the Text: As <hi>Munster</hi> saith in his <hi>Preface</hi> on the <hi>Bible, That no one can well Explain the Scripture, without the Commentaries of the Rabbins.</hi> And <hi>Ierom</hi> saith, <hi>He therefore hired a Iew to help him in the difficult places, (which he durst not attempt without:) And the best Commentaries amongst Christians, are those who have plowed with the Rabbins Heifer.</hi> What were the <hi>Criticks</hi> on the <hi>Bible,</hi> but Men best skill'd in the <hi>Rabbins?</hi> as <hi>Munster, Mercer, Fagius,</hi> and the rest.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Many Parts of the History of the <hi>New-Testament</hi> are well explained by the Rabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Writings; as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Ionathan</hi>'s Paraphrase on <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.11. and the like.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Many Proverbial Speeches are best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by them, even of the <hi>New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.24. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.25. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.25. &amp; 7.2. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.10. &amp;c.</p>

                     <p n="11">11. The Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> Moral, Judicial and Ceremonial, is fully explained by them only, as to many Laws.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. To conclude: As they are helpful to explain the Text; so is the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> very needful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and maintain the Purity, Perspicuity, and Divine Authority of the Text it self, as to the true Copy, the Character, the Points, Vowels, and Accents, and the like. Without some knowledge of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> Persons will find themselves very unable to judge of the Arguments themselves that are used on such Subjects: Nay, they'll be little the better for the very places of Scripture we most frequently alledge; because they most commonly respect the <hi>Masoretick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> which we have not room to explain to those who know nothing of these things. If therefore such Subjects are fit for Divines to understand, then must the Knowledge of the Rabbinical Writings be so likewise.</p>
                     <p>'Tis peculiarly incumbent on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry by their Office, to defend the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines they teach, by the Scriptures: But if they are unable to defend the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the only Evidence and Proof of their Doctrines, the Christian Religion, with the Doctrines thereof, must fall to the ground. And yet this Position, That the present <hi>Hebrew Bible,</hi> and <hi>Greek Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in the Words, Letters, Points, Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and Accents we now enjoy, is the same uncorrupted Word of God which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of old by the holy Pen-men of it to the Church: This, we say, cannot well be defended against all Opposers, without the Rabbinical Knowledge we speak of.</p>
                     <p>And so much for the <hi>need</hi> of this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: We shall only give some Directions about this Study.</p>

                        <hi>First,</hi> He must well understand the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Bible, in the first place, who would know the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> before he look after them: And for this, if he hath no <hi>Latin,</hi> he must get <hi>William Robertson</hi>'s <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second Gate to the Holy Tongue</hi>; His <hi>Key to the Bible: Iessey</hi>'s <hi>English Greek Lexicon,</hi> &amp;c.

much. And then for the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> take this brief Account and Direction: The ancient <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrasts are most of them tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated, and thereby easie to learn: The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cabalistical Writings, as the <hi>Zohar, Bahir,</hi> &amp;c. are both most difficult, and least useful: Their Oral Law, or Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were collected, after the Destruction of the Temple, <hi>A.D.</hi> 150. by <hi>Rabbi Iudah the Holy,</hi> as they call him: This they preferr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture, and suppose it was Orally delivered by <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Israel,</hi> and unlawful to be written; but when <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, they were constrained to write it, lest it should be lost; but yet 'twas so writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as that none but themselves might understand it: This Book is called <hi>Mish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naioth,</hi> comprizing all their Religion with the Bible: 'Tis divided into Two Parts; each Part, into Three <hi>Seders,</hi> or Books; each <hi>Seder,</hi> into many <hi>Masecats,</hi> or Tracts; each <hi>Masecat</hi> into Chapters and Verses.

And of <hi>History,</hi> as <hi>Seder Olam, Zutha</hi> and <hi>Seder Olam, Rabba, Tsemach, David,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And as to Rabbinical Commentaries, the best and chief are <hi>R. Sal. Iarchi,</hi> or <hi>Isaac; R. Aben Ezra; R.

                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible is so received, and doth so reveal the Mind of God according as it is at present pointed; for without Points, it is either mute, and speaks nothing, or else speaketh whatever Men please to have it say, or is most dubious, having divers and contrary sences. Hence the Jews say of it, That <hi>the Points are to the Letters, as the Soul is to the Body,</hi> (the one without the other hath neither Life nor Motion,) <hi>and as Garments to a Person, without which none can come forth in publick.</hi> And so are Vowels to Consonants; with them they may sound and signifie; without them they cannot: And as they say, <hi>He that reads without Points, is like one that rideth a Horse without a Bridle, and knoweth not whither he goeth.</hi> And as <hi>Marcus Marinus Brixianus</hi> saith, in his Preface to <hi>Arca Noae, There would be more Confusion in this one Book without Points, than was at Babel.</hi> The Oracles of <hi>Apollo</hi> were not more dubious, nor any <hi>Lesbian</hi> Rule more crooked.

                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet the Matter is most sublime, consisting of Divine Revelation; the Style more elyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, concise, and abstruse, in <hi>Iob, Psalms, Proverbs, Isaiah, &amp;c.</hi> and in many places, without any Connexion of Antecedents and Consequents, as in <hi>Proverbs, &amp;c.</hi> that there is left no means to understand the Mind of God in it without Points.

                     <p>Now the Opinion under debate leaves the Bible in this confused Condition, by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing the Invention of the Points to such an Original as render them fitter to be blotted out of the Bible, than kept in it any longer, as being the work of the blind hardned Jews of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> A.D. 500. For it is impossible that the whole Pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bible could be preserved so long as a Thousand Years from <hi>Ezra,</hi> until <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. under that calamitous state of the Jews, whilst the Tongue ceased to be vulgarly pronounced or known amongst them. The <hi>Rabbies</hi> themselves (the only supposed Preservers of it) lamenting they had so lost it in this time, that they found great difficulty to explain the <hi>Apax Lego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi> or words that are but once used in Scripture; of which there are many, as <hi>Kimchi</hi>'s Preface to <hi>Miklol,</hi> and to <hi>Sepher. Shereshim</hi> declares, the most being kept by the <hi>Mishna</hi>; which was unlawful, in their Opinion, to have been written, being their Oral Law of unwritten Traditions, but only to prevent its being quite lost by the Calamities of those Times. How then was it possible to keep, from Age to Age, the true sound of all the Points, Vowels and Accents of the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi> without the Shapes, when multitudes of them cannot be distinguished by their Sound at all? and no memory of Man is able so much as once to receive the very Pauses or Notes of Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor yet the very Anomalies of the Punctation; nor can the greatest <hi>Rabbi,</hi> by all his Skill and Custom to read by Points, be able to Point an Unpointed Bible truly, from end to end, without a Copy before him.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, to suppose that for a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years before they had the Shapes of the Points, they could infallibly and perfectly preserve all the Pronuciation of it by Oral Tradition, or Use and Custom, is to build Castles in the Air: And therefore Dr. <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> saith of this Opinion, <hi>pag.</hi> 169. that <hi>Elias Levita</hi> lyeth for the Whetstone, when he saith, <hi>That the Iews of</hi> Tiberias, <hi>and their Ancestors, were so cunning, that from Age to Age, they remembred how</hi> Moses <hi>pronounced all the fourteen Vowels; as though God would have a dull People to torment their Souls with the memory of Sounds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> If that were possible, that the Pronunciation might be so long preserved true, even until <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. what Trust or Belief is there to be had in these <hi>Masorites,</hi> not only for their Ability at this time, but especially for their Fidelity, which at best could be but Humane? Nay, what Evidence is there that these <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias, A. D.</hi> 500. were the Inventors of the Points, if they could be trusted? For no History says so of them; the Jews universally deny it of them, <hi>Elias</hi> only excepted: The Work of the <hi>Maso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> which is the <hi>Masora,</hi> proves the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The absurdity of this Opinion is compendiously expressed by Dr. <hi>Iohn Owen,</hi> in his Considerations on the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> to the <hi>Pollyglott Bible,</hi> pag. 243.
<q>Of all the Fables that are in the <hi>Talmud</hi> (saith he,) I know none more incredible than this Story, That Men who cannot by any Story, or other Record, be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they ever were, <hi>in rerum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura</hi>; Men obscure, unobserved, not taken notice of by any Learned Man, Jew or Christian, should, in a time of deep Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, in the place where they lived, amongst a People wholly addicted to monstrous Fables themselves, blinded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curse of God, find out so great, so excellent a work, of such unspeakable usefulness, not once advising with the Men of their own Profession and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who then flourished in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance at <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the places adjacent;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:103507:138"/>
and impose it on all the World (that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Scriptures,) and have every tittle of their work received, without any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition or question from any Person or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, of any Principle whatever; yea, so as to have their Invention made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Rule of all following Expositions, Comments and Interpretations; <hi>Credat Apella.</hi>
                        </q>
And as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> saith, in his <hi>Centuria Chorograph.</hi> cap. 61. pag. 146.
<q>If you can believe the Points of the Bible to proceed from such a School, believe also all their <hi>Talmuds:</hi> The Pointing of the Bible favours of the work of the Holy Spirit, not of wicked, blind, and mad Men.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude: The Unpointed Bible hath not that plainness, perspicuity and agreement with it self, which is indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably necessary to render it meet to be a Rule of Faith and Worship; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Punctation would deservedly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, if it had no better O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iginal than to be the Invention of some Post-Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical <hi>Rabbies.</hi> It is therefore of the greatest moment, to discover the improbability and absurdity of this Novel Opinion, which so directly tends to the Overthrow of the Divine Authority of the Scriptures. And though some of the Patrons of it do not themselves reject the Bible, yet they well know others of them do on this Account: So that we must defend the Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the Points, as we desire to maintain the Divine Authority of the Bible. And so much for the weight and moment of the Matter in controversie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the seasonableness of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating this Controversie at this time, there are Six Circumstances that in Conjunction attending it, do render it seasonable. The <hi>First</hi> is, the Place of it, that it is broug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t home to our own door. We concern not our selves with the Controversies of Foreign Countreys; but our own Nation is the Stage where this Opinion of the Novelty of the Points hath been more publickly espoused, than would have been suffered in any other Protestant State. And therefore, <hi>Secondly,</hi> It doth not creep in corners, as in other places; but hath received the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Approbation of the Nation, so far as to be solemnly espoused in the <hi>English Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyglott</hi> Bible. Wherein, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We have not faint Motions of it, but powerful and mighty Efforts by the most Learned among them. And this, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> is attended with answerable success, the generality of the springing Youth embracing it. And <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Yet not content with this Victory, Success and Credit in <hi>England,</hi> the Patrons of it have of late put forth their greatest strength afresh for the promoting of their Cause, in the <hi>Vindiciae</hi> of <hi>Ludovicus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Capellus,</hi> lately published in Answer to <hi>Buxtorf de Origine Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum.</hi> And, <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Notwithstanding this Opposition to the Truth, by the great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for the Novelty of the Points, and its suitable Success, yet there has been no Answer returned to this Treatise as yet, that we hear of: And it is fit it should be Answered, lest this <hi>Vindiciae</hi> do as much mischief as the former Treatise, entituled, <hi>Arcanum Punctationis Revelatum,</hi> whereof this last is a Defence, that being justly accountable for the Success this Opinion hath had in <hi>England,</hi> as by a brief Narrative of the Rise, Progress and Issue of this Controversie amongst us will appear: Which in short is this: One <hi>Elius Lovita,</hi> a learned Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ian and <hi>Iew,</hi> about the beginning of the Reformation, fell upon this Conceit, That certain Jews <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <hi>Tiberias,</hi> A. D. 500. placed the Points as they had received them by Oral Tradition. This he defendeth in his <hi>Masoret Hammasoret,</hi> Preface 3<hi>d.</hi> But herein he is contrary to all the Jews, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his time, or before, or after him: And therefore he was answered by them, as in particular by <hi>R. Sam. Are<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

And out of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> by <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> the Elder, in his <hi>Thesaurus Grammaticus,</hi> Print, ed in 1609. And in his <hi>Tiberias,</hi> 1620.</p>
                     <p>Thus amongst the Jews the Errour ended where it began, even in <hi>Elias</hi> himself, none being left of his Opinion amongst them. But it will not so end with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; several Reformers, whether moved by the Authority of <hi>Elias</hi> the famous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Master of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue of their time; or else, it may be, at first not well examining of it, embraced it. This Advantage the <hi>Papists</hi> lay hold on with both Hands; for they find their Accounts in it, and improve it according<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y.</p>
                     <p>Amongst <hi>Protestants, Ludovicus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Capellus</hi> becomes the main and greatest Champion for the Novelty of the Points, and <hi>ex pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesso</hi> defends the same in his Treatise, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Arcanum Punctationis Revelatum,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by <hi>Erpenius,</hi> the Author for some Reasons concealing his own Name at the first. This Book was fully Answered, and the Truth amply defended by <hi>Buxtorf</hi> the Younger, in his Treatise entituled, <hi>De Punctorum Origine &amp; Antiquitate,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished <hi>A. D.</hi> 1648. But at length, in the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> to the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta,</hi> we have this Opinion of <hi>Capellus,</hi> which did but slily creep before, publickly owned by Dr. <hi>Walton,</hi> the Compiler of that Bible, and defended with <hi>Capellus</hi>'s Arguments; whereby <hi>Capellus</hi> is deservedly answerable for the Success of this Opinion, by its Station in the <hi>Polyglott</hi> Bible upon his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon Dr. <hi>I. O.</hi> writes some <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations</hi> on the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> aforesaid; and by the way, Answers the Heads of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought for the Novelty of the Points. But hereunto Dr. <hi>Walton</hi> returns a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, entituled, <hi>The Considerator Considered,</hi> A. D. 1659. But in the Year 1661. Dr. <hi>I. O.</hi> in his Treatise <hi>De Natura Theologiae,</hi> doth concisely defend his Opinion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Original of the Points. The like doth Mr. <hi>William Cooper</hi> defend the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:103507:138"/>
of the Points, in his <hi>Domus Masaicae Clavis,</hi> 1673: And so doth <hi>Wasmuth,</hi> in his <hi>Vindiciae S. Hebraeae Scripturae,</hi> 1664.</p>
                     <p>And thus stood the Cause for some time, until now at last <hi>Ludovicus Capellus</hi> his <hi>Vindiciae</hi> comes out, in Answer to <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf</hi>'s Treatise, <hi>De Origine Punctorum</hi>; as also his former Treatise, <hi>Arcanum Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctationis Revelatum,</hi> is reprinted with it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other Critical Discourses, in a large <hi>Folio,</hi> published <hi>A. D.</hi> 1689. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the then <hi>Archbishop of Canterbury, the rest of the Bishops, and all the Clergy of the Church of England:</hi> By which Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made as bold a Challenge, and earnest Invitation to the Defence of the Truth in Controversie, as could well he made; and, together with the foregoing Considerations, render it seasonable at this time, as the weight and moment of the Subject do make the present Defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of necessary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the Method of the ensuing Discourse, we have divided the same into Two Parts.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>First Part,</hi> we examine the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for the Opinion, that the Points were invented, <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. Or since that time by the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> or Others, and discover the Improbability thereof.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Second Part,</hi> we Prove and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Antiquity and Divine Original of the Shapes of the Points, Vowels and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, against the Cavils and Objections of <hi>Capellus,</hi> and Others.</p>
                     <p>But the First of the Two is what we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin withall, for several Reasons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Because we are in Possession of the present Punctation, as being of Divine Original, and have peaceably enjoyed it in all Ages to this time, all Translations amongst us being taken out of it: 'Tis our Inheritance, and therefore unfit to call the Antiquity of the Points into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, until we first see sufficient Evidence, or at least great Probality that they were a Novel Invention: Which if of so late date, may be more easily proved than what was a Thousand Years before that time: And the Rejecting or Answering of the Arguments for their Novel Invention, is a Proof of their Antiquity, and Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; for the Points were placed either since <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. or between the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. or else by the time of <hi>Ezra.</hi> But we shall here prove in the First place, that they were not placed since <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. and there are none that pretend they were between the time of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. Therefore the Points were placed by the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> which is all we contend for.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Old Foundation must be removed, before a New Structure can be erected. Many have been so prepossessed with so high a conceit of the Novelty of the Points, that 'twould be bootless to prove their Antiquity, until the improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their late Invention be discovered: for they admire that any Learned or Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Person should believe their Antiquity, (altho' all the Protestant States and Churches in the World (except what hath been lately suffered in <hi>England</hi>) do religiously maintain it.) <hi>Scaltger</hi> saith, <hi>That nothing can be more foolishly spoken, that to say the Points were coaevous with the Letters,</hi> Ep. 243. <hi>Grotius,</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. affirmeth, <hi>That 'tis nothing but pertinacious Obstinacy in any, to deny that the Scriptures were used to be written without Points after</hi> Ezra's <hi>time.</hi> And <hi>Schikard,</hi> in his <hi>Iure Reg. Heb. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 41. asserteth, <hi>That he greatly wonders that any can seriously believe the Antiquity of the Points. Vid.</hi> Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Considered, <hi>pag.</hi> 234, 235. So that till the Absurdity of their beloved Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be manifested, 'tis in vain to prove the other whilst they disdain to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Our Antagonists spend their greatest strength in opposing our Opinion, to render it but Improbable; and 'tis but quit with them, to shew the Improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of theirs; and more fair, seeing 'tis easier for them to prove a Fact done but a Thousand Years ago, than for us to prove what was done at Two Thousand Years di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the present time.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This Discourse being principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to Answer <hi>Capellus,</hi> Dr. <hi>Walton,</hi> &amp;c. who take this method, first defending their own Opinion, and then Replying unto the Arguments for ours, it is convenient to follow them herein, and keep their Order so far.</p>
                     <p>And for these Reasons, we observe the Method here propounded, and begin with the First General Head; which is, The discovery of the Improbability of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That the Shapes of the Points, Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and Accents of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible, were first invented and placed to the Text, <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. or since that time, either by the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> or Others; and for the Reasons aforesaid, we shall largely insist hereon, according to the best of our poor Ability, and that small Reading which frequent Avocations from Study on neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Occasions would permit.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. I. The Question stated. The Four different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about the First Period of Time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Invention of the Points is assigned, are enumerated. The Three several Opinions of those who suppose the Points were a Novel Invention, related: The Two last examined.</head>
                        <p>THE Question under Consideration, is, Concerning the Time when the <hi>Shapes</hi> of the <hi>Points, Vowels</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents</hi> were first invented, and placed to the <hi>Hebrew Bible.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are Two periods of Time parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly fixed unto the one or the other, of which all Parties do in some respect ascribe their Original.</p>
                        <p>The one is, the Time of <hi>Ezra</hi>; the other is, <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. The one makes them of Divine the other of Humane Original and Authority.</p>
                        <p>So that the Question is, <hi>Whether the Shapes or Figures of the Points, Vowels and Accents which are joyned to the Text of the Hebrew Bible, were invented and placed to the Text as early as the time of</hi> Ezra, <hi>er else not until the</hi> Talmuds <hi>were finished,</hi> A. D. 500?</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Those that place them to the First Period, <hi>viz.</hi> that say they were as ancient as the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> are all the Jews, one (only <hi>Elias</hi>) excepted, though they differ as to the positive precise time of their first Invention, as <hi>R. Samuel Arkuvolti</hi> reckons them up. For, 1<hi>st.</hi> Some say they are coae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous with the Letters. 2. Others, That they were given to <hi>Moses</hi> on <hi>Sinai</hi> with the Oral Law, and kept by Tradition till <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time. 3. Others say, That they were placed to the Law, and the rest of the Scriptures, as they were first written. 4. But all the rest, except <hi>Elias</hi> only, say that <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the <hi>great Sanhedrim</hi> of his time, first invented and placed them to the Text. So that in this they all agree, That by the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> at latest, they were invented and placed to the Scripture; and thereby they own their Divine Original and Authority, as do the generality of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians likewise.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Those that place their Original to the Second Period, affirm that they were not invented before <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. though they also differ as to the precise time of their first Invention: About which they hold Three different Opinions. 1<hi>st.</hi> That they were began and ended, <hi>simul &amp; semel, A. D.</hi> 500. as <hi>Elias</hi> saith was his Opinion, in <hi>Tob taam lettar page tsade, cap.</hi> 2. <hi>I think</hi> (saith he) <hi>that those who found out the Points, found out also the Accents, and placed both of them to the Letters at one time.</hi> Which in his <hi>Masoret Hammasoret,</hi> Pref. 2. he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares was about the Year 500. The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences which he brings for his Opinion, and the Testimony he produceth out of <hi>Aben Ezra, Cosri, Kimchi,</hi> and <hi>Tsak Sepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taim,</hi> shall be at large examined in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapters, and the Improbability and Absurdity of his Opinion fully discovered afterwards in its proper place. A brief Relation of the Two other Opinions, and Examination of them (by the way,) is the Work of this Chapter: And they are these.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Second</hi> different Opinion about their Novel Invention, is that of <hi>Ludovicus Capellus,</hi> who supposeth they were began <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. and ended <hi>A. D.</hi> 1030. by <hi>Ben Asher,</hi> and <hi>Ben Naphthali, Arcanum Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis Revelatum,</hi> cap. 17. But for this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he brings no Testimony nor Reason, as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> observes, <hi>de Punct.

<q>And the Book that we lean upon in these things, is a Book that is known in <hi>Egypt,</hi> comprizing the Twenty four Books of Scripture, which was in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> many Years ago, to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Books by it; and all lean upon it, because <hi>Ben Asher</hi> Corrected it, who was exact therein many years, and Corrected it many times as he Transcribed it; and and on him I lean in the Book of the Law, which I have written after his manner.</q>
This <hi>Elias</hi> repeats, and addeth,
<q>And so we lean upon his Reading in all these Countreys; and the Men of the East lean on the Reading of <hi>Ben Naphthali</hi>; and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:103507:139"/>
the differences between them are only about little Accents, as <hi>Metheg</hi> and <hi>Mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaph,</hi> and <hi>Munach,</hi> and <hi>Pashta,</hi> single and double: And the divisions about the Points, are only about <hi>Holem</hi> and <hi>Kamets, Katuph</hi> and <hi>Kamets, Gadol</hi> and <hi>Pathak,</hi> and <hi>Sheva,</hi> and <hi>Kateph Pathak</hi>; and so of <hi>Dagesh,</hi> and <hi>Raphah,</hi> and <hi>Milhill,</hi> and <hi>Milrah,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
But doth <hi>Elias</hi> suppose these in whole, or in part to be the Authors of the Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Nay, he saith the quite contrary is evident in the words immediately before these of <hi>Maimonides:</hi> And thus saith <hi>Elias,</hi>
                           <q>But as to the Divisions that are between <hi>Ben Asher</hi> and <hi>Ben Naphthali,</hi> being only about Points and Accents, there is no doubt but that they were written after the Points and the Accents were founded: And this (saith he) is easie to understand.</q>

                           </gap> 3. as indeed it is; for the differences being about the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of the Punctation, both Points, Vowels and Accents, all those Parts must needs have been before in being, or they could not have been the matter of division or difference between them.</p>
                        <p>Obj. <hi>What made Ben Asher so long about it, if he only Corrected it?</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Sol.</hi> The Nature and Weight of the thing, to make it a Standard; by which, to try all Copies of their only Rule of Faith, wherein it was needful to observe exactly, and compare faithfully, by the best Copies, every Letter, Point and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the Scripture; and after that, to write it over, until that there neither want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor yet abounded one Letter, Point or Accent of all the Bible; was a work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many Years might be taken up, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out supposing him to be the Author of any part of the Punctation, because he was long in exact Correcting of it.</p>
                        <p>So that here, as <hi>Elias</hi> leaveth <hi>Capellus</hi>; so also the Testimony doth not help him at all, and others he hath none.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As <hi>Capellus</hi> leaves <hi>Elias,</hi> about the Sence of <hi>Maimonides</hi>; so they differ greatly in the Method and Order wherein they suppose the several parts of the Punctation were invented. <hi>Capellus</hi> conceiteth they were 500 years in compiling, after this manner: (1.) They distinguished the Verses by two thick strokes, for <hi>Soph pasuk.</hi> (2.) Next to that, they placed the five long Vowels, <hi>a, e, i, o, u.</hi> (3.) Then the Pauses, or great Stops, by the Accents. (4.) Then the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Stops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— But he brings no Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to prove it, and 'tis no more than his own single Conjecture. Now <hi>Elias</hi> saith they were all made at one time, <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. and that in another manner: For <hi>Elias</hi> saith, that next unto the placing of the <hi>Period,</hi> they placed the <hi>Colon,</hi> or <hi>Athnack</hi>; and then the <hi>Sakeph: And it was necessary</hi> (saith <hi>Elias</hi>) <hi>that they should do all this before they placed the Points, because that many of the Points are changed, by reason of</hi> Athnack <hi>and</hi> Soph pasuk; <hi>as</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And indeed, on this Account, <hi>Capellus</hi> his Opinion is absurd; for the Vowels could not be placed before <hi>Athnack,</hi> and the other Accents (which change the Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els one into another) were fixed.</p>
                        <p>And that the Points cannot be 500 years in composing (<hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. until <hi>A. D.</hi> 1040. as <hi>Capellus</hi> thinks they were,) the Nature of the <hi>Masoretick</hi> Notes, and the Time unavoidably to be allotted for the same, do evince.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Masorites</hi> have made their Notes on the Anomalies of all the parts of the Punctation: So that the whole of the Punctation must needs have been finished long before their time; who yet must needs have been before the time of <hi>Ben Asher</hi>; because the Grammarians succeeded him, and take no notice of any <hi>Masorites</hi> of their time; which they could not have omitted, if there had been any such Criticks in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-learning among them, as the <hi>Masorites</hi> were. And yet 'tis as absurd to suppose these <hi>Masorites</hi> to be before <hi>Ben Asher,</hi> as it was to suppose them since his time. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) They had then been Contemporary with the Authors of some part of the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, and before the Authors of the last part of the Punctation: Which is most absurd, as shall be made to appear from the Nature of the Masoretick Notes, which do manifestly shew that the whole of the Punctation was long before those Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For else we must suppose there were several sets of <hi>Masorites</hi> that did successively arise after every Set of Authors of each part of the Punctation, as it was gradually invented and placed. But this we cannot imagine: Because,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The First Set of <hi>Masorites</hi> must then have been so near the Authors of that part of the Punctation which was invented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time, as to have been able to know the Reasons of the Anomalies; which if they had known, no doubt but they would have mention'd them, there being no way like it to restrain Posterity from altering of them: Which was the main End of all their Observations, so to keep them even as they found them: And the same may be said of every Set of <hi>Masorites</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Then the First Set of <hi>Masorites</hi> must have been Authors of the Punctation it self, rather than bare Annnotators on it, being much more fit than after Ages so to be: For if they durst only observe the Anomalies of that part of the Punctation which was before them; how then durst any who came after their time become Authors, who had no more, nor yet so much skill and ability for the same? For the succeeding Authors must place the parts of the Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which they were the Authors of the Shapes thereof, according as they had received the knowledge of the Force, Sound or Pronunciation thereof, from these <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotites,</hi> who were their Predecessors, who yet durst not attempt any such things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

                           <pb n="250" facs="tcp:103507:140"/>3. If the <hi>Masorites</hi> were of such distant and divers Ages, there would then be a proportionable difference in their Style and Dialect; and those who made Notes on the First Part of the Punctation, would have been known by their Style, Dialect, or Authority, from those who made their Notes on the Last Part of it. But there is no Mark or Means left whereby we can dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But seeing <hi>Capellus</hi> would be accounted to be, for the main, of <hi>Elias</hi> his Opinion, though he differs from him in these Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as to the time taken up in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Punctation, and the like; yet seeing he pleads for his Opinion with all <hi>Elias</hi>'s Arguments, which <hi>Elias</hi> brings for his own Opinion, and chideth <hi>Buxtorf</hi> for stating his Opinion, as if it were different from that of <hi>Elias,</hi> seeing he agrees with him, that they might be begun by the <hi>Maso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> A.

The Evidences for the Novelty of the Points considered, in the Examination of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Elias Levita,</hi> and of the Testimonies produced by him and his Followers, <hi>Capel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and Others, for the same; in General.</head>
                        <p>WHereas there is no Testimony pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by any, for the Proof of the Time, Place and Persons, when, where, or by whom the Points were invented or placed, <hi>A.

D. 500. and then placed by the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias</hi>: It will be convenient therefore to examine the Evidences for the Novelty of the Points, under this Opinion of <hi>Elias,</hi> seeing they were first brought by him for the Proof of his own Notion. But we must distinguish between the Arguments which are brought, or Objections made against the Antiquity of the Points; and the Evidences for the <hi>ubi, quando, &amp; à quibus,</hi> when, where, and by whom precisely they were invented: For most of the strength of <hi>Capellus,</hi> and Others, is placed in making Objections against the Antiquity of the Points, which we intend to consider in the <hi>SECOND PART:</hi> And such are the Objections: (1.) <hi>Of Reading an Vnpointed Copy of the Law in the Synagogue:</hi> (2.) <hi>The Samaritan, and other Eastern Languages,</hi> being without Points: (3.) <hi>The LXX. and other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, not following the present Punctation:</hi> (4.) <hi>The Silence of</hi> Jerom, <hi>and the Fathers:</hi> (5.) <hi>The Silence of the Caballistical Writers:</hi> (6.) <hi>The Silence of the Talmuds, the Mishna, and Gemara, about the Points:</hi> (7) <hi>The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of the Names of them:</hi> (8.) <hi>The Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy, Superfluity and Anomalies of the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,</hi> and the like, do only conclude a bare Conjecture against their Antiquity, but do not so much as touch the Time, Place and Persons, when, where, and by whom positively the Punctation was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and placed; which alone is our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Enquiry. Nay, indeed they tell us they do not insist much, when, where, and by whom the Points were invented, whether <hi>A. D.</hi> 500, 600, 700, or 800. whether by the <hi>Mosorites,</hi> or Others at <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias,</hi> or elsewhere, so it be granted the Points be not of Divine but Humane Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. Vid. <hi>Considerator Considered,</hi> p. 219. <hi>Capellus Arcanum</hi> &amp; <hi>Vindicia,</hi> in the <hi>Prooemium</hi>; and yet do say that <hi>Elias</hi> hath proved they were invented, <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. by the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> Prol. 3. §. 42.</p>
                        <p>But we say we'll not be so served; for before we quit the Punctation, we'll know when, where, and by whom it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented within this last Thousand Years, then we'll yield it. But if they can't prove this, we'll abide by our own: For if it were invented so lately, they might be able to shew us when, where, and by whom it was invented, and placed to the Text; for it is impossible the whole World of Jews and Christians should universally receive it, without taking notice when, where, and by whom it came. So that will they or nill they, we must examine what they can say to this Point, When, where, and by whom the Points were first invented, and placed to the Text. Now if they were placed since <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. it must be done by the Jews; they would never have received it at the Hands of Christians, had any been able to have done it.</p>
                        <p>This must then have been best known to the Jews; and none of them would have done more, to gather up the Evidences hereof, than <hi>Elias,</hi> the first and last of this Opinion among them. This he hath done as well as he could, which we shall now examine, seeing his Followers have added nothing to what he hath produced in this Matter: Which amounts to no more than some dubious Expressions of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:103507:140"/>
four <hi>Rabbins</hi> about the Punctation, <hi>viz. Aben Ezra, Kimki, Cosri,</hi> and <hi>Tsak Sephataim</hi>; and what they say in Commendation of the Skill of the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias.</hi> Now we shall examine the Quotations out of the four <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi> about the Punctation: And we say in General,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We deny that any one of these Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins do speak one Word for the Novelty of the Points: But if they did all four speak positively for it, what could be thence concluded more than this, That four Jews were of this Opinion, contrary to the universal Belief of all their own People.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Our Adversaries say the Jews are not fit to be heard, when they speak in the Praise of their own Nation; for they are partial to their own Glory. But nothing could be said more to their own Honour than this, That they were enabled by the Lord to perform so great, so useful and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Work as the present Punctation is; even then when the Christians said they were under the Curse of God, for Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of Christ. The Time of <hi>Ezra</hi> needed not the Honour, it had as much besides as this was, there being several Books of Scripture then written by Men divinely inspired; but the poor ignorant Jews, <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. despised of all the World, and rejected of God for their Unbelief, wanted such an <hi>Encomium.</hi> So that by their own Argument, their Testimony is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; because it is in their own Cause, and for their own Glory, of which they are too ambitious.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But we deny that <hi>Aben Ezra, Kimki, Cosri,</hi> and the Author of <hi>Tsak Sephataim,</hi> do suppose the Points to be a Novel Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For,</p>

                           <hi>First,</hi> We shall produce plainer Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies out of these very Authors, wherein they plainly express themselves for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of the Points.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> We shall prove they have wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed those places they have collected; and that the genuine Sence of the Authors, in those very places they have alledged out of them, is very consonant unto, and doth well agree with what the same Authors say elsewhere for the Antiquity of the Points.</p>
                        <p>We shall begin, in the First place, with <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>; who, by <hi>Elias</hi> and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is esteemed <hi>Instar Omnium</hi>; none being, in their Opinion, so fully of their mind in this Matter.</p>

Origine,</hi> pag. 13. The words are these, or to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <q>The words of the Lord are pure Words, or Sayings, preserved by the hands of holy Men, one Generation after another: For they were sanctified from the Womb; they heard the holy words at the Mouth of him who is most excellent in Holiness; and they were Interpeters between him (<hi>viz.</hi> the Lord,) and between <hi>Iacob.</hi> The holy People and these were before the building of that holy House (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi>) and when it stood upon its Basis, or Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and after it, until the Vision and Prophecy was sealed up. But after a few years, about the time of the building of the holy House the second time, at that time the Spirit of the Lord, the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding rested upon the Men of that House that were called, <hi>Anashee keneset haggedolah,</hi> 
                              <q>The Men of the great Synagogue, or <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> to explain all that was sealed up in the Command.</q>And the words that are translated by the Mouth of the Just Men from the Mouth of the former and latter Prophets, (that is, delivered by Oral Tradition, from hand to hand.) Also they were rendring a Reason, (or resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Accent <hi>Meshebe taam,</hi> Prov. 26.16.) and taught their Posterity, <hi>Chephets Col<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inian,</hi> the sence of every word or thing; <hi>al jad taamee hamikra,</hi> by the hand or means of the Accents of the Scripture: And the Kings and the Ministers they taught their Posterity; and the closed Sections, and the open Sections: And what continues, carries on the sence (in opposition to the <hi>Pause,</hi>) and the Verses or Pauses that stop the sence; and they were Eyes to the Blind; therefore we go in their steps, and follow after them, and lean upon them in all the Expositions of Scripture. And after the Captivity of our Fathers from the Holy City, the Lord stirred up the Spirit of his Saints; and the Chief of them was our holy <hi>Rabbi</hi> (viz. <hi>Iudah</hi>) to compose what was noted in loose Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Commands of our God, and that is the <hi>Mishna</hi>; whereunto nothing may be added, nor may any thing be taken away from it. Also after them, came other holy Princes, and pious Hero's, and they are the Men of the <hi>Talmud</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Gemarists,</hi>) and they went on in their paths (<hi>viz.</hi> of the Masters of the <hi>Mishna,</hi>) and they took up the Stones out of the High-ways of the Testimony, and they removed every Stumbling-stone out of the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:103507:141"/>
paths of the Lord. And after this, stood up in <hi>Israel,</hi> according to the good Hand of our God upon us, two great Rows, or Orders, (<hi>Neh.</hi> 12.31.) the one keeping the Walls of the Sanctuary of Strength, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.31. (founded by the Hand of our God,) that no Stranger may be able to destroy it. Now this <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> is the Holy Books of Scripture; and the Men of this Row or Order, are the Men of the <hi>Masora,</hi> or the <hi>Masorites,</hi> who sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated all the mixed Multitude from the holy People, (alluding to <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.3. and meaning what is Humane from what is Divine, in Correcting the Copy:) And they numbred the Men of the Sanctuary, from Two or Eleven, to the end that no Stranger might draw near to the Gates of Righteousness. Blessed be the Lord our God, who hath put such a thing as this in the heart of the rest of the Kingdom of his Priests, to beautifie his House, which is a House of Wisdom; as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Wisdom hath built her House.</hi> And the second Row, that goeth over against it, <hi>And I go after it,</hi> Neh. 12.38. are those that are expert in War, alluding unto Cant. 3.8. <hi>in the Law,</hi> or <hi>about the Law</hi>; and they are the Grammarians.</q>

                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> After the building of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond House, about the ending of Prophecy, or the Prophetick Gift and Ministry, God raised up other holy Men, to wit, the Men of the Great Synagogue, (that is to say, <hi>Ezra,</hi> with his Councel,) who preserved the Word of God, which was brought to them by Oral Tradition. This Holy Scripture they did by other means than Tradition, with great care and study deliver down to Posterity: But how they did this, and what in particular it was that the Men of the Great Synagogue did about the Preservation of the Scripture; this he doth teach parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, and by Parts.</p>
                        <p>For, <hi>First,</hi> he saith, That this was done, <hi>Al jad taamee hamikra,</hi> By the means of the Accents of the Scripture.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> that is the Vowels. The <hi>Kings</hi> he calls after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards seven, <hi>viz. Holem, Shurek, Chirek, Pathak, Segol, Kamets, Tsere:</hi> And the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, Sheva, Mute, Mobile,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound:</hi> And he doth not mean the Accents which the Grammarians divided into <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Ministers.</hi> (Vid. <hi>Balmes,</hi> cap. 3. of the <hi>Points,</hi> more of this.)</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By the Doctrine concerning the Sections that are <hi>close, open,</hi> or <hi>continued; Hasetumim, Vpetuchim, Vdebikim.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By <hi>Hapesukim,</hi> the Verses, or the Distinction of the Scripture into Verses; by these helps he saith they are like <hi>Eyes to the Blind,</hi> and in their Steps we go, in Reading and Expounding the Scripture at this time: He saith, we every where lean on their Exposition of the Scripture, and therefore not of the <hi>Tiberian Masorites.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the Third place, after the Men of the Great Synagogue, he proceeds to the Masters of the <hi>Mishna,</hi> and to them he chiefly ascribes the true Explication of the Precepts of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He makes the <hi>Talmudists,</hi> or <hi>Gemarists,</hi> succeed the Masters of the <hi>Mishna</hi>; and to these he ascribeth the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration and Explication of the Doctrine of the <hi>Mishna,</hi> and their Disputations.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He saith, By the good Hand of God to <hi>Israel,</hi> he raised up Two other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Men, labouring profitably for the Preservation of the Scripture. The First Order he ascribeth to the <hi>Masorites</hi>; but unto these he ascribeth no Invention, either of the Points, or of the Accents, or of the Distinctions. But he principally commends these, for Two things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> That they did separate every thing that was strange (that is, Foreign or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane) from the Books of Scripture, if any thing had by hap crept into it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they numbred the Words and Letters of the Books of Scripture, that so there might be no way left whereby the Text could be corrupted in time to come. And agreeing to this, is what he writes of the <hi>Masorites,</hi> in his Book entituled, <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee Mora, — Truly there is a Reward to the Works of the Masorites, who are like those who keep the Walls of a City: For by reason of them, the Law of the Lord, and the holy Books of Scripture, do stand in their Form, without any Addition, or Diminution.</hi> This is the sum and substance of <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>'s words: From whence it appears (saith <hi>Buxtorf</hi>) as clear as the Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> That he did not make the <hi>Tiberian Masorites,</hi> but the Men of the <hi>Great Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi> (the Head of whom was <hi>Ezra,</hi>) to be the Authors of the Invention of all the Points, Accents and Distinctions: For he reckons up the <hi>Tiberian Masorites</hi> long after the Authors of the Points, Accents and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions. Nor is there left any room for that Exception, That he speaks only of the Power and Force of the Points and Accents: For his Words are too manifest, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Speech will not allow this; for he shews what was done in every Age, for the Preservation of the Scripture: But if he had spoken here of the Oral Explication of the Scripture only, what then did the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:103507:141"/>
Men of the <hi>Great Synagogue</hi> do, other than those before them? Did not they do this, and for this were commended by him? And if he thought the <hi>Masorites</hi> invented them first, why did he not expresly ascribe it to them, when he made mention of them? In vain therefore doth <hi>Capellus,</hi> in his <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciae,</hi> make the Objection, That the Sound, and not the Shapes, were meant by him of <hi>Ezra,</hi> when he knew <hi>Buxtorf</hi> had already Answered it. Moreover, <hi>Capellus</hi> says, <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> is as much for him elsewhere, and so no witness against him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> This we deny: But if he were, he is for us here, and therefore can be no Witness against us: We can spare him, having all besides him for us; better than they can, who have not another for them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> He saith, <hi>Why did not</hi> Ezra <hi>as well Write the Oral Law, as Point the Text?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reply:</hi> Because the Scripture is the only Rule of Faith, and so esteemed by them; but the Oral Law was but Humane Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of no account then, however it were afterwards admired; and it then became needful to Point the Text, that it might be plain, seeing they had in part forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their Tongue in Captivity, and was never since restored to be Vulgar.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Capellus</hi> asks, <hi>Why might not</hi> Ezra <hi>deliver the Sounds of the Points to</hi> Israel, <hi>as well as the Oral Law, by Tradition?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> We deny the Oral Law was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by <hi>Ezra</hi> to <hi>Israel</hi>; but if it were, as the Jews imagine, yet was there not that need to write one as the other: They could keep their Oral Traditions, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any Alteration of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; but so could they not preserve the true Punctation of the Language, when it ceased to be vulgarly spoken or understood. But when through their many Dispersions they were in danger of losing their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then they wrote them; as <hi>R. Samuel Arcuvolti</hi> declares in <hi>Arugath Habosem,</hi> who says also, <hi>It was necessary that the Points were placed in</hi> Ezra's <hi>time, though it had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful before; because the Sound could not be preserved longer than that time without them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Capellus Vindiciae,</hi> lib. 1. cap. 1 §. 11. objects, <hi>Was not</hi> Ezra <hi>enough, with a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Spirit, what need of the</hi> Sanhedrin?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> (1.) The <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> was instituted. (2.) Others were Prophets, as <hi>Haggai,</hi> &amp;c. and why must they be excluded? (3.) This is the General Opinion of Jews and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, That <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the Prophets did act in Conjunction with the Great <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> in the Reformation of the Church, as they were commanded. But of this more else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where may be spoken.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Capellus Vindiciae, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. §. 9. says, <hi>What</hi> Aben Ezra <hi>says of</hi> Ezra, <hi>is no more than is due to any skilful Grammarian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> Not so. For, <hi>First,</hi> as <hi>Cosri</hi> says, 'Tis a Work Divine, and requires Divine Aid, to give the true Sence of Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly and truly.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That might be done by <hi>Ezra,</hi> by Humane Ability, whilst the Language and the Text was rightly read and pronounced, that could not be done, after the Tongue ceased to be vulgarly understood, without Divine Aid: And therefore, though it were no more than Humane Skill, yet none since <hi>Ezra</hi> could be supposed to have that, and therefore it might well enough belong to him on that account.</p>
                        <p>So that here is an express Testimony of <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> for the Antiquity of the Points, notwithstanding all the Exceptions made by <hi>Capellus</hi> against it.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. IV. The several places of <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> wrested by <hi>Elias</hi> and his Followers, considered: Their genuine Sence declared.</head>
                        <p>WE are now to discover the Fraud and Violence used by <hi>Elias</hi> and his Followers, to wrest the places of <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> in the places they alledge out of him, in favour of their Opinion; and to shew, that what he saith in those places, doth well enough agree with what he hath elsewhere said for the Antiquity of the Points.</p>
                        <p>The First place we shall take notice of, is in his Book, entituled, <hi>Tsakooth,</hi> alledged by <hi>Elias,</hi> and after him by <hi>Capellus:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> saith, <hi>There are many Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, who charge the Author of the Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Text into Verses, with Errour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but they do not speak what is right, and</hi> Rabbi Moses <hi>the Priest is one of them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I admire at this greatly, how the Author of the Stops or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses should err,</hi> ve aph ki im hu Ezra hasopher, <hi>seeing he was Ezra the Scribe.</hi> The Novelists read it, <hi>And if he were Ezra the Scribe.</hi> This in general he saith, <hi>That there hath arisen no Man so wise as the Author of the Pauses since his time; for we see that throughout the whole Scripture he hath made the stops no where but where they should be placed.</hi> Thus far <hi>Aben Ezra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here <hi>Elias</hi> owneth, that <hi>Hamaphsik,</hi> the Author of the Stops, is meant the <hi>Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>; but he wonders why he is called so in the Singular Number, being elsewhere in this Book mentioned in the Plural. But this <hi>Buxorf</hi> denies is any where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Plural in this Book, though the Matter is small, whether the one, or the other; for the Singular might mean <hi>Ezra,</hi> as the Head of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi>; and the Plural might mean <hi>Ezra,</hi> in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the <hi>Sanhedrin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Elias</hi> inferrs from this place, <hi>That</hi> Aben Ezra <hi>did not believe the Points were given by</hi> Moses <hi>on</hi> Sinai.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> We grant it: For we say it was his Opinion that <hi>Ezra</hi> placed them: And that Opinion doth well agree with this place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Capellus</hi> objecteth, <hi>'Tis too mean a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Author of the Points, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:103507:142"/>
he meant</hi> Ezra, <hi>when he says, There has been none so wise since him, and that it was done perfectly right.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> 'Tis Praise enough for <hi>Ezra</hi> or <hi>Moses</hi> either, to say, That none has arisen like him: And, That the Punctation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly according to the Mind of God, and in all the Parts of it true and right. And as to Others, who charge the Punctator with Errour, he reproveth them for the same, seeing (as he says) that <hi>Ezra</hi> the Scribe made it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Capellus</hi> infers hence, <hi>That some, as this</hi> R. Moses, <hi>&amp;c had no such esteem for the Points, and did not think they were made by</hi> Ezra.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp. First,</hi> But <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> is not of that mind; which is the thing that is to be proved: For he reproveth it in them, and they want Witnesses who seek after those who are convicted of Errour therein. But they might charge the Punctator with Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and yet allow <hi>Ezra</hi> to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, by supposing, as <hi>Capellus</hi> himself doth, that there might be crept into the Text some Mistakes, through the length of Time, and humane Frailty of the Scribes, who wrote the Bible from the Copies that were before them: And 'tis more likely, that both <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> and these Persons, owned <hi>Ezra</hi> to be the Author of the Points, because he makes that an Argument, seeing <hi>Ezra</hi> made it, or <hi>if Ezra</hi> made it; either way shew it was a received Principle among them, and therefore goes not to prove it, but improves it, and infers from it, as a thing acknowledged, especially by those he reproves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> doth call the Punctator <hi>Hamaphsik,</hi> and meaneth <hi>Ezra</hi> thereby, appears by what he saith else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as on <hi>Esther</hi> 9.27. on the words <hi>Keketabam,</hi> according to their writing:
<q>The sence is (saith he,) that the Volume of <hi>Esther</hi> should be read even just as it was written, without Points; and that because <hi>Ezra</hi> the Scribe, <hi>Hiphsick Hapesukim,</hi> distinguished the Verses, which was not done till many years after the writing of this Volume: Therefore, our Wise Man, of happy memory, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That he that reads this Volume of <hi>Esther,</hi> should not stop at the end of a Verse.</q>
— Hence <hi>Buxtorf</hi> observes, He saw the Volume of <hi>Esther</hi> Unpointed.</p>
                        <p>Now in this place he expressly nameth <hi>Ezra</hi> the <hi>Hammappesik,</hi> or Pauser, or Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator: And in other places it is manifest, that the <hi>Hammappesik,</hi> or maker of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, was also the Maker of the Points, Vowels and Accents: Which <hi>Elias</hi> himself alloweth, saying, <hi>Vpeerush hammappesik mi shesam happesikat hattaamim:</hi> And the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Hammappesick,</hi> the <hi>Pauser,</hi> the <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator,</hi> is he that placeth the Pausing of the Accents.</p>
                        <p>Hence Dr. <hi>Walton</hi> and <hi>Capellus</hi> are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, who suppose that by <hi>Hammappesik,</hi> no more is intended, than he that placed the two thick Strokes, or divided the Text into Verses; which they allow to be much more ancient than the Points, Vowels and Accents: For, as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> observeth, <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> in <hi>Tsakooth,</hi> doth often use the Verb <hi>Hiphsik,</hi> not only to distinguish the Verses by two Points or Strokes, but also to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish Verses by distinguishing Accents and Pauses: As he saith in <hi>Tsakooth,</hi> before the words last alledged, <hi>Behold</hi> (saith he) <hi>we see that he</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Hammappesik <hi>the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator</hi>) <hi>hath put the Accent in the word</hi> Sham, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.33. <hi>which joyneth that with the word</hi> Shem <hi>that followeth: But in</hi> Exod. 34.5 <hi>there</hi> Hiphsiko <hi>he makes a Stop,</hi> (that is, makes an <hi>Athnak,</hi>) <hi>which distinguisheth it from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words.</hi> So that <hi>Hammappesick</hi> the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centator, or Punctator, is the same with <hi>Baal Hattaamim,</hi> the Author of the Accents or Punctation. For so <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> in his Commentary on this very place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.5. calls him there <hi>Baal Hattaamim,</hi> the Author of the Accents; who is here called <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mappesik,</hi> the Punctator.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Capellus in Vind. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. §. 5. would suppose <hi>Hammaphsik to be he that placed the Sounds and Force, but not the Shape.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> But, <hi>First, Elias</hi> plainly affirms that it is he that placed the Shapes: And so doth <hi>Capellus</hi> himself allow the same else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>viz.</hi> in his <hi>Arcanum, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. §. 5. he saith there,
<q>That none may think because 'tis said <hi>Maphsick</hi> in the Singular Number, the <hi>Punctator</hi>; therefore it was <hi>Ezra,</hi> and not the <hi>Masorites,</hi> that Pointed the Text: Saith he, <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> doth else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where call them <hi>Maphsikim,</hi> the <hi>Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> in the Plural, in his Book <hi>Moze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naim.</hi>
                           </q>
So that here he allows <hi>Maphsik</hi> to be the Placer of the Shapes, where he can but bring it to the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Capellus</hi> objects, 'Tis not said, <hi>Which was not done till many years after the writing of Esther</hi>; but, <hi>Which was done not many years after the writing of Esther.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp. First,</hi> It matters not which way it be read, as to the Point in debate; 'tis brought to prove that <hi>Ezra</hi> was the <hi>Maph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sik,</hi> the Punctator; which it proveth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether way it be read, <hi>long after,</hi> or <hi>not long after; Ezra</hi> Pointed it <hi>after</hi> both sences allow.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Capellus</hi> would fain suppose the Sound might be kept by Tradition, or Custom, to the time of the <hi>Masorites.</hi> But this we have elsewhere showed cannot be.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> The rest of the places alledged by <hi>Elias</hi> and his Followers, out of <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> for the Novelty of the Points, are principally Two that commend the Skill and Fidelity of the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> about the Punctation. We shall therefore,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> Consider the scope of the places themselves, to find thereby whether he esteemed the <hi>Masorites</hi> to be the Inventors, or Reformers and Correctors of the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation. And,</p>
                        <p>

of the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias</hi>; wherein lyes all the strength of the Evidence that <hi>Elias</hi> or his Followers do bring for the precise Time, Place and Persons, when, where, and by whom it is supposed the Points were first invented: And we shall here consider, whether what is spoken in Commendation of them, do belong to them as Inventors, or as Restorers, or Correctors of the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We shall shew that <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> doth not ascribe the Invention of the Points to the <hi>Masorites</hi>; because he oft differs from them, and opposeth them; but always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Punctuation, and enjoyns all others so to do.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First</hi> then, We are to consider the places themselves, and the scope, and true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>First</hi> is this, taken out of <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>'s Book, <hi>Tsakooth,</hi> pag. 138. col. 2. alledged by <hi>Elias Masoret Hammasoret,</hi> Prefat. 3. pag. <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> 6. The words are these: <hi>And this is the Custom of the wise Men of Tiberias, and they are the Foundation; for from them were the Men of the Masora, and we have from them received all the Punctation.</hi> The place more at large is this: <hi>The Punctators</hi> (saith <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> immediately before the words alledged) <hi>are used to point</hi> Sheva <hi>under Tau, in the word</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, Asit, <hi>which is the Second Person Feminine, that it might not be confounded with the Masculine.</hi> Then he brings an Objection, saying, <hi>If any one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, What need was there to place</hi> Sheva <hi>there? for seeing that</hi> Kamets <hi>was not under the letter</hi> Tau, <hi>was it not easily understood that there was to be a quiescent</hi> Sheva, <hi>because it was the last letter of the word</hi>; (for the last letter of every word that is without its own proper moveable Vowel, <hi>Sheva,</hi> belongs to them, whether it be expressed or not.) Now the Answer to this Objection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the words of the Quotation; viz. <hi>And thus the Wise Men of</hi> Tiberias <hi>have used</hi>; or <hi>thus is their Manner or Custom: And they are the Foundation; for from them were the Men of the</hi> Masora, <hi>and from them have we received all the Punctation.</hi> He goes on further, and saith, <hi>Perhaps they did so, that no Man might think that the Punctator had forgotten,</hi> (that is to Point that <hi>Tau,</hi>) <hi>and doubted about it,</hi> (that is to say, how he should read it.) This is the place at large; we are now to examine the sence and meaning of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First</hi> then, he saith, <hi>That there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Punctators that had a custom to place</hi> Sheva <hi>under</hi> Tau, <hi>at the end of a word.</hi> Then he tells who these were that did use so to do; and they were not all the Punctators, but <hi>those of Tiberias,</hi> the same also who were the <hi>Masorites; Ergo,</hi> there were others who did not use so to do, (though not of the like esteem for Skill herein as the <hi>Masorites.</hi>) Therefore, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He shews what value this <hi>Tiberian</hi> Punctation ought to be of with us; which is by him expressed to be of such worth, as that we ought to follow them in all things, as being the most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the Punctators.</p>
                        <p>What <hi>Capellus</hi> objects here, is, That <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf</hi> translates, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>There are some Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators</hi>: And thence inferrs, there were other Punctators than the <hi>Masorites.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> He doth not translate the word, nor doth he inferr from that word; but what he saith, <hi>There are some Punctators,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the scope of the place; and from the same he draws this Inference, as very well he may; as might easily be plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, were it worth while to enlarge upon the Point. But to proceed:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He shews the End why the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorites</hi> did thus: Which was this, lest the Reader should think that here was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting, and might stick in doubt how it should be read: <hi>Lest</hi> (saith he) <hi>any one should think that the Punctator had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten something.</hi> This certainly he doth not say of the same <hi>Tiberian Masorites,</hi> but of some other former Punctator: For if he had meant the same <hi>Masorites</hi> here, he should have said, <hi>Shelo jakshob Adam ki sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kachu</hi>; That no Man might think that they had forgotten: And not <hi>Shakach</hi>; That He had forgotten. So that <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> did not reckon the <hi>Tiberian Masorites</hi> to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Punctation, but the Correctors and the Preservers thereof in its Original Purity, as we may perceive by the scope of the place.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Second</hi> place, the sence whereof is to be considered, is what <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> saith in his Commentary on <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.31. on the word <gap reason="foreign">

<q>I have seen (saith he) the Books which the Wise Men of <hi>Tiberias</hi> searched, examined, corrected, and swore their fifteen Elders; that they had thrice considered every Word, and every Point, and every word that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten full or defective, and behold, <hi>Iod</hi> is written in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>Teaseh</hi>; but I have not found it so in the Books of <hi>Spain, France,</hi> or beyond the Seas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>'—</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now as to the sence of this place, what is more plainly spoken by these words than this, That they had three times searched or examined the Pointed Copies? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pointed Copies must be in being before their time, which they took and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined others by, and not their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Shapes of the Points examined, as Dr. <hi>Walton</hi> supposeth: <hi>For Aben Ezra</hi> (saith he) <hi>saw the Book which the Tiberian Masorites</hi> Badaku, <hi>searched or examined:</hi> He doth not say, which they <hi>made</hi> or <hi>invented.</hi> Of these Books he saith, they <hi>swore the fifteen Elders; that they had thrice considered every Word, and every Point, and every Word that was written full or defective.</hi> Here we see their Consideration was as much on the Words as the Points; and of the words written full or defective, as either; and they can be no more thought hereby to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Punctation, than of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Words, and of the Words full
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:103507:143"/>
and defective; for as much is said of the one as of the other. If therefore they only searched, examined, or tried the one, they did no more to the other.</p>
                        <p>Again, What is it that <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> found in these Books thus examined by the <hi>Maso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias?</hi> Why it is this, <hi>That the letter</hi> Jod <hi>is there written in the word</hi>

No one will say we can. No more can we suppose it of the Points, not yet so much, seeing the Instance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged is a Letter, and not a Point. So that the only thing that appears by his words, is, That he accounted the Books or Copies which they had examined by the best they had, to be the most exactly corrected, and therefore fittest to be the Standard: And on this account he might well say of them, they were, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>From all which Testimonies, it appears, saith <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> pag. 25. That the Men of <hi>Tiberias</hi> were no otherwise famous among the Jews, who were but Five hundred, or Six hundred years at most after them. Then,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> For their skill at decently reading and pronouncing the <hi>Hebrew Tongue.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> And also for their study and care to preserve the true reading of the Scripture.</p>
                        <p>For if they had believed them to have been the Authors of the Points, doubtless they would not have passed over that with such negligent silence, as not to speak a word about it, when they speak of them, and of their Commendation.</p>
                        <p>Nor can their being praised for Skill und Accuracy in the Punctation, suppose them the Authors of it: For none need be told, that the Inventors of any Art are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their own Invention; and 'tis a slender Encomium to say of such, That they understand ther own Invention: For if they should not well understand their own Device, how should others? or who else should?</p>
                        <p>Of their Skill and Accuracy <hi>Ierom</hi> seems to have knowledge, alluding thereunto on <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.21. and that he hired a <hi>Iew</hi> of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias</hi> to teach him to read: And as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He nor the Rabbins ascribe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the Points to them; so the Pointed Bible of <hi>Hillel,</hi> in being long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time, proves the contrary. And so much for the <hi>Second</hi> thing; that is, What <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> say in Commendation of the Skill and Accuracy of the <hi>Tiberian Masorites,</hi> in the Pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Hebrew Tongue</hi>; and whether what they say of them, doth belong unto them as Authors, or as Correctors of the Punctation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Third thing to be proved, is, That <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> doth not ascribe the Invention of the Points to the <hi>Masorites</hi>; because he often differs from them, and opposeth them, but always follows the Punctation, and enjoyns all others so to do: As may be seen not only in the places before alledged; where he reproves those who charge the Punctator with Errour; and saith, <hi>He hath Pointed right in every place:</hi> And not only in his Comment on <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.5. but also in other places he expresseth the same esteem of the Authority and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Punctation: As for Instance: in his Book <hi>Tsakooth,</hi> pag. 179. where he brings <hi>Hosea</hi> 4.10. <hi>They left off to take heed</hi>; he there saith,
<q>If we should say so, we should thereby accuse <hi>Hammappesik Happesukim</hi> the Punctator, that he did not know the reason of the Accents; but far be it from us so to do: <hi>Chalilah, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah.</hi>
                           </q> And in his Comment on <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.28. where our Translation ends that Verse, as also <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.16. with a Comma, the sence not making a Period:
About which matter he saith,
<q>It is to be admired, that the Orderer of the <hi>Parasha</hi>'s should here divide into two Verses, that which by the sence seems to be but one: And the like is done, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.16. We know not why 'tis done; but (saith he) 'tis like <hi>Baal Hahapesakoth,</hi> the Punctator, did know the reason why he did so; for his Knowledge is larger than ours.—</q>
Hence he adviseth us to follow the Punctator always, as in his Book <hi>Mosenaim,</hi> fol. 19. <hi>b.</hi>
                           <q>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I expound unto thee all these things already mentioned (saith he,) I must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish thee, that thou dost go after <hi>Baal Hataamim,</hi> the Punctator: And whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Exposition is not according to the Exposition of the Accents, do not agree to it, nor hearken to it; and do not mind the words concerning the Ten Verses that one of the <hi>Geonim</hi> saith do belong to the Verses following, or coming after them; for they are all right, and they are distinguished or divided according as the sence requireth.—</q>
And pag. 198. col. 1. disputing against some, he saith,
<q>And moreover, if their words were true, <hi>Lo hajah baal hateamim maphsik beathnak, besoph bemillath vejiphol, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Baal Hateamim,</hi> who is <hi>Hammappesik,</hi> the Punctator, would not have made the Stop or Pause with Athnak in the end in the word <hi>Vejiphol,</hi> Gen. 45.14.— So <hi>pag.</hi> 200. <hi>b.</hi> He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (saith he) the Secret of <hi>Baal Hatea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> the Punctator.— And elsewhere saith <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> He saith 'tis of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to keep the way of the Accents.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now that <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> doth not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Punctator, or Punctators, to be
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103507:144"/>
the <hi>Masorites,</hi> appears by this, That he treats the <hi>Masorites</hi> quite otherwise than he hath done the Punctator.</p>
                        <p>For, <hi>First,</hi> When he speaks of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorites,</hi> he doth not call them, <hi>Baal hatea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi> and <hi>hammappesik,</hi> the Punctator; but he calls them, <hi>The Wise Men of the Masora; The Men of the Masora</hi>; and <hi>Baal Hammasoret,</hi> the <hi>Author of the Masora.</hi> And,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> He often differeth from, and opposeth the <hi>Masorites,</hi> but he never op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the <hi>Punctator.</hi> And that he oft dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the <hi>Masorites,</hi> appears by these Instances.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Tsakooth,</hi> 149. concerning the word <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>Vehinneh hu,</hi> with <hi>Aleph</hi> added: As he reckons by the <hi>Masorites,</hi> he saith, <hi>This is not defective of</hi> Aleph, (that is, wanting <hi>Aleph</hi>;) <hi>for it is one word, though the Men of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sora do say it is defective.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And fol. 150. col. 2. <hi>Ve taam anishee hammasoret eno taam</hi>; And the Reason of the Men of the <hi>Masora,</hi> is no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                        <p>So <hi>fol.</hi> 190. he saith concerning a Maso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick Observation, <hi>Ein tserik</hi>; There is not need of it. And so of others, <hi>fol.</hi> 191.2. <hi>fol</hi> 192.1. and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>In the end of the Preface prefixed to the great Bibles, thus he saith, speaking of the Fifth way of Expounding Scripture, which he followeth himself:
<q>And I will not (saith he) mention the Reasons of the Men of the Masora, why this word is written full, and why the other word is written defective; for all their Reasons are allegorical, their Reasons are only good for Children; for sometimes the Writer writeth a word full, which he doth to make it plain; and sometimes he writeth a word more obscurely, by the defect of a letter, for brevity sake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but their Reasons are only good for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</q>
— So that we see he contemneth and oft opposeth the <hi>Masorites</hi>; but we shewed before, he honoureth, and always followeth the <hi>Punctator</hi>: Therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> doth not suppose the <hi>Masorites</hi> to be the Punctator or Authors of the Punctation.</p>

                           <hi>Capellus Vind.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 1. sect. 10. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth, <hi>There might be two sorts of</hi> Maso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites: <hi>First, the</hi> Tiberian <hi>Punctators; and long after them, those that numbred the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and counted the</hi> Keri Uketib.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> (1.) Neither <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> nor any other <hi>Iew,</hi> make any such distinction. (2.) <hi>A posse ad esse non valet consequentia.</hi> (3.) 'Twould injure the former <hi>Masorites</hi>; for he opposeth and despiseth the <hi>Masorites</hi> in General; and if the Punctators, whom he reverenceth so much, were <hi>Masorites</hi> also, he would no doubt have excepted them particularly. (4.) <hi>Capellus</hi> hath hereby lost his Cause, by supposing the Authors of the Punctation, or Shapes of the Points, were long before those that numbred the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, seeing the <hi>Talmuds,</hi> made before <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. do call those that numbred the Letters, the <hi>Ancients,</hi> as being long before their time; whereas <hi>Capellus</hi> his Opinion, is, That the Authors of the Points were not till after the <hi>Talmuds.</hi>

                           <hi>Capellus Vind. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 12. saith, <hi>If the Masorites restored and corrected the Punctation, our Faith is humane, if built thereon, as much as if they invented it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> Not so: For no more is required to preserve the Text uncorrupt, from Age to Age, than humane Care and Industry, under the conduct of Divine Providence; but the giving forth of the Scripture, and the ascertaining the Sence of Scripture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Divine Assistance, and Evidence of Divine Authority.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Capellus</hi> objects, <hi>sect.</hi> 13. ibid. <hi>Vind. The Masorites had few Pointed Copies to correct by, or many: If few, how came they to differ? And if many, they were either about great Matters, or small: If about great Matters, then we stand on Humane Authority; if about small, then 'twas not worth their labour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> (1.) Themselves say nothing can be certainly spoken of those Times, by reason of the darkness of the History there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and therefore they should not press us in this Point. (2.) How many Pointed Copies were then, we matter not; but that there were very great and many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the Copies, we deny; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God watching over his Word, to preserve it to the end of Time: The Superstitious care of the Jews, and the Religious Care of the Christians, would not consist with it; but some small diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence might be suffered, to quicken the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of those whose duty and concern it was to preserve it; which might be well worth their time to Correct, and justly deserve the Praise of Posterity for the same.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Capellus</hi> objecteth, <hi>They must destroy all other Copies besides that which they corrected; and this was impossible to be done.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> No more need for this, than for to burn Hereticks, and destroy all that differ from us: No, Truth is Light, the shining whereof dispelleth Darkness; and so is their Copy universally embraced as the Standard.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Capellus, Vind. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 17. saith, <hi>How know we that the Masorites did correct the Copies, seeing there is no History of it? And if they did correct them,</hi> (2.) <hi>It might be fallacious, and stuffed with many things in favour of their own Nation.</hi> (3.) <hi>Who can believe that these Men chose the best and most genuine sence always, and never mistook, either by Errour, Negligence or Design?</hi> (4.) <hi>Who can believe that our present Copies are the same as those which the Masorites corrected?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> They most need to Answer these Questions themselves, who say they are the Authours of the Punctation: We allow them no more than to be Examiners or Correctors of it; which their superstitious
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103507:144"/>
Care of the Text, and the general Esteem of the Jews of those <hi>Masorites,</hi> is enough to evidence the Truth of, as much as we need to lean on them for. But how do they solve these Doubts? Why, they say the Punctation yields generally a genuine and right Sence. If therefore this be strong enough to satisfie those who make them the Authors of the Punctation, that they were able and faithful in Point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Text; much more may it be a sufficient Satisfaction to those who allow them no further hand about the Punctation, than barely to examine the Copies, and follow the most and best Approved in their time. These are the faint Efforts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons engaged in a desperate Cause.</p>
                        <p>And thus we have proved at large, that <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> is not of the Opinion that the <hi>Masorites</hi> Pointed the Text; and all that he saith about the Points, and the Punctation, proves the contrary: As also all that <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> and the other Rabbins, say in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Skill and Accuracy of the <hi>Tiberian Masorites,</hi> proves no more than that they were skilful and faithful Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors, or Collaters and Examiners of the Copies of their time; and doth not at all belong to them as Authors, or Inventors of the Punctation.</p>
                        <p>We are nextly to consider what other Rabbins, <hi>Elias</hi> and his Followers, bring to countenance their Opinion; though not one of the places they alledge speak one word about the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> much less of their being the Inventors of the Punctation.</p>

                              </gap> 2. <hi>col.</hi> 2. saith,
<q>Thus saith the Author of <hi>Cosri,</hi> Without doubt it was kept in their Hearts, (that is, the Points from the time of <hi>Moses</hi> was,) with <hi>Pathak,</hi> and <hi>Kamets,</hi> and <hi>Sheva,</hi> and <hi>Chirek,</hi> and the Accents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they put seven Kings and Accents, which were Signs to express those Sounds which they had received of <hi>Moses</hi> from <hi>Sinai.</hi> And what thinkest thou of their ordering the Scripture first with Verses, and after that with Points, and then with Accents, and then with the Masora, with the Observation of the Words that are full or defective, until they had numbred the Letters? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now, <hi>Quid sibi vult Elias?</hi> What doth <hi>Elias</hi> infer from hence? Why saith he, <hi>Behold, it was not his mind that</hi> Moses <hi>wrote them.</hi> We grant it: What then? Why saith <hi>Elias,</hi>
                              <q>Oh that the Author of <hi>Cosri</hi> had explained to us who he meant, when he saith, <hi>Vesamu!</hi> and <hi>they</hi> put, or placed them (<hi>viz.</hi> the Points,) whether he meant the Men of the <hi>Great Synagogue,</hi> or the <hi>Masorites!</hi> But I think he meant the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorites,</hi> saith <hi>Elias.</hi>
                              </q>
But why he thinks so, he says not. Well, be it so, the Jews think otherwise: And We think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that he meant the Men of the <hi>Great Synagogue,</hi> both by the sence of the place in <hi>Cosri,</hi> and by the Exposition of <hi>Muscatus</hi> upon the place.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>First,</hi> As to the sence of the place, the Author of <hi>Cosri</hi> saith in the place alledged,
<q>That the Punctation was certainly made by Men divinely assisted, or it had never been so universally received as it is, and else Men of like ability might be able to do the like: And it was done (saith he) with admirable Wisdom; for it appears that in the fixing of the Points and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, there is such an Order therein, that cannot be done but by Divine As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance; which is far otherwise than our Wisdom can attain unto, in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now all the Jews acknowledge that none have been Divinely Inspired, and Infallibly Assisted, since the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie ceased: And therefore <hi>Cosri</hi> must needs mean the time of <hi>Ezra</hi> by <hi>Vesamu, And they put them.</hi> And Secondly, so <hi>R. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah Muscatus,</hi> upon the place, <hi>Vesamu, And they put them,</hi> doth expound it, where he saith,
<q>It appeareth to me, that by this indefinite Speech, he meaneth the Men of the <hi>Great Synagogue</hi>; for unto that time the Antecedents and Consequents, or what is spoken before it and after it, doth agree.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>And thus we see the Father-in-Law, <hi>Cosri,</hi> is of the same mind with his Son-in-Law, <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> that the Points were as ancient as <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>First,</hi> then, we say, If the Punctation were invented and placed, <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. or since to the Text, by the Jews, as they say it was, then without doubt the Jews would have frequently taken notice of it, being a thing so much for their Honour.</p>
                           <p>But there is not one <hi>Iew</hi> that taketh any notice of it, <hi>Elias</hi> only excepted; and all those he alledgeth, appear to be silent in the Case.</p>
                           <p>Therefore the Points were not invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and placed to the Text by the Jews, <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. or since that time.</p>
                           <p>This Argument they cannot refuse, seeing it is of the same kind with what they rely most upon: For they say, if the Points were before <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. then certainly the <hi>Talmudick Iews</hi> would have taken notice of it; and therefore we may well say, if the Points were since <hi>A. D.</hi> 500, the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jews must needs have taken notice of it; which they have not done, though the Commentators and Grammarians had better ability, and more frequent occasion so to do, than the <hi>Talmudists</hi> had of <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>a</hi>'s Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation.</p>
                           <p>Again, We will not believe the Points were placed by the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias, A. D.</hi> 500. or since that time; because the Evidence thereof is insufficient, and mute. For,</p>
                           <p>That Opinion doth not deserve to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, the Evidences whereon it is built be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing destroyed, and discovered to be insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and totally silent in the case.</p>
                           <p>But such is the Opinion, That the Points were Invented by the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> A. D. 500. For all the Evidence that <hi>Elias</hi> and his Followers bring to prove the Time, Place and Persons, when, where, and by whom the Points were invented, is no more than a few Expressions of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi> in Commendation of the Skill and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy of the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>And thus have we finished the First thing that we undertook to discuss; having at large examined the Evidences that are brought for the Novelty of the Points, and proved them to be against their late and Novel Invention.</p>

                        <p>WE are now to prove, That it is very unlikely the Punctation was invented and placed to the Text by the Jewish <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias, A. D.</hi> 500. which may be made to appear from several Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>FIRST,</hi> From the several Circumstances of that People of the Jews, at and before <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. in the Land of <hi>Iudeah,</hi> which render them very unfit for such an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, then and there, as the Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is.</p>
                        <p>Now these Circumstances relate to the state, either, (1.) Of their Learning, and its decrease at that time, as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes it in his <hi>Tiberias.</hi> Or, (2.) Of their Civil and Temporal Calamities, at and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> relates them. Vid. <hi>Considerations,</hi> pag. 224.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> As to the state wherein their Jewish Learning stood at that time, it was briefly this:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> The Jewish Historians have kept the Succession of their Learned Men for a Thousand Years, from the time of our Saviour; and by their Account, as well as all other History of those Times, there remained neither Learning, nor Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men of any Eminency, in <hi>Iudeah,</hi> any longer than <hi>A. D.</hi> 340, or thereabouts; for about the Year of Christ, 340. in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>R. Hillel,</hi> ceased the Promotion to the Dignity of <hi>Rabbi</hi> in the Land of <hi>Israel, Tsemach David,</hi> fol. 47. And if the Dignity ceased, 'tis unlikely the Profession should flourish any longer; and from that time and onward they give us an Account of their Learning and Learned Men in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Seeing the Jewish Writers have been so carefull to preserve the History of the <hi>Mishna,</hi> of the <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Babylon Talmuds,</hi> it is very unlikely they should pass over so great and glorious an Invention as was this of the Authors of the Punctation, in so deep silence, had there been any such. And the rather, because,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Jews flourished at that time in <hi>Babylon,</hi> whilst those of <hi>Palestine</hi> were
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103507:146"/>
very low; and therefore 'tis most impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to imagine that the Wealthy and Famous <hi>Babylonian</hi> Jews should leave the eternal Praise of this Work to the poor Jews of <hi>Tiberias</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ly. And that because,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Jews <hi>Talmud</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> hath not only obscured, but even extinguished that of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; so that the Jews, to this day, are governed by the <hi>Babylonian Talmud.</hi> It is therefore very unlikely that any such <hi>Masoretick</hi> Curiosity as might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige all their Nation, should not have the Honour drawn to those of <hi>Babylon</hi> also.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is very unlikely, that what required the Approbation of the whole Nation, should be so silently imposed on them all by some Men of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> at such a time, when for that present, and many hundred years after, the flourishing Schools of the Jews were at <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Elias Levita</hi> confesseth the <hi>Masorites</hi> were of divers Ages, as in pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>3. <hi>And the truth is, the Masorites were Hundreds, and Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, for many years, one Generation after another; and we know not the time of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, nor the time of their ending.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>How likely then is it to be, that those of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> A. D. 500. must invent and place all the Punctation; when all he brings to prove it, is no more than this, That some <hi>Rabbins</hi> commend the Skill and Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias</hi>; but proves not what time those <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias</hi> lived in, whether <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. or before.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the state of the Jewish Nation, with respect to their Calamities, at and before <hi>A.

                        <p>Now these are briefly the Scenes of their Misery, before <hi>A. D.</hi> 500.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> From <hi>A.D.</hi> 68. until <hi>A.D.</hi> 72. were hundreds of thousands of Jews destroyed, as the Translator of <hi>Eusebius</hi> reckons up out of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> (<hi>Euseb. Hist.</hi> lib. 3. cap. 8.) And that the Captives, at the taking of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were Ninety seven thousand. And the number of all that died during the Siege within <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were Ten hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. (Vid. <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s <hi>Wars,</hi> lib. 7. cap. 17.)</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Scene of Misery was under <hi>Adrian, A. D.</hi> 136. (<hi>Euseb. Chron. ad Ann.</hi> 136.)</p>
                        <p>Of this <hi>Euseb. Hist.</hi> lib. 4. cap. 6. saith,
<q>When the Jewish Rebellion waxed vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and grievous, <hi>Ruffus,</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>Iudeah,</hi> being sent with a great Power from the Emperour, forthwith slew an innumerable multitude of Men, Women and Children, destroying their Regions and Countreys.</q>
(<hi>With a Destruction,</hi> saith Dr. <hi>Owen, seeming equal to that of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>under</hi> Titus Vespasianus.)</p>
                        <p>This was most violent at the City <hi>Bitter,</hi> not far from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and belonging to it; which when taken, and <hi>Barchocheba</hi> their Seducer destroyed,
<q>This whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (says <hi>Eusebius</hi>) was banished, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the whole Countrey of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> by the Laws, Decrees and Appointment of <hi>Adrian:</hi> So that by his Commandment it was not lawful for these silly Souls to behold their Native Soyl; no, not afar off, from the top of an Hill. This City (viz. <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>) then, to the utter Ruine of the Jewish Nation, and the manifold Overthrow of the ancient Inhabitants, being brought to Confusion, began to be inhabited of strange Nations; and after that it was subdued to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the Name was quite changed; for unto the Honour of the Conquerour <hi>Elias Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> it was called <hi>Elia.</hi>
                           </q>
By this Second Desolation, (as Dr. <hi>I. O.</hi> observes) <hi>they were brought very low, made weak and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible; unspeakably diminished in their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and driven into obscurity all the World over.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Now (saith Dr. <hi>I. O.</hi> pag. 224.) that there was formerly a School, and Learned Men at <hi>Tiberias,</hi> is granted; <hi>Ierom</hi> hired one Learned from thence: But that they continued there in any Esteem, Number, or Reputation, unto the time designed by our Authors for this Work, is not made to appear from any History of Jews or Christians: Yea, it is certain, that about the time mentioned, the chiefest flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Jewish Doctors was at <hi>Babylon,</hi> and some other Cities in the <hi>East,</hi> where they had newly compleated their <hi>Talmud,</hi> the Great <hi>Pandect</hi> of the Jewish Laws, as themselves every where declare. That any Persons considerably learned were then in <hi>Tiberias,</hi> is a meer Conjecture; and it is most improbable, considering what Destruction had been made of them at <hi>Diocaesaria</hi> and <hi>Tiberias,</hi> about the Year of Christ 352. by <hi>Gallus,</hi> at the Command of <hi>Constantius,</hi> (<hi>Socrates Scholasticus,</hi> lib. 2. cap. 27.) by whom the Jews were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in Battel, and the City <hi>Diocaesaria</hi> laid level with the Ground. Now that there should, after all these Destructions of the Jews, be such a Collection of them, so Learned, so Authorized, as to invent this Work, and impose it on all the World, no Man once taking notice that any such Persons ever were, is beyond all belief, <hi>pag.</hi> 224.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Object. 1. <hi>Capellus</hi> answereth, First, <hi>He is not precise, when, where, and by whom the Points were invented.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> Then he should not insist on those words of <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> [<hi>From them we have all the Punctation</hi>;] nor should he so oft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for it, and suppose it proved.</p>
                        <p>Object. 2. <hi>Capellus</hi> saith, <hi>They might come from all Parts to</hi> Tiberias.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> This is said, without and against all History or Testimony of those Times.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But the Argument is, That so Noble a Work is not mentioned in History: And he does not attempt to prove it is.</p>

                           <hi>Resp.</hi> But how could the private Work of one <hi>Rabbi</hi> be forthwith embraced by all the World that receive the Scriptures? And placed through all Bibles, and yet no notice taken of the Author in the History of those Times?</p>
                        <p>Object. 4. <hi>But there were Schools at</hi> Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, <hi>A. D.</hi> 374.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. And yet there might be none by <hi>A. D.</hi> 500.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And if there were Schools then, yet no History saith they pointed the Bible.</p>
                        <p>Object. 5. Jerom <hi>hired a</hi> Jew <hi>from</hi> Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, <hi>learned in the Tongue, who died</hi> A. D. 400.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. There might be a learned Jew there, and yet no School there.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There might be a School, <hi>A. D.</hi> 400. and yet none <hi>A. D.</hi> 500.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Or if there were a School, still they might not be in a condition to be able to Point the Bible.</p>
                        <p>Object. 6. <hi>Iewish Histories are late, fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and to be suspected.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> Unless they are for <hi>Capellus</hi>: But what's this to the Point? We say there's no History takes any notice of these things, and they are the Dreams of <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Capel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>; which we have no reason to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, were the Jewish History worse than it is.</p>
                        <p>Object. 7. <hi>Why was there no History of the</hi> Tiberian Masorites <hi>Reforming or Correcting the Punctation, as well as of their being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. There was more need to have the Authors who <hi>de novo</hi> Pointed all the Bible, to be very well known and approved too, before their Work was universally received, than there was need of having those who did only Collate and Compare the Copies that were received, to be so much known. But,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is notice taken of the Skill and Accuracy of the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias,</hi> about the Correcting the Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though there be none about their being Authors of the Punctation; as was observed from the Testimony of <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> and Others.</p>
                        <p>Object. 8. <hi>'Tis not strange, that the first Inventors of Noble Arts have been unknown; as the Vse of the Load-stone, the</hi> Mariners-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, Bells, Guns, Printing; <hi>the</hi> Greek Accents; <hi>the</hi> Stops, <hi>such as</hi> Comma, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, <hi>&amp;c. the</hi> New Greek <hi>and</hi> Latin Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>&amp;c..</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> 1<hi>st.</hi> Our Wonder is not barely, That the Author of this Noble Work of the Punctation is unknown: But our Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, That if they were known to be the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> A. D. 500. as <hi>Elias</hi> saith they were, that all the World should receive it from them, and yet no History give any Account of them. And,</p>
                        <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> If, as <hi>Capellus</hi> fancieth, it were 500 Years in composing, 'tis the more a Wonder, that none of these Artists, for Five hundred Years successively, should be taken notice of, and yet their Work uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally received, as they did compleat it gradatim.</p>
                        <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> His Instances are not to our Point; for our Reasons do principally shew who they were not, rather than who they were: And our Arguments tend to shew, that whoever invented them, whether the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were known or unknown, 'tis very unlikely that the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias, A. D.</hi> 500. were the Authors.</p>
                        <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> Men are more ready to receive a Gift in the dark, than they are to Obey, without knowing who Commands them, and what is Commanded them: The Arts instanced in, are of real profit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and who refuseth their Profit till they know the Author? Nay, many are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, as to forget their Master, and would be thought to be the Authors of what they have learnt from Others: But the Punctation renders the Scripture to be a Law, a Rule of Obedience; and all Men will know who commands them, before they will obey; and will see what 'tis they are commanded too.</p>
                        <p>Object. 9. <hi>Capellus</hi> saith, <hi>The Vsefulness of it might introduce it.</hi>

                           <hi>Resp.</hi> Then were the Jews better than <hi>Capellus</hi> would have had them; for he wants to be rid of it, that he may have room for his Critical Amendments of the Text: However, it remains very improbable, that it was Invented at the time and place assigned for it, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <head>CHAP. VIII. The Improbability of the Persons to whom the Invention of the Points is assigned, manifested from several Considerations.

                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi>
                           <q>Men they were, (if any such were, saith Dr. <hi>I. O.</hi>) who had not the Word of God committed to them in a peculiar manner, as their Fore-Fathers had of old, being no part of his Church or People; but were only outwardly Possessors of the Letter, without just Right or Title to it: utterly uninte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested in the Promise of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit, which is the Great Charter of the Churches Preservation of Truth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.21.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                           <q>Men so remote from a right understanding of the Word or Mind of God therein, that they were desperately engaged to oppose his Truth, in the Pooks which themselves enjoyed in all Matters of Importance, unto the Glory of God, from the beginning to the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The Foundation of whose Religion was Infidelity, and one of their chief Fundamentals an Opposition to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                           <q>Men under the special Curse of God, and his Vengeance, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Blood of his dear Son.</q>

                        <p>

                           <q>Men all their days feeding themselves with vain Fables, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Devices against the Gospel, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to set up a New Religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of the Old, in despite of God.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
                           <q>Men of a profound Ignorance in all manner of Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but only what concerned their own Dunghil Traditions; as appears in their Stories, wherein they make <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> help <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> against <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; with innumerable the like Fopperies</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>

                           <q>Men so addicted to such mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Figments, as appears in their <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muds,</hi> as their Successors of after Ages are ashamed of, and seek to palliate what they are able; yea, for the most part, Idolaters and Magicians.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And to the same purpose, Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> in his <hi>Cent. Chorograph.</hi> (speaking of this Opinion, That the <hi>Masorites</hi> pointed the Text,) saith,
<q>I do not admire the Jews Impudence, who found out that Fable; I admire Christians Credulity, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud it: Recount, I pray, the Names of the <hi>Tiberians,</hi> from the first Foundation of a University there, to the Expiring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and what do you find but a sort of Men, being mad with, or above the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi> bewitching and bewitched with Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Blind, Crafty Raging; Pardon me if I say Magical and Monstrous? What Fools, what Sots, as to such a Divine Work! Read over the <hi>Talmud</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: Consider how <hi>R. Iudah, R. Chanina, R. Chajia, Bar, Ba, R. Iochanan, R. Ionathan,</hi> and the rest of the great Doctors among the <hi>Tiberians,</hi> do behave themselves: How seriously they do of nothing? How childish they are in serious things? How much Deceitfulness, Froth Venom, Smoak, nothing in their Disputations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you can believe the Points of the Bible to proceed from such a School, believe also all their <hi>Talmuds:</hi> The Pointing of the Bible savours of the Work of the Holy Spirit, not of Wicked, Blind, and Mad Men.</q>
— Thus far Dr. <hi>Lightfoot.</hi> This Account is full and sufficient at present; we shall only consider the Exceptions to this Argument.</p>
                        <p>Object. Tis said, <hi>They do not ascribe the Punctation to the</hi> Masorites, <hi>but only suppose they placed the Shapes of the Points,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they had received the true Sound of all the Punctation, by Tradition, Vse and Custom, by which they might have been able to Point it truly.</hi> (Vid. <hi>Considerator Considered,</hi> pag. 200, 206, 207, 210, 211, 212.)</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> (1.) We have briefly shewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in our <hi>PROEMIVM,</hi> that this was impossible to be done; for multitudes of the Shapes are not distinguished by the Sounds at all.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) No memory of Man can once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or take up so much as the very Anomalies of the Punctation: How much less all the Pauses, and the whole Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And how could all this be kept, from Age to Age, without Points, when now we have Points, no one is able to Point the Bible without a Copy? The <hi>Rabbins</hi> acknowledge they have lost the knowledge of the sence and meaning of many words in the Bible, in that time; and how was it possible they could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the true Sound of every Point in the Bible, when they had so lost their Tongue, and the true Sence and Meaning of many words in it?</p>
                        <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> We Answer them out of their own Objections: For they say,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>LXX.</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase, read otherwise than we or the <hi>Masorites</hi> do read; which they do not, as to the Shape, but the Sound of the Points, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and hence conclude the Points were not in their time.</p>
                        <p>Now we may better conclude from hence, that the Sounds which the <hi>Masorites</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Punctation, were not in the time of the <hi>LXX.</hi> or the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase</hi>; but since their time they are very greatly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                        <p>Again: When <hi>Buxtorf</hi> says, as to the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase,</hi>
                           <q>That that on the Law, agrees well with our Punctation; but those on the Prophets, go off most from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Punctation:</q>

                           <hi>Capellus</hi> replyes, <hi>The Reason of that might be, because,</hi> First, <hi>They were more used to read the Law, and it was written plainer; but it was more difficult to understand, and so rightly to sound, the words of the Prophets being more dark.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> But if the true Sound had been kept, there had been no difference; and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103507:147"/>
yet we see the present Punctation does all alike true; but if through such diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the Prophets they had missed the right Pronunciation, and lost it in many places by that time, it was then impossible it should be preserved to the time of the <hi>Masorites,</hi> so pure and entire as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                        <p>In vain therefore is the Succession of their Learned Men alledged, and that the Bible was constantly read by them: For 'tis known, the Language had ceased to be vulgarly spoken or understood for a Thousand Years; the <hi>LXX, &amp;c.</hi> (as themselves say) had lost the Pronunciation long before. The Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men of each Countrey differed from each other in the Sound of Vowels and Letters too, as those of <hi>Galilee, &amp;c.</hi> in Christ's time: And we see, where a Language is vulgar, the Pronunciation and Sound used in one Age and County, differs from that of another, as here in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. And so in <hi>Scotland,</hi> though the <hi>Scots</hi> do read our <hi>English</hi> Bible, yet they give it a very different Tone or Sound than we do; how much more when a Language is lost, the first part of it that departs, is the Tone or Sound: It is fabulous therefore to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that that part should continue longest, which always is gone first; and to suppose that a few Priests, that esteemed the <hi>Mishna</hi> above the <hi>Bible,</hi> should or could preserve the true Sound of the Text for a Thousand Years; when nothing is more unconstant in all Nations, than the sameness of sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Vowels, and wherein every Age and County makes an Alteration.</p>
                        <p>So that after all these Evasions, if the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorites</hi> invented the Shapes of the Points, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Sounds could have no better Original than the Shapes have, or their variable Custom, which is equivalent; and the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation it self, on that account, could have no better Foundation than their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Which how unfit they were for such a Work, and how unsuitable the Work it self (to wit, the <hi>Punctation</hi>) is to such Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, let all Men judge.</p>

                        <p>Now these <hi>Masorites</hi> are the Authors of the <hi>Masora,</hi> or the <hi>Masoretick</hi> Notes and Observations on the Text of the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi>; which is their Work, and all that is left concerning them whereby they may be known; so that such as this their Work is, such are they themselves; and no otherwise can we conjecture of or concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, but only according to and by this their Work, the <hi>Masora.</hi>

                        <p>Our <hi>Second Reason</hi> therefore, for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability of the Persons to whom the Invention of the Points is assigned, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Consideration of the Nature of the <hi>Masora,</hi> which is their Work; and the Design of their Masoretick Observations on the Text of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> compared with the Punctation, and the attempt of intruding the same upon the Scripture; and this in General we say, and shall prove by an Induction of particular Instances throughout all the Parts of the <hi>Masora.</hi>

                        <p>That the <hi>Masora,</hi> and all the Parts of it, consists only of Critical Notes or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations about the Text of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the Form of writing the same as they had found it received by the Jews in their time, with this single end or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, That no Persons whatsoever in time to come, should presume to make the least Alteration of the Text, on any Pretence, or for any Reason whatever: (And hence the <hi>Masora</hi> is said to be <hi>Sig Letorah,</hi> An Hedge to the Law:) And this shall be made appear by Instances throughout all the Parts of the <hi>Masora.</hi> On the other hand, the Punctation determins the sence of all the Scripture; it speaks what that makes it say, and nothing else: This might be placed by <hi>Ezra</hi> well enough, while the right Sound was known, and Men divinely inspired were among them: But for the <hi>Post-Talmudick Masorites</hi> to presume to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the Shapes of innumerable signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Points upon the Text, thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the sence of every word in the Bible, is a thing more contrary and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the whole Nature and only Design of all the <hi>Masora,</hi> and of all their <hi>Masore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Notes, than ever was done: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; it is altogether improbable that the <hi>Masorit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>AS the <hi>Masorites</hi> consider the Text, as to the Verses of it; so they consider it with respect to the words of it likewise. And their Observations herein also are only about what they found the Text <hi>de facto</hi> to be, with design to preserve it from any Alteration in time to come; which appears by a view of the several sorts or kinds of Observations about the words of the Text of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first sort of Observations about the words of the Text, is concerning their genuine and true Writing and Reading, called <hi>Keri,</hi> and <hi>Ketib:</hi> These <hi>Elias</hi> reckons in all to be 848; <hi>viz.</hi> 65 in the Law, 454 in the Prophets, and 229 in the Hagio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy.

                        <p>The Antiquity of these <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib</hi> are not only expresly owned to be as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, by <hi>R.D.

                        <p>Now these <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib, Elias Levita</hi> hath divided into Seven Sorts or Kinds, as the <hi>Masorites</hi> have summed them up, and noted how they found them, that they might not be alter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Now these Unpointed Letters they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>either made so, or found them so: If them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves made them so, their Notes thereon were very silly, and would not have been valued by any without Reasons alledged for the same, having Pointed all the rest: And if they found them so written, as no doubt but they did, then the Points were in being before their time.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, had they ventured to Point all the <hi>Bible,</hi> they would never have scrupled either to have Pointed these individual Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or have left them out of the Text.

                        <p>And this <hi>Keri u lo Ketib,</hi> and <hi>Ketib u lo Keri,</hi> is not only owned by <hi>Elias</hi> himself to be as ancient as <hi>Ezra</hi>; but the <hi>Talmud</hi> it self saith of it, That it was of <hi>Moses</hi> from <hi>Sinai</hi>: that is, of Divine Original, and thereby as Ancient as <hi>Ezra</hi>; and therefore the Points whereby alone it is preserved, must be as Ancient likewise.</p>

                        <p>Now 'tis very improbable that these Men, who dare not leave out an Immodest word, when there is one Modest in the place of it of the same Antiquity; nor make the least Omission of any one useless letter that they found in a former Copy, and yet cannot tell what it signifies to retain it: It is, I say, very Improbable, that these very Men should dare to Invent and Intrude all the Shapes of the Points, Vowels and Accents, upon the Text of Scripture, whose business is to observe every little difference of a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or word; and to preserve the same, that no Alteration might be made in time to come.</p>
                        <p>Again, <hi>Elias</hi> himself, in <hi>Masor. Hammas. Pref.</hi> 3. owns the <hi>Keri u Ketib</hi> to be as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as <hi>Ezra.</hi> So doth <hi>Kimchi</hi> in Pref. on <hi>Ioshua</hi>; and <hi>Abarbinel</hi> on <hi>Ieremiah:</hi> And

the Eight hundred forty eight words are preserved by the help of the Points, as <hi>Kimchi</hi> Pref. on <hi>Ioshua</hi> observeth; for the Points under the word in the Line, are not its own, but do belong to the word in the Margin; so that without the Points the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib</hi> could not be preserved, but it is preserved as we see: Therefore the Points were as ancient as the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> seeing the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib</hi> which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, is so ancient. And so <hi>Kimchi</hi> on <hi>Ioshua</hi> says, that <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the Men of the <hi>Great Synagogue,</hi> put the <hi>Keri</hi> in the Margin and did not Point it to distinguish it thereby from the word in the line: And as <hi>R.

                        <p>THE <hi>Second</hi> sort of <hi>Masoretick</hi> Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon the words of the Text, is about the words that are written Full or Defective; the Original whereof, <hi>Elias</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in <hi>Pref.</hi> 3. with the rest of the Jews, owneth to the Divine, and thereby as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as <hi>Ezra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Nature of these words <hi>Elias</hi> describes in <hi>Masoret Hammasoret Dibbur Haroshon,</hi> 1. As also doth <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> in his <hi>Tiberias</hi> from him; which is this:
<q>Know (saith <hi>Elias,</hi> that the chief and most of those words which the <hi>Masorites</hi> observe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that they are Defective or Full, they are most commonly such words that have <hi>Vau</hi> or <hi>Iod</hi> quiescent in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a word; that is, <hi>Vau</hi> after <hi>Holem</hi> or <hi>Shurek,</hi> and <hi>Iod</hi> after <hi>Chirek</hi> or <hi>Tsere</hi>; and 'tis but a few that they observe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective with <hi>Aleph</hi> or <hi>He</hi>: And (saith <hi>Elias</hi>) I will begin with those that are defective, or wanting <hi>Vau</hi> with <hi>Holem,</hi> which are many: Now know (saith he,) that most of the <hi>Holems</hi> in Scripture want <hi>Vau</hi>; but yet they do not observe of every <hi>Holem</hi> in Scripture that is without <hi>Vau,</hi> that it is defective; nor yet of every <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> that is with <hi>Vau,</hi> do they say it is full: Only those words whose manner is to have <hi>Holem</hi> with <hi>Vau</hi> most commonly, when they come at any time without <hi>Vau,</hi> then they observe concerning them, that such a word is defective: And so likewise those words whose manner is to have <hi>Holem</hi> come most commonly without <hi>Vau,</hi> then whenever such a word cometh with <hi>Vau,</hi> they observe concerning such a word, that it is written full: So that (saith <hi>Elias</hi>) this is a Rule, That only those words which are for the most part written full, they only are said by them to be defective, when they are written defective: And on the other hand, Only those words that for the most part are written defective, when they are written full, concerning them, only it is, That the <hi>Masorites</hi> observe that such a word is written full.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now of these <hi>Meleim ve Chaserim,</hi> or words written ful or defective, the <hi>Maso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> make innumerable Observations; for they note them where-ever they meet them, which is almost every where. Now what had it been for them to have made them all full or defective, had they Pointed the Text? But they religiously note every place where a word that is usually written full, that is, where the Vowel Letter is added to the Point most commonly, if that word be ever written without the Vowel Letter, they observe concerning it, that it is defective; but dare not make it full, by adding to it the Vowel Letter, though they know it is so written most commonly. Now can any one imagine that these Men did venture to place the whole Punctation, who durst nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add nor yet omit one single Vowel Letter, where the Use of the word shews it should be added or omitted?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Third</hi> sort of <hi>Masoretick</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations upon the words of the Text, is about the words that are called <hi>Ittur sophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim seu ablatio scribarum,</hi> or, What the Scribes have taken away, the Antiquity whereof the <hi>Talmud</hi> it self owneth to be of Divine Original, and <hi>Elias</hi> doth not deny it so to be. Now these <hi>Ittur So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherim</hi> are five words that might seem as to the sence to have required the letter <hi>Vau</hi> to signifie <hi>And</hi> at the beginning of them; but being written without them, are to be read without them. Of these the <hi>final Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sora</hi> on <hi>Ittur</hi> under <hi>Ain</hi> mention four, and direct to <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.6. where they are reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up; <hi>viz.</hi> (1) <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.5. (2) <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.55. (3) <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.14. (4) <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.6. (5) <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.26. Vid. <hi>R. Chaim.</hi> in <hi>Pref.</hi> on the Bible.</p>
                        <p>Now can any think that these are the Men who made so bold with the Text, as to Point all the Scripture of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and yet did not venture to put a <hi>Vau,</hi> one Vowel Letter, where the sence seemed to require it; and observed these places, that none might presume to add or alter a Vowel Letter upon their own Judgment, even there where they thought the sence did require it so to be.</p>

                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Fourth sort of Masoretick Observations upon the words of the Text, is about the Eighteen places Transposed, called <hi>Tikkun sopherim seu correctio scribarum</hi>; or, The Amendments of the Scribes; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called by <hi>Aben Ezra, Tikkun Ezra,</hi> The Amendments made by <hi>Ezra</hi>: For <hi>Elias,</hi> the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and the <hi>Iews,</hi> generally own their Divine Original; only <hi>Aben Ezra, Iarchi,</hi> &amp;c. sometimes say there was no <hi>Tikkun</hi>; but the Text always was as now it is, and the <hi>Masorites</hi> curse any that dare alter these places, which they reckon up round the beginning of <hi>Numbers.</hi> (1) <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.22. (2) <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.15. (3) <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.12. (4) <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.11. (5) 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13. (6) 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.12. (7) <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.7.

(14) <hi>Iob</hi> 32.3. (15) <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.20. (16) <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.20. Of these the <hi>Masorites</hi> say, on <hi>Numbers,</hi> cap. 1. A Curse shall come upon every one that writes an Accusation against these <hi>Tik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kum Sopherim.</hi> And if so, what must they have expected would have befallen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, had they intruded the whole Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, who esteemed the least part of Scripture to be so compleat and sacred.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There are other sorts of <hi>Maso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick</hi> Observations upon the words of the Text; which manifest likewise that the Authors of such Notes were very unlikely to be the Inventors of the Points and Verses: Such as these:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They note the Place or Position of words, as they are found in the beginning or end of a Verse: As in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. they say <hi>Vehaarets,</hi> and the <hi>Earth,</hi> is eight times at the beginning of a Verse, and the eight places are there collected: But if they had made the Verses, they'd never have made such Notes on their own Invention; for they had other work to do, and 'twas their own Fancy to have them eight times at the beginning, if they made the Verses.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They observe also when a Verb is used with one certain Noun, or Preposition, and how often; as how often <hi>Amar, said,</hi> is joyned with the words <hi>El Elohim, unto God,</hi> which they found to be nine times: so the Verb <hi>Iareh,</hi> to <hi>fear,</hi> is seven times joyned with <hi>Eth Elohim, the Lord,</hi> as they observe on <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.18. Certainly the Authors of the Punctation had somewhat else to do, than make such Notes.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They observe the signification of the ambiguity of a word, as to its various sences on <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Gnaleh,</hi> a <hi>Leaf</hi>; the <hi>Masora</hi> there saith it is six times used to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a <hi>Leaf.</hi> And why might it not have been six score times in that sence, had they so Pointed it? For it is fixed by the Points to the several sences wherein it is used; for <hi>Gnaleh</hi> in other places so Pointed, signifieth to <hi>Ascend</hi>; and if in six places they found it so pointed, and yet signified a <hi>Leaf,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Text must be pointed before such Notes could be made; or they would have made some difference in the Points of <hi>Gnaleh</hi> to <hi>Ascend,</hi> and <hi>Gnaleh</hi> a <hi>Leaf,</hi> had they Pointed the Text.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Sixthly</hi> The <hi>Masorites</hi> make many Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures about the truest Forms of words that seem to be irregular; which they call <hi>Sibbirim,</hi> or <hi>Conjectures</hi>; that is, about words that do seem at first view, that they might more conveniently be written otherwise than they are, as to the sence of the place, or usual form of the words; as on <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.23. the <hi>Masorites</hi> say there are three places where they think <hi>Iatsa</hi> is used in the Masculine Gender, when by Grammar-rule it should have been used in the Feminine, being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a word Feminine; and of this kind are many such, to restrain Persons from altering the least letter of the Text, upon never so great appearance of its being more agreeing to the Nature or Manner of the Language so to be, or Use of the words in Construction with it. Now if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their admirable Skill in the Nature and Use of the Language, they did not dare to alter one Letter or Point, where they thought the Nature and Use of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage required they should; who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they would venture to place all the Punctation? And so much for the <hi>Masore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Notes on the words of the Text.</p>

                        <p>THe <hi>Masorites</hi> have observed all the Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malies that are in all the Parts of the Punctation; which are very many, almost innumerable, and barely observe that so it is: Whereas had they been the Authors of the Punctation, they either needed not have made one Anomalous Point, Vowel, or Accent; but might have made them all uniform and regular; or else could, and 'tis likely would have given some Reason of the Anomalies; which they wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do. We shall therefore produce a few of the many Instances of the Anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that are in all the Parts of the Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with some of their Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations thereon, that by them it may be judged whether those <hi>Masorites</hi> placed the Punctation or not.</p>
                        <p>Now the Punctation consists of Three Parts: (1.) The Vowels. (2.) the Points <hi>Dagesh</hi> and <hi>Mappek.</hi> (3.) The Accents; as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> in his <hi>Tiberias,</hi> pag. 13. collects some of them, it being endless to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all.</p>

                        <p n="3">(3.) The Anomalies that are found in the Accents, with the <hi>Masorites</hi> Notes thereon, prove they were not the Authors of them; but only observed how the Books were Pointed before their days.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First, Pathak</hi> and <hi>Segol</hi> are commonly changed into <hi>Kamets,</hi> by the great Pauses, <hi>Athnak, Soph, Pasuk,</hi> or <hi>Silluk:</hi> (How then could the Vowels be placed so long before these Accents? as <hi>Capellus</hi> fancieth.)</p>
                        <p>Now in some Books sometimes they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and are not altered by these Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents: And these places the <hi>Masorites</hi> do note; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.8. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.13. <hi>cap.</hi> 30.19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.48. <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.24. <hi>cap.</hi> 26.5, 9. <hi>Isa.</hi> 47.1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.4. &amp; 4.3. &amp; 35.20. &amp; 66.12. &amp; 84.11.

                        <p>Here we find are multitudes of Anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in all Parts of the Punctation; and the <hi>Masorites</hi> note them all, but do no more than barely note them. Hence we conclude the Punctation, and all the Parts of it, were long before the <hi>Masorites,</hi> and before these Masoretick Notes; else they would have made no Anomalies, or given a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why they did make any. If now the whole Punctation were not finished until <hi>A.

But if the Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were finished, <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. as <hi>Elias</hi> supposeth, then these <hi>Masorites</hi> who made
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:103507:151"/>
the Points, could not make these Notes on the Anomalies thereof also, as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth they did, but were long after them. <hi>Vtrum horum mavis accipe.</hi>

                           <hi>Capellus</hi> saith, <hi>If the</hi> Masorites <hi>did not Point the Text, it follows not the Points were before</hi> A.D. 500.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Capellus</hi> supposeth the Anomalies may be either from Use against Grammar, or by Errour or Design.</p>
                        <p>In supposing it was by following Use and Custom, against Grammar-Rule; it must then be allowed, 1<hi>st.</hi> That all the Points, Vowels and Accents are usefully distinct from each other; which elsewhere he denyes; for they must distinguish all these Anomalies in their Sound by the Ear, till the Punctation was placed.</p>
                        <p>His other Conjectures, <hi>That it may be it was done by Errour,</hi> shews how little he regards the Providential Care of God over his Word, to be a perfect Rule to the Worlds end, so he can get but an <hi>it may be it was Errour</hi>; and then it <hi>may be</hi> it was <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi>; and yet a <hi>Posse ad esse non valet conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentia,</hi> as before was observed: We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conclude that every thing is actually, whatever it may possibly be.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It may be</hi> (saith <hi>Capellus</hi>) <hi>the first Authors of the Points made these Anomalies by mistake; but the succeeding</hi> Masorites <hi>finding of them, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed they were designedly made at first, and so left and noted them.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Resp.</hi> 1<hi>st.</hi> Then the Points, Vowels and Accents were made long before these Notes on the Anomalies of all the Parts of the Punctation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Then the Punctation was not 500 years in composing; for all on't was finished before these Notes were made, which yet were many Ages in making.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Then the first <hi>Masorites</hi> were the greatest blundering Blockheads that ever were, to make such innumerable palpable Mistakes in what they had invented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And yet their Successors must be supposed to esteem them so infallibly exact, as to follow them universally against their own Sence and Reason, not daring to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie one Mistake.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If <hi>Ben Asher,</hi> A. D. 1040. finished the Punctation, why did he not rectifie these Mistakes or Anomalies in all the Parts of it? And then let him produce some Evidence, that this <hi>Masora,</hi> or the Notes on these Anomalies, were made by <hi>Masorites</hi> that lived since <hi>Ben Asher</hi>'s time; whereas the Grammarians succeeded <hi>Ben Asher,</hi> and take no notice of any such.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly, Capelius</hi> says (if this won't do, that 'twas done by Mistake then,) <hi>It may be it was done at first designedly by the first Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorites, the Causes whereof we may not know; which the following</hi> Masorites, <hi>to prevent any Alterarion of them through inadvertency, have made those Notes on them: And this is not strange, seeing we must suppose</hi> Ezra <hi>did it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly; nor yet absurd, seeing we suppose</hi> Ezra <hi>did the same.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> 1<hi>st.</hi> Still the Punctation was all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the first <hi>Masorites,</hi> contrary to his Opinion elsewhere.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Ezra</hi> was a publick Person, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inspired; but the <hi>Masorites</hi> were private Persons, and had neither ordinary nor extraordinary Call or Authority to place innumerable Points, contrary to all Grammar-Rule, without rendring an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Reason why they did so. And therefore,</p>
                        <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> 'Tis absurd in them, though it was not so in <hi>Ezra</hi>; for (as <hi>Capellus</hi> saith) the cause of these Anomalies might be, that such was the Use and Custom of the Tongue, so to express some words different from Grammar-Rule: This might be known and done by <hi>Ezra,</hi> but could not be done by the <hi>Masorites,</hi> because the knowledge of such Niceties as the Anomalous Sounds, were lost long before their time. In short, this we say from hence, (1.) The <hi>Masorites</hi> are the Authors of the <hi>Masora</hi>; we know no other of their Works than this. (2.) These have made the Notes that are made on the Anomalous Punctation. And, (3.) They who made these Notes, we have proved were not the Authors of the Punctation; because all the Punctation must have been made long before these Notes could be made thereon, and therefore we conclude that the <hi>Masorites</hi> were not the Authors of the Punctation.</p>

                        <p>Now we shall prove that the Parts of the <hi>Masora</hi> here mentioned, were long before the <hi>Talmuds</hi>; and yet the Authors of these Parts of the <hi>Masora,</hi> are here called the <hi>Masorites</hi> by <hi>Elias</hi> himself.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> As to the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Masora</hi>; that is, not only mentioned by both the <hi>Talmuds,</hi> but spoken of, as being as ancient as <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, in the <hi>Ierusalem Talmud,</hi> in <hi>Megilla,</hi> cap. 4. And in the <hi>Babylon Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> in <hi>Masecat Nedarim,</hi> cap. 4. fol. 37. In explaining <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.8. <hi>And caused them to understand the reading</hi>; that is, the <hi>Masora,</hi> say both the <hi>Talmuds:</hi> That is (saith <hi>Elias</hi>) <hi>By Oral Tradition the Masora was then used. Not so</hi> (saith <hi>R. Azarias,</hi>) <hi>they speak of what was written, and not of Tradition.</hi> Again, The common Saying of the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muds</hi> shew the Name of the <hi>Masora</hi> was then known; <hi>viz. There is a Mother to the Scripture, and there is a Mother to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sora.</hi> And as to the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Masorites, Elias</hi> supposeth, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. that they made the Verses. And yet the <hi>Mishna</hi> it self, not long after the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> mentions the Verses; as in <hi>Masecat Megilla</hi> cap. 3. it saith. <hi>He that reads in the Law, must not read less than three Verses; and in the Paraphrase, not more than one.</hi> And as the <hi>Talmud</hi> on <hi>Megilla,</hi> cap. 3. fol. 32. saith, <hi>What Verse</hi> Moses <hi>did not make a Verse, we must not make a Verse.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Again, As to the Parts of the <hi>Masora,</hi> their readings <hi>Ittur Sopherim, Keri u lo Ketib,</hi> thus saith the <hi>Talmud</hi> in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secat Nedarim,</hi> fol. 37. <hi>Rabbi Isaac saith, the reading of the Scribes, and Ittur Sopherim, and the Keri u lo Ketib, and the Ketib u lo Keri, is a Constitution of Moses from Sinai.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But the main Work that <hi>Elias</hi> ascribes to the <hi>Masorites,</hi> was the numbring the Verses, Words and Letters of Scripture; and telling which is the <hi>middle</hi> Verse, Word and Letter of the Law; and the like. Now of these the <hi>Talmud</hi> maketh mention most plainly, in <hi>Masecat Kedushin,</hi> cap. 1. fol. 30. it is thus written: <hi>Therefore Roshonim, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, were called Sopherim, Numberers, because they numbred all the Letters which were in the Law; and these said that</hi> Vau <hi>in the word</hi> Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon, <hi>is the middlemost Letter of the Law,</hi> Lev. 11.42. <hi>That</hi> Darash, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.16. <hi>is the middlemost word of the Law: And</hi> Hitgalach, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13.35. <hi>is the middlemost Verse in the Law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Ancients (they say) knew well the Letters full and defective</hi>; and that <hi>the Verses of the Law were</hi> 5888.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Talmud</hi> indeed oft refuteth the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sora,</hi> as <hi>Elias</hi> confesseth in <hi>Table</hi> 1. <hi>Speech</hi> 5. but then the <hi>Masora</hi> must needs be in being. The <hi>Talmud</hi> takes notice of the Great and Small Letters, which is also a Part of the <hi>Masora</hi>; as on <hi>Sopherim,</hi> cap. 9. it saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> is <hi>Great,</hi> Deut. 29.28. <hi>What Argument</hi> (saith <hi>Buxtorf</hi>) <hi>can be plainer than this, the Name, and Work, and Parts of the</hi> Masora, <hi>were long before</hi> A. D. 500. Therefore they were not first made, <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. as <hi>Elias</hi> thinketh: Indeed he allows them to be by <hi>Tradition</hi> before, a thing most absurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, but not <hi>written</hi> until after the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muds,</hi> A. D. 500.</p>
                        <p>Now we say, if the <hi>Masorites</hi> Point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Text, they were these <hi>Masorites</hi> who wrote the Notes about the number of the Letters, Words and Verses of the Bible, of the <hi>Ittur Sopherim,</hi> the <hi>Keri u lo Ketib,</hi> the <hi>Reading of the Scribes,</hi> the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Greater, or Lesser than ordinary, the Letters and Words Full and Defective, and the like; all which the <hi>Talmuds</hi> plainly say were made by the Ancients, their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, long before their time, or else the Punctation was made by other <hi>Masorites</hi> than these the <hi>Talmud</hi> speaks of: if the Punctation was made by these Men, then it was made long before <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. even as ancient as <hi>Ezra</hi>; for so ancient is this <hi>Masora</hi> esteemed by the Jews to be. <hi>Elias</hi> his Fancy, <hi>That this</hi> Masora <hi>was Orally preserved from</hi> Ezra<hi>'s time, till</hi> A. D. 500. is refuted by <hi>R. Azarias,</hi> and <hi>R. S. Arcuvolti.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if the <hi>Masorites</hi> who Pointed the Text were not these ancient <hi>Masorites</hi> the <hi>Talmuds</hi> speak of, then they were either those that made the Notes on the Anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Punctation, and upon the rest of the things that are the Subject of the Masore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Observations which compose the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Masora,</hi> or else they were some others. But they were not these <hi>Masorites</hi> neither; for we have at large proved that those who made the Notes on the Punctation, were long after the Punctation was made: And that those who made the other Notes on the other Parts of the <hi>Masora,</hi> did only observe what they found the Text to be; but placed nothing to the Text, their only design being to prevent any from so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in time to come. If therefore the <hi>Masorites</hi> Pointed the Text, they were other <hi>Masorites</hi> than either of these before mentioned: But other than the one or the other sort of <hi>Masorits</hi> already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, we neither read nor hear of; and till some other can be found out, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the <hi>Masorites, A. D.</hi> 500. or since
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:103507:152"/>
that time, did not Point the Text. And so much for the discovery of the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of those Persons Pointing the Text, to whom the Invention of the Punctation is ascribed.</p>

                        <p>We shall begin with the Book entitled <hi>Habahir,</hi> made by <hi>R. Nechoniah,</hi> fifty years before Christ. (Vid. <hi>Buxtorf Thesaurus,</hi> A.

<q>The Points in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> are like unto the Breath of Life in the Body of a Man.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in the Book called <hi>Zohar,</hi> made by <hi>R. Simeon ben Iochai,</hi> a hundred years after Christ. (Vid. <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> ibid. and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliothaeca Rabbinica</hi> on <gap reason="foreign">

<q>Not one Letter is able to signifie one thing or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without the Points: All the Letters without the Points, are like the Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Soul; when the Points come, then the Body stands in its Station.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And so in the <hi>Tikkunim,</hi> or Explications of the <hi>Zohar,</hi> saith <hi>R. Azarias,</hi> ibid. And in the Preface of <hi>Tikkunïm,</hi> 'tis said,
<q>The Accents are as the Breath, and the Points as the Spirit, and the Letters as the Soul, the one come after the other.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this, as <hi>R.

sheweth, that what the <hi>Talmuds</hi> speak on <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.8. is all of it about what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and no part of it was spoken about what was kept by Oral Tradition. As,</p>

                           <hi>Resp.</hi> They cannot expound the <hi>Talmud,</hi> which was made long after they were dead; but the Ancient Writers speak plain enough of the Points, as <hi>Bahir, Zohar,</hi> &amp;c. And why may not the <hi>Talmuds</hi> speak of the Shapes of the Points? There is not one place of Scripture (saith <hi>Buxtorf</hi>) in all the <hi>Talmud,</hi> any otherwise read than our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Punctation reads it: Which could not have been, had not the Bible been then Pointed; for the Sounds could not be kept without the Shapes, as we have already shewed in the <hi>PROEMIVM</hi>; and as themselves say, the <hi>LXX.</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from our Copy, because they had no Points; and we may as well say the <hi>Talmud</hi> universally agreeth with our Punctation, because they had Points, which they could not have done without. And as to the <hi>LXX. &amp;c.</hi> they differ from the Letters and Words, as well as about the Points; and therefore <hi>Capellus</hi> reckons their Copy dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from ours in Letters, as well as Points: But these things we may examine hereafter, the Punctation is all we are now concerned about. And hereby all those Objections of the silence of the ancient <hi>Caballistical</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and of the <hi>Talmuds</hi> about the Points, are obviated. (Vid. <hi>Pugio Fidei,</hi> pag. 92. the former Edition: And pag. 111. of the last Edition. See also <hi>Buxtorf. de Punct. Orig.</hi> part 1. cap. 5, &amp; cap. 6.)

                  <p>WHEREIN The Antiquity, Divine Original and Authority of the present Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is proved, By the Testimony of Jews and Christians, The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Consent of all Nations that receive the Scriptures; Their quiet Possession of the Text, as 'tis now Pointed by Prescription, from Age to Age. The Vowels (an Essential part of Speech) oft expressed by the Punctation only. The Obscurity of the Scripture without Points, which yet was commanded to be written very plainly. The <hi>Old-Testament</hi> evidencing it self to be the Word of God, in and by the Punctation only. The Anomalies thereof manifesting its Antiquity.

The <hi>LXX.</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase reading otherwise than our Punctation directeth. The <hi>Samaritan</hi> Character, (supposed to be the ancient <hi>Hebrew,</hi>) never Pointed. The Novelty of their Names, The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of their Numbers, The possibility of preserving the Sound without the Shapes; and of reading the Bible without Points, (as well as the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binical Commentaries, the <hi>Talmuds,</hi> and other Oriental Languages, are read without them,) By the help of the <hi>Matres Lectionis,</hi> or Letters <hi>Evi, a, h, v, i,</hi> By the scope of the place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Silence of <hi>Ierom,</hi> and the Fathers about them.

                           </gap> of the ancient Caballistical Writings, the <hi>Mishna</hi> and <hi>Talmuds,</hi> about the Points, answered.</head>
                        <p n="1">§ 1. IN the <hi>FIRST PART</hi> of this Discourse, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. we declared that there were two Periods of Time parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly fixed unto the one or the other, of which all Parties do in some respect ascribe the Original of the Points: The one is the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> the other is <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. The one makes them of Divine, the other of Humane Original and Authority. So that the Question is,</p>
                        <p>Whether the Shapes or Figures of the Points, Vowels and Accents which are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Text of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible, were invented and placed to the Text as early as the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> or else not until the <hi>Talmuds</hi> were finished <hi>A. D.</hi> 500?</p>
                        <p>And having at large discovered the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability and Absurdity of the Opinion, That the Points were first invented, after the <hi>Talmuds</hi> were finished, <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. in the <hi>First Part</hi>; we are now to prove,</p>
                        <p>That the Shapes or Figures of the Points, Vowels and Accents which are joyned to the Text of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible, were invented and placed to the Text as early as the time of <hi>Ezra.</hi> Not that we need to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon this position, having proved it in proving the other: For none doubt of the Points being placed by <hi>Ezra,</hi> but those who suppose them first invented <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. Which Opinion being already refuted, there is no other time assigned by any for their Original since the time of <hi>Ezra:</hi> And having largely shewed that they were not first invented and placed, <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. or since that time, nor yet at any other time since <hi>Ezra</hi>; it followeth, they were placed by the time of <hi>Ezra.</hi> So that what is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alledged for the Antiquity of the Points, is <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> and more than could be required; not but that we intend to produce sufficient Proof for their Antiquity, and Divine Authority.</p>
                        <p n="2">§. 2. We have moreover observed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. That those who acknowledge the Antiquity and Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Points, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do yet differ among themselves about the precise time of their first Invention. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Some suppose they are coaevous with the Letters, and as ancient as <hi>Adam:</hi> This is the Opinion of <hi>R. Azarias</hi> in <hi>Meor Enaim,</hi> cap. 59 of <hi>Antonius Rodulphus, Cevallerius</hi> in <hi>Rudamentis Linguae Hebraicae,</hi> cap. 4. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus Cevallerius,</hi> ibid. in <hi>Annotationibus Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias Flacius Illiricus Clavis Scripturae,</hi> part 2. tract 6. pag. 644. <hi>Marcus Marinus</hi> in <hi>Pref.</hi> to <hi>Arca Noae.</hi> Vid. <hi>Buxt. de Punct. Orig.</hi> part 2. cap. 1. <hi>R. Samuel Arcuvolti Arugath Habbosem,</hi> cap. 26.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Others imagine that they were Orally delivered by <hi>Moses</hi> on <hi>Sinai,</hi> but not placed to the Text till <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time. So the Author of <hi>Cosri</hi> thinks, <hi>part.</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 31. The <hi>Talmudists,</hi> the Author of <hi>Tsak Sepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taim,</hi> and Others, say the same.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Others believe the Points were placed together with the Letters, as the Scripture was at first written by the Pen-men of it. So saith <hi>Baal Samadar,</hi> and Others. Vid. <hi>Aru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gath Habbosem,</hi> cap. 26. and <hi>Masoret Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masoret,</hi> Pref. 3.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But the most of the Jews affirm that <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the Men of the <hi>Great Synagogue,</hi> first invented and placed the Shapes of the Points to the Text; as <hi>Elias Levita</hi> himself, in <hi>Masoret Hammasoret,</hi> at the beginning of <hi>Pref.</hi> 3. observes; and <hi>Ephodeus,</hi> cap. 5. &amp; cap. 7.</p>
                        <p>Now all these several Opinions agree in this, That the Shapes of the Points were placed to the Text by the Time of <hi>Ezra</hi>; and that they are of Divine Original and Authority therefore; which is all we are concern'd to prove.</p>
                        <p>And herein we have the universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Jews, one (only <hi>Elias</hi>) excepted, as hath been proved in the <hi>First Part</hi>; for had another been of his Opinion, either himself or his Followers would have produced him; which they have not done to this day.</p>
                        <p>Now if we consider this Testimony in all its Circumstances, it will appear very full and pertinent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> As to its <hi>quantity</hi>: 'Tis the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Consent of all the Jews, in all Places, Times and Ages.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to its <hi>quality</hi>; they are of all sorts.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) The ancient Caballistical Writers and Philosophers. (2.) The <hi>Talmudists.</hi> (3.) The Grammarians; they are the most Learned, both ancient and modern.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the History and the Age of these Witnesses, none are so fit; for from them we have received the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible, by them it is preserved, and they are fittest to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:103507:154"/>
give the best Account of their own Affairs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As to the Form of this Testimony, here is their plain, loud, full and open Voice for the Antiquity of the Points; and their deep Silence as to the Novelty of the Points: So that in all respects the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is full, plain and Authentick.</p>
                        <p n="3">§. 3. But hereunto it is objected, That there are express and mute Testimonies of the Jews against the Antiquity of the Points.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to express Testimony, 'tis said and objected, <hi>That</hi> Aben Ezra, R. D. Kimchi, Cosri, <hi>and the Author of</hi> Tsak Sephataim, <hi>together with</hi> Elias Levita, <hi>are against the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of the Points.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> We have at large proved in the <hi>First Part,</hi> that all these Testimonies are wrested, and that all these <hi>Rabbins</hi> are for the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Points, (<hi>Elias Levita</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted;) which proves the universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Jews for the Antiquity of the Points, seeing <hi>Elias Levita</hi> and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers cannot pick up one single <hi>Iew</hi> that doth so much as question or doubt of it.</p>
                        <p>Object. <hi>But the Iews are partial to the Praise of their own Nation, and so unfit Witnesses; only</hi> Elias, <hi>speaking against their Glory, is of more moment than six hundred on the other side.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> (1.) <hi>Elias</hi> speaks most in his own Cause, and for the Glory of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ascribing the Punctation to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorites,</hi> A. D. 500. when we say the Jews were rejected, and under the Curse of God, that as such a time they should be owned of God, so as to be able to produce so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Work as the Punctation; which is the Rule of all our Translations, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of Scriptures: This Opinion is most their interest to espouse, and most to their Praise; whereas the other Opinion belongs not to their Praise any more than ours; for the Christian Church succeeded the Church of the Jews: What <hi>Ezra</hi> did, was whilst they were God's Church and People; which not the Jews, but the Christians now are: And <hi>Ezra</hi> had as much Honour as that did amount to besides, as being one of the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Scripture; and did not so need it as the poor <hi>Masorites,</hi> who had nothing else to boast of.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) But if the Jewish Nation were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in partial to their own Glory, yet still they are fittest to give the best Account of their own Affairs: All Nations are partial to their own Praise, and yet the Records of every Nation are the best Evidences of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and their own Transactions.</p>
                        <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis objected by <hi>Capellus,</hi> and Others, <hi>That the Iews preserve the Law which they publickly read in the Synagogue without Points, thereby to represent the</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tographon <hi>of</hi> Moses, <hi>being without Points; which 'tis said</hi> Buxtorf <hi>confesseth, doth prove that the</hi> Autographon of Moses <hi>was without Points.</hi> (Vid. <hi>Considerat. Consid.</hi> pag. 242.)</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp. Buxtorf</hi> doth not confess any such thing, but the contrary. (Vid. <hi>Bux<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>. de Punct. Orig.</hi> pag. 49, 50.) And tells the several Opinions of the Jews about the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>: Some suppose it was Pointed at first: Others suppose there were two Copies in <hi>Moses</hi>'s his time, one Pointed, the other without Points. That the Law is judged polluted, if one Point be put to it, is owned; but that it was without Points, to represent the <hi>Autographon</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> doth not appear: They who would know why the Jews read and keep it without Points, may hear what themselves say to it, who own the Antiquity of the Points; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if their Testimony be good in one thing, 'tis so in another.</p>
                        <p>But the Jews give Three Reasons why the Law is kept without Points in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue: (1.) Because of the difficulty of Transcribing Copies so exactly as is required for publick use, the least defect rendring it profane; which indeed with Points were almost impossible to be done. (2.) That they might have the liberty of drawing many and divers sences; whereas the Points consine it to one only, but they wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d have many more mysterious. (3.) That all Learners might be kept in dependance upon their Teachers; and 'tis not unlikely but they preserve the Law Unpointed, that none might be permitted to read it in the Synagogue, until he were able to read it perfectly without Points. Moreover, if it were so, this hinders not but that it might be Pointed by <hi>Ezra,</hi> as <hi>Megilla,</hi> or <hi>Esther,</hi> read without Points; which yet they own that <hi>Ezra</hi> Pointed, and is of Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. However, the rest of the Scripture is read in their Synagogue with Points; and the Law it self is read exactly according to the Punctation, to a tittle; which suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently sheweth their esteem of the Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as being of Divine Authority.</p>
                        <p>Object. 'Tis said, <hi>If the Iews did believe that</hi> Moses <hi>or</hi> Ezra <hi>either had Pointed the Law, they would not have used it without Points.</hi>

                           <hi>Resp.</hi> They all believe that <hi>Moses</hi> or else <hi>Ezra</hi> Pointed the Law; yet none of them Point it in the Synagogue, but give other Reasons why they omit the Points, though they read by them: And had <hi>Elias</hi> thought there had been any Argument in this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, 'tis like he would have used it; which he doth not, but acknowledgeth the Jews own their Antiquity.</p>
                        <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Tis objected, <hi>That the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Caballistical Writings make no mention of the Points, or their Names; nor yet do they draw any Mysteries from them, as they do from the Letters; which if they had been of Divine Authority, no doubt but they would have done: Also the</hi> Mishna <hi>and</hi> Gemara; <hi>yea, both the</hi> Talmuds, <hi>are very silent about the Points, even there where they had necessary occasion to have made mention of them, if they had been in their time.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> We have produced Instances out of the Caballistical Writings, as the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har,</hi> and the <hi>Bahir</hi>; and out of the <hi>Mishna</hi>;
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:103507:155"/>
and both the <hi>Talmuds, viz.</hi> that of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and that of <hi>Babylon</hi>; wherein the Points are not only mentioned, but their Necessity and Antiquity is owned, in <hi>part</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. And so hath <hi>Buxtorf. de Punct. Orig.</hi> part 1. cap. 5, 6. at large; where he produceth full Testimonies out of several Caballistical Books that mention very many of the Names of the Points, as doth his Father in his <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) The Points might be then, and yet they might not have occasion to mention them, as well as many voluminous Rabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Commentaries since the <hi>Masorites, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheeck, Abarbinel,</hi> &amp;c. who make no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Points.</p>
                        <p n="3">(3.) In the Points they were not like to find such Mysteries as in the Letters, seeing the Points hinder the design of raising many Mysterious sences, because they confine the Text to one certain sence.</p>
                        <p n="4">(4.) They might look for greater Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Letters, which they believe were given by the Lord himself, than by the Points, if they thought that <hi>Ezra</hi> invented them.</p>
                        <p n="5">(5.) And as to the <hi>Mishna</hi> and <hi>Talmuds,</hi> there is not a Text, (as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> observes, <hi>de Punct. Orig.</hi> par. 1. pag. 77.) in all the <hi>Mishna</hi> or <hi>Talmuds,</hi> any otherwise read than according to our present Punctation.</p>
                        <p>Now if <hi>Capellus</hi> placeth so much stress in the Argument, that the <hi>LXX.</hi> read other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than the Points direct, therefore the Points were not then; we may well lay as much stress on this, The <hi>Mishna</hi> and both the <hi>Talmuds</hi> read all places according to the present Punctation, therefore the Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was in their time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Elias</hi> objects, <hi>The</hi> Talmuds <hi>oft say,</hi> Read not so, <hi>but</hi> So; <hi>as not</hi> Beneecha, <hi>but</hi> Bonee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha: <hi>And there is a Mother to the</hi> Mikra, <hi>or Scripture; and a Mother to the</hi> Masora; <hi>and that</hi> Joab <hi>slew his Master, about the reading of the word</hi> Zacar; <hi>which, as 'tis Pointed, may be either the Male or the Memorial: Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>if the Points were Divine, they durst not say</hi> Read not so, <hi>but</hi> So.</p>

                        <p n="4">§. 1. (4.) 'TIs objected, <hi>That the</hi> LXX. <hi>read otherwise than our Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation directs, and therefore 'tis supposed the Points were not in their time.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. They also read with other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Words and Sentences, in many places, than our present <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copy directs: And we may as well suppose our Copy was not in their time, or that they used another Copy, as <hi>Capellus</hi> openly avoweth, <hi>Vind. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>sect.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 822. And in his <hi>Critica,</hi> and elsewhere, goes to mend our Bible, by Conjectures at what words were in the Copy by which the <hi>LXX.</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated; but will not say ours is corrupted, when yet 'tis to be mended by his Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in innumerable places; which cannot be admitted, without supposing it corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and grossly too: And we may here see whither this Opinion of the Novelty of the Points, and this Argument about the <hi>LXX.</hi> doth tend at last, not only to deprive us of the Points, but also of the Letters, Words and Sentences, even the Copy it self which we enjoy.</p>
                        <p>Hence <hi>Vossius</hi> more honestly rejects our <hi>Hebrew Bible,</hi> and prefers the <hi>LXX.</hi> as Authentick. And the <hi>Papists</hi> on this account reject our Bible, and prefer the Vulgar <hi>Latin.</hi> But both are more kind than <hi>Capel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>: For though they take away our Bible as well as he doth, yet they give us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in its stead; which he doth not, only leaves us to conjecture by ancient Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions what our Bible was of old.</p>
                        <p>And of this Argument of the <hi>LXX.</hi> Dr. <hi>Broughton</hi> saith in his <hi>Positions touching the Hebrew Tongue,</hi> pag. 669.
<q>Our late Men (saith he) help <hi>Elias</hi> his most deadly
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:103507:155"/>
Errour, with an Argument hard for the Unlearned to Answer, (<hi>viz.</hi> this of the LXX.) of which he saith, Good Men used this Reason, to help the Pope to disannull the Authority of Scripture, and to betray their own strong Hold: This Answer is sure, the <hi>LXX.</hi> never meant to open the Law to Heathen, where they would play the Hogs or Dogs.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Christ hath promised, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. <hi>That not one jot of the Law shall perish.</hi> That the Copy we now enjoy, is the true Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Original, we are ready to prove when 'tis necessary so to do: But seeing those in <hi>England,</hi> who embrace <hi>Capellus</hi> his Opinion about the Points, do yet reject this Notion about our Copy, we need not here enlarge upon this Subject:</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Some who use this Argument of the <hi>LXX.</hi> would nevertheless state the Question so smoothly, as if they did not deny the Antiquity of the Sound and Force of the Punctation, but of the Shapes only; which the <hi>Masorites</hi> (say they) placed right ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Sound, which had been kept by Use to that time. (Vid. <hi>Considerat. Consid.</hi> cap. 10. sect. 6. pag. 206, 207, 208, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Whereas they yet use this Argument of the <hi>LXX.</hi> the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase,</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>'s going off from the Punctation: Which they do as much in the Sound as Shape, or rather solely in the Sounds and Force of the Points, which by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then were not at that time; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Sound as well as Shape is discarded, whatever elsewhere be pretended.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That the <hi>LXX.</hi> altered Letters as well as Vowels appears, as in innumerable places elsewhere, so in particular by the thirteen which the Jews own they designed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did corrupt; <hi>viz.</hi> (1) <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. (2) &amp; 1.26. (3) &amp; 2.2. (4) &amp; 5.2. (5) &amp; 11.7. (6) &amp; 18.12. (7) &amp; 45.6. (8) <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.20. (9) &amp; 12.40. (10) 24.5, 11. (11) <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9. (12) &amp; 17.3. (13) <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.6. Not that all these places are found now so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, but some of them only: So in <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. the Flood was <hi>A. M.</hi> 1656. but by the <hi>LXX.</hi> 'twas 2262. or 2242. as they have altered the Age of the Fathers.</p>
                        <p>'Tis well known how uncertain all things are about the <hi>LXX. Iosephus</hi> expressly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, That not the whole Bible, but the Law only was translated by them: in his <hi>Proaem.</hi> (Vid. <hi>Drusius Observat.</hi> lib. 6. cap. 9. <hi>Scal. ad Euseb.</hi> fol. 123. <hi>Wouwer.

                        <p n="5">5. Whatever was translated by them, 'tis certain that the <hi>Autographon</hi> of it, if left at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was consumed to Ashes in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Wars; and that <hi>Ierom</hi> could not find a Standard for to mend the Various Readings of it hy: And 'tis observed, they shew such Ignorance of the Hebrew Tongue as is unmeet to be ascribed to such Persons as they are supposed to be. (Vid. <hi>Munster.

                        <p>And as to the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase,</hi> which is objected also:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. 'Tis a <hi>Cento</hi> of divers Persons and Ages: That on the Law agrees best with the Letters, and so likewise with the Vowels; but that on the Prophets differs alike from both; so that the Letters as well as the Points would be rejected on this account.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. 'Tis a Paraphrase, and not a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, and so not tied to the Rules of a Translation; nor do they always make a Litteral Interpretation.</p>
                        <p n="5">§. 5. 'Tis objected, <hi>That the Ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Character was the same with the present Samaritan, which never had any Points or Vowels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. Though it be not now known to have Vowels, it follows not therefore that they never had any.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Postellus</hi> shews that <hi>Ierom</hi> owned that they had Vowels.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This Objection would have lead us, if we had room enough, to prove which was the First Tongue and Character; but at present we can but refer to those who have so done.</p>

                        <p n="1">(1.) The same Men were alive at the burning of the first, and at the building of the second Temple; and so many of them too, as confounded the Shout of the Young Men by the Cry of the Old, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.12, 13. Enough, doubtless, to keep their Tongue, at least the Character of it: And 'tis incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that the Men of the same Age should forget their own Character, wherein they were so much exercised, having their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with them always, and that in their own Character only; and dwelling together in the same Cities, without any converse with others in Matters of Religion, about which the Scriptures treat, and very little in Civil Matters: No Marriages were made with others; they had their Bibles, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2. but 'twas unlawful for them to learn the Arts of the <hi>Chaldeans:</hi> And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved that they commonly had or learned other Books or Characters: They held Correspondence with the Jews in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deah,</hi> and elsewhere, as <hi>Ieremiah</hi>'s Letters shew, being sent unto them; which must needs be done in their own Tongue and Character. The Priests and Levites were with them, to instruct them; which must be done out of the Old Law, by Reading and Expounding it. They were also in continual Expectation of returning to their own Land, Language and Worship: And can we imagine they should then forget the Tongue of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whereby they hoped to converse with their Countrey-men, and serve God at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and learn the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a People whom they hoped to see destroyed, and their Tongue with them. Also <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the Prophets of that time, wrote their Prophecies mostly in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Tongue, and altogether in the Old Character, as none doubteth; it is then most irrational to suppose that <hi>Ezra</hi> should reject them, whilst they were even wet, and newly written, to introduce another Character. And that they commonly spake their own Tongue after their return, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in that it was accounted a strange thing, that the Children spake partly the Tongue of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and partly that of <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dod</hi>; which they learnt of their Mothers, who were newly married there to the Jews; so that there was no occasion of this Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Character.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Some say 'twas done, that the Scripture should be dispersed and spread through the East.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> This helps it not: Why then was it not put in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Tongue? They are little the better for its being in their Character only.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Some say the</hi> Jews, <hi>in hatred to the</hi> Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, <hi>left their ancient Chracter, because they would have nothing in common with them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> Why then did they not reject the Law also which the <hi>Samaritans</hi> held like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? Would they thus give the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> cause for ever to triumph over them, for having left the Ancient Character, wherein the Law was first given in its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Purity, to the Care of the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> their Enemies, whilst themselves had rejected it for that of <hi>Babylon?</hi> Were these the Acts of those Jews whom (they say) dare not put one Point to the Law, that they might represent the first <hi>Autographon</hi> of it as it was written by <hi>Moses</hi>? And who account the Bible unfit for Publick Use, by the least misplacing of a Letter, or making a letter that is larger or lesser than his fellows, but equal to the rest?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But so it was, though they know not why, as</hi> Eusebius, Jerom, <hi>the</hi> Talmuds, <hi>and some Coyns found with the Samaritan Character, do testifie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. These Witnesses were born five hundred years after the Fact about which they testifie; which impairs their Authority: The Fathers had little knowledge of that Tongue, especially <hi>Eusebius</hi>; and <hi>Ierom,</hi> who knew most, might easily be mislead by the darkness of that time. The sence of the <hi>Talmuds</hi> is disputed by the Jews, who say the <hi>Talmuds</hi> do not intend any such thing as is here fathered upon them; but say their Opinion was, That the Character we now have, was the first ancient Character where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Law was at first written by <hi>Moses</hi>; but not commonly understood till <hi>Ezra</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the writing of the Law in that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter only. (<hi>Iacob ben Chabib on Ein Is.</hi> p. 142.</p>
                        <p>And as to the Old Coyns; as there might be, (1.) Several sorts of Characters, some fittest for Embossing or Engraving, and yet the same Hebrew Tongue: So, (2.) The Story is fabulous. But be it so, if they were so ancient, must it needs follow, that because these Letters were then known, and in use, that <hi>they</hi> only were so? Or that the Bible was written with them, and those now in use, unknown? (3.) 'Tis as confidently
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103507:156"/>
affirmed that there were Coyns as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Solomon's</hi> time taken up, with the same Hebrew Letters wherein the Bible is now written. (Vid. <hi>Schickard Bechin. Hap. Hottinger. Cip. Heb.</hi>) So that this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is as much for the present Character, as for the Samaritan being the Ancient Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. But the truth is, as Dr. <hi>Broughton</hi> declares in his <hi>Positions</hi> touching the <hi>Hebrew Tongue</hi>; speaking against this Assertion, That <hi>Ezra</hi> invented the Characters which now we have, <hi>pag.</hi> 668. he saith, <hi>The</hi> Trojans <hi>were not willinger to betray their own City, than our loytering Fathers, and loytering Selves, to give</hi> Machmad <hi>all strength of victory.—Iews by Fables have overwrought us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">§. 3. And thus have we examin'd the Exceptions to the Testimony of the Jews for the Antiquity of the Points; by all which 'tis faintly suggested, That the Iews do not own their Antiquity; when at the same time 'tis known that all the Jews who at any time have written or expressed their Opinion about the Points, have plainly owned their Divine Antiquity, <hi>Elias</hi> only excepted, who nevertheless believeth that all the Punctation is perfectly the very same that was at first expressed by the holy Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Scripture; that only the Shapes were placed by the <hi>Masorites</hi>; not one <hi>Iew</hi> can be produced that doth so much as doubt of the Antiquity of the Points, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Jews, to this day, follow the Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and do still universally publickly profess they believe the Antiquity and Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Points; nor is there one Man left alive so much as of <hi>Elias</hi> his Opinion among the Jews.</p>

                        <p n="1">§. 1.

But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is objected the silence of <hi>Ierom</hi> and the Fathers, as to the Points, the Translation of <hi>Ierom</hi> differing from the present Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Fathers having recourse to the <hi>LXX.</hi> the Opinion of many Eminent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divines, both <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Protestant,</hi> for the Novelty of the Points, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whereunto we <hi>Reply,</hi> First, As to the <hi>Silence of</hi> Jerom <hi>about the Points, and that therefore they were not in his time,</hi> 'tis Answered:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Translation, for the main of it, shews he had the Sound and Force of the Punctation. Whether Pointed Copies were as common then as they are now, we do not debate; nor whether he could get one or not, though they were in being then with the Jews; nor yet whether the Names of them were then the same they are now; nor what need he had to mention them, though he had them, when many large Rabbinical Commentaries since the <hi>Maso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> take no notice of the Points neither, as <hi>Alsheech, Abarbinel,</hi> &amp;c. Yet some will dispute several places of <hi>Ierom,</hi> wherein they affirm he speaks of them: But grant he were silent about them, were they not in being therefore? <hi>Ierom</hi> is as silent about the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase,</hi> and yet both were before his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ime. <hi>Ierom</hi> saw not all things, nor is it proved that he mentioned all he saw: None else but <hi>Origen</hi> among the Fathers saw or knew any thing considerable of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in those dark times; and they were oft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to conceal their Esteem of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Original, because of the Ignorance and Obstinacy of those times: Hence 'tis no wonder the rest of the Fathers take no notice of the Points, when they generally understood not <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as to the Opinion of many Modern Divines, both <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Protestant,</hi> about the Novelty of the Points, there is no cause to wonder at it: For,</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) For the <hi>Papists,</hi> 'tis their great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to have the Bible rendred unmeet to be a perfect Rule of Faith, that some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity thereby might be supposed for the Infallibility of their Pope, and 'tis no marvel if they embrace this Advantage. And as to <hi>Protestants,</hi> 'tis known, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Elias,</hi> the Great, if not Only Master of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue of their time, was very greatly esteemed among them: And how easie is it for so great a Master to instill his own Notions into the Minds of those that depend upon his Instruction: He lived with <hi>Paulus Eligius</hi> for some time; and when some few Eminent Men among the Christians are at first infected with such an Opinion, not at first, it may be, well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Consequences that do attend it; jow readily do Others who esteem them for Leaders in that kind of Learning, follow them, without duly examining the Merits of the Cause? as is the practice of most Scholars that do not penetrate very far into a particular part of Learning, to embrace the common Notions about it, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining of the them. But moreover, whilst these very Divines themselves, together with all Christian States, Nations and Churches, do follow the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible as it is at present Pointed, and publickly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace those Translations of the Bible into the Vulgar Tongue of each Nation, as are taken either from the Original <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as it is Pointed, or from those Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are so translated, or pretended so
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103507:157"/>
to be, which is the present state of Affairs throughout <hi>Christendom</hi>: We have an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, full, and sufficient Testimony of all Christian States, Churches and People, Learned and Unlearned for the Antiquity and Divine Authority of the Points. For though some Protestant Divines deny the Antiquity of the Shapes, they all own the Divine Authority of the Sounds of the Points, and thereby follow the Punctation.</p>
                        <p>But the generality of Protestants own the Antiquity of the Shapes, as well as the Sounds of the Points. And that this is the publick professed Opinion of all or most of the Protestant Universities, Colledges, Doctors of Divinity, and Professors of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, in most of the Protestant States and Churches beyond Sea, is proved by a large Collection of their several Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages and Judgments about the Antiquity of the Points, lately delivered and Printed by <hi>Matthias Wasmuth,</hi> in the end of his Treatise, entituled, <hi>Vindiciae Hebraeae Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terae, &amp;c. adversus Impia &amp; Imperita multo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum prejudicia imprimis contra Capelli, Vossii, F. &amp; Waltoni Autoris Operis Anglicani Polyglot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Assertiones falsissimas pariter as pernitiosas.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that we have herein the full and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Testimony of the Christian States and Churches of all Ages and Places, as well as of all the Jews, for the Antiquity of the Points.</p>
                        <p n="3">§. 3. Now the strength of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lyes in this, That the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible, as it is Pointed, is become the peaceable Possession, Treasure and Inheritance of the Church and People of God by Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It hath always, in all Ages, been enjoyed; and under the Conduct and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of it, they have safely arrived at Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when all others wandered in darkness who have been totally without it, or some Translations taken from it, or from those that were so taken, as is the <hi>LXX.</hi> the <hi>Syriack,</hi> Vulgar <hi>Latine,</hi> and all others, only some more, and some less truly and exactly.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon we have sufficient ground to acquiesce in it; and all that can be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us, is, That when any accuse it of being a <hi>Novelty,</hi> we fairly examine what Evidence they can produce to prove their Charge.</p>
                        <p>This we have done at large in the <hi>FIRST PART,</hi> and shewed the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations and Charges brought in against the Antiquity of the Points, are all False, altogether Improbable in every respect, and on several accounts Impossible: That all the Evidence is totally silent in what it is brought to testifie, and witnesseth to the quite contrary of what 'tis brought to prove, declaring the <hi>Antiquity,</hi> instead of the <hi>Novelty</hi> of the Points. So that hereby the Antiquity of the Points appears with the greater lustre, having passed the Fire of Tryal and Examination. Nay, Dr. <hi>Walton</hi> himself confesseth, (<hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Considered,</hi> pag. 208.) the Text was generally so read by the Christian Church as it is now, as appears both by the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Copies among them, and by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Expositions, and Translations of the ancient Writers of the Church. And indeed our Debate is not with any Protestants about the Divine Authority of the Punctation directly; for they univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally own it, even those who suppose that the Shapes of the Points were first invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Masorites</hi> of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> A. D. 500.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible, as it is Pointed, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed and owned by all Jews universally, even <hi>Elias Levita</hi> himself; and by all Christians too, a few <hi>Papists</hi> only excepted, to be the only Standard whereby all Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations and Doctrins are to be tried, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less what <hi>Capellus</hi> and <hi>Vossius</hi> hold to the contrary.)</p>
                        <p>And we have already proved in the <hi>Prooemium,</hi> and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. of the <hi>First Part,</hi> and elsewhere, That the Opinion of those who suppose the Shapes of the Points to be first invented, <hi>A. D.</hi> 500. by the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorites,</hi> is utterly inconsistent with their own Opinion of the Antiquity and Divine Authority of the Sound and Force of the Points, it being impossible to preserve the true Sound until that time without the Shapes of them. So that we must either reject the Punctation, and then we have neither Standard nor Bible left us; or else we must own the Antiquity of the Shapes, as well as the Sounds of the Points, Vowels and Accents; as all the Jews, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Christians acknowledge.</p>
                        <trailer>And so much for the Testimony of Jews, and Christians for the Antiquity of the Points, together with Answers to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Objections that are made thereunto.</trailer>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>§. 1.</hi> The First Reason for the Antiquity of the Points stated and maintained: That the Vowels are oft expressed in the Bible by the Punctation only; and yet are so essential to Speech, that all Languages are constrained to express them in one shape or other. <hi>§. 2.</hi> The Objection, That the Bible may be read without Points, because the <hi>Rabbini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Commentaries,</hi> the <hi>Mishna,</hi> the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muds,</hi> and the <hi>Oriental Tongues</hi> may be so read, and the <hi>Greek</hi> without Accents, Answered: The Bible oft expresseth the Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els only by the Points, which the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and other Tongues, express by the Vowel Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>§. 3.</hi> As is evinced by several Instances. <hi>§. 4.</hi> And the Argument thereby proved.</head>
                     <p n="1">§. 1. WE proceed in the next place to Artificial Arguments or Reasons: And these are of Two sorts:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Such Reasons which the Jews have first used, and the Christians from them And,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such as the Christians only have invented and used.</p>
                     <p>We shall begin with the First sort, <hi>viz.</hi> Such the Jews first made</p>
                     <p>The First Reason for the Antiquity of the Points, is that which <hi>R. Azarias in Meor Enaim,</hi> cap. 59. bringeth to prove his Opinion, That the Points were coaevous with the Letters: And that is this:
<q>Because the Sounds of the Vowels (which are often expressed in the Bible by the Points only,) are so essential to Speech, that all Languages have them in one shape or other, either in Letters, or Lines, or Points; either in, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, or above, or below the Letters: And 'tis not to be imagined that the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Tongue, which is the First, and the Mother of all the rest, should want that Essential part which all others enjoy.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed, for this Reason Letters are called <hi>Consonants</hi>; because they can sound with, but they cannot found without Vowels.</p>
                     <p>And as <hi>R. Azarias, ibid.</hi> gives Instances of the Occidental Languages, as the <hi>Latin, Italian, Grecian,</hi> &amp;c. having Vowel-Letters; so he mentions the Oriental Languages also; and in particular, he caught <hi>R. Elias,</hi> in his Story about the Men of the Countrey of <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> reading without Points, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they had Letters to express their Vowels.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. Now 'tis granted us, that Vowels are coaevous with the Letters. (Vid. Dr. <hi>Walton,</hi> afterwards Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> in his <hi>Considerate Considered,</hi> cap. 10. pag. 201.) But then 'tis said that they are expressed by the Vowel Letters, <hi>Evi, a, b, u, i,</hi> in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which may be read without Points, as well as the <hi>Rabbinical Commentaries,</hi> the <hi>Talmuds,</hi> the other Eastern Languages, and as the <hi>Greek</hi> is read without Accents; and where they are wanting, there the scope of the place may help the Skillful. (<hi>ibid.</hi> c. 10. pag. 215, 216, 217.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Resp.</hi> Here's no Proportion in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons; the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> the <hi>Eastern Languages,</hi> the <hi>Talmud,</hi> the <hi>Greek Testament,</hi> &amp;c. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press their Vowels by Letters: But the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Bible, in innumerable places, doth not but by Points only.</p>
                     <p>They grant us, the Vowels of the Bible were expressed coaevous with the Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: And we'll prove this was done only by the Points in innumerable places; and thence conclude the Points were coaevous with the Letters, at least of Divine Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Authority.</p>
                     <p>And as to the scope of the place, the Matter is too Sublime, Divine and Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; the Language too Elyptical and Abstruce in many places, to yield that relief.</p>
                     <p>And as to the Argument, <hi>That the Bible was of old without Points, because the Eastern Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages were of old without Points:</hi> We reply,</p>
                     <p>They always used Vowel Letters; and so do the <hi>Syriack, Chaldee</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where our Bible useth Points only, and not Vowel Letters; which manifesteth that our Bible had Points from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as theirs had Vowel Letters.</p>
                     <p>To make this plain, we could produce innumerable Instances out of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and all the Oriental Tongues, had we room to place them; but one or two at present taken out of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> may suffice to shew that the Bible expresseth those Vowels by Points only, which the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase,</hi> the <hi>Syriac,</hi> and the rest of the Oriental Languages express by the Vowel Letters.</p>
                     <p>As for Example: <hi>R. David Kimchi,</hi> when he repeateth these Bible words, <hi>Hos.</hi>

                     <p>Now though the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth their Vowels either by Vowel Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters only, or by Points and Vowel Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters together, or else by the Points only; yet 'tis essential to that Tongue, and all others, to express the Vowels one way or other.</p>
                     <p>And seeing the Vowels in the Bible are expressed by the Punctation only in innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable places, where they are essentially necessary to Speech, that they be expressed some way or other.</p>
                     <p>We may conclude that the Points are an essential part of the Text, and thereby of Divine Authority and Antiquity:</p>
                     <p>Because the Vowels, which are an Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of Speech, are expressed only by them in innumerable places; as hath been already in part, and shall be more fully under the next Argument made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>

V. <hi>§. 1.</hi> The Second Reason for the Antiquity of the Points, stated, That the Scripture was written very plain; but without Points, 'twould be very obscure. <hi>§. 2.</hi> This is evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a Collection of divers places where the Vowels are expressed by the Punctation only, and that in such places as would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible without the Points. <hi>§. 3.</hi> The Objection of <hi>Capellus,</hi> That 'tis not Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, though it be Difficult to read without Points, Answered: The Objection, That 'tis the Office of the Ministry to Read, as well as to Expound, Answered. <hi>§. 4.</hi> The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the whole proved.</head>
                     <p n="1">§. 1. THe Opinion and Argument of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madar,</hi> for the Divine Original of the Points, is related by <hi>R. Samuel Arcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volti</hi> (who agrees with him) in his <hi>Arugath Habbosem,</hi> cap. 26. And by <hi>R. Azarias in Meor Enaim,</hi> cap. 59. And also by <hi>Elias Levita</hi> himself, <hi>Masoret Hammasoret,</hi> Pref. 3. fol. 78. and 'tis to this effect:
<q>If (saith he) it be asked, <hi>Whence shall we know that the Punctation was from God?</hi> 'Tis answered, From hence we know it; because 'tis said by the Lord in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture very fully, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.8. <hi>And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of the Law VERY PLAINLY:</hi> Now (saith he) unless it were for the help of the Points and Accents, whereby the words are made plain, no Man could be able to understand the meaning of them; as <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</q>
Thus far <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madar,</hi> as <hi>Elias</hi> reports his words; and all he saith to it, is only this, <hi>See if it be fit to lean upon:</hi> Which we shall now see ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                     <p>The Scriptures were always delivered in the Vulgar Tongue of the People of God, in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> when they understood <hi>Hebrew</hi>; in <hi>Chaldee,</hi> when they understood <hi>Chaldee,</hi> as parts of <hi>Ezra, Daniel,</hi> &amp;c. and in <hi>Greek,</hi> when that was understood by them, as is the <hi>New Testament.</hi> All sorts are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to read and know the Scriptures; Wise and Simple, Men and Children, it being their Rule by which they shall be Judged: It was therefore required to be written <hi>very plainly,</hi> as apears in the place mentioned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.8. So also <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.2. <hi>And the Lord said, Write the Vision, and make it PLAIN upon Tables, that he may run that readeth it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it is granted us by most of our Adversaries, That the present <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as to the Words and Letters of it, are for the main the same which God gave at first: These were required to be written <hi>very plain,</hi> and were accordingly so written and kept; but without Points, they are most dubious, most obscure and uncertain; therefore they were at first written with Points.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. The Obscurity of the Text without Points, as it hath been evidenced in the <hi>Prooemium</hi>; so also at large it's demonstrated by <hi>Buxtorf, de Punct.

                     <p n="1">§. 1. A Third Reason for the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Points, is taken from what the Author of <hi>Cosri</hi> saith, <hi>part</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 32. as to the Nature of the Punctation it self, being Divine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="288" facs="tcp:103507:159"/>Now we say that for the same Reason why we believe the Text to be God's Word, for the same do we believe the Points to be from God.</p>
                     <p>We believe the Scripture to be God's Word, because it evidenceth its self to be from God by certain <hi>Tekmeria,</hi> or Proofs of the Power, Light, Purity and Majesty that appears in it, manifesting its self to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a Holy, Wise, Glorious, Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God: But this it doth only as it is Pointed; for without Points the Text speaketh either nothing, or else contrary and divers things, of which no judgment can be made whether they are good or bad: Now saith the Author of <hi>Cosri, part</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 32. <hi>There appears in the fixing of the Points and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents to be such an Order as cannot be made without Divine Aid, which is far beyond the reach of humane Skill: Nor had it otherwise been so universally received in all times by all the People of God without alteration; because as wise men as they could have Pointed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, had it been done by humane Art only</hi>; and so say we.</p>
                     <p>Now to fix and ascertain the sence of the Text universally infallibly right, which is the Work of the Punctation, requires no less ability than the infallible guidance of the same Spirit of God that first gave forth the Scriptures. Men may know the things of men, and may rectifie any litteral mistakes in Writings about Arts and Sciences, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Subject whereof they treat being first well known and understood by them; but no Man knows the things of God, nor can know them, but the Spirit of God, and he to whom the Spirit reveals them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. The matter of the Scripture consists of such Misteries that were hid from all Men, 'till revealed by the Scripture only: The Prophesies of future Events, as <hi>Isaiah,</hi> &amp;c. are delivered in such cloudy and figurative Expressions, and in such Elyptical Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as posed the very Pen-men of Scripture themselves to interpret; it must needs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be impossible for any infallibly to fix and ascertain the right sense of the words of Scripture without Divine Assistance.</p>
                     <p>But in all the most deep and dark places of Scripture the Punctation is as compleat and perfect as in the plainest, and every where shews it self and the Striptures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be from God, by the Divine and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Subjects that are delivered by the Text as it is at present Pointed.</p>
                     <p>We say then, that we believe the Bible is God's Word, with Faith Divine, because of the Authority and Veracity of God, who hath declared it so to be therein: And we believe that God did indeed declare it so to be, as is therein affirmed, because the Bible evidenceth its self to our Consciences by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible <hi>Tekmeria</hi> or Characters, that it did proceed from no other but God himself.</p>
                     <p>All God's Works wear his Name, and bear some mark upon them of God their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; but his Word is herein exalted above all other Works that bear his Name, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138.2. <hi>Thou hast magnified thy Word above all they Name</hi>; for there no where remains so many and so great prints of the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Finger of God as is on the Scripture; none but God can make that Revelation of the invisible Nature and Being of God as is in the Scripture, nor declare those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels which before were hid in God that are plainly expressed in the Scriptures, which things the Angels desire to look into: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Heaven or Earth doth bear so much of the Image of God as doth the Scriptures, (but God himself;) by nothing hath the great God revealed his Will, and given forth to the Sons of Men a Law of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but only by the Scripture; nothing evidenceth it self so to be, in the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but the Scriptures, and all this the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doth in and by the Punctation only, without which it would be nothing at all, but whatever wicked men have a mind it should be.</p>

time, then so must the Punctation be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, whereby alone the <hi>Keri</hi> is distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Ketib,</hi> and so preserved, as <hi>Kimchi</hi> observes.</p>
                     <p>So that here is no Anomaly in this Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, but it is Regular, according to the <hi>Keri.</hi> And this <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib</hi> is not only owned by Jews, but Christians also; most Translations following some times the one, and some times the other, as they think best.

Hence 'tis most likely these Accents were then placed, when the Tunes they teach were sung and understood, and not since, by Persons who knew not what they placed them for.</p>

                     <p n="1">§. 1. HAving related the principal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that are used by the Jews, for the Antiquity of the Points, in the Three foregoing Chapters; and plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, and the Divine Authority of the Points thereby:</p>
                     <p>We are in the Second and Last place to mention the Heads of Arguments that are used by Christians for the Antiquity of the Points.</p>
                     <p>Now these are, for the most part, Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Improvements of those that are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the Jews: Though they have much encreased their number, yet some do seem to derive their Original from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians more particularly; which we can but briefly mention, having already far exceeded the Limits of this Discourse.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>First</hi> then: Among other things, they plead lawful, peaceable possession, by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, under these several Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>(1.) The Bible, as 'tis now Pointed, is a Possession of Inestimable Value; the Rule of Life, from whence all Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Translations are taken, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Faith and Religion is founded.</item>
                        <item>(2.) It hath been but of late called into question: And that,</item>
                        <item>(3.) Upon the most frivolous Pretences that ever any thing of such Importance was questioned about.</item>
                        <item>(4.) The Interest and Design of many herein, being to pervert us to a False Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion thereby: And therefore 'twould be great folly to deliver our Defensive Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to our Enemies, only because they come to destroy us: So that 'tis thought but reasonable to hold our Bible till some cause be assigned why we should reject it, besides the bare desire of the <hi>Papists,</hi> or any Others, to deprive us of it for their own Ends.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Argument more peculiarly used by Christians for the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Points, is taken from the Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malous Punctation thereof, (from whence
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:103507:160"/>
some raise an Objection against their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,) and 'tis briefly this:</p>
                     <p>The Points are either coaevous with the Letters, and a part of the Language; or else they are an Art invented by Men: Which if they were, the Authors might, and would have made them all uniform and regular; there was no occasion for one Anomaly: The only Reason why there are any Anomalies in Grammar, is, because all Grammar is made after Languages, and by their Use; whereas had Grammar been first, all Speech and Words had been regular and uniform.</p>
                     <p>If then the Art of the Punctation had been first invented, there had been no Anomalies in it, or any occasion for the same.</p>
                     <p>But because there are innumerable Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malies in the Punctation equal to what are in any Language, we therefore conclude the Punctation it self was before the Art of it, and as Ancient as is the Language it self.</p>
                     <p>What is objected, <hi>Considerat. Consid.</hi> c. 11. p. 251, 252, 253. <hi>That the Anomalies were not</hi> Consilio, <hi>but</hi> Casu; <hi>not Designedly made by the Masorites, but by Mistake</hi>; is not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any colour of Reason or Testimony, but against it: For neither the Providence which attends the Preservation of Scripture, nor yet supposing of common, ordinary, and very indifferent attendance on the Work of Pointing the Scripture by the Authors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, will admit of such a Conceit; the Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malies being so innumerable and obvious to Any, much more to the Inventors of them, that they could not but observe them.</p>
                     <p>And whereas 'tis further objected, <hi>Why are not the Points that are placed to the</hi> Syriack, Chaldee, Arabick, <hi>&amp;c. coaevous with those Languages also?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Resp.</hi> Had he produced the like Anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the Punctation of them, and their Religious Observation thereof, he had said something; till then he saith nothing against us, but argueth for us: For all those Points are either always Regular, or may so be; and yet as Novel as those Points are, they change several Letters one into another by their presence.</p>
                     <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Third Christian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is taken from the <hi>New-Testament</hi>; and that is <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. <hi>For verily I say unto you, till Heaven and Earth pass,</hi> one Jot, <hi>or</hi> one Tittle, <hi>shall in no wise pass from the Law till all be fulfilled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two different Opinions are raised from these words.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>(1.) Of those who say the words, <hi>One Iot,</hi> or <hi>One Tittle,</hi> relate to the least Letter, or least Point or Tittle. And thereby the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation is owned by our Saviour, and its continuance to the worlds end promised.</item>
                        <item>(2.) The Second Opinion, supposeth the least Letter, and the least Horn or Corner of a Letter, to be intended by the words.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>In which Opinion it is granted us, That by this Text Christ hath promised, that the least Letter, or Corner of a Letter of the Scripture, shall not be lost or changed as long as Heaven and Earth endure.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon we say, The Vowels are a great part of the Scripture, and an Essential part of it; whereas many Letters are redundant, and might be spared, without impairing the sence, but the Vowels cannot.</p>
                     <p>Now these Vowels, in innumerable places, are kept and expressed by the Points only: If then the Points are a Novel Invention, then the Vowels in many places, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a great part of the Scripture, is lost; but if it be not lost, then it must be in the Points, and then are the Points of Divine Authority.</p>
                     <p>And so much for the Heads of Arguments that are used by Christians for the Antiquity of the Points, which we could but barely mention; nor yet have we room so much as to mention all of them, being confined to brevity.</p>
                     <p n="5">§. 5. And thus have we, as briefly as possibly we could, plainly proved, <hi>That the Shapes or Figures of the Points, Vowels and Accents which are joyned to the Text of the</hi> Hebrew Bible, <hi>were Invented and placed thereunto as early as the time of</hi> Ezra, <hi>and thereby are of Divine Authority.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We thought to have presented in one View the Sum of this Treatise; but being informed that <hi>Mr. De la Crose</hi> intends to give himself the trouble of Abridging the same, who is more able so to do; we shall conclude this Discourse, and commit it to the Blessing of God, being to render an Account of our sincere Aim at his Glory alone in all our Undertakings.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THere is much Order, Exactness and Learning in this Work: In short, 'tis a very good Abridgment of the Critical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> It first speaks of the principal Manuscripts of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Texts of the Bible, those that the Jews made for the Use of their Synagogue requiring a thousand Superstitious Precautions. They must be written upon a very neat Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and prepar'd by a <hi>Iew</hi> that was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apostate nor Heretick: There must be little Crowns upon certain Letters: The Parchment must be folded in a Roll, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Collumns or Pages thereof mark'd very exactly, and all the Lines rul'd before that they are written: A certain Ink also must be made use of, which they believe <hi>Moses</hi> gave the Composition of. In fine, The Letters must not touch one another, but have always between 'em the space of a Thread, and between each Line the space of a Line, and neither more nor less than thirty Letters in each Line. What Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is requisite to observe all this! As to the Copies design'd for a Domestick Use, they observe not all these Circumstances: Many Copies of them have been found in the Libraries of the Christians, the best are those which were made in <hi>Spain:</hi> The Jews make a great account of that of <hi>Hillel</hi>; he was a <hi>Rabbin</hi> much esteem'd; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Relation of some, liv'd before the coming of Jesus Christ; but the Author is not of their Opinion, he believes he was a <hi>Spanish Rabbin,</hi> who liv'd a long time since the Jewish Doctors of the School of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riades,</hi> who Compos'd the <hi>Masora</hi>; and that he Corrected the most ancient Copies of the Edition that these Masorite Doctors had publish'd.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Second</hi> place, it speaks of the Copies printed from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Texts of the Bible; and says that they are form'd after the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Masorites:</hi> From thence it is that there is so much conformity between them, and that they are so much admir'd. He does not believe that the <hi>Masora</hi> was begun in the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> or in the time of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras</hi>; but on the contrary, that it was a Work of the Seventh Age, and that the <hi>Iews</hi> borrow'd it from the <hi>Arabians,</hi> to whom they confess that they are indebted for all that they know of the Grammar and Criticks. He founds his Conjecture upon this, That the <hi>Arabians</hi> have a <hi>Masora</hi> of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> resembling that the <hi>Iews</hi> have of the <hi>Bible:</hi> He is far from much esteeming or despising the <hi>Masora</hi>; for since 'tis the Work of very able Men in their own Language, and such as are well vers'd in the knowledge of the Manuscripts of the Bible, it may be made use of; but as it is certain the <hi>Maso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> were not Inspired from God, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said their Corrections are Infallible; their Endeavours were effectual, that the Text should not be altered hereafter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the preceding Alterations were not a few. It treats very learnedly of the Original of the <hi>Masora</hi>; of its <hi>Variae Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiones</hi>; of the Differences which are found between 'em and the Manuscript Copies of the Bible: And he pretends that the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braic</hi> Bibles, printed by the Christians, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in finer Characters, are not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act as those publish'd by the Jews: He gives his Judgment of the most celebrated Editions in <hi>Hebrew</hi>; and says that of the Rabbin <hi>Iacob Hajim,</hi> of the Printing-House of <hi>Bomberg,</hi> was Re-printed at <hi>Venice</hi> in the Year 1618. But as it has pass'd through the hands of the Inquisitors, who amended and corrected it as much as they thought good; so this Author places it much below the others.</p>
                  <p>He is free from that defect so common among Men, of Condemning, through Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Prejudice, those who are not of his Religion; for he takes the part of the Jews, against the number of Ancient and Modern Christian Doctors, who have accus'd him of corrupting the Texts of the Bible: A List of these Accusers may be seen in the <hi>Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationes Biblicae</hi> of Father <hi>Morin,</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 2, 3:) And in the Treatise <hi>Leon de Castre,</hi> a Spanish Divine, upon the Translations of the Bible, which he hath placed before his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries on the Bible.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> is of this Opinion, I mean, he speaks very much against the Jews, as if they had maliciously altered the Hebrew Text, through a hatred to the Christian Religion: But the Author thinks himself oblig'd to do them more Justice; he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that the Fathers of the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain not so much of the Alterations of the Text, as of the bad Interpretations that the Jews give to the Words of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or of the Version of <hi>Aquilla,</hi> of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docian</hi> and <hi>Semachus,</hi> that the Jews were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom'd to oppose to that of the Seventy Interpreters: He proves his Pretension by the same Passages of the Fathers as <hi>Leon de Castre,</hi> and Father <hi>Morin</hi> have cited; in this he hath almost copied the other word for word. He adds, That in Matter of Criticisms, the Authority of the Fathers is nothing near of so great a consequence as in Matters of Faith: And says very plainly, That many among them did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue enough to be able
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:103507:161"/>
to judge whether the Jews had falsified the Original of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> or not. He answers to the Passages of <hi>Origin</hi> and St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> and tells us we should judge of their Genius, and manner of Writing: He also refutes the Reasons of Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi>; and shews, among other things, that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> is not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in this Point, both because he did not understand <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and because he was often abused in Matter of Fact; which destroys the Proof which they would bring for his Testimony, after this manner, <hi>That he would have been sacrific'd to publick Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, if he had accus'd the Iews of a Crime whereof they were not guilty.</hi> The Author believes therefore that the Jews did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Scripture upon any Deliberation, or through Malice to the Christians; but that the Defects which were found in their Copies, ought to be imputed to the same Causes which have produc'd so much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Manuscripts of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Authors: He referrs to the Treatise of <hi>Scioppius de Arte Critica,</hi> and shows by a passage of the Book, that <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> compos'd against the pretended An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities of the <hi>Hetruria</hi> of <hi>Inghiramimus,</hi> how easie it was for the Copiests to take one Letter for another, and by this means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the sence of an Author; such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance there is in a Book, where if they had put <hi>Orbis</hi> instead of <hi>Vrbis,</hi> it wou'd have been the Cause of many New Opinions or many Learned Dissertations, and of many Difficulties that would have made the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctors sweat. There are some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piests who not taking sufficient Care of any one Letter, create a thousand Disputes to the succeeding Ages, of whom it may be properly said, <hi>They prepar'd Scourges for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Author relates an Example of some Errors that Copiests have Committed: It was believed for many Ages that <hi>Dagobert</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> forc'd a Nun from her Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to marry him, but Father <hi>Sermon</hi> and young Mounsieur <hi>Vellois,</hi> and some others, having found in the old Manuscripts of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digair, Nantechildem unam ex puellis DE MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISTERIO accipiens Reginam sublimavit</hi>; whereas these words were ill quoted by <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moion, Nanthildem unam ex puellis DE MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NASTERIO in matrimonium accipiens subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mavit</hi>; have sav'd the Reputation of this Prince, upon a Fact sufficiently scandalous, which was much spoken of by Authors. As to the rest the Author maintains, those cannot be accus'd of a malicious deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which take a Passage in the sence that is most favourable to 'em, when the words are equivocal. We owe to our selves this Justice as we are Christians, of not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our selves of falsifying the Scriptures, when we explain it to our advantage, in places where what precedes and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, does not necessarily determine us to the sense which is against us. What the Author says afterwards about the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Bible, which only comprehended the five Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> because when they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themselves from the Jews, they had then only publish'd this part of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rure; (that I say) and what he adds of the Learning of the same <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and of the Paraphrases of the Bible, is very Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; they had Paraphrases in <hi>Chaldaick, Greek</hi> and <hi>Arabick,</hi> according as those Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages became common among 'em; for as in the Synagogues the Law was alwayes read in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> both among the <hi>Samaritans</hi> as well as among the <hi>Iews,</hi> so it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to have a Paraphrase of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in another Language, when the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> was only among the Learned; from whence he concludes, contrary to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes of Mr. <hi>Mallet,</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> compos'd the Scripture in a vulgar Tongue, and makes the same remarks upon the Paraphrases of the Jews, to wit, that they were a remedy against the Ignorance of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongues, the most ancient of the <hi>Chaldaicks,</hi> among whom he principally esteems those of <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and <hi>Avonculus</hi>; there are others in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, Persian,</hi> in the modern <hi>Greek,</hi> and in <hi>Spanish</hi>; this was first Printed at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> in the Year 1553. and elsewhere in the Year 1630. The Author believes that the Jews of <hi>Alexandria</hi> made use of the <hi>LXX.</hi> for the same reason that produc'd the Paraphrases, to wit, because they did not understand He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and because the Greek Tongue was become their proper Language: He never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless speaks of this Version but in treating of that which is made use of by the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
                  <p>He remarks that the Fathers have said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most nothing of this Version, which was borrow'd from a <hi>Roman,</hi> falsly, a Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Aristeus</hi>; and he imagines that the Reasons why they call'd it the Version of the <hi>LXX,</hi> was because 'twas undertaken by the Order of the great Sanhedrim, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by the seventy two Senators which Compos'd it, or because the Jews being will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reconcile it with greater Authority, they attributed it to this Honourable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as they did many other things; which is no impediment (adds he) but that a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as ancient as that, and as much honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Apostles, ought to be considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We are only to shun the excess of those who by the Example of Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not the other to be authentick, or such as prefer it to the Hebrew Text: <hi>Masius</hi> and <hi>Eugubinus</hi> are not of this Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for they have spoken of this Work with much Contempt. <hi>Eugubinus</hi> observes many Faults in it, but sometimes his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are not over just. <hi>St. Ierom</hi> is as much deceiv'd sometimes in Criticizing upon the <hi>LXX,</hi> as <hi>Piersorius</hi> hath show'd in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Version Printed at <hi>Cambridge, An. Dom.</hi> 1665. The Author himself relates some Passages which are thought to be little to the purpose, after which he examines the Hypothesis of Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> upon the Version of the <hi>LXX,</hi> and upon the Tetraples and Hexaples of <hi>Origen.</hi>

                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:103507:161"/>Here follows an Abridgment of what he says of the Version that was declar'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> All the Western Church under the time of <hi>St. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> made use of a Version of the Bible that some call'd <hi>Italick,</hi> some the <hi>Old,</hi> and others <hi>the Translation of the LXX</hi>; the Author of it was not known, but only that it was made upon the Version of the <hi>LXX. Flemminius Nobillius</hi> re-establisht it as well as possibly he could, and caus'd it to be Printed at <hi>Rome, An. Dom.</hi> 1588. Father <hi>Morin</hi> reprinted it at <hi>Paris,</hi> with the Greek Copy of the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> in the Year 1628. but it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that this was the pure Latin Version that the Western Church made use of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>St. Ierom</hi> had made another. This Father Corrects the Translation of the <hi>LXX</hi> only in some places, and notwithstanding the Tempests that he rais'd against him for daring to have recourse to the Hebrew Text; 'tis this Version that the Western Church made use of for many Ages, altho' some men say that it was not this Author which is now call'd <hi>the Translation of the Septuagint.</hi> When the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declar'd this Translation Authentick, they did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to declare that it had no defect, and that it merited more Faith than the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew and Greek Texts. The Council on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commanded that they should use it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrably to all other Latin Versions, which were very numerous. Many Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors have not understood the sence of the Council, for they wou'd not suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to believe that there remain'd any Faults in this Translation of the <hi>LXX</hi>; some great men run the risque of their Lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imprison'd in the Inquisition, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving believ'd it, as <hi>Mariana</hi> relates. <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> makes mention of a Decree of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Congregation of the Cardinals, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the 17<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1577. bearing, that there must not be cut off from the Translation of the <hi>LXX,</hi> even not so much as one Syllable, or one Iota; but this Decree never being publisht, cou'd not Captivate the Faith of any person: And Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5<hi>th.</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> sufficiently evidenc'd they were not of this Opinion, since they have endeavour'd to make a Correction of this Translation. <hi>Sixtus</hi> made a Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which he enjoyn'd the rejecting of all Editions that were not conformable to that which he Publisht. But <hi>Clement</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> nevertheless made another, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in his Bull, that he had very exactly Corrected the Defects of the <hi>LXX.</hi> An <hi>English</hi> Protestant, whose Name was <hi>Thomas Iamesius</hi> writ a very hot Book against the Church, entituled, <hi>Bellum Papalis, sive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia discors Sixti V. &amp; Clementis VIII. circa Hieronymianam Editionem:</hi> Here is some things which are very perplexing to those Persons which have not much Wit and Learning, for in fine, this Edition of <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII. now passes for Authentick, altho' it is not Conformable to the Edition of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the V. who declar'd all the Editions of the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint void, which differ'd from his.</p>
                  <p>The rest of the Book the Author employes in speaking of the Versions of the Bible, that have been made for the Eastern Church, and of those that were publisht in divers Languages in these last Ages by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and by the Protestants. Afterwards he Examines what concerns it in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of <hi>M. Vossuis de Oraculis Sybillinis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We soon expect a Work very like to this we have been speaking of, the last Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of <hi>Francfort</hi> promised it to us; it is entituled <hi>Christiani Kortholti S.

                  <p>HAving Translated this Abstract, We think it necessary to make some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks thereon, that our Young Student be not lead into Mistakes and dangerous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors by the Learned Papist, whose Interest and Design is to take away our Bible: One Mistake we impute to the Abridger, and not the Author, who seems to say that the Jews use many superstitious Precautions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Writing of the Bible, which they do about the Law only, as the Author must needs know, though the Abridger might not.</p>
                  <p>The Author is a Papist, and affirmeth that our Hebrew Bible is corrupt in many places, that the Ancient Versions Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a better Copy, and therefore sayes he would have it, <hi>That those places of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Text which bad Connexion tells us to be false or corrupted, should be restored by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the most Ancient Interpreters,</hi> vid. <hi>Critical Enquiries into the various Editions of the Bible,</hi> pag. 52, 53. And to begin with the Service of his Mother the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who follow the Vulgar Latin, and Translate <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.15. <hi>She shall bruise thy Head</hi>; which they expound of themselves, and not of Christ, (though 'tis <gap reason="foreign">

there are others who are far worse, both Papists and Protestants, whose Arguments he Answers, and particularly Dr. <hi>Isaac Vossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> whose Sentiments are abominable, yet published in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue. We have not room here to Answer this Learned Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, the Author of these <hi>Critical Enquiries,</hi> but do intend a distinct Discourse upon the Sacred Original Text of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in Defence of its Purity and Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as 'tis now enjoyed by the Protestant Church; wherein we purpose to handle all those Curiosities that are the Subject of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Observation about the same; if our Discourse about the Original of the Points, Vowels and Accents find that Acceptance as may encourage such an Undertaking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very willing to Defend our Religion and the Rule of our Faith, to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of our Power. Yet something about it we intend in this Volume, but very briefly.</p>

                  <p>THe Design of this Author is to give an Abridgment of the Polyglot Bibles, which have been Printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at <hi>London,</hi> adding thereto never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless many considerable Pieces, which wou'd make a New Polyglot, that wou'd contain more things, and yet in the same time much shorter. <hi>To what end</hi> (says he) <hi>is the Pentateuch of the</hi> Jews <hi>and that of the</hi> Samaritans <hi>printed separately, since they hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differ but in respect of the Letter? and since 'tis agreed on, that the Versions of the</hi> Syriack, Arabick, Chaldaick, <hi>&amp;c. have been made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the</hi> Hebrew <hi>or upon the</hi> Greek <hi>of the</hi> LXX: <hi>To what purpose</hi> (I say) <hi>shou'd those places that are Conform'd to the</hi> Hebrew <hi>or</hi> Greek <hi>Texts, be reprinted.</hi> Nevertheless to preserve the Original of the Scriptures, and the Version of the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Church, he inserts in his Bible the Hebrew Text, and that of the Greek of the <hi>LXX,</hi> and the two Latin Texts of the <hi>Western</hi> Church; he makes four Collumns thereof, and in the Margin marks the different read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Text, and at the bottom of each Collumn observes the different Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the Versions. This is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Draught, but I shall give a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular one in respect to each of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns.</p>
                  <p>In the first he places the Hebrew Text, so as we have borrowed it from the <hi>Masso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Iews:</hi> But because he would not have it thought that there's none other in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew but that, he Notes in the Margin the divers Hebrew Readings that he hath Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, either of Copies of Manuscripts and Printed, or even of the <hi>Massora,</hi> and of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> or of the <hi>Ancient Interpreters</hi>; and by this means he in some manner re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishes the Hebrew Text in its ancient Form. He shows that the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Text was us'd much to clear that of the <hi>Iews,</hi> wherein he finds above six hundred Sollecisms in the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> only, which may be restor'd by the Hebrew Texts of the <hi>Samaritans</hi>; the varieties whereof he Observes in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and at the same time the Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Version of the <hi>LXX</hi> in many places: He gives us the Numbers of the Copies, and of the Interpreters that he had Consulted, and remarks that Mr. <hi>Cappel,</hi> who sometimes multiplies more than is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary the differences of the Hebrew Text with the Version of the Septuagint, has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got many others which deserve to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Notice of; they appear'd in this Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with divers other readings, which Mr. <hi>Cappel</hi> must necessarily be ignorant of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the <hi>Syriack, Arabick</hi> and <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> did not appear 'till after he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his <hi>Critique Sacrée.</hi> Besides the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch</hi> he gives its Extracts drawn from an <hi>Arabian</hi> Version, which is a very rare Piece.</p>
                  <p>The second Collumn is destin'd to the Version that they call the <hi>Vulgate; St. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> hath made the principal part thereof: The Notes that are at the bottom show where this Version agrees not with the Hebrew, when it's confin'd more to the sense than to the words; when it contains more or less than the Hebrew Texts; when it twice expresses the same thing, or that it abridges the words, which often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, and chiefly upon the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> In fine, another Latin Version is put in the same Notes, when it is necessary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration of the <hi>Septurgint.</hi> The third Collumn contains the Greek Version of the <hi>LXX,</hi> according to the Edition of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the Copy of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> which was preferr'd to other Greek Editions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis more simple, and that it comes nearer to that which was in the Greek Church before <hi>Origen.</hi> Among the Notes he hath placed divers readings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of <hi>Compluta,</hi> of <hi>Alda,</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>; with the Fragments of this Version, which are preserv'd in the Works of the Fathers; and adds upon all this Critical Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>The last Collumn is for the Latin Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Greek Text, which <hi>Nobillius</hi> caus'd to be Printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> and call'd it the <hi>Italick,</hi> The Author will have it that it yet retains this Name; but he believes it very different from the ancient <hi>Italick</hi> Version, which was formerly receiv'd in all the West. The Notes Correct the places where this Version does not express the Greek well; or else Correct the Greek Texts which was sometimes chang'd by the Greek Authors, because they were ignorant of proper Expressions for the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> or <hi>Syriack</hi> Tongue, which this Text is fill'd with, and from thence many Faults are slipt into the <hi>Italick</hi> Version: The same Marginal Notes contain many Remarques upon the Methods how the Fathers made Use of this Version.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:103507:162"/>This being supposed, we shall not be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to regret the <hi>Syriack, Arabick, Chaldean</hi> and <hi>Samaritan</hi> great Polyglot Bibles, since in the Notes of this Abridgment all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are mark'd where they agree not with themselves, nor with the Ancient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters; and where they may be made clearer by the Hebrew Text, and which will be very useful, the Author correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in many places the Texts of these Versions, and the Latin Interpretations that have been given of 'em, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be more defective.</p>
                  <p>Here's in a word the precise Notes: <hi>First,</hi> They contain the Explication of all the obscure words that are in the four Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, and chiefly in the Hebrew Text, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all the rest depends: Besides that, there is the Judgment of the Author upon the divers Interpretations that the Ancients have given upon the same word. There is also an Observation of what is more or less in the Versions than in the Hebrew, and the Opinion of the best Rabbins: He speaks every thing in the Language of the Authors, to which he adds a Latin Translation.</p>
                  <p>In respect to the New Testament he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the same Method as he does in the Old, but it contains only two Collumns, one for the Greek Text, and the other for the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Vulgate:</hi> He remarks in the Notes the Places where it does not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree with the Greek. The same Notes exactly contain all the differences of other Versions, and the divers readings of the Greek Texts. The Author produces many new things that he hath taken from Greek Manuscripts, and adds to it his Critical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques. He even pretends to re-establish upon different Manuscripts the antient <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> which was in the Church before <hi>St. Ierom.</hi> This Version being according to him Translated word for word from the Greek, he thinks it the most Ancient Greek Manuscript in the World; he hath good reason to believe that the most ancient Greek Manuscripts which are now in our Libraries were written by the Latins.</p>

                  <head>An Essay upon <hi>Criticks,</hi> wherein it is endeavoured to shew in what the Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of the Hebrews consists.</head>
                  <p>THose who have some Knowledge of the Hebrew Tongue, and who know the efforts which have been made since 200 Years, to clear the difficulties thereof, are not ignorant that divers Learned Men have endeavovred, with much application, to seek for the Poetry of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Most have despaired of finding it; and if some have believed they had discovered it, there are others who have soon discovered that they were mistaken. <hi>Francis Gomarus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving published at <hi>Leiden</hi> his Book entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Davidis Lyra,</hi> in which he thinks he hath found out the Rules of this Poetry: <hi>Lewis Cappel</hi> ruined in a small Book all these Discoveries: Here the like Fate might be feared, if a quite different way had not been taken; but 'tis thought nothing is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced which is not upheld by the very Nature of the Hebrew Tongue, and upon uncontestable Principles, besides our being assured of the truth of the Rules which shall be given by the application that hath been made thereof in the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> and in other ancient Pieces of Poetry of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</hi> Nevertheless it may be that one may be taken with that, which is look'd upon as a New Discovery, although entirely false, or at least mistaken in some respect: We have thought we ought to expose what is done therein to the Judgment of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that Faults may be Corrected, if any have been omitted, or that we may be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in our Judgment by New Reasons, or finally for ever suppress the Works wherein this Discovery is supposed as true, in case one was not entirely mistaken.</p>
                  <p>His Reasons therefore shall be proposed here, with the briefness we are oblig'd to keep in an Essay that is to be inserted in our Supplement; to this will be added the Solution of some Difficulties, which come immediately into our minds, and may serve to confirm the Hypothesis which we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to read.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first thing that ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, is, that all Languages are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing all manner of Verses. There are some, as the Greek and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, in which Verses may be made, which we call <hi>Metricks,</hi> to wit, measured by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Feet of long and short Syllables. There are on the contrary other Languages wherein all Poesie cannot consist, but in a certain Number of Syllables which form a pleasing Cadence to the Ear, whether there are several Verses which rhime together or not; such is the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, and most of the Moderns. If some <hi>French</hi> Poets have endeavoured to make <hi>Metrick</hi> Verses, as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sportes,</hi> and some others after him, they were so hard and so contrary to the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, that they could not be suffered; it is so with the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> with the <hi>Syriack,</hi> and with most of the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Languages,</hi> whose Genius is in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard conformable to that of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue. These Tongues may easily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Rhimes, but they cannot suffer <hi>Metrick</hi> Verses, as <hi>Ioseph Scaliger</hi> hath already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd a long while agoe, in his Notes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Eusebius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:103507:163"/>It would have been very grateful if this great Man had produced his Reasons, by proposing only his Sentiments; he hath drawn upon him therefore the Censure of some Learned Men, who had not penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the bottom. One dares not affirm that <hi>Scaliger</hi> had in sight the same things which we are about to speak of; but we believe they are more than sufficient, to shew that we can advance the same thing as he did, without deserving the Censure, which those who have not examined the matter, have pronounced slightly enough against him. This is what perswades me that <hi>Metrick</hi> Verses cannot be made in the Hebrew Tongue, no more than in the <hi>French.</hi> To render it more sensible, I shall begin with that which is the most known, and shew that it is the same in all respects with that of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Metrick</hi> Verses cannot be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the liberty of transposing words, for without this it is impossible to find out the measure which must be observed. One hath not alwayes different words, or different expressions, whose quantity is the same, to express one's mind: One must necessarily use such words, which can be but in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain scituation, by reason of their quantity: So if one could not transpose the others, these words could not enter into the Verses, which would be very troublesome for Poets, who would thereby lose an infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Words, whereof they do most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily make use, and which would wholly ruine the <hi>Metrick</hi> Poesie: For Example, there is nothing better placed than the word <hi>civilia</hi> in this Verse of <hi>Lucan,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Bella per Emathios plusquam civilia Campos.</l>
                     </q>
if one endeavoured to put it in another place, the Verse would immediately lose its Cadence, and that other words must needs be sought for. But this hath no need of Proof, for those who know what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is, and those who know it not, ought not to meddle with judging of these kinds of Questions.</p>
                  <p>We know that in the <hi>French</hi> Transposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not allowed of, and if there was nothing else, one might thence conclude that it is not possible to make good <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> Verses in this Tongue: They cannot transpose as they would the Adjectives, there are some which must necessarily precede the Substantive, and others which ought of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to follow it, they say, <hi>a great Prince,</hi> and not <hi>a Prince great; a Horse black,</hi> and not <hi>a black Horse:</hi> It is not permitted neither in Poesie nor in Prose to change the Order of these words. In the Hebrew the Substantive al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways precedes the Adjective, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is understood between two things, as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>ben chacan, a wise Son,</hi> and not <hi>chacan ben.</hi> In Latin and Greek it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different whether one puts the Adjective be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after.</p>
                  <p>It is not permitted in <hi>French</hi> to transpose Pronouns; one can only say <hi>mon pere, ma more,</hi> and so of the rest: It is not even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to omit them, but in certain places, where a long Paraphrase supplyeth this Omission; whereas in Latin and Greek one may say <hi>Pater</hi> as well as <hi>mi Pater.</hi> The <hi>Hebrews</hi> are as much restrained as the <hi>French,</hi> their <hi>prefixes,</hi> their <hi>suffixes</hi> and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouns separated, have constantly the same scituation, as it may be seen in the first He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Grammar; neither do they omit them, excepting the Relatives: As for Pronouns possessive I believe one would very hardly find examples; where they have been omitted.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> cannot transpose a Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive governed by another; for <hi>the Psalms of David,</hi> one cannot say <hi>of David the Psalms.</hi> If <hi>Ronsard,</hi> and other Poets of this time made use of such Transpositions, their <hi>French</hi> was often but a sorry kind of <hi>Latin.</hi> Neither could these sorts of Licenses be long suffered, and they are now quite ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished from the French Poesie. In the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Tongue, the Substantive which <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> ought always to precede, as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>dibre schlomo, the Words of Solomon,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>schlomo dibarim.</hi> If by an <hi>hypallage</hi> they sometimes change their place, it's by a large License, and what is very rare.</p>
                  <p>This Order of Words, which ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be the same, in most of the Eastern Tongues, makes it to be impossible to make <hi>Metrick</hi> Verses in them, which can have any grace. There is even a likelihood that the Greeks and Latins have not transpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Natural Order of their words, but only to make <hi>Metrick</hi> Verses, as <hi>M. Vossius</hi> hath remarked it in his Book <hi>de Poematum cantu &amp; viribus Rythmi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another thing, which hath more enabled these two Nations to make <hi>Metrick</hi> Verses, is the different Termination of their Cases, which is a very great conveniency in this kind of Poesie, and without which I do not know whether Verses could be made in <hi>Greek</hi> or in <hi>Latin,</hi> that might be suffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But in <hi>French</hi> all their Cases have a like Termination, so that they have all the same quantity as the Nominative has, and that they could make in <hi>Metrick</hi> Poesie but one and the same Foot. It is so with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, whence one ought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to conclude that it cannot suffer <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> Verses no more than <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides this, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and other East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Tongues have but two Terminations in the Plural. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> do make the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culines end in <hi>IM,</hi> and the Feminines in <hi>OT</hi>; so that if one wou'd make <hi>Metrick</hi> Verses in this Tongue, the Plurals wen'd always make the same Feet, which wou'd be an inconveniency capable of it self to make a Poet despair, who intended to have any delicacy in his Verse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third thing which hindereth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Metrick</hi> Verses in <hi>French,</hi> is that they have too great a quantity of long Syllables, and too few short ones, as one may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in reading some Lines in a <hi>French</hi> Book, where one shall soon find it. The same thing may be remarked in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:103507:164"/>
Tongue; in which I call long Syllables, not those under which the <hi>Masorites</hi> have put one of the five Vowels, which are called long; for I doubt in this Case whether one may always confide in their Punctuation; but those which are followed with several different Consonants can be short in no Tongue, whatsoever Grammarians may say, as the first Syllable in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Chephtso,</hi> and all the latter Syllables of the words which would not be the last in a Verse, for they all have two Consonants after them. It's true, that one may except words which end by one of the Letters <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Ehevi,</hi> which it may be could make no <hi>Position,</hi> but at least the Rule will be good in respect of the other words ending in Consonants, which are alwayes changeable: For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in these words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>halach bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natsath,</hi> the second Syllable of <hi>Halac</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made short, nor a Dactyl made of <hi>halac-ba</hi>; upon which <hi>Cappel</hi> may be seen in his Refutation of <hi>Gomarus.</hi> And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supposed, one may only read what place he will of the Poetick Books of Scripture, and he shall see that there is such a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of long Syllables, that it is impossible to make <hi>Metrick</hi> Verses of them: Those who have endeavoured to do it, had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to this; which is as ridiculous as if on would make Latin and Greek Verses, without troubling himself with the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Syllables.</p>
                  <p>It may be some will Object the Verses of the modern Rabbins, whereof <hi>Buxtorf</hi> hath made a Treatise, which he hath joyned to his <hi>Treasure,</hi> because this Learned Man hath sought for Feet there, as in <hi>Metrick</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; but it would be easie to shew that he hath been entirely mistaken, that the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins have regard only to the length and number of Syllables, and that all their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censes consist principally in the Pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the suppression of the <hi>Scheva, simple</hi> or <hi>compound.</hi> I shall not engage my self here in this matter; and we are besides assured, that those who do understand a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Hebrew, and who know in what consists the Cadence of our Verses in Rhyme, will agree hereupon by the only reading of the Examples which <hi>Buxtorf</hi> relates. But it falls out, I know not how, that those who apply themselves to the Study of the Eastern Tongues, do ordinarily neglect that of their own Language, and it is perhaps one of the Reasons for which we have not hitherto discovered what the Poesie of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What hath been said sufficeth, if I am not mistaken, to shew that one cannot make <hi>Metrick</hi> Verses in Hebrew: We must remark, that even this in part renders the Rhime in this Tongue very easie, for the Cases and <hi>suffixe</hi> Pronouns Rhime together, as do all the Plurals, which causeth such a multitude of Consonancies and Rhimes, that much care and labour would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to write in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> without Rhiming at every moment. Thus the easiness of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Verses after this manner, as is remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable by what we have observed in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> seems to have lead the <hi>Hebrews</hi> thereunto. Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> saith very ingeniously, in the Book which we have cited, that Nature it self hath taught this Poesie to Men, in rendering them capable of singing:
<q>If some one, adds he, gives attention to the Custom of Children, when they begin to sing, and remarks after what manner they adjust together the words of their Songs, to be able to sing them, it will be perceived that they oft do repeat the same word, and in this ignorant way of speaking there will be found the Principles of rhiming Poetry.</q>
For it cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the same words repeated make a kind of Hamony, which though it is not very agreeable and very fine, is yet very natural and very exact, though those who have a little more delicacy keep from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the same word rhime with it self.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. This being so, it cannot be thought strange that we should affirm that the Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> consists only in Rhime, and is very irregular. The Genius of the Hebrew Tongue cannot permit, as I have already shown, any other kind of Verses; and it is easily conceived, that the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who were not extraordinary Polite, took little Pains to reduce Poetry to an Art, as the <hi>Arabians</hi> have since done, and the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins after them.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> hath remarked, that not only the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Affricans,</hi> but also the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Chinois,</hi> and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations of <hi>America,</hi> know no Poetry but Rhime. There is a likelihood that the Northern People, who possessed all <hi>Europe</hi> in the <hi>falling of the Empire,</hi> had also such like Verses, and that it is from them that the Monks of the following Ages learned to make Latin Verses in Rhime, whereof so great a Number is found in the ancient <hi>Offices.</hi> There remains yet some Fragments of the ancient Poems of the <hi>Brittans,</hi> such as is that which <hi>Vsher</hi> relates of one <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lascienus,</hi> whom he calls <hi>The Prince of Bards,</hi> and who lived in the time of <hi>Iustinian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. But as these Northern Nations had no concern, as we know of, with the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern, no consequence can be thence drawn. We shall then stop at the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and shall observe that the advantage they have received from time to time in their Poems, was long without any Rule, consisting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Rhimes good or bad, without observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any constant measure in Verses: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless it was look'd upon as a more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Style than those Books which were solely composed of irregular Verses. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there were divers Rhimes, sometimes all the Verses of a Poem ended after the same manner. It was in this Condition when the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was written, to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the middle of the seventh Age: All this Book is almost composed with Rhimes, tho' the Periods are very unequal; and it appeared in that time so well written, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself boasts in several places,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:103507:164"/>
that neither Angels nor Devils could equal the Elegance of his Style. We may thence conclude that this Style was established a long time since amongst the <hi>Arabians,</hi> else this Impostour would not have chosen it, or it would not have pleased them as it did. It is true that one <hi>Abubeker</hi> formed the Style thereof, but that's nothing to my design, because it is enough for me that, it should thereby appear in what consisted the Elegancy of the Style amongst the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> And the Authors who have written since, have endeavour'd to imitate it, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Learned Men have observ'd, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others <hi>Iohn Fabricius</hi> of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> in his <hi>Specimen Arabicum,</hi> where he hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished amongst other <hi>Arabian</hi> Pieces, a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of a famous Author in <hi>Asia,</hi> named <hi>El-Herir,</hi> who hath perfectly imitated the Style of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Those who will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure themselves hereof by their Eyes, may only read this Book, and compare it with the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> or at least with the <hi>Surates XII.</hi> and <hi>LXIV.</hi> which <hi>Erpenius</hi> printed in <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some may perhaps say, that those are not so much Verses as Rhimed Prose, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are not equal measures; but we are not to dispute about words. We An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this, that this Poesie in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was in effect but a rhimed Prose, and it's' what appears by the Verses of <hi>Ali</hi> and other Poets in the time of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which the <hi>Arabians</hi> have yet, where there is no exact measure observ'd. It was since <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> that Poetry was reduced into an Art, as I shall observed, after I have remarked that the <hi>Arabians</hi> having a very long time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained separate from others, and without any strange Nations entring into <hi>Arabia,</hi> it may be believed that these Customs were very ancient, when Strangers begun to know them: So tho' there was no knowledge of their Poesie but of late, yet it followeth not that it had not been a long time amongst 'em. In fine, they could not learn this Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of the <hi>Romans,</hi> nor of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to whom it was unknown; so that it may be reasonably believed, that the <hi>Arabians</hi> have had from unregistred times a Rhiming Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. As in these latter times these People knew not what Study was, and Sciences, we must not marvel if it remained very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect for several Ages.</p>
                  <p>It was but under <hi>Chalife Alraschid,</hi> who lived towards the end of the eighth Age, that a Learned <hi>Arabian,</hi> Named <hi>Al-Chalin Eben Achmed Al-Farachidi,</hi> reduced Poetry into an Art. This Art consists not in any distinction of long Syllables, or short ones, but solely in the Rhime, number of Syllables, and in the observation of certain length which they keep, in carefully distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>moveable</hi> Consonants from the <hi>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escent</hi> ones: Those who would be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instructed therein, may consult a small Book of Learned <hi>English-man,</hi> Named <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Clark,</hi> Printed at <hi>Oxford</hi> in 1661. in 12<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Ethiopians</hi> have also a Rhiming Poetry; but which resembles much more the ancient Poesie of the <hi>Arabians</hi> than the new one, if we believe Mr. <hi>Ludolf,</hi> who speaks thereof in these Terms: <hi>The Verses of the Ethiopians consist in pure Rhime, if one can call Rhimes Consonants of the same Order, which end the Verse, though they have different Vowels.</hi> He adds, that they have divers sorts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and promiseth to give examples, in his New <hi>Ethiopick Grammar,</hi> and in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, which is said to be out by this time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it be now asked with which of these Poetries that of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> has most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, it will be answer'd with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poetries of the <hi>Arabians.</hi> The <hi>Hebrews</hi> have never much cultivated Sciences, and never took great Pains to imbellish their Tongue, nor to write politely: They were all occupied in Agriculture, and had but little concern with their Neighbours, from whom perhaps they might have drawn much knowledge. This is confess'd by their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Books, wherein no Tract of Eruditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is found, as in those of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Nations, who have applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Sciences: Nevertheless, they had had, since the beginning of their Republick, Songs and Verses, in which they celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Praises of God, and related the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of their Nation; witness the Songs of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Book <hi>of the Wars of the Lord,</hi> which was a Collection of Poetry, as it appears by <hi>Iosh.</hi> 10.13. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. therefore nothing extraordinary will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced: if it is said that their Poetry was not very regular, nor very polite, no more than that of the ancient <hi>Arabians:</hi> If it was known in what consisted the Poetry of the Ancient <hi>Egyptians,</hi> one might search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> for the same Rules; for 'tis probable that it could be only there that <hi>Moses</hi> cou'd learn to make Verses. But as we know nothing on't, all that can be done on this occasion, is to seek for the Rules of Poetry of their Neighbours, as we have done, in respect of the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> and to see if the Poetry of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is not the same. But we have shewn that the Hebrew Tongue can suffer no other Poesie than that, and it remains now but to mark the principal Rules thereof, and to apply them to the Poetical Books of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>

                  <p n="3">III. The Poesie of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been reduced into an Art, there cannot be many Rules given thereof, because a great Number of Rules is begun to be observed; but when we have endeavour'd to form them, all that can be said on't, is brought to some general Remarks, which suffice to make known the Nature thereof.</p>

If one wou'd have examples of such Rhimes in some modern Poesie, he may only consult those who have written of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Poesies, wherein <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonants</hi> are called Rhimes, which the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins call <hi>Passables,</hi> and the other <hi>Consonants:</hi> But both of 'em have learned from the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> the Rules of their Poesie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Number of the Rimes is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there are sometimes several of a sort, and fewer of another; so in <hi>Psal.</hi> 11, 3, 5. there are five in <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>mo,</hi> which are only se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by two Rhimes in <hi>ac</hi> of the fourth Verse. There are Psalms whose Verses do end almost all in the same Rhime, as the <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. which endeth almost all in <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>cha.</hi> The <hi>Arabians</hi> have also such Poesies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have several examples, as the Poem entituled <hi>Tagrai,</hi> which all ends in <hi>LI,</hi> that of <hi>abu El-ula,</hi> which ends all in <hi>LA, &amp;c.</hi> The Order of the Rhimes is neither the same in a Psalm, but resembles altogether that of our irregular Verses, which we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose as we please. It may likewise be that in some places they were satisfied with the Cadence, without searching necessarily for a rhime. Indeed there are some places in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> where there are no Rhimes found, tho' the sense seems to want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as at the end of <hi>Psal.</hi> 111, and 112. There are some modern Tongues, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others the <hi>Italian</hi> and the <hi>English,</hi> where there are very good Verses made without rhime, in observing only a certain Cadence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The length of Verses is also seldom the same, and it seems the <hi>Hebrews</hi> did not at all matter it. If perchance two Verses of the same measure present themselves to their mind, they shunned them not, but they did not also seek the equality of measure, which shows that their Poesie was not very polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As the <hi>Hebrews</hi> have not long Periods, their Verses are seldom long, such as are those of the <hi>Psalm</hi> 119. The others are so short, that there are of two Syllables, as in our irregular Verses. It is perhaps for this reason that they call a Hymn <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>

                     <hi>zamar,</hi> which signifies <hi>to cut,</hi> because its Style is extreamly cut, and that for to make the Cadence of the Verses to be felt, we ought several times to stop at a Period: It is true, that this Verse signifies <hi>to sing</hi> in the <hi>Piel,</hi> but the signification of <hi>Piel</hi> comes from that of <hi>Kal.</hi> This day with the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who sing their Verses in cutting them into divers lengths, <hi>zamaria</hi> signifies <hi>to sing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Poesie of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> not being very regular, cannot but be full of Licenses, as to what concerns the Rhimes, whereof the greatest according to the Rabbins, are those which make different Letters to Rhime, but whose Pronunciation is alike. Nevertheless, as their Poesies were rather made for to rehearse them or to sing them, than to read them, they did not so much matter to satisfie the Eyes as the Ears: So though in reading these Verses, one may be offended to see them rhime by different Letters, the Ear being not offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, they made no difficulty to make use of these Rhimes: For example, in the <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.3. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Besides the Rhime, we also remark in the Verses of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> the same Cadence which is seen in our rhimed Verses, only that the lengths are not so well observed in it as in ours, which without this could not be pronounced. But they are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary in the Hebrew Verses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause commonly they are much shorter than ours, and often so short that there can be no cutting off.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As almost all Nations put Verses some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in their Poesies, which are repeated, and which are called in French <hi>le refrein:</hi> We find also of them in the Hebrew Psalms, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. and in <hi>Psal.</hi> 136. but they have perhaps this in particular, that the Verses which are placed between those of the <hi>refrein,</hi> sometimes rhime not together, as may be seen in the last of the two Psalms which we have cited.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They affect sometimes to make their Verses begin by a certain Letter. In <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. the first eight Verses begin by an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the eight following by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and thus after one another unto the end of the Alphabet: In the 37<hi>th.</hi> the same thing is remarked, only that it is but each Stanza, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins by a Letter of the Alphabet, according
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:103507:165"/>
to the Order they are ranged. This made some believe that in some of the Psalms there were <hi>Acrostick</hi> Verses; and indeed it hath been remarked that the first Letters of the Verses of some might form the sense; but the irregularity of the Verses hindering one to be alwayes assured that the beginning of each was discovered; and it being besides possible that these first Letters form a sense by a pure chance, we have dared to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine nothing thereupon.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It's needless here to enlarge upon the Style of the Hebrew Poesie, because it hath scarcely any thing in particular, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be remarked in general of all Poesies. We shall only say, that amongst the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of the Hebrew Poesie one thing hath been found, which is common to it with that of the Greeks, <hi>viz.</hi> it borrows words and wayes of speaking of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dialects, as from the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Tongue: Examples may be seen in the <hi>Psalms, CIII.</hi> 3, 4, 5. <hi>CXVI.</hi> 7, I2. where there are found <hi>Chaldean suffixes.</hi> There is a very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one in <hi>Psal.</hi> 11. whereof mention shall be made hereafter. This Observations is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry important, because it serves for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of divers places, and to Correct some Faults of Copyers, which hinder the Rhime to be found, which appeareth every where else.</p>
                  <p>These Rules being established, I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late here some other particular Proofs, which shall serve to confirm the general ones whereof I have made use, to shew that the Poesie of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> might have been like the ancient Poesie of the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Some Learned Men have made good remarks in the Poetical Books of the Old Testament, of rhimed Verses in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but they believed that pure chance had produced them, without any Pains ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Sacred Writers thereabouts. 1. For to prove clearly that they are mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it would be necessary for me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce here a Work which I have made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Psalms,</hi> where they might be seen reduced into rhimed Verses, and where they are disposed so, that in casting an Eye on them, one may be assured of the truth of the Hypothesis which we have advanced. I have tryed the same thing upon divers places of the other Poetical Books, and the Hymns which are in the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> and the <hi>Iudges:</hi> It succeeded with me happily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, though there are some Places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I could never come to an end, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which I shall mark hereafter. I do not believe that after this one can imagine that these Rhimes were found by chance in the Poesies of the ancient <hi>Hebrews.</hi> It would be impossible for them not to take Notice thereof; and if they did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, why did they rhime every where, if it was not for the sake of their Poesie? We shall give an Example of it at the end of this Essay.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Indeed it is remarked in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the same words are repeated without necessity, to Rhime with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as <hi>hatelouhou</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 150. and a great Number, which cannot be related here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Besides this, there are many words which rhime together, without having a particular connexion with the sense: So <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>abad,</hi> he is <hi>perished,</hi> rhimes in divers places with <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>ad</hi> alwayes. This sheweth clearly that it is not chance, nor the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of expression, which have placed these words near one another, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of making them to rhime; otherwise they would not be found to rhime so often together.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is scarcely any place seen, where a rhime hath not produced such another, and often times two or three, the Phrase not necessarily requiring them; as the Rhime <hi>MO</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. whereof I shall put here seven Verses in Latin Characters, tho' they are but three in the Psalm.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Eth mosrothe <hi>MO,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Venaschliche mimmennou, abothe<hi>MO,</hi>

                     </l>
                     <l>La<hi>MO</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Az jedabber ele<hi>MO</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Bappho oubacharono jebahale<hi>MO.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
                  <p>I believe it cannot be doubted, that the Author of this Psalm hath affected these Rhimes in <hi>MO,</hi> for the third was in no wise necessary; it sufficed to say <hi>jilAG, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jedabber ele</hi>MO; and if it was not even in that the Poesie consisted, these Rhimes must have been shunned, which without this would extreamly offend the Ears, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king use of the <hi>suffix</hi> HEM. Besides this, we shall find plain Examples of this Truth in <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There are places where no Rhime is in the Hebrew Text, and where also the sence is very difficult, and the order of the words contrary to the genius of the Hebrew Tongue: But in putting these words again in their Natural Order, according to the construction, where they ought to be, the sence of them becomes not only fine and clear, but also the Rhime very good; whence we have reason to conclude that these words had been transposed, and that since the rhime agrees with the sense, it is an Argument that it was sought after: Here is word for word the sense of the 5<hi>th.</hi> and 6<hi>th.</hi> Verses of <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. according to the Order they are in this day, <hi>Thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the wicked, thou hast blotted out THEIR Names for ever: O thou Enemy, desolations are come so a perpetual end, and thou hast demolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cities, their memory is perished with them; they</hi> (a Feminine) or, <hi>they</hi> (a Masculine.) All the World may see the difficulty of this Construction, but those who understand He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, may yet much better be assured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in reading the Original. Neither can the Rhime be found in this place, but in making some slight Changes, which may be supported by other paralel Passages, and in
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:103507:166"/>
re-establishing the Rhime, these words form a sense clear and easie, and are found in a regular construction: <hi>Thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast blotted out their Name for ever, the Enemy is perished, the Streets and the Cities are ruined for ever; thou hast destroyed them and their memory:</hi> In these words is a clear sense, which is but darkly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in the preceding ones. Indeed it hath been constantly remarked, that in the most obscure places, it is the hardest to find the Rhime, which makes us reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to believe, that the obscurity comes from some transposition, or from some word forgotten, or a letter omitted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Rhime cannot be found. On the contrary, the sense is easie, almost every where, where the Rhimes are easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found. If the brevity which I am to keep here admitted me, I could give a sufficient Number of Examples, but we shall only bring one at the beginning of the 16<hi>th. Psalm,</hi> which the Version of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> hath rendered thus, in supplying the words which are in Roman Characters: <hi>Keep me, O mighty</hi> God, <hi>for I have trusted in thee:</hi> O my Soul, <hi>thou hast said to God, thou art the Lord, my goodness</hi> extendeth <hi>not to thee, but to the Saints who are on the Earth, and</hi> to <hi>the excellent, in whom I take all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. The sorrows of those who run</hi> after <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God shall be multiplyed,</hi> &amp;c. The sense is obscure enough, and the words are very difficult, in spite of the Supplements which Interpreters have made herein; but the difficulty is yet more sensible in the Hebrew, by reason of the Punctuation of some words, and of some letters which must be ncessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily changed, or added. And this Passage hath given a very great labour to Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, tho'we have seen none of them who hath happily gone through it. It is thought it should be translated thus, after having made the necessary changes in it: <hi>Keep me, O God, for I have hoped in thee; I have said to God, thou art the Lord, my whole trust is in thee! Men have gone in multitudes to the Effeminate (Cynaedi) who are in thy Countrey, great Persons put all their delight in them, they have eagerly multiplyed their Idols with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God,</hi> &amp;c. We shall not undertake to give an account of this Version, for fear of being too long; it is enough for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that in the supposition that this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is just, People do know that the Rhime is excellent, and that it is not otherwise to be found therein.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Those who have some knowledge in the Criticks of the Old Testament, know that in divers places there are found words in the Version of the <hi>LXX,</hi> which are not in the Hebrew. There are some in the Psalms, as well as in the other Books; but what is remarkable, is that in some of these places the Hebrew Text transmitteth not necessary Rhimes; and that if the words be added which are in the Greek Version, the Rhime is found there: By this we see there these words had been omitted by the Copyers in the Hebrew, and that they ought to be put there again: So in <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.4. the <hi>LXX</hi> have twice put <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>it is not so</hi>; whereas this Phrase is but once in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Originals: But it hath been discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by means of the Rhime, that it ought to be twice there. Here is yet another more remarkable place, which in <hi>Psal.</hi> 7.12. where there is according to the Hebrew, <hi>God is a just Iudge, and a God who is angry every day:</hi> There can be no Rhime found in this place, and this description of Divine Justice is not in the ordinary Terms of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Authors, who describe God not only extreamly patient, but also easie to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, and exercising his Wrath but in a moment, whilst his Mercy appears for a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long time, see <hi>Psal.</hi> 30.6. But accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>LXX.</hi> there is no difficulty, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Rhime, nor for the sense, which is here, <hi>God is a just Iudge, patient, and who is not alwayes provoked.</hi> The same is found <hi>Psal.</hi> 134.1. three words in the Version of the <hi>LXX.</hi> which are not in the Hebrew, and which yet are necessary for the Rhime: <hi>All ye Servants of God, who stand in the House of the Lord</hi> (in the Porch of the House of God) <hi>lift up your hands towards the Sanctuary:</hi> Words included amongst Crochets are not found in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and yet they are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Rhime. The repetition of the words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>beth jahvoh, House of the Lord,</hi> seems to have been the cause of this Omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is easie to conceive it for those who have sometimes Copied Writings, where the same words were repeated.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is yet one thing, which may convince those who understand these kinds of matters, that the Poesie of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is a Rhimed Poesie; for there is a place in the Psalms where the Sacred Authors have made use of certain words not much in use among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> or wayes of expressing drawn from the Neighbouring Dialects, in places where the words and expressions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> would make no Rhime, whereas these strange words do Rhime per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well; for example, the Author of <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. made use in <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>bar, Son,</hi> which Rhimes very well with the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>jibar,</hi> which is in the sequel; whereas the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>ben,</hi> which signifies the same thing, and which in <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. would make no Rhime there. So also in <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. the Psalmist speaking to his Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> to himself, speaks in the Feminine, because the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>chi,</hi> in the following Rhimes, because in using the Hebrew <hi>suffixe,</hi> there would have been no Rhime. It is true, that this Rhime in <hi>chi</hi> hath produced three others, but that same sheweth that these Rhimes are sought for, and not lit on by chance.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In treating of the Poesie of the other <hi>Eastern</hi> Tongues, we might mention that of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> Neighbours to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> and whose Tongue was the same as
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:103507:166"/>
theirs; but as what hath been said of the Poesie of the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> is so undoubted, and that what can be said of <hi>Phoenician</hi> Poesie appears not so evident, we have chosen to speak of it here, only as of a consequence, and to make use of the same until we had proved another way that the Poesie of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> could only be a rhim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Poesie. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongues being the same, if the <hi>Hebrews</hi> could only make rhimed Verses, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had none else. There remains no fragment of <hi>Phoenician</hi> Poesie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, but ten lines which are in the <hi>Paenulus</hi> of <hi>Plantus</hi>; for the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue and that of <hi>Carthage</hi> are looked upon to be the same: The Verses having never been written but in Latin Characters, and by Men who understood them not, it cannot be this day promised to re-establish them wholly. It is true, that <hi>Plautus</hi> hath tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated them afterwards into eleven Latin Verses: But first one may conjecture from thence, that there hath been one line lost, because there is a repetition in the Latin Verses, which undoubtedly comes from the <hi>Phoenician,</hi> not being conformable to the Genius of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, but very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the Hebrew Tongue.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Meàsque ut gnatas &amp; <hi>mei fratris filium</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Reperire me siritis, Dii vestram fidem!</l>
                     <l>Quae mihi surreptae &amp; sunt, &amp; <hi>fratris filium.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plautus</hi> would never have repeated <hi>&amp; fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris filium,</hi> if this repetition had not been in the Original. <hi>Secondly, Plautus</hi> seems to have Translated the rest with pretty much liberty, as <hi>Bochart</hi> (who has most happily re-established these Verses) hath shewn: So one ought not to be surprized, if there should be no <hi>Vestiges</hi> of Rhimes found here: Yet there are such considerable ones found in them, that we can scarcely doubt but that they have been true Rhimed Verses: That it may be the more easily known, I shall put them here in Hebrew and Latin Characters, with an English Version, where each Verse is translated word for word. I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed partly <hi>Bochart,</hi> and partly the Versi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Plautus,</hi> rather than the Terms of the Original, as they are in Latin Characters. I shall not undertake to expound in part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular each Verse, because <hi>Bochart</hi> hath part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done it already, and because the Versi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is added thereunto is sufficient. I shall only admonish the Reader of three things: The one is, That each Line of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> written in Latin, contains two Verses, which were joined together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Plautus</hi> hath expressed two of them in one Latin Verse; so that for eleven Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Plautus</hi> there should be twenty two <hi>Phoenician</hi> ones, whereas there are but twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But, as it hath been already said, there is a Line lost, to wit two Verses, this hath been supplyed in Translating the Verse of <hi>Plautus</hi> into two little Verses, which do rhime together as the other. The second thing is, That we know not the Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the <hi>Punick</hi> Tongue, as to what concerns the Vowels, It might be that it came nearer to the <hi>Syriack</hi> or <hi>Arabick</hi> than the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or even that in <hi>Affrick</hi>; some words were pronounced quite otherwise than in <hi>Asia,</hi> as it is now seen in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Dialects of the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, and as its known that the Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> whose Tongue comes from the same source; pronounce the same <hi>Root</hi> quite otherwise in respect to the Vowels, though it retains the same Consonants. So although we can mark here the radical Letters, and that they can be punctuated after the way of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> or that of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> it doth not at all follow that that is the true Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the Words. The Consonants principally ought to be taken heed of, and consider if they might have been pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced so that they rhime together. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who could tell if <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> hath been pronounced <hi>benothai,</hi> or <hi>benothi,</hi> or <hi>benothe?</hi> It sufficeth therefore to make the following Verses by a word which ends in <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, seeing it's not known after what manner the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> pronounced this Termination. The third thing which ought to be Noted here, regards the places wherein we have swerved from the Conjectures of <hi>Bochart.</hi> We have a little disagreed with him in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses 3, 4, 5, 11, 17, and 32, besides the 9<hi>th.</hi> and 10<hi>th,</hi> which have been added. It's needless to stay to tell the reason of every change; those who would know, if they are just, need only to compare these Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with those disposed by <hi>Bochart,</hi> as he thought they should have been. We can only Note that in <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="5">V. After all these Proofs, it's thought it may be concluded without fear of a mistake, that the Poesie of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is nothing else but a rhimed Poesie. This Essay might end here, if it was not thought necessary to take off some difficulties, which undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall spring in the mind of part of those who shall read it. The one respects the Musick of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and the others the manner of discovering in what their Poesie consisteth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to what concerns Musick, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends much more on the particular Genius of each Nation, than of certain constant Rules, so it cannot be guessed what <hi>Times</hi> the <hi>Hebrews</hi> might give to their Songs. It's well seen by the multitude of their Hymns, and the History of <hi>David,</hi> that they had some Passion for Musick, but we do not see that they ever writ any thing on't; and if they had written on't, it would be hard to understand their meaning: And as we can't not as much as conjecture how they might sing their Verses; so what hath been said of their Poesie would not be less certain. We know that the Grecians have in times past sung their Verses, and that they have been even compos'd from their Musick, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which there remains some pieces amongst us: That notwithstanding hath not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, but it hath been entirely lost, and that it is impossible to find what <hi>Tunes</hi> were given to the Odes of <hi>Pindarus.</hi> If some Body shewed <hi>Chinese</hi> Verses to the best Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician of <hi>Europe,</hi> they could not guess in what their Musick consists, even the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese</hi> could not sing our Verses: That which is still more surprizing in this is, that they laugh at our Musick as we laugh at theirs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it were said that the Musick of the Ancient <hi>Hebrews</hi> was not very regular, 'tis nothing but what is like to be true; it was a Nation given altogether to the Care of Agriculture, which had neither Theaters nor publick Divertisements of this kind. All the publick Use it made of Musick, was in the singing of the Sacred Hymns instituted by <hi>David,</hi> and nothing obligeth us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that this singing was very harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and very methodical. At this day the Jews do sing in their Synagogues their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers very confusedly, and they read even Scripture in singing, whether it be Prose or Verse. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> sing also their Alcoran, because 'tis all compos'd of Verse: Nor does the Hebrew Prose want it, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently for the same reason that the Jews sing it from an immemorial time, as well as their Books of Poesies, tho' they know not in what the Poesie of the Bible consists.</p>
                  <p>One might even go further, and say downright, that the Musick of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was not very fine; suppose that the <hi>LXX.</hi> and <hi>St. Ierom</hi> have Translated well a place of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and that we understand well the Names of the Instruments whereof they made use, because these Instruments could not make but a very confused and disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Musick. Thus the Author of this Book describes the Consort, which <hi>David</hi> caused to be made in conducting the Ark, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Version of <hi>St. Ierom: David autem &amp; omnis Israel ludebant coram Domino
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:103507:167"/>
in omnibus lignis fabrefactis, &amp; cytharis, &amp; lyris &amp; tympanis, &amp; sistris &amp; cymbalis:</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and all <hi>Israel</hi> played before the Lord with all sorts of Instruments made of Wood, Harps, Lutes, Drums, Tymbrels (<hi>these Instruments shall be spoken of hereafter</hi>) and Cymbals.</q>
According to the <hi>LXX,</hi> one must Translate thus the Names of these Instruments; <hi>Cynares,</hi> (an Instrument of ten Strings, which was touched with an Archet, according to the relation of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>;) <hi>Nables,</hi> (an Instrument with twelve sounds, which was touched with Fingers, according to the same;) <hi>Drums,</hi> (perhaps as our Drums of <hi>Basque</hi>;) <hi>Cymbals,</hi> (Drums of <hi>Basque</hi> of Brass, which were beaten with Fingers) and <hi>Flutes.</hi> But these Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have Translated this place only upon chance, as a great many more, without knowing exactly what instruments are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of here, and the last words, to wit, <hi>Tsiltsel</hi> signifies not <hi>a Flute,</hi> but <hi>a Cymbal</hi> or a <hi>Timbrel.</hi> The <hi>Rabbins</hi> represent the Musick of the Temple in the same manner, upon which <hi>Lightfoot</hi> may be consulted in his Book <hi>of the Service of the Temple,</hi> ch. 7. sect. 2. they say that Voices were added to these Instruments, and mark the Psalms which were sung each day of the Week, and on the principal Festivals: But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not much confide in what they say, as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Learned Men have shewn. All that we would conclude from hence, is, that though it should be said that the Musick of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was very confused, to judge of it by ours, nothing would be said but what may be maintained by the very Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Jews.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thus tho' it were agreed that the singing of the Hebrew Verses, such as they are conceived, would not be very pleasing to our Ears, if it were possible to revive their Musick, there would be nothing which wou'd appear surprizing in it: But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their Musick was better than it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, by the Descriptions which we have of it, who should have hindered them to give Tunes to their irregular Verses, like unto those which we give to ours. It will be granted undoubtedly that their Musick had been pretty pleasing, if it had equall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Musick of our <hi>Opera</hi>'s, which are all composed of irregular Verses. Tho' the Musick of the <hi>Greeks</hi> hath been so much boasted of, and the Tunes of their Lyrick Poesie, which is almost all composed of Verses or equal Couplets, or of Strophes, or of regulated Antistrophes; a Cadence which alwayes returneth, and a Tune which we hear twenty times successively, does not please as much as a varied Cadence, and a change of Verses almost perpetual, such as ought to be in irregular Verses.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. An excellent Musician in reading an Opera, whose Musick he should not have seen, could perhaps sometimes, by the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Cadence of the Verses, find out ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near what sort of Tune should be given in looking for that which would be most proper unto them. It might also be very well that in some Composures the Cadence of the Hebrew Verses, which is pretty sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, by reason of their smallness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality, could make one guess at the Tune they had, or at least draw near it in some manner: So if we read <hi>Psal.</hi> 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. as it ought, so that its Cadence may be rendered sensible, there are few Persons who have their Ear good, who judge not that the words of this Psalm are extreamly proper for that which is called a Tune of <hi>Fanfare,</hi> [i. e. <hi>the sound of Trumpets</hi>] hence arose the Thought of Translating the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verses into irregular <hi>French</hi> Verses, which have just the same Number of Syllables, and to put thereto a Tune of this Nature. Not that it is believed it had with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> that same Tune which will be found here; but we may conjecture with a great like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, that it had a like one, because the Hebrew words are very proper for a Tune of <hi>Fanfare,</hi> and could hardly suffer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>If the Instruments were well known which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> used, there might perhaps be said something more exact upon their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick; but as we have but a very small know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in't, we are obliged to hold to these general Idea's, which are sufficient for us on this occasion, where we have no other design but to shew that they would easily sing irregular Verses, such as are those which we have attributed to them.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. There remains no more, but some only difficulties which may be objected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the manner whereby this Poesie was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. It may at first be said, that it seems strange, that so many ancient and modern learned Persons, who have sought with Care the Secrecy of the Hebrew Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, could not think of a thing so easie as Rhimes: But this is but a difficulty of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysick, which proves nothing, but that these Learned Men did bring hereupon the attention which they ought. It hath been observ'd several times, that by too much seeking for a Mystery, in a thing easie of it self, hath rendered it difficult: It would suffice thus to answer this difficulty, and to oppose thereto the thing it self, in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the whole Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> disposed into Rhimed Verses, as it may be easily done, and as perhaps it may be done some time or other: But now this difficulty may be resolved by the following Remarks.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not absolutely true, that all the Learned have not at all perceived the Rhimes of the Hebrew Poesie, <hi>Buxtorf</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked something thereof, as it may be seen in the beginning of his <hi>Prosodie</hi>; but he thought that chance had formed them, because he hath remarked but some, and where the Verses are equal. There hath been besides an Author cited, named <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Herbert, de Poetica Hebraica,</hi> who hath remarked more of them, but we have not seen his Book, and it is judged by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which we read on't, that he hath
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:103507:168"/>
not drawn from these Rhimes the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence this Essay hath done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Augustin Steuchus</hi> of <hi>Engubio,</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face upon the <hi>Psalms,</hi> had remarked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, in terms much more express,
<q>That the Poesie of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is not the same as that of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> as the <hi>Italian</hi> Poesie is not the same with the <hi>Latin.</hi> The <hi>Latins</hi> do observe after the imitation of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the quantity of the Syllables; the <hi>Hebrews</hi> do not so, but take heed only of their Number and Cadence.</q>
We see not nevertheless that <hi>Steuchus</hi> hath undertaken to reduce Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Books of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> into rhimed Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, no more than <hi>Lewis Cappel,</hi> who hath not disapproved of the Thought of this learned Man.</p>
                  <p>Some have also believed that <hi>St. Ierom</hi> had observed Rhimes in the Hebrew Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, because he hath said in his Preface up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Iob, Interdum quoque Rythmus ipse dulcis &amp; tinnulus, fertur numeris pedum solutis. Buxtorf</hi> hath thought that <hi>Rythmus</hi> signified what we now call <hi>Rhime,</hi> but he might learn of all those who have treated of <hi>Prosodie,</hi> that this word doth not only signifie <hi>Cadence. Ioseph Scaliger</hi> also made use of this same word in this Sence, in the place which hath been cited of him, <hi>Quantum sententia postulat, rythmus nunc longior, nunc brevior est:</hi> He means that the Verses are more or less long, and consequently that the Cadence hath more or less extent, according as the sence demands more or less words: Yet Mr. <hi>Ferrand</hi> censures him in his Preface up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the<hi>Psalms,</hi> as if he had understood Rhimes thereby. <hi>Scaliger</hi> was too good a Grecian to commit such a Fault as that. Mr. <hi>Ferrand</hi> then was mistaken in the sence he gave to the words of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> as he is also mistaken in what he adds after <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> that if there are Rhimes in the Poesies of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> it is but by chance. What hath been said, sheweth sufficiently the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and this Remark is made but upon the occasion of the Term <hi>Rythmus,</hi> whereof we thought we should say a word, fearing that some being mistaken in the sence which is given it in the modern Languages, should without reason think that we were obliged to cite <hi>St. Ierom</hi> and <hi>Scaliger.</hi> But we have undertaken to refute no body, because then there should be made a Book on purpose for that, which would be very unusefull, after the direct Proofs which have been rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the <hi>Psalms</hi> shall be seen dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in form of Rhimed Verses, it will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be imagined that there was nothing so easie as to find these Rhimes; But that which appears easie, after it hath been expounded, was often very difficult be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Exposition. Enigma's are clear as the day, when we see the mystery of them, and we often wonder that we could not understand them at first sight, when we learn what they signifie. It is the same with the Poesie of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; the difficulties which hindered its discovery being taken away, nothing will appear so easie, but this is what rendered the discovery. The Verses are not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in the Books of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but written all after one another, even as Prose, which was the Cause that tho' we knew that certain Books are Poesies, yet it hath been insensibly forgotten in what these Verses consisted, and how they could be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished. Two things besides have much contributed to this: The one is, that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of these Verses are extreamly short; and the other is, that their Rhimes are not always very happy. If one writ at length irregular <hi>Spanish</hi> Verses composed of <hi>assonant</hi> Rhimes, there are very few People who could guess them to be Verses, if the Style did not make it known, and without a good knowledge in <hi>Spanish</hi> Poesie, it would scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be possible to distinguish between the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and end of these Verses. It is the same with the <hi>Italian</hi> irregular Verses, which rhime sometimes, and sometimes the rhime is neglected, as is thought fit. We are well assured that very few <hi>Vltromon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> could in the form of Verses write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain this Period of a famous <hi>Italian</hi> Poesie, <hi>Tempesto so furor non fù mai Pira in magnanimo petto; ma un fiato sol di generoso affetto, che spirando ne l'alma, quando é piu con la ragione unita, la desta e rende á le bell opre ardita.</hi> As in this would appear but four Rhimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst so many words, it would be suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either that some of them were lost, or that those which are in it came by chance: Yet these are six Verses which may be read in <hi>Scene</hi> V. of the V. <hi>Act.</hi> of <hi>Pastor Fido.</hi> To this must be added, that to find out the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ending of Verses thus written, one must know how to pronounce them, which is not easie for Strangers, as all those who have some knowleege in <hi>Italian</hi> Poesie are sensible. And it is a thing which is yet more difficult as to the Hebrew Tongue, whose Pronunciation is as rude as that of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Tongue is sweet: So the manner of writing Poesies without distinction of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, their inequality, the smallness of some, the neglected Rhimes, or omitted, and the difficulty of the Pronunciation, were Obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles great enough to hinder the easie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangling the Hebrew Verses.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hereby we see that though Copiers should have Committed never a Fault, it would be still hard to find out these Verses: But we ought to Judge that the Copyers might have sometimes without thinking on't transpose the Order of words, not knowing the measure of the Verses they did Copy. So we see that the ancient Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts, not only of the Greek and Latin Authors, who have written in Prose, but also Poets, whose Verses have no very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Cadence, vary extreamly amongst themselves in the disposition of the words. Hereupon may be consulted the Lyrick and Dramatick Poets of the Greeks and Latins, where the Learned have often remarked some Transpositions. If there have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened such changes in the Books of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:103507:168"/>
and Latins, which have been carefully enough Copied, and by Copiers who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood well those two Tongues, it may be easily judged that the Hebrew Tongue being lost in the Captivity, and the Books of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> having been Transcribed by Copyers who understood them but by halves, there wou'd some slight changes have slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thereinto, which though they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the sense, would yet disorder the Verse. We think we can shew that there are in effect some transpositions of words in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> which do quite disorder the Rhime, and which render the sense more difficult; an Example on't hath been rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heretofore, drawn from <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. Thus in <hi>Psal.</hi> 71. <hi>ver.</hi> 6, and following, the rhimes are disturbed, and the sense less clear: The Version of <hi>Geneva</hi> hath thus Translated this place, <hi>I shall speak of thy Iustice only: O God, thou hast taught me from my Youth, and hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to have I declared thy wonders: Now also when I am old and grey-headed, O God, forsake me not!</hi> &amp;c. It's easily observ'd, that these words are entangled, but it will be yet easier, if the Original is read, where one will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find out as much as <hi>disjecti membra Poetae:</hi> On the contrary, in disposing them so that the Rhime may be found, they are Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated thus, <hi>Lord, thou art the only God, I will celebrate thy Iustice, I will declare thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: O God, thou hast instructed me from my Childhood until now: O God, for sake me not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Old Age,</hi> &amp;c. Not that there was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent need of transposing the words, to find the Rhimes, it hath almost always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it self without that; but a transpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, as that which offers it self by chance to one who seeks whether the Psalms are composed of rhimed Verses, is sufficient to make him believe that if there be rhimes in them, the Hebrew Poets made them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any heed thereto.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Besides the Transpositions which may happen in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> there may also be some places where the Copyers have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one word for another, or have even forgotten some. Those who have a little understanding in Criticks, or who have sometimes examined the Varieties of reading of the New Testament, which are in the Editions of <hi>Courcelles,</hi> or in that of <hi>Oxford,</hi> will easily agree hereunto; and those who would deny the possibility of these kinds of oversights, should shew how that which is happened in respect of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (transcribed by Christian Copyers, whose Mother Tongue was the Greek) was impossible, in respect to the Psalms; which have been Copyed since the Captivity, by Copyers who only knew the Hebrew by Study. But it is not only very possible that the Copyers have committed some Faults that indeed happened, as <hi>Cappel</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others have shewn: To be convinced hereof, we only need to compare <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. with 53. which certainly are the same, and it will be found that the 14<hi>th.</hi> is the less cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, that there are some words missing in it, and that the Copyers have been mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in some others, which hath wholly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the sense and the rhime: Besides, we need but to compare <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. such as it is in the Collection of the Psalms, with the same Psalm, as it is related in <hi>ch.</hi> 22. of the 2<hi>d.</hi> Book of <hi>Samuel.</hi> Those who can read Hebrew, may remark there more than fifty examples of Omissions, of Transpositions, or of words taken one for the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the resemblance of some Letters.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Lewis Cappel</hi> hath treated on this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with so much Care in his <hi>Sacred Criticks,</hi> that it would be useless to stop at it after him: He hath also shewn that the Point Vowels of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are of the Invention of the <hi>Masorites,</hi> and that they have not Pointed well some places, which is also one of the Reasons for which it hath been hard to discover the Secret of the Poesie of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> For Example, in the first Verse of the Psalms, they have put <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>halach</hi> for <hi>holech,</hi> which lost the rhime. It is true, one ought not to swerve from their Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without reason, and that if there are formed some rhimes in Pointing otherwise, it is good to give some Example thereof, as may be done concerning the Rhime whereof we speak, and even of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the true sound of divers Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els is not well known, as of the <hi>Kamets mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> which seems to have been pronounced as an <hi>O,</hi> perhaps sometimes as an <hi>A,</hi> just as the <hi>Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ha</hi> and the <hi>Damme</hi> of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> have each two sounds, which can only be known by Use in divers obvious places.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Masorites</hi> have purposely changed the Punctation of some words, as that of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which comes into the Psalms very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and whose true Pronunciation must be necessarily known, to discover the Rhime. <hi>Cappel</hi> hath shewn that it ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Iahvoh,</hi> and it hath been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the necessity of the Rhime, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of the Psalms.</p>
                  <p>Thereby we see that the Rhimes have been necessarily very much disordered by the Punctation of the <hi>Masorites,</hi> and the same thing ought to be observed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cadence. They have diminished or augmented the Number of Syllables, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Scheva <hi>moveable</hi> or <hi>quiescent,</hi> under certain Syllables which were otherwise Point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in times past, as appears by an infinity of proper Names, as <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>schlomo</hi> for <hi>schala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> as divers Learned Men have already remarked.</p>
                  <p>These difficulties, which have until now hindered the discovery of the Cadence and Rhimes of the Hebrew Verses, hinder also our hopes of re-establishing them perfectly; for although they may be surmounted in part, no man can promise himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ridiculous temerity, to surmount them all. But it sufficeth, I think, to shew by clear places, which are in great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, what may be supposed of those, which we grant we cannot well go through. There are places in the Fragments which remain amongst us of the ancient Dramatique Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:103507:169"/>
both Greeks and Latins, which shew evidently what sort of Verses they used, though in some places it is not possible to re-establish them: We therefore do declare that we in no wise do flatter our selves of having, or of being able to put in their true Order all the Poesies of Holy Writ: But it may be said, that it's believed we may apply to three quarters of these Poesies the Rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s which we have given, and convince after a sensible manner those who may doubt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>reof.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We have nothing more to remark here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon except one thing, which comes not from the difficulty of the Hebrew Poesie in it self, as the precedent, but from a false Judgment which some Ancients have made on this subject; which is, that knowing no other Poesie but that of the Greeks and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, they have falsly judged that that of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> should resemble it. It is a Fault which St. <hi>Ierom</hi> hath committed, as may be seen by what he saith on't in his <hi>Preface upon Iob</hi> and elsewhere: 'Tis true, 'tis not he that speaks thus the first, he cites <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> and <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who had said the same thing as he; and the last could defend themselves by the Authority of <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Iosephus.</hi> This Historian assureth, that the Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> which is in the 15<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> is in Hexameter Verses: But there is nothing so far from truth, and it is not the only Mark which <hi>Iosephus</hi> hath given, that he understood but very little the Hebrew of Scripture no more than <hi>Philo.</hi> It may be also he spoke thus to accommodate himself with the Heathens, whose Sacred Hymns were ordinarily in Hexameter Verses, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by those which are attributed to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and by those of <hi>Callimachus.</hi> Others have already marked in divers places where this Author accommodates himself to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and Opinions of the Pagans; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be through ignorance in the Hebrew, or to make himself understood by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, that <hi>Iosephus</hi> hath spoken thus: It's certain there is no Hexametrum in <hi>Moses,</hi> as those who know a little Hebrew, and know how to scan Hexameter Verses may assure themselves. On the contrary, all this Song was disposed into pretty good rhimes, and it might be published so if it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> who found Lyrick Verses in the Psalms, seems to be of this Opinion, because others had said it before him: For it was the Custom to Copy <hi>Origen,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out too much examining, if what he Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed was true or not, as he confesseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Some Learned Men have notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing essayed to excuse him, and amongst others <hi>Steuchus</hi> and <hi>Cappel</hi>; but it seems it were better to grant downright that he was mistaken herein, as in several other things, not being able in no wise to pass for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Author, and one who saith nothing but after a mature examination.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. What we have said of the Ignorance of <hi>Iosephus</hi> and <hi>Philo,</hi> and what hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced of the Errors of the Copyers, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth a thing which we think should be marked here more distinctly, for to take away the scruples which may arise from thence in the mind of Persons, who have only a superficial Knowledge of the Criticks of Holy Writ, <hi>viz.</hi> People imagine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly that the ancient <hi>Hebrews</hi> had a very great Care of their Books, and that the Jews have never discontinued to Study with application to the Hebrew Tongue; thence it's concluded that the Originals which we have now, have been so well preserved, and transcribed by so able men, that the very New Testament is not almost so Correct as the Old. But these Prejudices will be laid aside, which are founded upon nothing else but the Authority of the modern Jews, and upon some reasons of Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>physicks, if we consider with Attention these six things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The Law of <hi>Moses</hi> hath almost ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been observed with any exactness by the Jews, as their History, and the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the Prophets use against them thereupon, do clearly shew it. So although <hi>Moses</hi> had Ordered the Kings to have always a Copy of the Law for their Instruction, this Law was so little observed, that <hi>Iosias</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reigned eighteen Years, knew not what the Book of the Law contained; see 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.10. It appears by this History, that the Copy which was kept in the Temple was not to be found, and that it was not read, as it should have been; whence it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be concluded that the Jews had no great Care for their Books in that time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though several Ancients have said that <hi>Esdras</hi> re-established the Sacred Books, which had been neglected during the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and formed thereof a Volume which was preserved from that time in the state wherein it is; yet if the Genealogies be examined carefully, which are in the Book of <hi>Esdras,</hi> there will be Omissions found in it, which can only come from the Negligence of the Copyers, as that of <hi>Ch.</hi> 7.3. where there are three ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations omitted in the Genealogy of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras.</hi> There is moreover so great a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Calculation betwixt the Books of <hi>Esdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> touching the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those who returned from the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, that there is no means of resolving this difficulty, but in saying that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyers have not been so exact as they should, in describing these Books.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ought to remark, that since that time Hebrew was no more spoken, but Chaldean, amongst the Jews, so that the Hebrew Tongue could not be known, but is Studying it. In those Ages they had not opportunity to Study a dead Tongue, by those assistances which have been invented since, seeing there were neither Dictionaries nor Grammars, and it was but by an Oral Tradition that the Knowledge thereof was preserved, as the Jews have also done seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages. It is manifest that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to acquire by this means an exact Knowledge of the Hebrew Tongue; for
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:103507:169"/>
without a fixed Grammar, one is mistaken at every moment in the Construction of words, and without a Dictionary one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily forgets the signification of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of terms, and chiefly of those which are but once in Scripture, or whose sense is not clearly determined by the sequel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It must be acknowledged, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had not at that time the Use of Points, so that retaining the Pronunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words of the old Hebrew Tongue but by heart, it was impossible but a great deal of Changes should happen therein. <hi>Lewis Cappel</hi> hath clearly proved the one and the other, in his Treatise of the Points of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and in his Sacred Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If some Books of the Hebrew Text be compared with the Version of the <hi>LXX,</hi> it will be found that these Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have Translated an infinity of places by guessing, without knowing well the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the terms which they Translated, that they went ill enough through the hard places, where they have made in their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion nothing but pure gallima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fry, that they have not often understood the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the words; that finally either they had a Copy written very neglectfully, or that they have unseasonably taken some words for other some, in a very great Number of places. I know full well that Learned Men have endeavour'd to excuse some of their Faults, and that they have even shewn that they were often censur'd unreasonably; but its certain there is an infinity of unexcusable Faults, and its what may be clearly seen in the <hi>Critical Notes</hi> of <hi>Lewis Cappel,</hi> which are now in the Press, where he hath compared the Version of the <hi>LXX.</hi> with the Hebrew. As he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth justly that much light may be drawn from this Version, that its manner of reading is sometimes the best, and that the Copyers have done it much wrong, he remarks so great a Number of absurdities in it, that it is impossible but to doubt that the Copy whereof they made use was not of the best, nor they very skilfull in the Hebrew Tongue: Notwithstanding, the Jews used this Version before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jesus Christ, and the respect they had for it, sheweth clearly that they had extreamly neglected the Study of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tongue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Study of the Jews of that time, and in the following Ages, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only in the Ceremonial Law, Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Allegories, nothing being remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Writings which may make one suspect that they were skilfull in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Knowledge and Criticks, if it be lawfull to speak thus of the Hebrew Tongue. It is seen even in the time of St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> they had no exact Grammar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in his Version he often offends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the common and undoubted Rules, and commits the same Faults which have been remarked in the <hi>LXX,</hi> particularly in the difficult places, he hath commonly no regard to any Construction, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself out of trouble by some obscure Phrase. The Admirers of St. <hi>Ierom</hi> and the <hi>LXX.</hi> will find perhaps these Terms somewhat bold, but in facts as clear as the day; why should not things be called by their Names?</p>
                  <p>It's needless to extend further upon this matter, because what we have said sufficeth to make it understood why the secrecy of the Hebrew Poesie hath been so long hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. If any one should draw any ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence from the Principles we have set down, we declare we acknowledge none of these consequences; and those who may believe these consequenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s are well drawn, are desired to consult the two Works of <hi>Cappel,</hi> who hath been already cited seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, where he hath shewn that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion can only draw great advantages from the Disquisitions of Criticks, which some Persons either malicious or unskilfull, have unseasonably endeavour'd to decry: In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, as those are, History ought to be consulted, as also ancient Monuments, and we ought to build thereupon, and not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to reason, and then to contradict History, because it is not conformable to these Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. That the Reader might see an Essay of the Poesie of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> we have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. <hi>Psal.</hi> CL. which is short, and which is visibly in rhime, and it hath been put into a Tune proper to the words, as we have already Noted. As to what concerns the Version in French Verses, the Author was satisfied to keep the sense in general, and the Number of Syllables, without sticking too much to the words, because he would but give an example of a Poesie like to that of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> So the Names of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments which are in the French Verses answer not to those of the Hebrew Verses, but they agree better amongst themselves, and are chosen according to the Rules of our Musick.</p>

                     <hi>Seldeni Otia Theologica,</hi> &amp;c. at <hi>Amsterdam: in quatuor Libris.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis Work is very Curious, and very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to those that don't care for the trouble of gathering dispers'd Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als together: The Author, who is very Learned, and has read much, spares them the trouble, and gives them his Opinion, as well as that of many others upon a great Number of Critical Questions in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. Thus I ought to call the Subject of this great Treatise: For altho' he there explains some places of Divinity generally receiv'd, he does it not after the way of the Schools; he very ingeniously discourses upon sacred and prophane Antiquity: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, the generality of the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions entirely respect certain Persons, or matters of Fact, which the Scripture speaks of, or of certain things which are different from common receiv'd Notions in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>As to what regards the Sentiments of the Author, we ought to acknowledge this on his behalf, that he proposes them with much modesty, and makes use of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest liberty which Men of Learning may safely do.</p>
                  <p>He is very exact in citing those that he borrows any thing from, and desires the Reader not to take this exactness as an Ostentation of his Learning, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a better way than barely to cite such Authors as are serviceable to him.</p>
                  <p>He divides his Work into four Parts, which in all contain forty one Dissertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in each of which many different Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are Treated on, as happens in Persons who know much, or who wou'd divert the Reader with variety of Objects. We shou'd almost make a Book it self, if we shou'd speak to every one of the Dissertations: It shall suffice to give the Analysis of the first; where it is examined who was the first Writer, and a Judgment may be made of the rest by this Piece.</p>
                  <p>The first thing this Author does, is to relate the Dispute formerly rais'd amongst the Doctors, concerning the Prophecy of <hi>Enoch,</hi> which the Apostle St. <hi>Iude</hi> makes mention of: Some said this Patriarch's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was committed to Writing, others maintain the contrary; many Fathers, and especially St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> was of the first Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they often spoke of the Book of <hi>Enoch:</hi> Some have made no difficulty to hold it as Canonical, and wou'd prove by it that the Angels begat the Giants, by the Commerce they had with Women. There are some which say the Prophecy of <hi>Enoch</hi> contained four thousand and eighty two Lines, and that it spoke of all that shou'd happen to the Posterity of the Patriarchs, of the Crimes and Chastisements of the <hi>Iews,</hi> of the Death that they shou'd make the Messiah suffer, of their being dispersed through all the World, and of the second Coming of Jesus Christ to judge Mankind. They also pretended they found many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Opinions, and that <hi>Noah</hi> had taken a great deal of Care to secure this Work in the Ark.</p>
                  <p>After that the Author relates also many more ridiculous Fancies; some have said that the Angel <hi>Raziel,</hi> Tutor to <hi>Adam,</hi> gave him a Book containing all Sciences, and that after he was put out of the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> he had it again, suffering him to touch it at his humble Entreaties. Others say that <hi>Adam</hi> did not receive this Book 'till after he had sinned, then having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought God Almighty to grant him some
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:103507:172"/>
small Consolation in the unhappy State he had reduced himself to; they say, that three days after he had thus begg'd of God, the Angel <hi>Raziel</hi> brought him a Book, which discovered to him all the Secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Power how to Command both good and bad Angels, and the four parts of the Earth, of Interpreting Dreams and Prodigies, and foretelling whatsoever was to happen in the time to come: They say also that this Book pass'd from Father to Son, 'till it fell into the Hands of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and that it gave to this learned Prince the Virtue of Building the Temple, by means of the Worm <hi>Zamir,</hi> without making use of any Instrument of Iron.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> afterwards speaks of those two Celebrated Pillars that some say the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of <hi>Seth</hi> built, to engrave upon them the Discoveries that they made in the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. He also speaks of the suppositious Books of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> that <hi>Postulus</hi> forg'd in the last Age; of the Book that <hi>Philo</hi> makes mention of as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, which was Translated from Hebrew into Latin by <hi>Ritangelius</hi>; of the Book that is entituled <hi>The Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs,</hi> and the Fable of the <hi>Rabbini,</hi> who said God writ his Law two thousand Years before the Creation of the World: He might have added to all these Fabulous Works, the Testament of <hi>Iacob,</hi> the Ladder of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> (which was a Book very much esteem'd amongst certain Hereticks call'd <hi>Ebionites</hi>) the Books of <hi>Enoch</hi> upon the Elements, and some other Philosophical Subjects; those of <hi>Noah</hi> upon the Mathematicks, and Sacred Ceremonies; those that they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Abraham</hi> teaching Philosophy in the Valley of <hi>Mamre</hi> to those he lead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the five Kings that had taken <hi>Lot</hi> his Nephew Prisoner. Father <hi>Kircher</hi> says, that the <hi>Abyssins</hi> pretended to have all these Books, and a great Number of others, in the Library of the Monastery of the Holy Cross upon Mount <hi>Amara,</hi> and that the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> received them as a Present from <hi>Solomon.</hi> They pretend more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that she Composed many Books that they have in the same Library, and that she had a Son born by <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was Prince <hi>Melilech,</hi> that had also Compos'd many Books they had in the same place. Those who cannot get the Works of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Kircher,</hi> may find what I have said, in a Treatise of Bibliotheques publish'd 1680. If the <hi>Abyssines</hi> had only said that <hi>Solomon</hi> gave many Books to the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> and that he lay with her, they wou'd have said nothing so very improbable; for a Prince so Learned as he was, and which is more, an Author of such a multitude of Books, wou'd not without doubt, send a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a Princess so Curious as the Queen, without giving her a Copy of his Works, and some other rare Treatises: Besides, he hated not the Sex, and perhaps she was touched with the same desire, and a long time after that obliged the Queen of the <hi>Amazon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> to make a Visit to <hi>Alexander.</hi> And it is apparent enough that <hi>Solomon</hi> had as much Complaisance as the King of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>: But these are things which are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant, that all the World may be permitted to believe what they please of it.</p>
                  <p>The Author then considers the Vanity of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who gave 100000 Years Antiquity to their Writings, and sends us to <hi>St. Augustin,</hi> who refutes them in his eighteenth Book of the <hi>City of God,</hi> the 29<hi>th.</hi> Chapter. He relates what was said of <hi>Zoroaster,</hi> concerning the making of a Book entituled <hi>The Similitude,</hi> which was edged with Gold, and required for a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering twelve hundred and sixty Oxes Hides; some think this <hi>Zoroaster</hi> was <hi>Cham</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah.</hi> He omits not that it was said of <hi>Trismegistus,</hi> that he had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed twenty five thousand Volumes, or else thirty six thousand five hundred and twenty five; and that the Science of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in which <hi>Moses</hi> was so well Vers'd, was contained in this great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Books, and that <hi>Moses</hi> himself took some thoughts from 'em to insert in the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> He forgets not likewise to speak of the <hi>Sybil,</hi> Daughter (or rather Daughter-in-Law) to <hi>Noah,</hi> nor the Book of <hi>Iob,</hi> according to some writ before <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>; for there are some which pretend that <hi>Moses</hi> found it perfect at <hi>Iethro</hi>'s his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law, in the Land of <hi>Midian,</hi> and thinking it proper to Comfort the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> in their Misery, he took it with him into <hi>Egypt</hi> to show it them. Mr. <hi>Huet</hi> dissents from this Opinion, and believes only that <hi>Moses</hi> Composed the History of <hi>Iob</hi> during the Servitude of his Brethren, to the end to propose to them a great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Patience and Hope.</p>
                  <p>After all these ridiculous and fabulous Traditions, the Author concludes that there is great probability that the Custom of writing Books was in use before <hi>Moses</hi>'s time, but nevertheless that the Pentateuch is the most Ancient of all Canonical Books, and even of all Books whatsoever that are now extant. He maintains that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Enoch</hi> was not written, and that St. <hi>Iude</hi> had no knowledge of it, only by inspiration; that the Book that formerly bore the Name of this Patriarch, was made by some Cheat, and that St. <hi>Augustin</hi> did not well consider the Text of the Apostle, since he makes him say that <hi>Enoch</hi> writ Prophecies. He makes the same Judgment of the other Works that go under the Name of the Patriarchs: As to the two Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Descendants from <hi>Seth,</hi> he is of their Opinion who conclude it to be one of the oversights of <hi>Iosephus</hi>; he also takes occasion by this to reproach him with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving corrupted the sense of a Passage of <hi>Moses</hi> to flatter the Idolaters; 'tis where he <note n="*" place="margin">

have no certainty, and after having rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a long passage of Mr. <hi>Huet</hi>'s, who believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he should find <hi>Moses</hi> not only in <hi>Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster,</hi> but also in all the false Gods, and in all the first Heathen Poets, he gives his own Judgment upon this Opinion with much equity. He shows after that by a Passage of <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s, that <hi>Moses</hi> having lived in the time of <hi>Cecrops,</hi> the first King of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> he was before the most ancient Greek Poets, <hi>Orpheus, Linus</hi> and <hi>Museus,</hi> and gives the Reason why some maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Cecrops</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> was the same Person. He says also, that nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain can be established concerning the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Mercurius Trismegis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ne, Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> observes, that that Treatise of <hi>Origen</hi>'s is a suppositious Work, which says the Book of <hi>Iob</hi> was found in the House of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Father-in-law. Our Author refutes those that believed <hi>Iob</hi> was the same with <hi>Iobab,</hi> in the 36<hi>th.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> who was the great Grand-son of <hi>Esau:</hi> He does not believe <hi>Iob</hi> Composed his History him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, because it is writ in Verse, and he does not disapprove the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Huet</hi> upon it, who says that <hi>Moses</hi> having Collected divers Memoirs which were in Manuscript, concerning the Life of <hi>Iob,</hi> and heard upon that the Relation of many Persons, composed a Work with all these Materials. We shall hardly give Credit to this Proof that the Author makes use of; for altho' he had a very great reason to say, that a Man in such Afflictions as <hi>Iob</hi> was, cou'd not entertain his Friends in Verse, yet a Poetical Discourse is as likely on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion as in those that are recited in <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies,</hi> or sung in <hi>Opera's</hi>; yet it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that <hi>Iob</hi> himself, after his Affairs were re-established, might give the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Misfortunes in Verse. This is an Abridgment of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s first Dissertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is about eighteen Pages.</p>
                  <p>In the second he examines whether <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was the Author of the Pentateuch, and answers in the affirmative, and refutes the Objections of <hi>Spinoza.</hi> He thinks it very unadvised that some writ in <hi>Dutch</hi> against this impious Author; because, says he, this wou'd make us fear, that the Curiosity of the People wou'd be stirr'd up, if these Disputes were manag'd in a Language that they understood not.</p>
                  <p>I believe that our Author speaks prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in respect to the Philosophical Works of <hi>Spinoza</hi>; many think it strange that some Learned Men have not solidly refuted them; but others on the contrary say, that it's better to make no Answer to 'em at all in any Tongue, least a Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently Vers'd in the Sciences should op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him, and not know how to refute what he undertakes; or if it be an ingenious Man, by discovering this Doctrine he wou'd render it more dangerous; because all those that have the impertinent Vanity to desire to pass for followers of <hi>Spinoza,</hi> altho' they understand him as little as they do Arabick, will become in effect what they have yet only the Name of, if these impieties are made more easie to be apprehended. It is better therefore to suffer them to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in that impenetrable darkness which the Author has left them in, and not to seek any other Antidote than their own Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> also makes many remarks upon the Critical History of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament: Least the Extract should be too long, I shall content my self with speaking of these things, and make an end after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving observ'd the chief Subjects of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dissertations. There is one touching <hi>Pre-Adamites,</hi> another of Self-Love; ore upon the Waters of Jealousie, which gives him occasion to speak of many Proofs of Chastity us'd in divers places: One upon the 18<hi>th.</hi> Verse of the 23<hi>d.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy,</hi> where God forbids the offering <hi>the Hire of an Harlot</hi> or <hi>Price of a Dog:</hi> One upon the White Stone that Jesus Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> to those that shall overcome: One upon the Thorn that St. <hi>Paul</hi> felt in the Flesh; another upon the Terrestrial Paradice: One upon the Fratri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide of <hi>Cain:</hi> One upon Polygamy: One upon <hi>Iudas Iscariot,</hi> in which the Author de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring for the Opinion of <hi>Priceus,</hi> incurrs the Censure of Mr. <hi>Gronovius:</hi> One upon Excommunication; another upon the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of those that the Jews call'd <hi>Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's,</hi> who in certain Cases might unreveng'd kill in cool Blood, upon which the Author speaks very finely according to <hi>Selden:</hi> One upon the Divinity of the Book of <hi>Est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her:</hi> One upon Eunuchs: One upon God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers; another upon the Obligation of an Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> adds to each of his Questions whatsoever he has met with that is Curious, we may very well believe that there is a very fine Mixture. The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertation about the <hi>White Stone</hi> ends with reflections upon the <hi>Philosophers Stone,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some Philosophers have said that this White Stone was nothing else but that <hi>great Work.</hi> He relates a pleasant Story upon Pope <hi>Leo X.</hi> A certain Chymist presented him with a Stone, whereby he pretended he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Criticks have endeavour'd to remove this difficulty, but says our Author, they have not yet done it. He is a good Judge in these kind of Matters, his Learning is very profound, and he worthily keeps up the Reputation which his Father has acquir'd throughout all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> as may be seen in the Letters of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Balzac:</hi> He is a great Honour to the University of <hi>Leyden,</hi> where he is the Professor of History and the Greek Tongue.</p>
                  <p>He first refutes the Sentiments of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philact,</hi> that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not think to push on the matter so far against Jesus Christ; and having found, contrary to his expectation, that he was Condemned to Death, Despair put him upon fastening an Halter about his Neck, but the Tree which he ty'd himself to, bended down with his weight, so that he dyed not; afterwards he got so strange a Dropsie that he took up more room than the breadth of a Chariot, whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that falling down once he burst in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder: Others say he was run over with a Chariot. He refutes these and other like things, and maintains that <hi>Iudas</hi> dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards he refutes many Learned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, who by the Words of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> compar'd with those in the <hi>Acts,</hi>

In mentioning the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of Hanging, attributed by some to <hi>Iudas,</hi> he Corrects a pretty Passage of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius,</hi> cap. 54. where 'tis ordinarily read, <hi>Et jam semicinctior stanti ad perietem spondam junxeram</hi>; instead of which we must read according to our Author, <hi>Semicinctio insitam ac parieti spondam junxeram,</hi> to signifie that he that wou'd Hang himself, ty'd his Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Cord which held up the Bed, and pusht the Bed a little nearer the Wall. He concludes that St. <hi>Peter</hi> did not mean by these words, that <hi>Iudas</hi> was Hang'd; and he confirms it, because the sequel of his Discourse touching the broken Entrails of <hi>Iudas</hi> has so little relation with the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Strangling, that we must make a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand suppositions to join these two things together.</p>
                  <p>Next after, the Author examines the Opinion of <hi>Causabon,</hi> that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related the beginning of <hi>Iudas</hi>'s Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that St. <hi>Luke</hi> mention'd the rest. <hi>Causabon</hi> pretends that this Wretch was Hang'd, but that the Cord being broken, he fell (<gap reason="foreign">

This Opinion was follow'd by <hi>Conradus De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tericus, Iohn Gerrard, Calixtus,</hi> and many Authors, but Mr. <hi>Gronovius</hi> does not at all approve of it; and shows first, that the term which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> makes use of, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, signifies rather to be Hang'd, than to Hang himself; he proves it after such a manner, as denotes his great Knowledge in the Greek Tongue; and he inferrs from this proof that 'tis false, that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> did not express the kind of Death which made a full end of destroying <hi>Iudas</hi> at once. He refutes (in the second place) the Observation that <hi>Causabon</hi> made upon the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and says in general, that all the suppositions of this great Critick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the breaking of the Cord, the falling with his Belly upon a Stone, from the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of a Hang'd Person, don't at all agree.</p>
                  <p>He refutes, after this, the Opinion of <hi>Daniel Heinsius,</hi> who says, that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> did not say that <hi>Iudas</hi> put a Rope about his Neck, and Hang'd himself; but that the meer Power of his Despair took away his respiration, and Choak'd him to Death. Now if the Rage that posess'd him was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Suffocating or Choaking him, we may also suppose that it was able to burst his Belly, as inclos'd Vapours in a Vessel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rarify'd make it burst asunder: He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Authorities, to prove that the Term which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> makes use of, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies in general that he was Strangled; whether by a Cord or by something that he had swallowed, or by an Effort of sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; a Passage in <hi>Tobit,</hi> cap. 3.10. seems to make for this sence, since 'tis read <gap reason="foreign">

                     </q>
and many other Passages of ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; but Mr. <hi>Gronovius</hi> is not of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but shows clearly that the Book of <hi>Tobit</hi> does not at all favour the Opinion of <hi>Heinsius,</hi> seeing that immediately before the Words alledg'd, 'tis plain that <hi>Sarah</hi> spoke and pray'd fervently to God, (which shows that 'twas not Grief that strangled her) that because she made a reflection which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly denotes that her sadness had inspir'd the thought of Hanging her self; <hi>I am the only Daughter,</hi> says she, <hi>and if I do this, it will reproach my Father, and I shall dye in grief</hi>; These Words wou'd be Nonsense if the word <gap reason="foreign">

As for the Quotation out of <hi>Virgil,</hi> it's plain they don't signifie a <hi>true rupture,</hi> or at least that they signify'd not an <hi>external rending,</hi> no more than when we say, <hi>Let him burst himself if he will, he can bear it:</hi> We don't precisely mean a true Laceration of the Skin and Flesh, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Intestines, but 'tis a vehement man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speaking. If we exclude this kind of Death, which is properly call'd Burst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asunder, then we have no longer an express Idea of any thing else. This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes many Learned Remarks upon the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the sence whereof is, that he ran away to Hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and not that he was Choak'd for want of Breath, thro' the vehemency of his run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as <hi>Heinsius</hi> understands it.</p>
                  <p>The Opinion of <hi>Grotius</hi> comes next under his Examination, but he stays not long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, there being scarce any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt it and that of <hi>Heinsius,</hi> which he refuted before. Next he attacks <hi>Saumasius,</hi> but with a great deal more mildness, giving him a very Honourable Encomium, he does not reprehend him for having said that the Text of St. <hi>Luke</hi> signifies that <hi>Iudas</hi> fell down headlong, and that the two Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists have given different Relations of this matter, because they are accommodated to two manners of speaking. He abuses <hi>Price<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who believed that <hi>Iudas</hi> fell down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and that the Text of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signifies a <hi>Resolution of dying.</hi> He flatters not <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> whose Opinion was that the Devil lifted up <hi>Iudas</hi> into the Air, strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him there, and then cast him down with such a force, that his Entrails burst out; he is certain the Narration of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> can't suffer that sense, since it marks very clearly that <hi>Iudas</hi> strangled himself, tho' he forgets what he said before, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Original rather signified to be strangled than to strangle.</p>
                  <p>After having examin'd the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of all these great Men, he built upon their ruines his own Opinion, and having carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd the Words of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> he says; 1. That <hi>Iudas</hi> made haste to his Death, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had given the Price of his Crime to the High Priests. 2. That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

He proves this very learnedly, by many Passages, and concludeth that <hi>Iudas</hi> strangled himself with a Cord. 3. That the Vulgate hath very well translated the Words of St. <hi>Luke</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

That St. <hi>Luke</hi> had no design to show the Death of <hi>Iudas,</hi> but only what hapned to his Carkass after his Death, which was thrown upon a Dunghill, where he supposes there might be sharp Stones, which tore the Body that was cast upon them: He confirms this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture by many Learned Observations.</p>

                  <p>THe Author Dedicates it to King <hi>Charles</hi> the second, who indeed was the fittest Patron, for he encouraged the Noble De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of this Society by his own Personal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>The Treatise it self, which is writ in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Style, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> very agreeable to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty of the Author, is compos'd in three Parts. The first gives a brief Account of the Ancient and Modern Philosophy, and shows that we owe the Original of all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Eastern Parts of the World; bringing for Example the Noble Endeavours after it by the <hi>Chaldeans, Egyptians, Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi>; the Revivers of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Sects, and an Account of the Moderns in particular, with the Authors of each Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; so that by this method he has observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Excellencies and Defects of all our Predecessors, and given us hopes of what may be expected from this New experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Method.</p>
                  <p>The second contains the Narration it self; in which the Dr. (having seen their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals) gives an Account of their first Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, their Encouragements, with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of their Society as to their Aim, Ability and Number, the way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Weekly Assemblies; the Method of their Enquiries, their Registring every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject under its proper Head; the Progress they have made from their first beginning. Thus being well established, and having pass'd all difficulties, the Author does not doubt but all ingenious Persons will be pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Performance, since they have already given such good Proofs of it in their Method, of which by this short Specimen, the rest may be judged of.</p>

                  <p>Each of which Subjects have been very Curiously managed, with all possible Care to discover and advance the Truth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with much better success than their envious Detractors cou'd ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. They are <note n="*" place="margin">This was in <hi>An.</hi> 1667.</note> already above 700 in Number; Experiments and Observations together, more than 350; Relations 150; Queries, Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Recommendations and Proposals, above 80; Instruments 60; Relations both Artificial and Natural more than 50; Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Discourses as many: And our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gave us this Account, when the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was but little more than just begun; therefore what happy Discoveries may the World expect from such a Body of Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Noble Undertakers.</p>
                  <p>After which he describes the Library and Repository, that the Liberality of two of their Members bestowed upon them; and adds some Examples of their Experiments, and whatsoever they have engaged in. The Dr. concludes, that if this shall not satisfie any Cavillers, they are not worth the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, since nothing would please them (if the search after Nature is not sufficient) but Proposing to solve such Chimera's as the <hi>Philosophers Stone, Squaring the Circle,</hi> &amp;c. which is only an Argument of the Vanity of such Persons Expectations.</p>
                  <p>The Third Part declares both the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Benefit of this Design, on the Account of all Professions, and especially of Religion it self. The Promoting of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments according to their Method, will be so far from injuring Education, or the least disadvantage to the Universities, that it will introduce many profitable things in the stead of such as are no way advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to Youth, and may be laid aside with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudicing any one whatsoever; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidently the most profitable to secure Truth by Experiment, and the least danger of ever being deceived; whereas other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods make us more fit for Wrangling and Disputation, than the finding out things as they are in their own Nature, the Theory being always too much, except the Practick were more observed; the speculative Man always pursuing Airy Notions, whilst he that Experiments is certain of finding the Truth.</p>

                  <p>I shall not undertake to give an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of each of these Lives; yet that the Reader may in some manner judge of the Usefulness of this Work, I have made choice of Three, to give an exact Extract thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> St. <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> and that of <hi>Origen</hi>: Wherein may be seen a perfect Sample of the History of the three first Ages, the Author having added to that of these Fathers, an Account of the Events, Opinions and Customs of those Times.</p>
                  <p>Before I enter upon the Work, I must advertise the Reader of a long Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the beginning of it, where from the Birth of Jesus Christ is an Abridgment of the History of the Ages wherein these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lived. This Book is divided into Three Parts, The first containing the Life of our Saviour, while on the Earth; the second that of the Apostles, and the third the Preservation and Growth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion from their Deaths, until the time of <hi>Constantine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Life of Jesus Christ, a Letter is made mention of from <hi>Archar King of Edessa</hi> to our Lord, and the Answer that this Prince received from him, (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> relates.) is not contradictory to those pieces which have had the Reputation of Authentick. There can nothing very solid be opposed to this, except the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Evangelists, who have not spoke of it in the short Account they have given us of the Life of Christ; though perhaps the Reason that <hi>Eusebius</hi> was the Person that first takes notice of it, might be this, that these Letters lying in the hands of the Arch-bishop of <hi>Edessa,</hi> were not come to the knowledge of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were written in <hi>Syriac,</hi> and that <hi>Eusebius</hi> first Published them in the <hi>Greek.</hi> He cites also other Pieces that many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men have censured as Counterfeit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which are the <hi>Acts of Pilate,</hi> from whence <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath taken what he saith in his <hi>Apologetic,</hi> touching I know not what Design of <hi>Tiberius</hi> to put Jesus Christ into the Number of the <hi>Roman</hi> Deities. See what Mr. <hi>Le Feverre</hi> saith of this History in his Epistles.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> makes no long stay on the Preaching of the Apostles; but passing to the Third Part, he there considers first, the Progress that the Christian Religion hath made in the World, after the Apostles time; secondly, What contributed to so great and swift a Growth as that of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, in spight of all the Persecutions that it suffered; and then gives a brief Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of them. Of which, according to the common Opinion, he reckons up Ten, and he advances many other things that the Learned have contested about, as the silence of the Oracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not long since the Ingenious <hi>Dodwell</hi> made it appear, that the number of these Persecutions was very dubious, and that an Author of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> shews there was no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in the Reason that was generally given for the pretended silence of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Oracles.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Without rehearsing what all the World knows of Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> by reading the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> he tells us ancient History teacheth nothing certain of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, Place, Birth nor Life of this first Martyr. <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Baronius</hi> maintains, as he says, upon the Authority of <hi>Lucian</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of the Fifth Age, that Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> was a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> as well as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who became his Enemy after he was Converted to Christianity. But Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> saith he found nothing like it in this Letter. <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Epiph. Hort.</hi> 20.</note> Others say he was one of the Seventy Disciples. Be it as it will, he was certainly one of the Seven first <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> that the Apostles Establish'd in the Christian Church, and who were supposed to have been all <hi>Greeks</hi> by <hi>Nation,</hi> but of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion. As <hi>Nicholas,</hi> one of them, being a Proselyte of <hi>Antioch,</hi> 'twas thought all the rest might be Proselytes of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostles being employ'd about things of greater Importance, were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:103507:175"/>
to remit to other Persons the Care of <hi>Serving the Tables,</hi> which was to make it their business to relieve the Poor, and buy sufficient Provisions to refresh them; this they called <hi>Agapes</hi>; to manage the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Church, and to distribute to each according to his Necessity. The Office of <hi>Deacon</hi> answers very well to the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication this word hath in the Heathen Authors, where <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> believes that the Charge of Deacon extended much farther, and that when the Eucharist was celebrated in these <hi>Agapes,</hi> the Deacons were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to distribute it. As was practised in the Christian Church in <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi>'s time, which his second Apology sufficiently testifies, where he says, the Deacons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed the Bread and Wine to the Assembly, after it had been consecrated by the President. Besides which, they Preach'd, Baptiz'd and Absolv'd Penitents, especially when they were empower'd by the Bishop.</p>
                  <p>The Apostles establish'd but seven Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons; the reason is apparent, without seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Mysteries, 'twas because that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was sufficient. Nevertheless the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Council of<note n="*" place="margin">Can. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Neoce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saria</hi> ordained there should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be more than seven Deacons in one City, founding their Canon on this Practice of the Apostles. <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. c. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Sozomen</hi> tells us also, That in his time there was no more at <hi>Rome,</hi> altho' in other Churches they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served not this Rule.</p>
                  <p>These Deacons made by the Apostles met with violent Opposition, in performing their Office, from one or other of the Synagogues, whereof, if the <hi>Rabbins</hi> are to be credited, there was at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to the number of 480, besides Colleges, in which, Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> believes, young Persons were instructed in the Law. St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was first set upon by those of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of the <hi>Libertins, Alexandrians,</hi> the <hi>Cyrenians</hi> of <hi>Cilicia</hi> and of <hi>Asia,</hi> on whom the Author makes some Remarks, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly upon the first. To understand who these <hi>Libertins</hi> were, 'tis necessary to know, that <hi>Pompey</hi> having subdued <hi>Iudea,</hi> brought from thence a great number of Slaves to <hi>Rome</hi>; and the Governors of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Iudea,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Pompey,</hi> did the like; there was so many of them, when the Jews sent Ambassadors to <hi>Augustus,</hi> that <hi>Iosephus</hi> says there was near eight thousand of their own Nation that joyned themselves to them: They continued in that Slavish Condition, till by degrees they were all made Free; which happened in the time of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who permitted them to live a little beyond the <hi>Tyber,</hi> as <hi>Philo</hi> informs us. Among these Jews were without doubt no small number of <hi>Libertins,</hi> or Free-men, who had their <hi>Proseuques,</hi> or Chappels, where they assembled together to pay their Devotions. Every Year they sent a Summ of Mony to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> instead of first Fruits, and deputed some among them to offer Sacrifices in the name of the rest. <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ann.</hi> lib. 11. c. 85.</note> 
                     <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi> report, That afterwards the Senate sent to <hi>Sardina</hi> four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand young Men of the Jewish Nation, that were Free, to clear that Isle of the Thieves that were very Incommodious to it. <hi>Tacitus</hi> likewise says, That all the other Jews and Proselites were banished from <hi>Rome,</hi> and even <hi>Italy</hi> it self. Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, many of these Enfranchised Jews took occasion from thence to return to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and established a Synagogue there, which was call'd, <hi>The Synagogue of the Libertins.</hi> Of the Members of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety 'tis, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> speaks, when amongst those that were at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> on the day of Pentecost, he says, There were <hi>Strangers from</hi> Rome, <hi>Iews and Proselites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Violence of these Men was so great, that they run upon St. <hi>Stephen</hi> to Stone him, without observing the accustom'd Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in the like cases, <note n="*" place="margin">

As thus, when they brought the Delinquent to the place of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, a Man stood at the Door of the Sanhedrin with a Handkerchief in his Hand, which he waved to an fro, that some one might undertake to speak in Favour of the Criminal, and by this sign to advertise a Man on Horse-back, which was at some distance, to ride full speed to bring back the accused Person, and defer his Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till they had heard all that could be said in his Favour. Sometimes he was brought back four or five times, if he said he had any thing to represent to his Judges in defence of himself. But as the Laws of the <hi>Thalmud</hi> often much resemble those of <hi>Plato,</hi> it is no small Difficulty to found any thing thereon. It seems the People some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times stoned those that were accused, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out staying for any Sentence or Order of the Judges, <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Some say the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was three Years after the Death of <hi>Iesus Christ: Eusebius</hi> supposed it to be a little afer his Ordination; and the <hi>Excerpta Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologica</hi> published by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> places his

Death at the end of the eighth Month, after the Ascension of our Lord. <hi>Lucian</hi> the Presbyter saith, St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was Stoned in the North of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> at the side of the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> a little without the Gate that hath since been called the <hi>Gate of St. Stephen,</hi> and formerly according to some, the <hi>Gate of Ephraim,</hi> after others the <hi>Gate of the Valley,</hi> or <hi>the Gate of the Fish</hi>: Some Travellers to the <hi>Holy-land</hi> tell us, that they have seen the place where St. <hi>Paul</hi> kept the Garments of those that Stoned this Martyr. The Empress <hi>Eudocia</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly caused to be built near this place a Temple, which bore the name of St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen.</hi> And as those who are curious after the Search of Relicks, never fail to find what they please, so they have discovered not only the place where St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was stoned, but also the very Stone that he kneel'd upon, which was afterwards car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and placed in the Church that was built in Honor of the Apostles. <hi>Baronius</hi> also relates, That some devout Persons kept one of the Stones with which St. <hi>Stephen</hi> had been stoned, and that it is still to be seen in the Treasury of <hi>Ancona.</hi>

The Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> thus advertised by <hi>Lucian,</hi> made these Relicks be taken up, and carried to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> from whence they were sent to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> informs us, who hath been very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to relate all Histories of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>With a great deal of Reason Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> observes, that excessive Veneration to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks was one of the Defects of that time, by consequence one cannot much confide in these sort of Histories. He brings another out of <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Baronius,</hi> not less Marvelous than the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. 'Tis thus, that a Viol full of the Blood of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> brought to <hi>Naples</hi> by one <hi>Gaudois</hi> an African Bishop, used to boyl of it self every third of <hi>August,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the account of Ancient time, as if it had been just shed. But since that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. having corrected the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, this Blood doth the same at the end of the thirteenth of <hi>August,</hi> in which day, after the new Reformation, the Feast of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> is kept; a manifest Proof, say they, that the Gregorian Calender is received in Heaven, altho' in some Countries Hereticks have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to follow it.</p>
                  <p>The Author adds not so much Faith to Modern Miracles, as to those who did them, and to what is spoken of in the time of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius.</hi> It seems not Irrational to believe, that there was a great number of Sick Persons, who were cured by the admirable Odour that proceeded from St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Tomb the first time it was opened, if we may give credit to <hi>Lucian</hi> and <hi>Photius.</hi> But he relies more on what St. <hi>Augustine</hi> says in his <hi>City of God,</hi> Liv. 22. c. 8. of Miracles done in a Chappel where some of St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Relicks were kept, carried from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> into <hi>Africa</hi> by <hi>Orosus.</hi> Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> believes God might do Miracles then, to convert the Heathens which were in great Numbers amongst the Christians in those days; where altho' there was no necessity of them, yet he could not tell what might be done. The Author of the Logick of the <note n="*" place="margin">4. p. c. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> speaking of the same Miracles, maintains, that all men of Sense, whether they had Piety or not, must acknowledge them as true. But one of a good Understanding, and Pious too, could not well think, that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> should suffer himself to be deceived in things of that nature, and upon slight ground would take that for a Miracle which was not so, or that he made use of them as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means to convert the Heathens, without examining whether they were Matter of Fact or not; it is very certain that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates them with great Assurance; and at this day apparent Falshoods are advanced with no less Confidence: Tho' this is not a place to examine the Miracles of St. <hi>Augustine</hi>: 'Twill be more to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to pass to the Life of <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi>; <note n="*" place="margin">P. 140.</note> Who was born in a City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> formerly called <hi>Sichem,</hi> afterwards by the Inhabitants <hi>Mabarta</hi>; and in fine by the <hi>Romans Neapolis</hi> and <hi>Flavia Cesarea,</hi> because of a Colony sent thither by <hi>Vespasian.</hi> His Father, whose Name was <hi>Priscus,</hi> brought him up in his own Religion, and took a great deal of care to have him well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in Philosophy. He engaged himself particularly to that of <hi>Plato,</hi> which was a means, as he himself has declared, of his embracing Christianity. Having conceived a dislike against the other Sects of Philosophers, he becomes a perfect Platonist, and from that a Christian, after he had some Conference with an Old Man of that Persuasion in <hi>Palestine.</hi> He gives an account of his Conversion in his Dialogue with <hi>Tryphon,</hi> but the Learned receive this as a feigned Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, or at least look upon it to be extremely imbelish'd.

About the hundred and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Year of the Blessed Jesus, he Presented to <hi>Antonine</hi> his Apology for the Christian Religion: Which seemed to be the Cause that the Emperor publish'd an Edict, and sent into all <hi>Asia,</hi> commanding that the Christians should be proceeded against ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary Forms of Justice; whereas before they took away their Goods, banished them, and sometimes put them to death without any Formalities at all. In Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> there are some critical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations on the date of this Edict, by which he plainly proves that it was <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonine</hi>'s and not <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>'s, as some Learned Men have supposed.</p>
                  <p>After having Publish'd this Apology, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> makes a Voyage into <hi>Asia,</hi> where he came acquainted with <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Iew,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> believes to be <hi>R. Tarpho,</hi> who was Friend to <hi>R. Akiba,</hi> that is so often spoke of in the <hi>Thalmud.

                  <p>From thence returning to <hi>Rome,</hi> he composed that Apology which is called the First, tho it was really the Second, and Presented it to <hi>Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus,</hi> for a certainty not being at that time at <hi>Rome.

This Man enraged against <hi>Iustin</hi> resolved to do his utmost to ruin him; he found it not difficult to make use of the excessive Superstition of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> to that end, who had also a very ill Opinion of the Christians, as is evident by these words of his Book 11. §. 3. <hi>Such is the Disposition of the Soul, that it must be separated from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whether it be extinguish'd and dissipated like a Vapour, or whether it Subsists.

It is true, that some have doubted whether those Acts contained the Martyrdom of <hi>Iustin</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to matter of Fact; but their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion seems not to be well grounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is nothing but what agrees ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well with it, especially the Time and Death of this Martyr, which was when <hi>Rusticus</hi> was Praefect of <hi>Rome,</hi> as St. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> confirms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rusticus</hi> was a great Man both in the Wars and State, very much enclined to Philosophy, and particularly that of the <hi>Stoicks.</hi> He had been Governor to <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> as may be seen in the First Book of this Emperor, where are the chief Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that he learnt of him. Before this <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticus, Iustin</hi> and Six other Christians were brought, after they had been first put in Prison. He asked them if they were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, they all freely confessing it publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and refusing to Sacrifice to the <hi>Roman</hi> Deities, were Beheaded. <hi>Baronius</hi> concludes it to be in the 165th. Year after Christ, as agrees very well with the <hi>Alexandrian Chronology,</hi> that saith, a little after <hi>Iustin</hi> had presented his second Apology to the Emperor, he received the Crown of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom.</p>

He tells us, that although Ancients have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely praised the Learning of <hi>Iustin,</hi> this Holy Man had no knowledge of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> as appears by the Etymology he gives of the word <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rivet</hi> perhaps might be deceived by a popular Prejudice that's received in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of these Martyrs, who have always been lookt upon as Men of great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings; Supposing he could not Praise their Piety, without having a good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Learning.

Whereas we are assur'd on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that he was no good Historian, as appears by many gross Faults that he hath committed. 1. In his <hi>Exhortation to the People,</hi> he makes <hi>Herod</hi> contemporary with <hi>Ptolomy Philadelphia,</hi> in speaking of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty two Interpreters which he had seen in some of the Monks Apartments at <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria.</hi> 2. He Cites <hi>Hystaspes</hi> and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of the <hi>Sybils</hi> against the Heathens, which made them ridicule him, as <hi>Blondal</hi> shews in his first Book of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> c. 2. where he hath Collected divers <hi>Contempts</hi> of this Holy Man. 3. Such another he made at <hi>Rome,</hi> taking an Inscription writ in honour to an old Deity of the <hi>Sabins,</hi> call'd <hi>Semo Sangus,</hi> to have been done in favour of <hi>Simon</hi> the Magician. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription is now at <hi>Rome,</hi> being dug up the beginning of this last Age in the very same place that <hi>Iustin</hi> said it was, <hi>Nella isola del Terere.</hi> 'Tis true, St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> have committed the same mistake; as many Learned Men have observed, and amongst the rest <hi>Didier Herault,</hi> in his Commentary on the <hi>Apologetic</hi> of <hi>Tertullian.</hi> But 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the more excusable for that, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor proves which we have just cited, and who <note n="*" place="margin">P. 77.</note> judiciously observes, that the Christians in those Times, drew all Advantages possible, from the Actions, Words and Writings of the Heathens, which they often in favour of themselves interpreted contrary to the Opinion of the Author: <hi>Omnia Gentium facta, dicta, scripta ita interpretabantur tunc temporis Christiani, ut ea omnia proposito suo accommodarent, aliquando contra Gentium men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi>

                  <p>But to return to our Author, although he hath very much praised <hi>Iustin</hi> Martyr, he Remarks some Doctrins that he found in his Writings, which are not Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to those commonly received, and especially at this time.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He believed that <hi>Socrates, Heraclitus,</hi> and other Virtuous Heathens may have been Saved, and to maintain this Opinion, says they were in some manner Christians, because they have <hi>in part known the Reason</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>If these words were taken to the utmost Rigour, it would be very difficult to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish this Opinion of St. <hi>Origen,</hi> and that of many other Ancients, from the <hi>Arians,</hi> whom they have been accused of favouring. For it may plainly be proved, that the <hi>Logos</hi> of the <hi>Platonics</hi> according to these Philosophers is of a different kind from that of the Supreme God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second Error in his Writings, is the Reign of a thousand Years. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that after the Resurrection, Jesus Christ should come again in a visible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with the Patriarchs and Prophets into <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which should be then rebuilt much more magnificent than before. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Primitive Fathers were of this Opinion also, as <hi>Papias,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> St. <hi>Iraeneus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lyons, Nepos, Apollinarus, Tertullian, Victorinus, Lactantius,</hi> and many others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He believed the Souls of the Fathers of the Old Testament were before the coming of Jesus Christ in some manner under the Power of the Devil, and <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>In Dial. cum Tryph.</hi>
                     </note> that since Jesus Christ the Souls of the Righteous ascended not to Heaven immediately after their Death, nor were received there till the Resurrection. Nevertheless they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>in an agreeable Place</hi>; even so the Souls of the Wicked are, where they are as much displeased with their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, still expecting the day of Jugdment. <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid. P.</hi> 307.</note> 
                     <hi>Iustin</hi> repeats the same to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute some Hereticks, who deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Resurrection, in suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Soul was received into Heaven immediately after Death. 'Tis not his Opinion alone, almost all the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers have said as much, among which St. <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary, Prudence,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, &amp;c.</hi> They have very agreeably described this Place which received the Souls of Good Men, under the Names of <hi>Paradice,</hi> and the <hi>Bosom of Abraham,</hi> which some of them have supposed in the midst of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Iustin</hi> had not a less number of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on his side, in another point as visibly absurd. That the Angels, to whom, before the Deluge, God had given dominion over the Earth, becoming enamoul'd with the Daughters of Men, marry'd with them, and so fell from the Excellency of their Nature.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I could also, says Dr. <hi>Cave,</hi> insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what some have so often repeated in our Martyr; which is, that he hath very much exalted the Free Will of Man, an Opinion that was generally received by the Fathers of the first Ages, before the Pelagian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies entred into the World; though the necessity of Grace has been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by many, as our Author proves from divers passages of St. <hi>Iustin,</hi> St. <hi>Irenaeus, Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Tertullian,</hi> and even of <hi>Origen</hi> himself. Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> ends this Life, with an Observation, that he passes by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speculative Notions in our Martyr, which are not Conformable to the Truth; and the occasion of them seems to be the great esteem he had for the <hi>Platonic</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, endeavouring as much as possibly he could to make it agree with the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion.</p>
                  <p>By this 'tis plainly seen that Speculative Errors are not wholly inconsistent with true Piety, and that the most solid Virtue is not able to render a Man infallible, nor give him a Right to decide Controversies. These Remarks sufficiently testifie one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take those Praises, that are sometimes given to the Ancients a little too profusely, as an absolute sign all their Opinions are approved on; since Dr. <hi>Cave,</hi> after he had very much praised the holy Martyr, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates divers Errors he was guilty of. 'Tis apparent by this how we must also under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the praises Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> hath given him in his Ecclesiastical <hi>Bibliothique,</hi> p. 160. where he says, He to Admiration under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the Holy Scripture, and Prophecies therein contained, had a perfect knowledge of our Religion; So that there was hardly one of the Ancients spoke more exactly of all our Mysteries than he has done.</p>
                  <p>There is not the least Reason to think Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> or Mr. <hi>Du Pin,</hi> approved this Thought of St. <hi>Iustin,</hi> which nevertheless they have neither of them placed amongst the Errors of this Father. That although we should acknowledge Jesus Christ to be simply but a Man, born after the same manner as others are might nevertheless be proved that he is the Messiah: <note n="†" place="margin">

He was so happy in this Employ, that many of those he had instructed gain'd the Crown of Martyrdom; among which was <hi>Plutarch, Serenus, Heraclidus, Heron</hi> and <hi>Herais,</hi> who, in spight of the Weakness of her Sex, died as constantly as any of the four Men I have named. During the Fury of these Persecutions, <hi>Origen,</hi> not content only to teach the Catechumens, visited those also that were put in Prison, accompanying them to the place of Execution, endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Life a thousand times, during the Government of <hi>Letus</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> who were one after the other Govornors of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                     <hi>Origen</hi> did an Action, for which he was as much esteem'd by some, as blamed by others. Being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to encumber himself with Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and finding he was of an unfit Temperament to preserve himself Chaste in a single Life, or it may be to shun the Suspicion of the Heathens, he resolved to take an effectual way to suppress all Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Desires.

                     <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> tells us of a young Man of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> that being brought before <hi>Felix</hi> Governor of that City, desired of him the Permission of a Surgeon, that he might put himself out of the State of ever being suspected of any Impurity. <hi>Felix</hi> refused, because the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws forbid it, as the Canons of the Church have done since. <hi>Iustin</hi> related this, to shew those that accused the Christians of committing horrible Uncleanness in their Assemblies, were only Calumniators. <hi>Demetrius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> highly admired this Action of <hi>Origen,</hi> when first done, but afterwards becoming an Enemy to this great Man, it passed with him for an enormous Crime. <hi>Origen</hi> was so ill treated for it, that it is difficult to determine, whether this unkind Usage was not the cause, when he was advanced a little in Years, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted the words of Jesus Christ in
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:103507:178"/>
a figurative manner, and condemn'd those who had any way mutilated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor <hi>Severus,</hi> Persecutor of the Christians, dying the 211<hi>th</hi> Year of our Lord, <hi>Origen</hi> made a Voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> a place he had always desired to see, but continued not there long, <hi>Demetrius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling him, and obliging him to take again his Employ of Catechist. This Charge being too great for one, he joyned with himself one <hi>Heraclas</hi> who had been his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and bestowed his leasure Hours in Learning the Hebrew Tongue; for which he was so much the more to be praised, as he was the first amongst the Greeks that had dared to engage in so difficult a Work, and for which there was then so little help. It is supposed that his Master was one <hi>Huillus</hi> a Jew, Patriarch of those of his own Nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Origen</hi> had always a great Number of Disciples, that he instructed in Humane Sciences, and in Religion; among which, one of the most Illustrious was a Man of Quality named <hi>Ambrose,</hi> with whom he studied the Scripture with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Application during many Years: Whilst he was in this Occupation, <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> received Letters from the Governor of <hi>Arabia,</hi> desiring him immediately to send <hi>Origen</hi> to instruct him in the Faith of the Christians. He went thither, but soon return'd to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> from whence he was obliged as soon to depart, to escape the Fury of <hi>Caracalla,</hi> who had entred into <hi>Egypt</hi> with an Army, designing severely to punish the City of <hi>Alexandria</hi> that had offended him. <hi>Origen</hi> retired to <hi>Cesarea</hi> in the <hi>Palestine,</hi> where whilst he was yet but a Laick, the Bishop desired him pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly to expound the Holy Scripture to the People. But <hi>Demetrius</hi> caused him soon to return to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> after having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to <hi>Theoctist</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cesarea,</hi> and to <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that they had conferred on him an Employ that was never before given to a Laick, altho' these two Bishops produced to him many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Examples thereof. They assure us, that <hi>Mammea,</hi> Mother to the Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> being at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and having heard of <hi>Origen,</hi> sent often for him, and had many Conferences with him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion.</p>
                  <p>Being returned to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he applied himself, at the Perswasion of his dear <hi>Ambrose,</hi> to compose Commentaries on the Scripture; in the Prosecution of which, he generally maintain'd seven Copyists, that in Latin are call'd <hi>Notarii,</hi> from <hi>Nota,</hi> to <hi>Mark,</hi> because they wrote in Cyphers as fast as Persons spoke. Who invented this manner of Writing is not certainly known; some attribute it to <hi>Cunius,</hi> others to <hi>Tyro</hi> the Freed Man of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and some again to one <hi>Aquila,</hi> a Freed Man of <hi>Mecoenas.</hi> These Notaries were made use of in the Primitive Church, to write the Discourses of the Martyrs, both in Prison and upon the Scaffold, as appears by what <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Origen</hi> was interrupted in this Work, by a Voyage he made into <hi>Greece,</hi> which was at that time troubled by some Heresies. He passed through <hi>Palestine,</hi> making a short stay at <hi>Cesarea,</hi> where <hi>Theoctist</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ordained him Presbyter, without his seeking the least after it, and with no other design, than to make his Ministry more effectual. <hi>Demetrius</hi> had no sooner heard this News, but he thought he had found a fair occasion to discover a Hatred he had long conceal'd, for a Person whose Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Virtue had render'd him much more Illustrious than himself, thinking to cover his Malice under the handsome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of defending Ecclesiastical Discipline. Then 'twas he reproach'd him with that Weakness committed in his Youth, <hi>viz.</hi> The cutting off that part of his Body which seem'd troublesome to him. He caused him to be condemned by two Synods, wherein they declared his Ordination void, and expell'd him <hi>Alexandria.</hi> But these Proceedings did no Injury to <hi>Origen,</hi> he was very well received wheresoever he went, and continued to execute his Office of Priest, without any regard at all to the Anathema's of the Synods of <hi>Egypt:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheless the Insults of his Enemies obliged him to think of quitting <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> for ever, and entirely to give up his Charge of Catechist to <hi>Heraclas,</hi> whom he had converted to the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, a Man of a profound Learning and great Virtue. One thing which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with <hi>Origen</hi> to take his Mind more easily off <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to depart from thence with less Regret, was as

                     <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells us, his falling into the Hands of some Heathens that were his sworn Enemies, who threatned to kill him unless he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to satisfie the Brutality of an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Woman, or Sacrifice to the Pagan Gods, and that in so strange a Choice, he rather preferred casting a few Grains of Incense to a false Deity. He adds, That <hi>Origen,</hi> after this, durst no longer continue at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> But Authors that lived in the same time with him, make no mention at all of it; nor was this Crime ever objected against him during his Life, as has been sufficiently proved by the Apologies writ in his Defence. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was the first that ever spoke of it.

                        <hi>Ad Ann.</hi> 253. n 123.</note> hath conjectured that this Passage may have been added to St. <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> believes likewise, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> hath said enough on this occasion, to make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Reader apprehend, that he ought not to give too easie a Faith to all that he hath related. He saith he hath spoken many strange things of <hi>Origen,</hi> which he himself did not believe to be true, and that he thought good nevertheless to insert them among his Writings. Besides those who have read but little of what he hath done, saith our Author, know how much his Faith was upheld by popular Reports, and having testified so much Zeal and Anger against <hi>Origen,</hi> he took care to omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might sully or lessen his Fame. In fine, the Relation we have had of <hi>Origen</hi>'s Mutilation, and the Noise that it made in the World, would not permit his Enemies to offer him that Choice before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>'Twas in the 233<hi>d</hi> Year of our Lord, that <hi>Origen</hi> quitted <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and retired into <hi>Palestine.</hi> St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> to confirm his Accusation, saith, That <hi>Origen</hi> being at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and desired to preach, he stood up and read these words of <hi>Psalm</hi> 50.16. <hi>And God said unto the Sinner, why speakest thou of my Righteousness, and takest my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant into thy Mouth:</hi> That with great Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row he spoke these words, and then shut up the Book, and sat down covered with Shame, and fell into a violent Passion of Tears. That there might be nothing wanting to compleat his History, he hath made a Recantation under <hi>Origen</hi>'s Name, where he confesses his Sin, and testifies a lively Repentance for it; but the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune is, that the Style of this piece does not agree with that of the Author, whose name is affixed to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Origen</hi> having set up a School at <hi>Cesarea,</hi> drew many Men thither to him, and among others <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus</hi> and <hi>Athenodorus</hi> his Brother, who were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Bishops in that See. <hi>Firmilian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Cesarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> a Person celebrated for his Virtue and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was also one of <hi>Origen</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers.</p>
                  <p>The 235<hi>th</hi> Year <hi>Maximinus</hi> of <hi>Thrace</hi> succeeded <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> and with the utmost Severity treated the Christians, who had some Rest in the time of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor. This occasioned <hi>Origen</hi> to write his Book entitled, <hi>An Exhortation to a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> which he dedicated to <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and to the chief Presbyter of <hi>Cesarea,</hi> who had then signaliz'd themselves by a Couragious Confession of the Christian Faith. <hi>Origen</hi> at this time resided with a Lady of Quality called <hi>Iuliana,</hi> who furnish'd him with Books, and particularly with the Version of <hi>Symmachus,</hi> and his other Works in favour of the <hi>Ebionites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twas then that <hi>Origen</hi> took pains to collect the different Translations of the Old Testament, which were publish'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time: Whereof he made some Famous Editions entitled, <hi>Tetraples, Hecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> and <hi>Octaples,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> explains in order, as is his general Custom, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Idea's of St. <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> One may see in the second Tome of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Bibliotheque, <hi>Page</hi> 407. the Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Work, according to the thought of Mr. <hi>de Valois,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vossius,</hi> to the end that we may compare what these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men say thereof, with the common Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> has follow'd after Father <hi>Petau</hi>: Here is in short the common Order and Method of <hi>Origen</hi>'s Works. The <hi>Tetraples</hi> were four Columns, which contain'd the Versions of <hi>Aquilas, Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and of <hi>Theodotion</hi>; in the <hi>Hexaples</hi> there were more than two Colums, where the Hebrew Text was in Judaick Characters, and the same Text collateral to it in Greek Characters. In the <hi>Octoples</hi> might also be seen, after the six Colums (whereof we are a coming to speak) the fifth and sixth Edition which were found not long since, one at <hi>Iericho,</hi> the other at <hi>Nicopolis</hi> near to <hi>Actium. It is evident,</hi> saith Dr. <hi>Cave, by what St.</hi> Jerom <hi>tells us thereof, these two last Versions were not compleat, but contain'd only some Books of the Old Testament, and particularly the Prophets; tho' we cannot determine whether it may be concluded from thence, that the</hi> Hexaples <hi>and</hi> Octaples <hi>were only one Work under different Titles, according to those parts to which the fifth and sixth Edition were added. Besides this, there was a seventh Edition, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained only the Book of the</hi> Psalms, <hi>and by consequence made no change in the name of the Work.</hi> The Reader will more easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Method of this Collection, by a Copy which is here added to it, and drawn from an Ancient Manuscript of the lesser Prophets out of the <hi>Bibliotheque</hi> of the <hi>Barbarines.</hi> 'Tis the first Verse of the eleventh Chapter of <hi>Hosea, When</hi> Israel <hi>was a Child I loved him, and called my Son out of</hi> Egypt.</p>
                  <p>To render this Work Fruitful, <hi>Origen</hi> Remarks on the Version of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> that it contain'd either more or less than the Hebrew Text; when there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more he noted it thus (†) and when
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:103507:179"/>
there was any thing Deficient, he thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished it (*) and if confirm'd by many Versions, he added a Note which he call'd <hi>Lemniscus</hi>; and when two only agreed, he affix'd a <hi>Hypolemniscus.</hi> This Work which was a Labour almost impossible to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish, was begun at <hi>Cesarea</hi> and perfected at <hi>Tyre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheless it seems that <hi>Origen</hi> made a second Voyage to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he writ his Commentaries on <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and the <hi>Song of Songs.</hi> He pass'd through <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> where he met with his Friend <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who was retired thither with his Family. He there composed his Answer to <hi>Iulius Africanus,</hi> touching the History of <hi>Susanna,</hi> who had Fruitlesly endeavour'd to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it as a Truth: Returning into the last, he recover'd <hi>Beryl</hi> Bishop of <hi>Botsra</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> calls him) from a new Opinion apparently destructive to the True Faith, which he soon renounced that he might be better instructed, and thank'd <hi>Origen</hi> for having disabused him. Beryl <hi>believed that Iesus Christ before his Incarnation did not so exist, that he had a distinct Essence, which was only proper to him; and that he had not a Divinity peculiarly his own, but only that of his Father dwelling in him. Origen</hi> did not apprehend this Opinion at first, but after divers Conferences with <hi>Beryl,</hi> and indeed it is difficult to understand what he meant, according to the words of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> when he comes to cite and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate him word for word from the Greek. Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> thus expresseth it in English, <note n="*" place="margin">P. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>That our Lord, before his Incarnation, had no proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance nor personal Deity, but only a derivative Divinity from his Father.</hi> Mr. <hi>de Valois</hi> hath translated this Passage of <hi>Eusebius</hi> into Latin after this manner: <hi>Servatorem ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam inter homines: versaretur non substitisse in propriae personae differentia (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) nec propriam sed paternam dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxat divinitatem in se residentem habere.</hi> In his Remarks he says that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Essence,</hi> is plainly to be understood in this place for that of Person; but that <hi>Beryl</hi> was mistaken, when he said that Jesus Christ had no Personality before his Incarnation, yet he might reasonably maintain that he had the same Divinity with his Father, since if any other had been proper to him alone, there would have been more Gods than one: By this may be seen, that it is not always very easie to apprehend the Opinion of the Ancients upon difficult things; and above all, when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by their Adversaries. What Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> observes a little further, is more pertinent to <hi>Origen</hi>'s case.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Origen</hi> was Sixty Years old, and ceased not nevertheless to take pains; at that time it was that he composed this Book against <hi>Celsus</hi>: He writ also about the same time Letters to the Emperor <hi>Philip,</hi> and to his Empress, which gave occasion to some to believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' without any reason, that he was a Christian: He also applied himself to confute certain Hereticks, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that the Soul died with the Body, to rise again with it; and the <hi>Helcesaites,</hi> who were a kind of Gnosticks, and whose Errors were stifled in the very beginning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Decius</hi> succeeded <hi>Philip,</hi> who violently persecuted the Christians, and in whose Reign <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> relates in his History, died in Prison. <hi>Origen</hi> was also imprisoned with him, and suffered much thereby, but escaped his own Death by that of <hi>Decius</hi>: He at last died at <hi>Tyre,</hi> being Sixty nine Years of Age, in the Year of our Lord 254. in the first of <hi>Valerius,</hi> as our Author has made appear, against some Ancients who were deceived therein: He was buried in a Church at <hi>Tyre,</hi> among the Ruins of which, his Sepulchre is yet to be seen, according to the Relation of some Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers. Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> afterwards makes an Eloge of the good Works and Learning of <hi>Origen</hi>: He was of an Extraordinary So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and so little desirous of Riches, that he many times refused Presents that Rich Persons offered him. He even at the end of his Life, sold his Library to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him; and sold it upon this Condition, that the Purchaser should give him four <hi>Oboles,</hi> that is to say, five Pence a day during his Life: The extraordinary Pains which he took for many Years, procured him the Names of <hi>Adamantinus</hi> and <hi>Chalken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus,</hi> that is, of <hi>Steel</hi> and <hi>Brass</hi>: He assures us that he wrote Six thousand Volumes, which appears impossible, except we make a Volume of each of his Homilies and Letters; if so, we may reconcile St. <hi>Ierom</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> who have contented very hotly about it. To add the Judgment of the Heathens to that of the Christians about <hi>Origen,</hi> I shall relate here at length a Passage of <hi>Porphyry,</hi> of which Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> has given us the Sense. It is to be found in the sixth Book of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> Cap. 19. what this <hi>Great Philosopher</hi> says of <hi>Origen,</hi> in a Work of his against the Holy Scripture. <hi>Some have chose rather to seek Solutions of the difficult Writings of the Iews, than to abandon them; and have been oblig'd to put such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations as have contradicted themselves, and even agree not with their very Writings; which includes not so much the Defence of these strange Writers, as Advantagious Thoughts of their own Opinions; for after having spoken those things in Pompous Terms, which</hi> Moses <hi>gives the clearest Relation of in the World, they esteem'd them as Enigma's, and Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astically maintain, that they ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd as full of hidden Mysteries; and they propose not their Explications till after they have confounded their Auditors with their Lofty Language. And in a few words, a Man that I have known, being also very Young, may serve me for an Example: 'Tis</hi> Origen, <hi>who was then in great Esteem, and is so-still, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Works that he hath left behind him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As to what regards his Life, he was a Christian, and liv'd and obey'd the Laws of the Empire: But as for his Opinions

                  </p>
                  <p>Many great Men have formerly made Apologies for <hi>Origen,</hi> and among others, <hi>Pamphilus Martyr</hi> and <hi>Eusebius,</hi> but they are all lost. Nevertheless we may draw from the Ancients some general Remarks, which may render him more excusable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. He had written many things not dogmatically, and to Remark that he had thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd his own Sentiments, but only for Exercise, as he Witnesses of himself in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Places of his Book of <hi>Principles,</hi> which is the most critical of all his Pieces. 2. In the heat of dispute sometimes he would to the utmost extremity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> oppose the Opinions of his Adversary which he disputed with, although in effect he approved not of this immoderate way of Proceeding. And this is what happened to <hi>Origen,</hi> as some say, in his Disputation against <hi>Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> where sometimes he spoke as if he thought there were three Gods; also as Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> remarks, St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> is far from attributing any Error to him in this Case, and cites him among the Fathers who have been Orthodox touching the Trinity, and calls him an <hi>admirable Man and one of great Studies.</hi> 3. Many of his Opinions are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sentiments of Philosophy and Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation than of Religion; also we see not that the Councils have denied any thing about him, nor that the Divines raise any Disputes concerning him amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. 4. He hath written many things for his own particular Use, and which were publish'd against his will, as <hi>Pamphilus</hi> hath formerly complain'd, casting the fault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Friend <hi>Ambrose,</hi> to whom he had communicated them. 5. The Hereticks have corrupted and added many things to the Works of <hi>Origen,</hi> as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> hath shew'd more at large, and <hi>Origen</hi> himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd on even in his Life time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ruffinus</hi> also makes it appear that the same Fate happened to the Writings of St. <hi>Clement Romanus, Clement</hi> and <hi>Dionisius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and to <hi>Dionisius</hi> of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> believes that it was not amiss that <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Ancyrus</hi> had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably said that <hi>Origen</hi> had mingled too much <hi>Platonism</hi> with the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that he began to Teach in a time in which he had much more studied <hi>Plato,</hi> than the holy Scripture.

But they were not like them in other things. It is a Wonder that <hi>Gregory,</hi> who, as we see, denies that they adored Idols, and saith that his Father was born in these Sentiments, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Casun.</hi> 1. <hi>de rebus su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is v.</hi> 135.</note> should elsewhere positively say that he worshipped <hi>the Images of Animals.</hi> It seems that his Memory was a little short in this place, or his great Zeal made him fall into this Contrariety; unless we excuse him, by taking what he saith of <hi>the Idols of Animals,</hi> which his Father adored, for an Exaggeration of Rhetorick, a figure common enough in the Style of <hi>Gregory.</hi> As for his Mother <hi>Nonna,</hi> she was born of Christian Parents, who had carefully edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated her, and who had found in her a Disposition extremely inclined to Piety. Her Son also praiseth infinitely her Wit, and her Conduct.</p>
                  <p>A Woman thus qualified, must be much afflicted for her Husband's Inclination to such Errors as those of the <hi>Hypsistaires</hi>; yet he was of a very mild Temper, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme orderly; so that although his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents were erroneous, nothing could be found of ill in his Manners. <hi>Nonna</hi> would continually press him to get himself instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Christian Religion; and as he could not be prevailed with, it happened that he had a Dream which made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to do it: He dreamed that he Sung these words of the Psalm cxxii: <hi>I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in that I was told, we shall go into the House of the Lord.</hi> This manner of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though new, gave him delight; and his Wife failed not to make use of this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, to induce him to embrace Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
                  <p>It happened when <hi>Leontius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> passed by that place with some other Prelates to go to <hi>Nice,</hi> where <hi>Constantius</hi> called the Council; <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> went to see him, and told to him the desire he had to become a Christian. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontius</hi> got him instructed, and whilst they were instructing him, for a Catechumen, he kneeled without any bodies advice, whereas Catechumens were commonly standing, whilst they were instructed. Those that were there, observed this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, because it was that of Priests, whilst they were Consecrated. <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 19. <hi>P.</hi> 294.</note> His Son testifieth that every body guessed from thence, that he would be one day honoured with the Order of Priesthood. After that, as the Bishop of <hi>Nazianze</hi> baptized him, those that were present saw him go out of the Water, all environ'd with light; and the Bishop could not with-hold saying that <hi>Gregory</hi> would certainly succeed him in the Episcopacy, as it really fell out, after that the See of <hi>Nazianze</hi> had been sometime vacant. His Son in relating these two Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, treats on them both as <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>; and as then, so at this day; all the World believed not all that Ecclesiasticks said, he declares he proposes these Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels but to the Faithful only: <hi>Because there is none of these fine things, which appear cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to prophane Minds.</hi> Without being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, we cannot but suspect, not of False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but of a little Credulity and Exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration, these <hi>Rhetorical Souls,</hi> which draw an Advantage from every thing, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting matters of this Nature: When we think to declare what we have seen, we often say what we judge of a thing which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes us, and instead of affirming what we see with our Eyes, we draw some doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Consequences from a prejudiced Mind; so we believe, without enquiry, all that is advantageous to that which we have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and all that is contrary thereunto is false, or at least suspicious. If we do not make these Reflections in reading <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> of <hi>Nazianze,</hi> we shall run the hazard either' to take him for a Man of little Truth, or to believe his Miracles suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>

                  <p>As soon as <hi>Gregory</hi> was a little grown, he was sent to <hi>Cesarea,</hi>

                  <p>He went on Board for this purpose, a Vessel of the Isle of <hi>Egine,</hi> not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from <hi>Athens,</hi> being in the middle

                     <hi>November,</hi> his Passage was not very comfortable; coming by the Isle of <hi>Cyprus</hi> the Ship was tossed with a violent Storm for several days, and Victuals growing short, Hunger was one of their many Inconveniences; insomuch that the Seamen were not in a Condition to do their Business, had it not been for a <hi>Phoenician</hi> Vessel brought by the Wind, which supplied them with Victuals. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> testified, that all which troubled him at that time, was his not being Baptized: That Thought troubled him so much that the Seamen took notice of it, although they were concerned at the danger they were in themselves. He made a Vow to get himself Baptized, and to Consecrate himself to God: Then the Storm immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ceased. One might by this conclude that he feared Damnation if he died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptism; and since it was the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those Times, it is a wonder that his Father and Mother, whose Piety he so much extols, had not got him Baptized in his Infancy. True it is, Baptism might be deferred for fear of losing the Grace which God gives to them that receive it, or of being Excommunicated, if they lived unworthily after being Baptized. But these Fears take not away the difficulty, seeing one is as much exposed to be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in living ill, without having received Baptism, as in dishonouring it after it is received. Howbeit <hi>Gregory</hi> saith his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had notice of the danger he was in, by a Dream which caused them to pray for him. One in the same Ship saw also <hi>Nonna, Gregory</hi>'s Mother walking upon the Sea, and drawing the Vessel towards the Shoar, after which the Storm ceased. They Sailed by the Coast of <hi>Greece,</hi> and passing by <hi>Rhodes,</hi> they came at length to the Isle of <hi>Egene,</hi> whence <hi>Gregory</hi> went to <hi>Athens.</hi>

As they applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves both to the same Studies, and had the same Inclinations, so their Friendships encreased so much that <hi>Gregory</hi> said they were but one <hi>Soul in two Bodies.</hi> We shall in the Sequel see what was the breaking of their Friendship. The Sophists or Masters of Rhetorick at <hi>Athens</hi> had each their Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and endeavoured all they could to get Disciples; and for that purpose they had Men posted at all the Avenues of the Town of <hi>Athens</hi>; and as soon as any Youth that came to study appeared, they that were the strongest seized on him, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to lodge with their Friends. They that could bring many Scholars to their Masters, paid nothing; and this made poor Scholars very vigilant to take notice when any Strangers came to <hi>Athens.</hi> A young Man being thus in their Hands, some one of the Scholars took delight to contradict him, that they might try if he was Witty or Ingenious. After that they carried him in Triumph through publick <hi>Baignio</hi>'s, and they who had taken him went two and two before him: Coming at the Door they made as if they refused to let him in, and endeavoured by a great Noise to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him; notwithstanding they would soon let him in, and being washed, put a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Cloak on his Shoulders, which he was not permitted to wear before. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> was freed from this Ceremony, because he was more advanced in Studies than those which used to come to <hi>Athens</hi>; but we do not see that <hi>Gregory,</hi> who rehearseth this, had found the same Privilege. This Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom was observed, though of little value in it self; but it sheweth the Passion they had for Sophistry and Rhetorick, and how greedy Masters were for Disciples. We may see by this that the Academies of their Times were not better ordered than these of our Times, and that according to all appearance, one came not out thence better instructed than from our Academies at this time.</p>
                  <p>The two most famous Sophists at <hi>Athens,</hi> were <hi>Hincerius</hi> and <hi>Proeresius,</hi> both much esteemed by the Emperor <hi>Iulian.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond being an <hi>Armenian</hi>

Some Youths of <hi>Armenia,</hi> who had took the Philosophical Cloak, and were entred into the Schools, where they learned only to prattle before him, thought it their duty to humble this new Comer. They understood it in a Dispute, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him stronger than they, saw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves reduced to abandon the Field, had it not been for <hi>Gregory,</hi> who thought the Honour of <hi>Athens</hi> was at a Stake, came to their Assistance, and made the Combat equal on both sides.

From that time their Amity encreas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they lived very lovingly together.

some time to know well all the Learned Men of a City, and to judge of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Temerity.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> had spent Thirty Years in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or teaching Rhetorick, as he witness<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself; to wit, that he quitted <hi>Athens</hi> about the Year Three hundred fifty four, or Three hundred fifty five. It is hard to believe, that having a very ancient Father and Mother, he did not think of going to them sooner, and did not undertake to do the Christian Church some other Service, than to study or teach Rhetorick; <note n="†" place="margin">

From that time <hi>Gregory</hi> began to hope for no good from him, as may be seen in the Speeches which he made against him. When <hi>Basil</hi> was gon, he particularly applied himself to Eloquence, and declaimed with such Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauses, that every one esteemed him the greatest Orator of those times. His Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as he witnesseth him self, was not for that kind of Life; and he left <hi>Athens</hi> soon after without taking leave of any: <note n="*" place="margin">

Those that live thus, and acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves well of their Employments, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him to be profitable only to others; and those that live quite retir'd seem to him profitable only to themselves. He wished he could keep in the middle of these two Extremes, and to lead a kind of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastical Life in the midst of Men; without taking any Occupation upon him, but such as he would willingly choose, and without being Subject to troublesome Regularities, which give a distaste to the finest Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>He left <hi>Athens</hi> with these Thoughts, and took the way of <hi>Constantinople</hi> by Land; he found their his Brother <hi>Cesaire,</hi> who was arrived by Sea from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he had studied Physick. <note n="†" place="margin">

What Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation soever <hi>Cesaire</hi> had to yield to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations, the desire of his Parents and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of his Brother made him omit all this, and take his Journy with him to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianze</hi>; but having lived there some time, he returned to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in which it was far more pleasing to live, than in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert City of <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> As for <hi>Gregory</hi> he got himself Baptized at <hi>Nazianze,</hi> and his Father soon after engaged him to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up to a studious Life, and to take the Orders of Priesthood. <hi>Gregory</hi> a long while after could not <note n="*" place="margin">

But upon each side they used equivocal terms, so that unhappy. Inferences were made by those which were not well acquainted with these kinds of Subtleties, in equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating and confounding their different Sentiments. The Father of <hi>Gregory</hi> was one of those which fell into this <hi>Ambuscade</hi>; <note n="*" place="margin">

This Action of the Bishop of <hi>Nazianze</hi> alarum'd the Monks of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> who full of Zeal for <hi>Consubstantiality,</hi> refused to communicate with this good Man, and drew a part of the People after them. It seems that <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Son was not then at <hi>Nazianze,</hi> seeing he would have hindred his Father from committing a Fault, which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obliged him to repair, by a publick Retraction.</p>
                  <p>Having thus appeased the Monks, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Son ascended into the Pulpit, and made a Discourse <hi>concerning Peace,</hi> which is the Twelfth of his Speeches, in presence of his Father, who was not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to him in Eloquence and Ability. 1. He saith, That the Joy he had to see Peace return into the Church of <hi>Nazianze,</hi> had induced him to make this Discourse, whilst nothing before had obliged him to speak. 2. That he was extremely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at the Separation which was made before, chiefly when he considered the Austere and Holy Life of the Monks, which he describes by the bye with much Rhetorick. 3. That Divisions are the cause of all sorts of Evils, and that they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to praise God, because that which arose in the Church of <hi>Nazianze,</hi> was appeased. 4. That the Church of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianze,</hi> which before this last Division did not know what Schism was, ought, for the future, to endeavour a perpetual Peace. 5. That in the last Discord, they were so strongly perswaded that the Bishop of <hi>Nazianze</hi> acted Sincerely, and retained the Truth of Faith, that he was reproached with nothing else, but suffered himself to be surprized by equivocating words. 6. That every thing obliges us to Peace, God, Angels, and all Creatures, which Concord holds together. 7. That the Jews were happy whilst they were at Peace, and unhappy as soon as they were divided. 8. That notwithstanding Men ought not to seek after all sorts of Peace, but to keep a Medium, and that they were obliged, vigorously to oppose Heresie, when any one was seen to profess it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly; but that for mere Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions there should be no Schism <note n="*" place="margin">P. 203</note>. <hi>When that which afflicteth us,</hi> saith he, <hi>is but a Suspicion, and what is grounded upon nothing, Patience is better than Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Condescension better than Furiousness. It is much better to correct each other recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally like Members of one Body, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn our selves by a Separation, before they mutually understand one another; or to lose the Opinion the one had of the other by a Schism, and then to undertake to correct others, not like Brethren, but Tyrants, by Edicts and Laws.</hi> Finally, <hi>Gregory</hi> exhorts the Church of <hi>Nazianze</hi> to preserve the good Doctrin concerning the Holy Trinity, which he expresses in these words. <note n="*" place="margin">P. 204.</note> 
                     <hi>We adore one Father, one Son, and one Holy Ghost; in the Son we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Father, and in the Holy Ghost the Son. Before we joyn them we distinguish them, and before we distinguish them we joyn them. We do not look upon these three things as one</hi> (God) <hi>for they are not things which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of a distinct Existence, or which have but one Existence; just so our Riches are but in names of things, and not in things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the other three things really are but one. It is a thing not in Existence but in Divinity: We adore one Unity in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity. It hath all but one Throne and one Glory: It is above all the World, beyond Time, uncreated,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This Speech of <hi>Gregory,</hi> as almost all his others, is first without any great Order: His thoughts are heaped upon one another just as they came into the Author's Head, a Fault which is common to most of the Ancient Orators, which makes him fall into unnecessary Repetitions. Secondly, His Arguments seem sometimes to be too far fetch'd and of little Consequence, as when he saith the Universe subsists by Peace. This Expression is too far sought for, one might say quite contrary, as some Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, <hi>That the Contrariety, in which are all the parts of the Universe, keeps the State they are in, hindring one another to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi> In the third place, his Style is very full of Figures, uncorrect, and sometimes hard, and all this often causeth Obscurity. Notwithstanding we must allow that he is full of fine Similitudes, of strong and happy Expressions, as are those whereof he makes use in that part where he condemns Schism, which we before mentioned. He is full of Ornaments drawn out of History or Pagan Fables; and he speaks of the last in some places, as the Philosophers do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out openly rejecting it. So <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 3 p. 86</note> in speaking of the Flames of <hi>Aetna,</hi> he makes use of this Expression, <hi>Whether it be something else, or the Breathing of a punished Gyant.</hi> In another place, after he had spoken of the Torments of <hi>Tantalus
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:103507:182"/>
Ixion</hi> and <hi>Tityus,</hi> he adds, <hi>Whether it be Truth or a Fable under a Fiction, teacheth us a Truth.</hi> We cannot yet doubt but <hi>Gregory</hi> did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all these things as pure Fables; but the Greek Philosophers, which he had care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully read, said the same. One would think, that the Custom of speaking like others, had made <hi>Gregory</hi> say several things which he had in Pagan Books without Examination. But he is far from the Clearness, Exactness and Eloquence of <hi>Isocrates,</hi> whom many say he took for a Model. I thought it my Duty briefly to take notice here, of what you may judge, what was the Style of <hi>Gregory,</hi> that I may not repeat it hereafter in speaking of his other Speeches: I shall only take notice of some Examples of what I have said, when occasion shall offer.</p>
                  <p>We must also observe here, once for all, that <hi>Gregory,</hi> as to what concerns Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, followed that of the Platonicks, of whom he borrows divers Terms, which we cannot understand without knowing it. So <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 198.</note> he saith, <hi>That God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the most Excellent and the most elevate of all Beings, we cannot but raise him above all Essence, and place him above all Beings, seeing he hath given Beings to other things.</hi> For to understand the meaning of these Terms, <hi>being above Essence,</hi> we must know that the Platonicks did establish a <hi>Choice</hi> of Beings, as they spoke, to wit, Series of Beings placed upon one another; so that as they mounted this Chain, they came to more excellent Beings, and at last to Sovereign Trinity, which is above all the Essences of these Beings; that is to say, which cannot have relation to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Species, but which includes in it all their Essences, and can produce them upon that reason. <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </note> This is what makes these Philosophers say, That the Gods have <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essential</hi> Qualities. Without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Platonick Tenet, we cannot comprehend what <hi>Gregory</hi> meaneth, in the words which we have cited.</p>
                  <p>In the same Page he saith, <hi>That the Angels draw their Principles from Light; that they are enlightened by true Reason, and that they are Rays of this perfect Light.</hi> These terms are drawn from the bottom of Platonism, as it might be easily shewn in Expounding them, but that we should make too great a Digression. It shall suffice to mark what the Philosophy of our Author was.</p>
                  <p>To return to the History, the <hi>Arians</hi> being informed of the Division which had been at <hi>Nazianze,</hi> drew some Advantage from it, and laugh'd at the Orthodox. This gave occasion to <hi>Gregory</hi> to make the Homily, which is the Thirteenth of his Speeches, where he sheweth the <hi>Arians,</hi> that the Division of <hi>Nazianze</hi> being sprung but from a Misunderstanding, and having lasted but a short time, they unjustly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted over this Church. Moreover he sheweth the Advantage of the Orthodox, above the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Sabellians,</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Sentiments of these three So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties one with another. Tho' the Passage is somewhat long, it shall be put here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those who have not sufficiently stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died these Matters, shall better understand what was then the Sentiment of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, than they could by the Passage of the Twelfth Speech which hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>

It must needs be either by Envy, or by Fear, that you do not establish any thing which should equal it, or that should oppose it.</hi> But in as much as God is more excellent than Creatures, so much is he most worthy of the first cause of being the Principle of a Divinity, than of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and of not descending to these latter but by a Divinity which is betwixt two: As if the Divinity existed <hi>(according to the Arians)</hi> because of Creatures, as it seemeth to those who are so very subtle. <hi>If in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the Dignity of the</hi> Son <hi>and</hi> Holy Ghost, <hi>we made them without a Principle, or if we related them to a Principle of another Nature, then we should dishonor Divinity, or introduce Gods opposed one to another.</hi> A little lower <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>That the Unity moved it self by reason of its Bounty, and that the number of two hath been surpassed, because Divinity is beyond Matter and Form, which are the two Principles whereof Bodies are composed; that Trinity is limited by reason of its Perfection, and surpasseth the Conjunction of two, so that Divinity is neither too strait, nor doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it self to Infinity.

                     <hi>Iulian</hi> having ascended the Throne in the Year CCLXI. sought all manner of ways to ruin the Christians; and perceiving they made great use of Pagan Authors, whether to form themselves to Eloquence, or to draw from thence Reasons fit for maintaining the Christian Religion, and to attack Paganism, he undertook to hinder the Christians from applying themselves to the Study of Literature: Some Ancients say, that he prohibited them, <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Ep.</hi> xli.</note> in one of his Letters) That the Children of Christians should not be hindred to go to the Schools of Pagans, because those who offend not, but for want of Wit, ought to be taught and not punished. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> speaks of this Prohibition of <hi>Iulian</hi> in his third Speech, but according to the Judicious Observation of a <note n="*" place="margin">

'Tis a bad effect of the continual Rhetorick of the Ancients: They are so Eloquent, that they are not understood. 'Tis likely that <hi>Iulian</hi> prohibited not the Children of Christians to go to the Schools of Pagan Doctors, either because he saith it, or because it was a good means to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them. Hence some Learned Men amongst Christians, as the two <hi>Apollinaries</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> put Scripture and Religion in Greek Verses, or in fine Prose. These Writings would supply the Reading of those of Ancient Pagans, and Youth had no need of Grammarians for to understand them. Parents could easily serve their Children in room of a Tutor, to expound unto them these Christian Verses after having read Scripture. Yet this Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion extreamly vexed the Christians, <hi>which would not suffer their Grammarians, their Rhetoricians and their Philosophers in the Churches of the Galileans</hi> (these are the terms of <hi>Iulian</hi>) <hi>to expound their</hi> Matthew <hi>and</hi> Luke. If he never had done any other thing, they would not have introduced so many new words, nor so much subtiliz'd upon the Tenets then in Dispute; and the Platonick Philosophy had not had so much share in their Decisions.</p>

If this Letter obliged not <hi>Cesar</hi> to return to his Parents, there is a likelihood it strengthened him against the Endeavors of <hi>Iulian,</hi> of making him abandon Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism, whereof his Brother speaks <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> p. 167 &amp; 168.</note> in one of his Speeches. He saith, That <hi>Cesar</hi> having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to all his Reasons, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested to him he was a Christian, and would be so all his Life, and that <hi>Iulian</hi> cried out before several Persons of the Court, when he thought on the Bishop of <hi>Nazianze</hi> and his two Sons, <hi>O Happy Father! O Happy Children! Cesar</hi> either wearied by the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations of <hi>Iulian,</hi> or touched with the Advertisements of his Brother, returned to <hi>Nazianze</hi> in the time that <hi>Iulian</hi> departed to go against the <hi>Persians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It appears to be about the same time that <hi>Iulian</hi> sent a Captain with Archers to <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 19. p. 308.</note> 
                     <hi>Nazianze,</hi> to seize on the Church of the Christians; but far from being able to do what he desired, for if he had not escaped immediately, by advice of the Bishop, or of some other Person, he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned <hi>with his Legs broken, so great was the Anger and Zeal of the Priest</hi> (of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Father) <hi>for this Temple</hi>: These are the own words of his Son, which shews that these good Folks did not always Preach <hi>Passive Obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Year CCCLXIII. <hi>Iulian</hi> was kill'd in his retreat from before the Army of the <hi>Persians</hi>; <note n="†" place="margin">

                     </note> the effect (if we believe herein the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Gregory</hi>) of the Prayers of the same Bishop and the same People, who were for breaking the Legs of the Captain of the Archers, of whom we have spoke.</p>
                  <p>Then it was that <hi>Gregory</hi> composed his two Invectives against <hi>Iulian,</hi> where he omits nothing to render him Odious to all Posterity. These two Speeches are assuredly full of all the Eagerness and Passion that can be imagined, against a Man, who set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aside his Paganism, had been one of the greatest Emperors which hath been in the Roman Empire. A Learned Man hath unreasonably thought that these two Speeches were published during the Life of <hi>Iulian; Gregory</hi> speaks of his Death in both of them. The same Author remarketh <note n="*" place="margin">

us, when we judge after them of some Princes of their time. Prejudices are so strong</hi> (saith he) <hi>that they seldom come into Examination, but suffer themselves to be entertain'd under the Authority of the Holiness of these Illustrious Men. The Vulgar imagines it a great Sin, to disbelieve that the Piety of these Men has not always been accompanied with a great deal of Candor. As for my part, as I am perswaded that they were Vertuous, so I know that they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Faults through Passion. To say nothing of others, those that had some Reputation in</hi> Greece, <hi>have been subject to the evil Custom of their Nation, to fall into Extremities,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They have cast head-long into Hell those they were angry with, though their Vertue had raised them up to Heaven: And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they have so highly raised those they have undertaken to Praise, that Posterity this day admires their Vertue, which scarcely was indifferent: It is necessary to remember this Genius of the Grecians, if we have a mind sincerely to judge of the Panegyricks and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives of Christian Antiquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Gregory</hi> begins his first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 3. p. 49</note> with Furious Railings against <hi>Iulian,</hi> which he invites Heaven and Earth to hear. He particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly maketh his Address to the Soul of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius,</hi> who had set up <hi>Iulian</hi> to be <hi>Caesar.</hi> In speaking to him he adds these words, <note n="*" place="margin">P. 46.</note> 
                     <hi>If the Dead perceive any thing</hi>: By which it appears, he doubted if the Dead know any thing of what passeth here on Earth. Notwithstanding he saith else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <note n="*" place="margin">Page 63.</note> 
                     <hi>That he reprehends him as if</hi> Constantius <hi>was present and did hear him, though he was with God and enjoyed his Glory.</hi> This sheweth that this is but an Apostrophe of Rhetorick, whence nothing can be concluded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He mightily wonders that <hi>Constantius</hi> had raised <hi>Iulian</hi> to the Dignity of <hi>Caesar,</hi> knowing what he was; and sets forth at the same time the Praise of the first, whose Piety he boasts of every where; <note n="*" place="margin">Page 65.</note> he defends him against those who accused him of Impruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for having raised up <hi>Iulian,</hi> after having put to Death his Brother <hi>Gallus</hi>; and saith, That he thought to mitigate the mind of <hi>Iulian</hi> by Kindnesses, and that full of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his own Strength, he feared him not, as it might be seen, if <hi>Constance</hi> had not been Dead. In the following Speech against <hi>Iulian,</hi> speaking of the same Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, he excuses him for the Protection he had given the <hi>Arians.</hi> He saith,<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 5. p. 119.</note> That he suffered himself to be put upon by Simplicity and want of Firmness, and that the appearance of Zeal that he saw in the Arian Officers at Court, had seduced him. It would be hard to grant this with the Principles of <hi>Gregory,</hi> who looked on the Questions of Arianism as Capitals; if it were not known that the Expressions of Orators are not to be pressed, as those of a Geometrician. But there would be much ado to reconcile him with St. <hi>Hilary</hi> of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> who hath treated <hi>Constantius</hi> a great deal worse than <hi>Gregory</hi> treateth <hi>Iulian.</hi> These great Men acted as others, according to the Passion that animated them at the present, without too much weighing the Figures and Expressions which they made use of.</p>

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Page 51.</note> Laughs at <hi>Iulian,</hi> who hindred the Christians to teach Prophane Letters, because the Reasons of Christians would not be the less Strong, tho they were not proposed with so much Purity: But he makes as if he despised Eloquence and Politeness, which in truth he did not despise, and which he sheweth as much as he can in all his Writings, which would be even ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often more clear, if there was not so much Rhetorick in them. He also Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth <hi>Iulian,</hi> who trusted much on his Eloquence, the desire he testified to take from the Christians the means to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it: Which is, saith he, the same thing as if a Wrestler play'd the Bravade after having prohibited all the Vigorous Wrestlers to Contend with him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He assures us <note n="*" place="margin">Page 55.</note> That <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> had carefully Educated <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Iulian,</hi> Sons to one of his Uncles, and who also was named <hi>Constantius,</hi> to shew that he had no share in the Murder of the latter, which had been Commissioner when <hi>Constantius,</hi> Son to <hi>Constantine,</hi> ascended the Throne. He was willing even to communicate the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to his two Sons, who were of a very different Disposition, if we believe <hi>Gregory.</hi> Tho they had been instructed after the same manner, and were both of them willing to be <hi>Anagnostes,</hi> or to read the Holy Scriptures at Church; it appeared afterwards that one of them was not a Christian: It was said, and <hi>Gregory</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it to be true, that <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> building a Temple at equal Expences, in Honor of some Martyrs, what <hi>Gallus</hi> Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed did sensibly Augment; but that the Ground Trembled in the Place where <hi>Iulian</hi> built, and that all which was done did Fall. There happened besides many other Miracles far different from those of the Gospel, which were not so much in favour of the Incredulous, as of those whose Disposition did not render them quite unworthy. True it is, that <hi>Gregory</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 70.</note> saith, that Falshood was mixed with Truth, and relates but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully what was said, that <hi>Iulian</hi> in Sacrificing, had seen a Crowned Cross in the Entrails of a Victim. But he relates for truth things far more incredible in the following Speech, <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 71.</note> and in this, he saith, That <hi>Iulian</hi> having call'd out the Devils by certain Sacrifices, could not forbear trembling so soon as he heard the noise, and saw certain Fires which usually precede their Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that as he had been Educated in Christianity, he made the sign of the Cross,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:103507:183"/>
which immediately banished all these Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctres. The Priest that acted the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and perceived the disturbance of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> told him that the Gods abhorr'd him for that reason, and not that they were in any wise fearful of the sign of the Cross, which he had made. So he begun the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice again, and <hi>Iulian</hi> look'd upon the Devils.</p>

Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for the cause of Religion, is so Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in it self, in those who have retained any spark of Humanity, that the very Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who make use of it, are ashamed thereof, when Superstition and Cruelty leave them any interval, to think, with a little more calmness on what they do. This is so true, that most of those, which have abondoned themselves to the blind Zeal of Superstition, have made use of the same artifices. Our Age hath seen an illustrious Example of it, and if we compare what <hi>Gregory</hi> saith hereof, and the evil Crafts of <hi>Iulian,</hi> with what hath been done not long since in a great Kingdom, there will be a great Similitude found betwixt them. We shall pass it by here, fearing lest it should be thought that we have a mind to stop at a Parallel so Odious as this.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Amongst the Reasons whereof <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> makes use to shew that <hi>Iulian</hi> could not succeed in his Design, he thus describes the power of the Saints which Christians honoured: <note n="†" place="margin">Page 76. <hi>&amp;</hi> 77.</note> 
                     <hi>Have you not feared those to whom so great Honor is done, and for whom solemn Feasts have been established; by which Devils have been driven away and Diseases cured; whose Apparitions and Predictions are known; whose very Bodies have as much Virtue as their holy Souls, whether they are touched or honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of whom some drops of Blood only have the same Virtue as their Bodie.</hi> We see by these Words, and divers places of <hi>Gregory,</hi> and other Fathers of his time, that there was then a great deal of Respect had to the Relicks of Saints, and that a great many Miracles were said to be done at their Graves. It is astonishing that <hi>Gregory,</hi> who loved inlarging, hath not said even that the Bodies of Saints had more Virtue after their Death than during their Life; for there is no comparison between the multitude of Miracles, which were said to be done at the Graves of Martyrs, and those which they did whilst alive. Many People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Falshood of some Christians, and the Credulity of some others contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much to hold up Paganism.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Our Author <note n="*" place="margin">

As to their Lives, the endless Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of those Pious Hermits, and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Humor, shew sufficiently that they were infinitely beneath these great Models of Pagan Antiquity.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. He remarketh <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 80.</note> very well, that to be desirous to ruin the Christian Religion, in a time wherein the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was full of Christians, was to undertake to ruin the very Empire. When they were in a small number, they could not be ill treated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prejudice to the State; but when they were numerous they could not be engaged without causing great Convulsions, and too much disorder. It were to be desired that the Imitators of <hi>Iulian</hi> had well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Advertisement of <hi>Gregory</hi>; who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth most justly all the good that could accrew from the Government of <hi>Iulian,</hi> in comparison with the evil that so detestable a Design would have caused, if he had been able to put it in Execution. It were yet to be wished, that our Age had <note n="*" place="margin">

Nevertheless many others had done it, without any Reflection; and being admonished of their Fault, <hi>as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated Iesus Christ making the sign of the Cross after their Meal,</hi> by some one that told them they had renounced him, they went immediately crying out in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, and in the Ears of the Emperor, that they had been surprized, and that they were Christians. <hi>Iulian</hi> provoked at the mistake, banished them.</p>

                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Iulian</hi> added Insults also to his ill Treatments, and in taking away the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Goods, he said, he only assisted them to observe the Gospel, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded 'em to despise the things of this Life. This Railery is in the forty third Letter of <hi>Iulian,</hi> where he saith, that the Church of the <hi>Arians</hi> at <hi>Edessa</hi> having done some Violence to the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> he had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscated all their Mony to distribute it to the Soldiers, and kept their Goods to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; fearing lest the <hi>Arians</hi> being too Rich, could not get into the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Gregory</hi> Answers to this, amongst other things, that <hi>Iulian</hi> acting thus, made as if he imagin'd that the Gods of the Heathens thought it necessary, that People should be deprived of their Goods, without deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, and that they approved of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. He might have been satisfied with this Answer; but he adds, that there are things which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath commanded as necessary, and others which he hath simply proposed for those that would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them, without indispensibly obliging any one to do it. Such is according to <hi>Gregory,</hi> the Commandment of abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Wealth of this World.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. One thing for which they abused the Christians of that time, and upon which they did not always defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so well as they might have done, was the Pagans Reproaching them for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding Ignorance, <note n="†" place="margin">Page 97.</note> Seeing they Preached nothing else but Faith.
<q>You do not Reason, said <hi>Iulian</hi> unto them, at all; you are Rusticks, and all your Wisdom consists in saying <hi>Believe. Gregory</hi> answers to that, that if <hi>Iulian</hi> jeer'd the Christians, by reason of this Method, he ought also to Laugh at <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> whose Disciples were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to say, when they were asked the reason of any thing, <hi>that</hi> Pythagoras <hi>had said it</hi>; which comes to the same sense. He adds, that Christians meant nothing else thereby, but that we must not refuse a belief to what hath been said by Men Inspired from God; and that if they are worthy of Faith, what they say is more Demonstrable than all the Faculties of Reasoning and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting. <hi>Celsus</hi> rais'd the same Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Laugh'd at those that said, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine not, but Believe.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <hi>Origen</hi> had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, that 'twas in effect impossible for the <hi>Multitude</hi> throughly to Examine things; and that there was nothing more convenient for the People, than to Believe, without knowing the reason why. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers of this nature would not render Christianism very Recommendable; nor to put Christians in a State of Triumphing over Pagans, who might have shut their Mouths by such Answers. For in fine, if we must Believe without knowing why, we may equally believe all that we hear say, be it never so absurd.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>Iulian</hi> having remarked that Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Discipline and Order, which was amongst Christians, helped infinitely to Unite them one to another, and to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their number, had resolved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce them into Paganism. He would <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 102.</note> Establish Schools in every City wherein the Pagan Religion was taught, and also good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; publick Prayers; Censures against those that would commit any Fault; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries; Hospitals, where care was to be taken of the Poor and Sick. The Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were Maintained and increased in the midst of Persecutions by these ways, which were much more convenient to gain the People, than Reasoning. Those who have treated of the manner whereby Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity increased, have notwithstanding, I know not why, for the most part forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the good Order, and this regulated Charity, which was Established amongst them.</p>

                  <p>I shall besides give an Extract of the principal Places of his second Speech a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Iulian,</hi> and after that, I shall only in general speak of the Subject of the other Writings of <hi>Gregory</hi>; whereas what we have seen, is enough to judge what his Genius was.

And upon entring into a neighbouring Temple to shelter themselves, the Doors Shut of themselves, as some did relate. But all the World, if we may believe <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> did affirm, that as they endeavoured by force to get into this Temple, there issued forth Flames of Fire, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed one part of them, and Disabled the rest. If there happened any Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing on this occasion, it must be granted that there has been no great care taken to write it faithfully, since History doth vary extreamly upon this Subject; as may be seen by comparing only <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> with <hi>Gregory.</hi> Yet the latter speaks of this Fire which came forth, either from the Foundation, or from the Temple, as a certain Truth; and to prevail with the Incredulous, he adds, <hi>That no body refuses to believe these Miracles, if he doth not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise reject the other Miracles of God. What there is most Admirable and Bright in it is, that in the Firmament was seen a Light which represented the Cross,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Miracle stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not there: Let those who have seen this Miracle, continues</hi> Gregory, <hi>shew their Clothes marked with the Cross. As soon as any one, whether of our Party, or of Strangers, related it, or heard any body relating it, he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Wonder, in himself, or in those who were near him. He saw it shine on his Clothes, or on those of others, after a more Artificial manner than the finest Weaving, or the most exact Painting could represent it. This Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle added to the forementioned, did Convert an infinite number of People, if we may believe</hi> Gregory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He after this describes the March and Conduct of <hi>Iulian</hi> against the <hi>Persians,</hi> and his Death, on which the Relation was different, some relating it after a certain manner, and others after another; a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety which was found not only amongst those which were not in the Combat where he was Slain, but among those which were at it. <hi>Gregory</hi> tells what he knew on't by Hear-say; but he hath not as yet writ all that was said of it, as it may be seen by what <hi>Sozomen</hi> reports, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1 &amp; 2.

That which is most surprising, adds he, is that those who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted us with the rest, threw down with great Shouts the Statues of the Gods, by which they had been so long misled. Those which adored them yesterday, draggeth them to day along with Indignity. But
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:103507:185"/>
those who remained in Paganism were without doubt extreamly affronted at the manner, wherewith the Statues of their Gods were treated, and could not look on Christians as moderate Men. For in fine these Statues were as dear to them, as what the Christians regard as most Sacred. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over those that changed their Religion, as their Emperor did, and became so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly Enemies to God, which they had adored all their Life, ought to have been very much suspected.</p>

                  <p>To pursue the Thread of our Discourse, <hi>Gregory</hi> having been against his Will or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Priest, as we have already observ'd, took the Resolution of retiring into the So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Father being very Old, and not being able alone to bear the Burthen of the Episcopacy, engaged him to come back to help him. <hi>Basil</hi> himself used his Endeavours to make him give this Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his Father. He was consecrated Bishop to be his Coadjutor, and perform'd the Functions of Episcopacy, which his Father was not able to do. In that time it was that he made the Speech, which is the Fifth in order, wherein he directs his Discourse to his Father, and to <hi>Basil,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 136.</note> and tells them, he took at their Solicitation, <hi>The long Gown and the Miter.</hi> It is hard to know if he spoke this in Complement, or only was satisfied with the writing it; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed before the People the Forty first of his Speeches, which is upon the same Subject. A little time after he made the long Apology for his Flight, which is at the Head of his Works. He proposeth more at large the Difficulties which are found in the Exercise of Episcopacy, and saith, That notwithstanding he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to come, to satisfie both the Church of <hi>Nazianze</hi> and his Parents, who equally wished for his Return.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the Reasons which had given him a Distaste of the Episcopacy and Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he puts the Shameful manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many strove to attain them, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy soever they were of his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Multitude of Competitors. <note n="|" place="margin">

                     <hi>They look,</hi> saith he, <hi>upon this Dignity, not as a Post where they ought to be a Model of Vertue, but as a means to maintain themselves; not as a Ministry, whereof they must give an account, but as a Magistracy, which is subject to no Examination. They are almost in a greater number than those which they govern,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And I believe,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Evil will so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease with time, we shall have no body to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, but that all will be Doctors, and that even</hi> Saul <hi>will be seen amongst the Prophets.</hi> He saith that <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Page</hi> 21.</note> into the Sees were introduced Ignorant People and Children; <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Page</hi> 36.</note> that the Ecclesiasticks were not better than the Scribes and Pharisees; <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Page</hi> 33.</note> that they had no Charity, but Eagerness and Passion only; that their Piety consisted in condemning the Impiety of others, whose Conduct they observed, not to bring them back to the Truth, but to Defame them; that they blamed or praised Persons, not for their good or bad Life, but according to the Parties they had embraced; that they admired amongst themselves, what they reprehended in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party with Eagerness; that amongst them were seen Disputes like to the <hi>Nocturnal Combats,</hi> wherein neither Friends nor Foes are discerned; that they were Litigious upon Trifles, under the fine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Defending Faith; that finally they were a Horror to the Pagans, and the Contempt of Honest Men amongst the Christians. This is a true Picture of the Manners of the Ecclesiasticks of his Age, as it is but too apparent by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of those times. By ill Fortune those of our time do so much resemble them, that if it had not been said whence these Complaints were drawn, it would seem to be a Picture of our Modern Divines.</p>
                  <p>Another Difficulty which was found in the Exercise of Episcopacy, is that of speaking well of the Mysteries of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and principally of the Blessed Trinity; <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Page</hi> 16.</note> where, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Gregory,</hi> we must hold a Medium between the Jews, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but one God, and Pagans, who adore several; a Medium the <hi>Sabellians</hi> could not hold in making the same God, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in divers respects, Father, Son and Holy Ghost; nor <hi>Arius</hi> in maintaining that they have divers Natures. As for himself he believed, as we have already observed, and he himself saith, again here in many other places, he held this desired Medium, in establishing three Principles equal in Perfection, although the Father is the Origine of the Son and the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>It was not a very long time, that <hi>Gregory</hi> was Coadjutor to his Father, before his Brother <hi>Cesairia</hi> died. This was a little after the Earth-quake, which happened in <hi>Bithynia</hi> in the Month <hi>October,</hi> the Year

                  <p>

All that <hi>Gregery</hi> the Father could obtain of his Son, was, that he would take the Care of the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Nazianze</hi> during his Life, without engaging himself to succeed him.</p>
                  <p>In that time it seems, that a Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Emperor's, to Tax the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Nazianze,</hi> and who had been a particular Friend to <hi>Gregory,</hi> gave some suspicion to his Flock, that he would not Tax them very lightly; they thereupon forc'd <hi>Gregory</hi> to make that Discourse, which is the Ninth of his Speeches, where he exhorts all Conditions to Piety, and speaks to <hi>Iulian,</hi> who was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner of the Emperor, to induce him to settle this Tax like an Honest Man. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding there happened some Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances at <hi>Nazianze</hi> which irritated the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Commissary; and gave occasion to <hi>Gregory</hi> to rehearse the Seventeenth of his Speeches, which is upon the same subject, and wherein he exhorts the People to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and the Commissary to Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It's also believed, that it was about the same time that his Sister <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> who had been Married to a Person of Quality, named <hi>Vitalian,</hi> died. <hi>Gregory</hi> made her Funeral Oration, which is the Eleventh in order. We shall not stay to relate the Praises he gives her for her Piety and Wise Conduct; but only Remark two things.</p>

At the end of his Speech, after having said in addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himself to her, by a Figure of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick common in our Author, that she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth the Contemplation of Celestial Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he continues thus: <hi>If you have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to us, and if God hath given this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to Holy Souls, to perceive things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, receive our Speech, rather than Funeral Gifts.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> made in the Year CCCLXXIV. another Funeral Oration in the Honour of his Father, which is the Nineteenth in order. He testifieth that he died almost at a hundred Years of Age, after being Bishop forty five Years. His Son makes at length his Panegyrick, in giving an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of his Life; and endeavours to comfort his Mother <hi>Nonna,</hi> whom he also praiseth much, for the Loss she had sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He directs himself to his Father, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 13. <hi>P.</hi> 314.</note> whom he prayeth to let him know what Glory he was in, and to conduct both the Flock and Pastors, of whom he had had the name of Father, and principally his Son. He puts not a Word, which may excuse so violent a Figure as this <hi>Prosopaeia</hi>; and if elsewhere he had not used some mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying Expression on such occasions, we should with much ado have distinguish'd this Apostrophe from a true Invocation.</p>
                  <p>His Mother <hi>Nonna,</hi> who was almost of the <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 315.</note> Age of her Husband died soon after, and it was not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site that <hi>Gregory</hi> should make any Discourse in her Praise, because he had already made her Panegyrick, in the Funeral Discourse of his Father. After the Death of the latter some would have had him to have taken upon him the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick of <hi>Nazianze,</hi> and it was pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had engaged to stay in it, when he begun to take care of it. But <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ep.</hi> xlii.</note> he excused himself on the account of his Age; the Bishops of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince named <hi>Eulalius,</hi> to succeed his Father; on which the report rising, that this Election was done in spight of <hi>Gregory,</hi> he writ to <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nyssa,</hi> to shew him that nothing was done herein but at his request.</p>
                  <p>As the Business did not immediately come to that push, and that <hi>Gregory</hi> had <note n="†" place="margin">

Yet he returned into this
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:103507:186"/>
City, afore the Election was ended, and was urged anew to take his ancient Post, but he never would. The Author of his Life assures us it was at this time that <hi>Basil</hi> built an Hospital for the Leprous, and that on this occasion <hi>Gregory</hi> made his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Charity towards the Poor, and particularly towards those that were sick of a Leprosie. In this Speech are divers Reflections upon Piety in general, and touching the Use of good and bad For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in this Life. It is very seldom that <hi>Gregory</hi> applies himself to one matter only, and to an Order that is clear and void of Digressions.</p>
                  <p>During the Empire of <hi>Valens,</hi> who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the <hi>Arians,</hi> this Sect and that which sprung from it, had gained a great many People on their side. <note n="†" place="margin">

                     <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> was chiefly full of <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Apollinarists,</hi> who believed that the Divinity of Jesus Christ served for a Soul to his Body. That occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned several Bishops and many of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which followed the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to desire <hi>Gregory</hi> to go to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to strengthen the Orthodox, and to oppose the Hereticks. He declares he undertook this Voyage purely against his will; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly because the Report run that a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Apollinarists</hi> was going to be held there, to establish their Opinions.</p>
                  <p>Being arrived at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>

Valens</hi> had given the <hi>Arians</hi> all the Churches of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> so that <hi>Gregory</hi> was forced to preach in the House of his Kinsman. There was in a short time such a great Crowd of People, that this House having no Chamber which could contain them, he to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed pulled it down to make it a Church. <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 22. p. 527.</note> It was called the <hi>Anastasia,</hi> to wit, the Church of <hi>Resurrection,</hi> because the Belief of the Orthodox was as if it had been risen again in that place. The <hi>Arians</hi> then raised almost all the City against him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing him of believing <hi>several Gods.</hi> He attributes the Zeal of the People against him, to their Ignorance of the manner, whereby the Trinity ought to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with the Unity of God. It was not altogether the Fault of the People, because <hi>Gregory</hi> himself speaks thereof in such a manner, as seem'd as if he introduced that in common Discourse, which would be call'd <hi>Three Gods</hi>; although, according to the manner he defines Unity, it must be confessed he believed but one. He complains that <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Carmen de vita.</hi> p. 10. &amp; 11.</note> Stones were cast at him upon that account, and that he was cited before the Judge as a Seditious Man.</p>
                  <p>All this made him but the more Famous, and augmented the number of his Auditors. Then it was that St. <hi>Ierom</hi> heard him, as he witnesseth in divers places. <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>The number of the Orthodox increasing every day, they desired to have a Bishop of their own Judgment, and generally cast their Eyes upon <hi>Gregory.</hi> The Orthodox Bishops of the East, and principally <hi>Melece</hi> of <hi>Antioch, Basil</hi> of <hi>Cesarea,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> favoured him openly; yet their design succeeded not.</p>
                  <p>There was <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Carm. de vita sua,</hi> p. 12.</note> in <hi>Alexandria</hi> one <hi>Maximus</hi> by Profession a Cynick, yet a Christian. He pretended to be descended of a Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and in which there had even been some Martyrs. After the Death of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius,</hi> the Orthodox being persecuted in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he had removed into a Village of the Deserts of <hi>Thebaides,</hi> named <hi>Oasis.</hi> He went cloathed like the Philosophers, to wit, covered with a poor Cloak; he would have neither his Hair nor Beard shaved, and carried a Stick as <hi>Diogenes</hi> did: Living thus after a manner most Austere, he would take the liberty of censuring the Vices of all People, without having any regard to their Quality, as the Ancient Cynicks used to do. Notwithstanding under this severe Outwardness was hidden a Soul Fraudulent, Ambitious, Malicious, Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and full of the most Shameful Lusts. But as that did not appear to the Eyes of Men, he acquired a great Reputation, not only amongst the People, but also amongst the most Learned Men. He held Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency with the Bishops of <hi>Cesarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> Friend to <hi>Gregory,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> received him so well, at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that he made a Speech in Honor of him, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Orat.</hi> 23.</note> where he omits nothing that could make this Impostor pass for a great and good Man. But having since known his Fraud, <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </note> instead of the Name of <hi>Maximus</hi> which was at the Head of this Speech, he put that of <hi>Hieron,</hi> and entituled it thus: <hi>A Speech to the Praise of</hi> Hieron <hi>a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>sent into Exile for his Faith, and returned three Years after. Gregory</hi> shews in this Discourse, what use could be made of the Cynick Philosophy in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity; and speaketh of the Persecutions which the Princes who had favoured Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism, had raised against the Orthodox, particularly in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to <hi>Maximus</hi> the Philosopher. He endeth in expounding the Mystery of the Trinity, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting his Philosopher to keep himself constantly applied to the wholsome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, which held a Medium between

He often makes this Remark, when he speaks of the Holy Trinity; and in general we perceive, in reading his Works, that the same thoughts return fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently enough. <hi>In admonishing his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher to despise the Objections that are made against this Tenet, he bids him not to be ashamed at the Accusation of</hi> Tritheism, <hi>whilst others are in danger of establishing two Gods</hi> (the Arians and Macedonians) <hi>for you shall either resolve the Difficulty,</hi> adds he, <hi>as they do; or you shall remain entangled like unto them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> having thus made the Panegyrick of <hi>Maximus,</hi> received him in his House, instructed him in the Religion, Baptised him, conferred the Orders upon him, and communicated to him his most secret thoughts. <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Carmen. de vit.</hi> p. 12. <hi>&amp; seq.</hi>
                     </note> But so soon as <hi>Maximus</hi> thought himself ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable enough, he saw with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that they thought upon making <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> He judged himself more worthy of this place than his Master and Benefactor, and perceiving that one of the principal Priests of this Church envied <hi>Gregory</hi> this Dignity also, he joyned with him to supplant him. To which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Maximus</hi> gained <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who before favoured <hi>Gregory.</hi> Some time after the Fleet of Corn, which came every Year from <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there; and the Masters of the Ships <hi>Hammon, Aphammon, Harpocras, Steppas, Rhodon, Anubis</hi> and <hi>Hermanubis,</hi> immediately joyned themselves to the Assembly of <hi>Gregory,</hi> though they had orders to assist the Designs of <hi>Maximus,</hi> whom two or three Egyptian Bishops after that upheld strongly. Yet this arrival of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the Cares they took to joyn themselves to <hi>Gregory,</hi> gave him so much satisfaction, that he made <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 24.</note> a Speech thereupon; where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely praiseth the Piety and Constancy of those of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and expounds to them his Sentiments touching the Equality of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. He extends particularly to the Proof of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, and makes use, amongst other Reasons, of this, the terms of which would seem strange, if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready we had not observed such heretofore. <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 429.</note> 
                     <hi>If the Holy Ghost is not God, let him be made God before, and after that let him make me a God equal to him in Honour.</hi> This bold Expression seems to signifie nothing else, but that if the Holy Ghost be not God, he cannot Sanctifie Men, which <hi>Gregory</hi> calls in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>to render Men Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Learned Men think, That it was about the same time that <hi>Gregory</hi> made the Panegyrick of St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> which is the Twenty first of his Speeches. He reckons therein not only the Vertues of the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but also gives more at large the History of the Persecutions he suffered, and the Turmoils that happened during his Life. He praiseth him above all for his Orthodoxy, and for his Constancy in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Truth. <hi>All those,</hi> saith he, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 394.</note> 
                     <hi>that made Profession of our Doctrin, were divided into three Parties: The one had no good Sentiments for the Son, and yet less for the Holy Ghost; there were very few whose Doctrin was sound in these two respects. He was the first and the only Person who durst publickly declare the Truth, or at least he was upheld by very few. Gregory</hi> gives besides to St. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 395.</note> the Glory of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled the Eastern with the Western People, who Disputing only about words, believed each other reciprocally to be Hereticks: <hi>We say conformably to the Doctrin of Piety, that there is one Essence, and three</hi> Existences (Hypostases) <hi>the first relating to the Nature of Divinity, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the Propriety of the three. The Bishops of</hi> Italy <hi>conceived the same thing, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Poverty of their Tongue, they could not distinguish the Hypostases from the Essence</hi> (because that <hi>Latius</hi> would tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Maximus</hi> the Arrival of his Country-men in CCCLXXIX fortified his Party; and the more to engage the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of that Country to serve him, he made them considerable Gifts. For this purpose he borrowed Mony of a Priest, who was lately come from an Isle of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> named <hi>Thassus,</hi> with order to buy at <hi>Constantinople</hi> Marble and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for a Church, which they designed to build in this Isle. A little time after, <hi>Gregory</hi> who was indisposed, went out of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to take the Air, and thus gave the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishops an opportunity to enter betimes in the Morning into his Church, and there to place <hi>Maximus</hi> in the Episcopal See. They could not end the Ceremony of the Ordination of this Cynick, before the report of it went through the City. Thereupon the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Clergy, and People, without excepting the very <hi>Arians,</hi> went in a Crowd to the <hi>Anastasia,</hi> and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:103507:187"/>
drove these Bishops out of the Church. They retired into a Play-House which was hard by, where they cut his Hair and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated him. That still irritated the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the more, who heap'd all manner of Injuries upon <hi>Maximus,</hi> and blamed even <hi>Gregory,</hi> for having received an evil Man with too much Bounty, into his House. <hi>Gregory</hi> being advertised of what passed, returned speedily to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and made the Speech which is the Twenty eighth in order, wherein he declares he went out of the City with much Difficulty, and that the short time he had been absent, did but augment the Love he had for his Flock. He besides represents the Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of <hi>Maximus,</hi> and of those of his Party, to which he joyns the Description of a Christian Philosopher. He excuseth himself for being put upon by <hi>Maximus,</hi> in that good Men not being to be suspected, he could not imagine that this Philosopher had an Intention to deceive him. He saith at the end, That he is ready to quit the Episcopal See, and that he never wished for it. He mingles a great many general Reflections in this Discourse, and appears to prepare himself for Patience, in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Miseries of this Life. We see that he was Old, because he saith, That perhaps <hi>Maximus would up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid him</hi>

                     <hi>with his Old Age and Infirmity</hi>; which is contrary to the Opinion of those, who believe that <hi>Gregory</hi> was born towards the time of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Returning of <hi>Gregory</hi> engaged the People much in his Interest, and obliged <hi>Maximus</hi> to quit the City; but not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Design. It seemeth that he writ to the <note n="*" place="margin">

He allowed that he had been ordain'd in a private House, but he said it was because the <hi>Arians</hi> were in Possession of all the Churches, and that he was obliged to yield to their Violence. The Council not knowing the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, approved of his Ordination, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that the Promotion of <hi>Gregory</hi> was not done according to the Canons, because it was not lawful for a Bishop to abandon a Church, to go to establish himself in another. The Approbation which they had given to the Ordination of <hi>Maximus,</hi> made them also afterwards refuse to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with <hi>Nectaire</hi> his Successor, and that they writ to the Emperor, to intreat him to overlook it, and to re-establish <hi>Maximus</hi>; or to call a General Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> to examine into this Matter. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> also disapproved the Election of <hi>Gregory,</hi> who according to the Canons, ought to have staid at <hi>Sasine,</hi> seeing it was not permitted to a Bishop, <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>to abandon the People which had been committed to him, to go to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other through Ambition, which often causeth Quarrels and Schisms.</hi> Thus he speaks on't, in a Letter written to some Bishops of <hi>Egypt,</hi> wherein he also repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the Election of <hi>Maximus,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Canons. He writ <note n="†" place="margin">

Moreover, to resolve to go to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> after having despised <hi>Sasine,</hi> was a thing that might produce bad Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ill-minded People. It cannot be doubted but <hi>Maximus</hi> maliciously made use of all this, to ruin the Reputation of <hi>Gregory</hi>; and it was perhaps that which gave him the Boldness of going to <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi> to solicit <hi>Theodosius</hi> to establish him by an Edict. But far from obtaining what he demanded, the Emperor commanded him with Menaces to desist. Desperate for missing his aim, he went to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where having drawn some People unto his Party, he threatned <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of that City, to take away his place, if he did not help him to become Master of the Church of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The Governour of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> being advertised of this Insolence, and fearing the Cynick should cause some Troubles, banished him from the City, and History tells us not what became of him afterwards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> being thus rid of <hi>Maximus,</hi> had the Arian Party upon his Hands, which endeavoured to defame him, in jearing his Country and Parents: Besides, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of an ill Humour, of Negligence and other Defects of this kind; but as these Reproaches were either ill grounded, or inconsiderable, he easily justified himself, as may be easily seen in his Twenty fifth Speech. That which did him the most Damage, was, that in effect, though he was a great Orator at that time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering his Age, he was not very fit to take other Cares upon him, which he ought to have done to have maintained himself against the <hi>Arians.</hi> He should have man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged the Court, and endeavoured to win the Favour of the Chief, to advance the Interests of his Church; and this is what he was not able to do, having pass'd the greatest part of his Life in Study and Rest. Which caused the Priest who favoured <hi>Maximus</hi> (as we have said) to gain divers Catholicks, who began to say, that <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> was not capable of fulfilling the Duties of Episcopacy, where there needed no less Experience, and Ability in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Life, than Eloquence and Knowledge, The Complaints and Repulses of these People, gave <hi>Gregory</hi> so much distaste,

But he had no sooner said that he would go away, but all the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly desired him so earnestly not to Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, and expose the Orthodox Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin to fall under the efforts of the <hi>Arians,</hi> by his Departure, that at length he gave his consent to stay until the Bishops of the <hi>East,</hi> who were to Assemble speedily, as they said, had Elected to fill the <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Sea</hi> of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>

                     </note> After this, <hi>Theodosius</hi> was Accus'd of want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Zeal; and some would have had him employ'd Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, to have reduced the <hi>Arians,</hi> as <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> reports; tho he disapproves of the Heat of those who found fault with the Conduct of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> because of that, and declares against those that pretend to force Consciences. The Emperor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sent for <hi>Gregory,</hi> received him with much Affection, and told him he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to put him in Possession of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> For fear the People, the greatest part whereof followed the Sentiments of <hi>Arius,</hi> should rise, <hi>Theodosius</hi> sent Soldiers to Seize the Church of St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> and made <hi>Gregory</hi> to be Conducted by others through the midst of the People, which Cryed on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry side and was in as much Concern and Despair, as if <hi>Constantinople</hi> had been Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; which cou'd not be an acceptable Spectacle to a Wise and Moderate Bishop. Tho the Sun was Risen, it was so full of Clouds, that it might have been said, it was Night; But the Sun immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared when <hi>Gregory</hi> went into the Churh. This Circumstance deserved not to be taken notice of, if our Bishop had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it as some extraordinary thing, after having said, <note n="*" place="margin">Carm. <hi>de Vita sua. p.</hi> 22.</note>
                     <q>That although he is one of those who regards not such sort of Thoughts, he believes notwithstanding it is better to add Faith to all, than equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to refuse to believe what is said.</q>
So soon as they were in the Church, <hi>Gregory</hi> was demanded for Bishop, by the Cry of all the People which was there, which he made to cease, in telling them by a Priest, that they should give God Thanks, and not to Cry. He was threatned with no Danger, except thaat one Man drew his Sword, and immediately put it into the Scabbard. But although the <hi>Arians</hi> had given up their Churches, they never the less Murmured amongst themselves, and were enraged for their being driven away. <hi>Gregory</hi> believed with a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that the Heterodox might be drawn by Mildness; and used it more willingly, than the Authority of the Emperor. <hi>"He complains of a parcel of unhappy young People; who called Mildness, Cowardice; gave Fury, the name of Courage; and would have the</hi> Arians <hi>to be irritated and inflamed with Anger.</hi> The Moderation of <hi>Gregory</hi> did not displease <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius,</hi> who some times <note n="*" place="margin">

As he was Old and of a weak Constitution, he was often Indisposed, which his Enemies attributed to too great Tenderness. Being one day in Bed, a Man was sent to Assassinate him, who touched with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, confessed to him at his Beds Feet, that he was set on work to have committed this Crime, and obtained For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness. As to the Revenues of the Church, <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, that finding no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count out, neither in the Papers of those who had been before him Bishops of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> nor amongst those who had the care of gathering them, he would not meddle with them, and took nothing on't, that he should not render an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theodosius</hi> at that time called a Council at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> either to Condemn divers <hi>Heresies,</hi> or to Establish <hi>Gregory</hi> according to
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:103507:188"/>
the Canons in the Episcopal See of that City. But before we relate what passed therein, as to what concerneth <hi>Gregory,</hi> it's necessary to say somewhat of the Speeches he made, whilst he was at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and which remain yet amongst us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Basil</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea</hi>

                        <hi>Or.</hi> 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> made a Speech in Honour of him some time after; not being able to render his Friend this last Duty as soon as he would. He praiseth the Ancestors of <hi>Basil,</hi> who were Persons of Quality, and moreover Christians, from a long time. He saith, that <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 319.</note> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Persecution of <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> some of the Ancestors of <hi>Basil</hi> being retired into a Forest of <hi>Pontus,</hi> without any Provision, and Arms, to go to Hunt, they prayed God to send them some Game, or Venison, which they saw in this Wood; and that in the very Moment, God sent them a great number of Deers, and such as were of the Fattest, who shewed they were troubled not to be called for sooner. <hi>Gregory</hi> is Merry enough on this Subject, according to the Custom of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Orators, who do the like in respect to the Pagan Fables. That which there is of worst consequence in it is, That this renders Suspicious the other Narrations of <hi>Gregory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Afterwards he makes an Abridgment of the Life of <hi>Basil,</hi> and insists on each Place, according to his Custom, with much Exaggeration, Figures and Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Speaking of the manner he himself had passed his Life, he saith, that he wishes <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 335.</note> 
                     <hi>His Affairs may prosper better for the future, by the Intercessions of</hi> Basil.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ways whereby in his time <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> Men advanced in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Charges, were no more Canonical than the ways which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed this day upon that account, if <hi>Gregory</hi> may be Believed. After having said, that in other Professions Men were advanced by degrees, and according to the Capacity they had, <hi>he assures us, that the chief Places were attain'd as much through Crimes as Vertue; and that the Episcopal Sees were not for those who were the most Worthy thereof, but for the most Potent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>No body takes the name of Physician, nor of Painter, who hath not studied the nature of Maladies, that hath not well mixed Colours, and Painted many things; but a Bishop is easily found, not after his being formed with care, but out of hand, as the Fable hath feigned, that the Giants were no sooner Sown, than they were Born. We make in one day, and we bid those to be wise who have not learned to be so, and who bring nothing to acquit them of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, but the desire of being Bishops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Gregory</hi> attributes to <hi>Basil</hi>

                        <hi>P.</hi> 340. <hi>&amp;</hi> 358.</note> Monastical Laws and written Prayers. We have still the first, without great Changes, but the Liturgy which bears his Name, hath been extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alter'd since.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He praiesth not only his Friend, but also makes his Apology against those who accused him of Pride, (of which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he hath done it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in divers Places) <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 364.</note> and that suspected him of not ackowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divinity of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> because he had not called him <hi>God</hi> in his Book. <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, that <hi>Basil</hi> did thus, that he might not enrage Hereticks, who could not suffer that this Title should be given to the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> because the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not attribute it to him, but that he had said the equivalent, which was the same, seeing it is not Words, but things That do Save us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In fine, after having described the Funerals of <hi>Basil,</hi> he continues in these terms, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 372.</note> He is now in <hi>Heaven,</hi> where he presents, as I believe, Sacrifices for us, and where he Prayeth for the People; for in leaving us, he hath not quite Abandoned us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He advertises me still, and reprehends me in Visions at Night, when I swerve in any thing from my Duty. At the end of his Speech he asks his Succour, in terms as earnest as if he hear'd him; tho he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to doubt if he was <hi>in Heaven,</hi> to wit, in the <hi>Habitation of Supream Beatitude</hi>; where Antiquity believed, that excepting Martyrs, none entred till after the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as we have already seen by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place of <hi>Gregory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's probable, that 'twas at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> he Composed the greatest part of his Speeches, which we have not as yet spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, especially those that he made against the <hi>Arians,</hi> wherein it was judged that he had defended the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> as well as in his other Writings; that for that reason he had the Title of Divine. Thereupon may particularly be read his twenty third Speech, and the four follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To give some Idea of these five Speeches of <hi>Gregory,</hi> it must be observed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the design of the First, is to shew, that it belongeth not to all Men to Dispute of Religion, and that it ought not to be done before all the World, nor at all times; nor with too much Heat. <hi>He Censures the Hereticks, as if they had no regard to all this, and names Common Places which every Party have always made use of.</hi>

                     <hi>He complains, that they no sooner thought a Man Holy, but they Sainted him; that Divines were Chosen, as if by their Choice, Wisdom and Learning were Inspired into them; and that many Assemblies of Ignorants and Pratlers were Convocated.</hi> As he knew that there was People that cou'd not abstain from Disputing, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their desire, he tells them he will open them a vast Career, in which they may Exercise themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Danger: <hi>As, to</hi>

the Soul; rational Beings more or less Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; upon the Resurrection; upon Iudgment; upon Reward; upon the Sufferings of</hi> Jesus Christ: <hi>In these matters it is not unprofitable to succeed, and there is no great danger in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceiv'd therein.

                  </p>
                  <p>In the second <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 34.</note> he comes to the Point, and sets himself prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to prove against the <hi>Eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> the Incomprehensibility of God, which he often repeats. He likewise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves that there are many things in nature that we cannot comprehend; with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to conclude, that it is an ill Argument, to deny that something is in God, simply, because we comprehend it not.</p>
                  <p>After having thus prepared the Mind of his Reader, or Auditor, he declares his Sentiment upon the Divinity of the <hi>Son,</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 35. p. 562.</note> and upon the Holy <hi>Trinity</hi> in general, which he does in such terms as are worthy of remark. <hi>What we Honour is a Monarchy: I do not call that Monarchy that is possessed by one only Person (for it may be that a Person not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with himself may do the same as if there were many) but what is founded upon the equality of Nature, the consent of the will, the same Motion, and upon the same Design, in regard to what is produced by this Monarchy (which is not possible in created Natures) so that though those who compose this Monarchy differ in number, their Power is not different.</hi> If <hi>Gregory</hi> had believed the numerick Unity of the Divine Essence, he had spoken very weakly and obscurely, since that instead of <hi>Equality of Nature,</hi> he should have said <hi>identity,</hi> and not to speak of <hi>Consent of Will,</hi> but of <hi>one Will in number.</hi> In this same Speech, <hi>Gregory</hi> answers Difficulties, that the <hi>Arians</hi> made against the Eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Son, which often are very weak; whether it be that they are not well proposed, or that the <hi>Arians</hi> argued no better. Howbeit, as the Personage of an <hi>Arian</hi> may be better represented, the Opinions perhaps also of <hi>Nice</hi> can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with more Advantage.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the Objections of the <hi>Arians,</hi> which <hi>Gregory</hi> starteth to himself, this is one, which is the Eighth. <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>That if the Son is, in respect of his Essence, the same with the Father, it will follow, that the Son was not begotten, because the Father was not.

                  <p>In the fourth Speech <hi>Gregory</hi> after his way resolves the Objections of the <hi>Arians,</hi> by which they pretended to shew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of the Father and the Son.</p>
                  <p>In the Fifth <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 37.</note> he disputes of the Consubstantiality of the Holy Ghost against the <hi>Macedonians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of those who received the Divinity of the Son, denied that of the Holy Ghost, and had even the Boldness to call the Holy Ghost <hi>a strange God</hi>; under pretence that he is named God in no place of Holy Writ. It is against those that <hi>Gregory</hi> made his fifth and last Theological Speech.</p>
                  <p>In this Discourse, speaking of the divers Sentiments which were had thereupon, he saith amongst other things, <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 37. p. 595.</note> 
                     <hi>That the greatest Divines of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and those that came nearest to us, have had an Idea thereof; though they have given it another name, having called it the Soul of the Universe, and the Soul that comes from without, and other such names. As for the wise Men of our time,</hi> saith he, <hi>some have believed that the Holy Ghost is a Faculty, others a Creature; some a God, others know not where to place him, because of the respect they had for Scripture, which is not clear upon this Subject. Gregory</hi> maintains he is a <hi>Consubstantial</hi> Person to the two others; and when he answers his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, who asked him in what <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Procession</hi> differ'd, he fortifies himself in the <hi>Incomprehensibility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But one of the principal Objections, which was made against the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 600.</note> is that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged three Gods. <hi>If there be,</hi> said they, <hi>one God, and one God, and one God, how is there not three Gods?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That is,</hi> replieth <hi>Gregory, what those say whose Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety is arriv'd to the heighth; and those who are even in the second Rank, have good Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments towards the Son. I have a common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to give both, and another which regards the second only: I therefore ask these latter, why they call us Tritheists, who honour the Son; and if they abandon the Holy Ghost, they are not Ditheists? How do you expound,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth he, <hi>your Ditheism, when this Objection is made to you? Give us the means of answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the answer wherewith you will repel Ditheism, will also serve us to defend our selves from Tritheism,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thus we shall overcome, and our Accusers will serve us for Defenders,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But we have a Contestation with these two sorts
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:103507:189"/>
of Adversaries, and a common answer to both of them. We have but one only God, because there is but one only Divinity, and that those who proceed thence, relate to one thing only, though we believe three. The one is not more a God than the other, the one is not anterior and the other posterior. They are not divided in Will, nor separate in Power, and nothing is remarked in them that is found in divided things; but to say all in one word, Divinity without Division is found in three divided Persons; as in three Suns turn'd one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there would be but one mixture of Light. When we consider Divinity, and the first cause of Monarchy, we conceive but one only thing; but when we consider those in whom is the Divinity, and those that proceeded from the first cause before the beginning of time, and who enjoy the same Glory, we adore three.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But they will say, is there not one only Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity amongst Heathens, as their most able Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers have profess'd? All Mankind hath but one Humanity, and yet there are several Gods amongst Heathens, and not one, as there are several Men. I answer, That in these things Unity is but in the Thought; each Man is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from the rest, by Time, by Passions, by Power, which is not in God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is it in which consists the Unity of God, as much as I can conceive it. If this reason is good, we must give God Thanks, if not, we must seek for a better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Gregory</hi> proposeth to himself an Objection of the <hi>Arians,</hi> which shews still clearer, that the Orthodox made not the Unity of God to consist in the <hi>Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Unity</hi> of Divine Essence, but in a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Unity</hi> of distinct Essences, equal, and in a perfect consent of Wills. <note n="*" place="margin">P. 902.</note> 
                     <hi>The things that are of the same Essence, say you, are reckoned as in the same order of things—and those that are not consubstantial, are not reckoned after this manner; whence it followeth, you cannot but grant that there are three Gods, according to your opinion; for as for us, we are not in the same danger, because we do not say that the Persons are Consubstantial.</hi> The <hi>Arians</hi> would have it understood, that they admitted but one Supream God, who created all others; that they would say in this regard, that there is but one God; because God could not be put in the same order, and under the same name as his Creatures; but that the Orthodox acknowledging three Beings of a Nature perfectly alike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they could not deny but that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged three Gods speaking properly. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> answers nothing else, but that Men often place in the same Rank (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) things that are not of the same Species, whereof he brings divers Examples drawn from Holy Writ. That sheweth that the <hi>Arians</hi> might be accused, as well as the Orthodox, of admitting a plurality of Gods; but in no wise that the Orthodox did not acknowledge three eternal Spirits, although perfectly equal, and the same Will.</p>
                  <p>A little further in this same Speech <note n="†" place="margin">P. 611.</note> 
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sought uncreated things, something like to the Trinity, he could find no comparison that could satisfie him. He had well considered an Eye, a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and a River; but he did not find these things proper enough to express his thoughts by. <hi>I was at first afraid</hi> (saith he) <hi>lest it should seem that I was willing to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a certain Flux of Divinity, which would have no consistence. Secondly, Of establishing a</hi> Numerical Unity <hi>by these Comparisons: For an Eye, a Fountain, and a Sun, are one in number, although diversly modified. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected in the Sun, on the Beams and the Light; but there was yet somewhat to fear on this occasion, lest that we should suppose there was a Composition in a nature where there is none, such as is the Composition of the Sun, and of what is in the Sun; and that we should give an Essence to the Father, but that we should attribute no distinct Existence to the other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, from thence making them Faculties which exist in God, and which have no distinct Essence. The Sun-beams and Light are not other Suns</hi> (as the Son and the Holy Ghost are other Spirits distinct from the Father) <hi>but certain Emanations and Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties essential to the Sun. Finally</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">P. 612.</note> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory <hi>found nothing better than to abandon these Images and Shadows, as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful and very far from the Originals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <note n="†" place="margin">P. 608.</note> 
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> believed the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was revealed by degrees, as that Revelation first discovered God the Father, without speaking of God the Son but with much Obscurity; after that the Son, without imposing on Men the Belief of the Holy Ghost, fearing they should not be in a State of admitting thereof; and finally the Holy Ghost, after the Ascension of the Son.</p>
                  <p>We may judge by these places, of the Doctrin of <hi>Gregory,</hi> and of the Orthodox of his time, with whom the Orthodox of ours agree as well for the Terms, as they are distant in the Sense. We may further see, in the Expressions of our Bishop, a remarkable Effect of the Dispute. It is when we fear that our Adversaries should draw some Advantage from certain ways of speaking, we avoid with care the use thereof, lest we should give them some Prize; although these Expressions are otherwise most proper, to express the Doctrin we maintain. It is visible, that to make himself be understood, <hi>Gregory</hi> ought to have answered to the <hi>Arians: Yet it's true we adore three Gods, seeing we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge three Eternal Spirits, whose Essences are distinct; but these Gods are perfectly equal, and as perfectly united as distinct Beings can be, having the same Thoughts and the same Will; which makes us say commonly, That we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge but one God.</hi> But if he had spoken thus, the <hi>Arians</hi> who boasted to study and follow Scripture, would have replied, That all the Scripture represents the Unity of the Supream God, as a <hi>Numerical Unity,</hi>
                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:103507:190"/>
and not as an Unity of Species and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. They would have said, as they did before, but with much more appearance of Truth, That the <hi>Homoousians</hi> introduced a new Paganism, in establishing three Collateral Gods. Thus they were obliged, that they might keep themselves from these Reproaches, to maintain strongly that there is but one God, according to the Sentiment of <hi>Nice.</hi> The Platonicks, who had a like Thought, but were not restrained in their Expressions, fortified themselves thereupon, and said, That the Principle of all things were three Gods. I cannot but relate on this Subject these remarkable words of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> which admirably confirms what I have said: <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>De civit. Dei,</hi> l. 10. c. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Liberis verbis loquuntur Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophi, nec in rebus ad intelligendum difficilimis, offensionem Religiosarum aurium pertimescunt: Nobis autem ad certam regulam loqui fas est, ne verborum licentia, Etiam in rebus quae in his Significantur, impiam gignat opinionem. Nos autem non di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus duo, vel tria principia, cum de Deo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quimur; sicuti nec duos Deos, vel tres nobis licitum est dicere, quamvis de unoquoque lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentes, vel de Filio, vel de Spiritu Sancto, etiam singulum quemque Deum esse fateamur.</hi>
                     <q>Philosophers freely use what words so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they will, and fear not to offend Pious Ears, in Subjects most hard to be understood. For our part it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to speak, but according to a certain Rule; lest words imployed with too much Liberty, should beget an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Opinion, to understand them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they signifie. When we speak of God, we do not say two, nor three Principles, as it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted us, no more than that there are two or three Gods, though in speaking of each one, or of the Son, or of the Holy Ghost, we grant that each of them is God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Custom hath made Men insensibly swerve from the Ancient Idea's, because the word Unity was taken in the ordinary Sense that it used to be taken in; without supposing that the Ancients understood it in a particular Sense. This is what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in divers other Doctrins, as it hath been observed in the History of <hi>Iansenism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's now time to return to the History of our Bishop, after having brought so many proofs of his Sentiments upon those Tenets that then divided Christians. The Council, whereof we have already spoken, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Socr.</hi> l. 5. c. 8. &amp; <hi>Soz.</hi> l. 7. c. 7.</note> assembled at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in <hi>May</hi> CCCLXXXI. There were at it an Hundred and fifty Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Bishops and Thirty six <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who it was hoped would be brought to the Orthodox Faith. Besides some Canons that were made there concerning Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline (whereof we shall not speak) the Affair of <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> was treated on, they also made a Symbol. The Ordination of <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Maximus,</hi> and all those that he could ever have, were judged void; after which <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Carm. de vita,</hi> p. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> was declared Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> though he endeavoured to discharge himself from it. They obtained of him that he would stay there, because he was perswaded that he could the more easily in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ost, reconcile the different Parties which then rent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. It was brought against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of <hi>Gregory,</hi> that being Bishop of <hi>Sasime</hi> and <hi>Nazianze,</hi> he could not be transferred to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which is express thereupon. But <hi>Melece</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Theod.</hi> l. 5. c. 9.</note> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to that, that the design of this Canon was to bridle Pride and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which had no share in this business. Moreover, it seemeth that this Canon was not observed in the East, since <hi>Gregory</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Carm. de vita sua,</hi> p. 29.</note> saith, That they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to him, <hi>Laws that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed long before</hi>; besides, that he had perform'd no part of the Episcopal Function at <hi>Sasime</hi>; and as for <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> he was but Coadjutor to his Father.</p>
                  <p>This Affair being cleared, they entred on the principal Subject for which they were assembled, which was the Sentiment of <hi>Macedonius,</hi> who had been Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and believed that the Holy Ghost was but a Creature; though all the Disciples of this Bishop were not of the same mind, upon the nature of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Person, as appears by a passage of <hi>Gregory</hi> which hath been related. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, in the Council, was confirmed the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and they thought it convenient <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid. Conc. Chalced. act.</hi> 2.</note> to augment it, particularly with what respected the Holy Ghost. This addition is in these terms, <hi>We believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord of Life and he that giveth it, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son is glorified, and who spoke by the Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Council also anathematized the Sentiments of <hi>Sabellius, Marcellus, Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>All passed with Tranquility enough, in regard to <hi>Gregory,</hi> until a Tempest arose, that made him lose the Episcopal See of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> when he least expected it. It was the Spirit of Revenge in a Party which he opposed, that caused this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; from which <hi>Gregory,</hi> who was not so Couragious as to maintain the Brunt against his Adversaries, could not free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self but by flying.</p>
                  <p>There was some time after a sad Schism in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where two Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Bishops were at the same time. <hi>Melece</hi> being dead at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> before the Council was separated, they spoke of giving him a Successor. <hi>Gregory</hi> thereupon proposed an Expedient to end this Schism;
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:103507:190"/>
which was, that <hi>Paulinus</hi> who was the other Orthodox Bishop, <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Carm. de vita,</hi> p. 25.</note> and who had been ordained by <hi>Lucifer de Cagliari,</hi> alone governed the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> during the rest of his Life; and that after those of the Party of <hi>Melece,</hi> being reunited with those of <hi>Paulinus</hi>'s, would choose a Bishop by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Votes: For fear it should be thought that he had some Interest to favour <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> and that he would form a Party; he offered the Council to quit the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Throne of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in which he had been established. But the <hi>Ambitious</hi> and <hi>Incendiaries,</hi> as <hi>Gregory</hi> calls them, who had begun to give a Successor to <hi>Melece,</hi> would not hearken to this Proposition. <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 27.</note> A Crowd of young Persons begun to cry out like <hi>Magpies,</hi> and made so much noise, that they even forc'd the old Bishops, who should have resisted them, and brought in question again the Affair of <hi>Gregory,</hi> which had been decided. <hi>Gregory</hi> perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes their Ambition, Ignorance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, in the Poem he hath made of his Life: It is better to read it in the very Author than here. Yet the People, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Council gave <hi>Gregory</hi> a Distast, and that the latter spoke of retiring, cried out, That they should not take away their Pastor, and intreated him not to abandon his Flock.</p>
                  <p>About that time <hi>Timothy</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Peter,</hi> and who was of a Violent and Contentious Spirit, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there with divers <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishops. The old Malice they had against <hi>Gregory,</hi> upon the account of <hi>Maximus</hi> the <hi>Cynick,</hi> had so much inflamed them against our Bishop, that they began by complaining that the Canons had been violated, in transporting <hi>Gregory</hi> from one Bishoprick to another. This excited a great Noise in the Council, and it was upon this occasion that <hi>Gregory</hi> made his Speech of Peace, which is the Fourteenth, wherein he at length presents the Advantages of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the evil Consequences of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. He highly Censures therein the lightness of the Bishops, who had without reason, changed their Opinion in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and suffered themselves to be deceived by the Calmness of his Enemies. He saith, That Back-bitings ought to be slighted, which are commonly spread of Moderate Persons; and in fine, we may easily see by what he hath said, that it is not in our Age alone, that Men do cover their Passions most unworthily under the fair name of Zeal for the Purity of Faith. <hi>Gregory</hi> testifieth also, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 29.</note> that he told them, <hi>For what concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self they should not put themselves to so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that they should endeavour to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united; That it was time to make People cease laughing at them as wild Men, who had learned nothing else but to fight; That pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they would agree, he consented to be</hi> Jonas, <hi>who should make the Tempest cease; That he had taken against his Will the Episcopal See<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and that he quitted it freely, and that his Body being weakened with old Age, obliged him thereunto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding all this, they accused him of Ambition; he therefore made a Speech, which is the Twenty seventh, wherein he protests he had accepted of the Bishoprick of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but by force; and brings the People to witness it. He saith, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 27. p. 465.</note> That he cannot tell whether he ought to call the Seat of <hi>Constantinople, The Throne of a Tyrant, or the See of a Bishop</hi>; he complains of the Distractions of his Enemies, and the Envy they bore him <note n="*" place="margin">P. 466.</note> because of his Eloquence, and his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Sciences of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. It may be that made some People envy him, but the Post which he was in made a great many more envy him. He would have suffered him to have made use of his Rhetorick at <hi>Sasine</hi> without giving him the least trouble for it.</p>
                  <p>After having declared in full Council, that he desired to quit the place which was envied him; he went to the Emperor's Palace, to entreat him to suffer him to withdraw. He obtain'd it with some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and afterwards he only thought upon taking leave publickly, which he did in the Cathedral in the presence of one hundred and fifty Bishops, and all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: We have the Discourse he then made, and 'tis the Two and Thirtieth in order; he there represents the Ill Condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he found the Orthodox Church of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and the Change he had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd; he makes a Confession of his Faith, touching the Blessed Trinity, and shews he had done nothing which was worthy of Censure; he exhorts the Fathers of the Council to choose a Person worthy of the See of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to succeed him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards took his leave of all that heard him. In this Speech he complains of his Old Age, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 528.</note> and in the Poem of <hi>his Life,</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 30.</note> he saith he was then but a <hi>dead Man animated</hi>; which he could not say, if he was, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Supposition, but Fifty six Years Old.</p>
                  <p>As soon as he took his Leave, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in general all those who had heard him at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> testified a great deal of Grief. The Conduct of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil appears very unequal and Violent, since after they Confirmed <hi>Gregory</hi> in the See of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> they oblig'd him to quit it, at the Age of about 80 Years. This man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of acting so Unwise and Un-christian like, gave pleasure enough to the Enemies of the Council, and much diminished the Authority of their Decisions. For in fine, how can we think that Bishops so Factious, so Unjust, and so Ignorant, as <hi>Gregory</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes them in divers places, were nor capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Examining maturely the Doctrins in question? If their Authority did not make them incline to the Orthodox <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus <hi>Gregory</hi> Abandoned the Bishoprick of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> some few Weeks after he had been established by that Council that Banished him. He withdrew into <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia,</hi> according to <hi>Gregory</hi> the Priest, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his Life; and went to live at <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anze,</hi> where he was Born. Amongst those that were presented to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Sozom. l.</hi> 7. <hi>o.</hi> 8.</note> some Bishops put up <hi>Nectairus,</hi> Senator of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> a Man of regulate Manners, and comely Countenance, but who was not as yet Baptized, and who had scarcely any Learning. It is not known whether <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> parted for <hi>Cappadocia</hi> before this Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion was made, or staid at <hi>Constantinople</hi> until he had a Successor named to him. Howbeit, <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> xlvi.</note> 
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> writ an Instruction to <hi>Nectairus</hi>; where he begins thus, <hi>That it seemed as if the Providence of</hi> God, <hi>who before kept the Churches, had altogether abandoned the Affairs of this Life.</hi> That which made him speak thus, he says, was not his particular Evils, tho so great, that they would have seemed insupportable to any body else. He assures us, that the State of the Church only, forc'd those words from his Mouth. He afterwards describes to <hi>Nectaire</hi> the boldness of the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who were in as great a number at least as the Orthodox, and who durst Assemble and form Churches, (a horrid Attempt) after the Decisions of a Council so well Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated as that which had been newly held! <hi>Gregory</hi> comprehended not how his <hi>Holiness</hi> and his <hi>Gravity</hi> (it was thus that Bishops were stiled) permitted the <hi>Apollinists</hi> to Assemble. He advertised him that <hi>Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> said, that the Body of the Son of God, Existed before the World; that the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity served him as a Soul; and that his Body descended from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and was essential to the Son; yet nevertheless Died. <hi>Gregory</hi> thought, tho I know not why, that to permit these Men to Assemble, was to grant, that their Doctrine was truer than that of the Canonical, since there cou'd not be two Truths; as if to suffer any one, was a sign that they believed his Opinions to be true! In fine, he advises <hi>Nectairus</hi> to tell the Emperor, that what he had done in favour of the Church, would be of no use, if <hi>Hereticks</hi> were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Assemble. It was thus that good <hi>Gregory</hi> who would not whilst the <hi>Arians</hi> were the strongest Party, the Emperor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their side, have any thing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken which was blamed in them; Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Successor to forget this good Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; so difficult it is not to contradict our selves, when we take not great care to free our selves from Passion.</p>
                  <p>The following Year, CCCLXXVIII. <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Theod. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> there was an Assembly of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops held at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where <hi>Gregory</hi> was called; but he would not go to it; and thus he Answer'd those which Invited him. <note n="†" place="margin">

                     <hi>If I must write the truth to you, I am disposed always to shun every Assembly of Bishops, because I never saw a Synod which had good Success, or which did not rather augment the Evil than di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish it. The Spirit of dispute and Ambition, (without exaggerating upon it) is so great there that it cannot be expressed.</hi> It must not be thought that our Bishop said this, without thinking well on it, in a time wherein he might have any regret. He repeats it again in his Letters LXV.LXXI, LXXII. and LXXIV. and also diverted himself by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this thought in Verse,<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Carm.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 40.</note> I will never be present, saith he, at any Synod, because none but <hi>Geese</hi> and <hi>Cranes</hi> herd there, which fight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out understanding one another: There are Divisions among them, Quarrels, and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, which before were hidden, and which are Re-assembled in one Place, with Cruel Men. Being returned to <hi>Nazianze,</hi> he found that Church <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Greg. Presb. p.</hi> 52.</note> Vacant a second time, and by that reason Infected with the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of <hi>Apollinarius.</hi> He was immediately desired to take the Place of his Father, but he never would do it, and that gave occasion to <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ep.</hi> 222. <hi>Et Carm. de rebus suis.</hi>
                     </note> his Enemies to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him of Pride, as if he had scorned to take care of a small Church, after having possest the Patriarchal See of <hi>Constantinople. Gregory</hi> protests in one of his Letters, that he had refused it only because he was too Old, and too much Indisposed; yet seems never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless to promise <hi>to lend his Body to the Church,</hi> as he himself said; which makes us believe he really took care of the Church of <hi>Nazianze,</hi> at least until they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Bishop for it.</p>
                  <p>We shall not speak of what hapned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the retreat of <hi>Gregory,</hi> because he was not concern'd in it; only he writ to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his Friends, to endeavour that the Bishops might live in Peace, tho they were to be severely Censured for it. At his leisure hours he composed some of the Poetry which we have, and particularly that which concerns his Life. We may say of his Poetry, that the Stile is as Prosaick as that of his Speeches is Elevated: As there is often top much Ornament in his Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, so there is too little in his Verse, the turn of which besides is harsh enough. But he is not alone among excellent Orators, who have been indifferent Poets. The rest of his Poetry that is extant not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed according to the order of Time, we cannot well distinguish those that he made at the end of his Life, from those writ under the Empire of <hi>Iulian,</hi> as has been already observed, unless there be in the very Poetry some matter of Fact, which may distinguish the time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> died very Old, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Relation of <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:103507:191"/>
above XC Years, and died in the Year CCCXCI, the third Year of the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Theodosius.</hi> We have still a Testament which he made, being at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and which is at the beginning of his Works; some suspect it to be Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posititious; but as it contains nothing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and no more than <hi>Gregory</hi> has said before, there is no convincing reason that can make us reject it.</p>
                  <p>It is not requisite that I should make here an Encomium upon <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianze</hi>: It might be seen by his Conduct and those Places we have related of his Writings; what judgment may be made of him in general; and it is not sure to trust to any whatever, when we are to judge with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness of an Author. In his writings is a very faithful description of the Manners of that Age; as wherein the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency <note n="*" place="margin">

Nevertheless, his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience taught him, as is evident, that the very Bishops did not act on these occasions, with more Widom than the Vulgar. We only need to read his description of the Council of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to be convinced herein. Their judgments were so much the more to be feared, because they determin'd very speedily, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exactly informed of the matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but agree'd with very great difficulty, as in the business of <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Gregory.</hi> They scarcely thought on any thing but to enrich themselves and to augment their Authority, under pretence of Piety, as <hi>Gregory</hi> reproacheth them in divers Places.</p>
                  <p>This inclination commonly possessing the Ecclesiasticks of that time, made them ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the People into the Churches, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to publish both Miracles and Legends, much more frequently than before, and to Preach up a blind Credulity instead of exhorting Christians to examine their Faith, and to maintain it by good Reasons: An Example whereof may be seen in the Eightenth Speech of <hi>Gregory,</hi> which is in the Honour of St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> He Accuses the Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who bore this name, of being a Magician, and of having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to seduce a Christian Virgin, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Iustina,</hi> by the means of a <hi>Demon</hi>; who not being able to accomplish his aim, entred into the very Body of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and was driven away by this Magician, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the God of <hi>Iustina.</hi> Those who have read St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> know that this Bishop never had such an accident, and the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Fable may be seen in the <hi>Oxford</hi> Edition of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a supposititious piece, that is Intituled, <hi>Confessio S.</hi> Cypriani <hi>Martyris &amp; Pontificis.</hi> After having thus harangued upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of a Legend, <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, that the Ashes of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> had <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or.</hi> 18. <hi>p.</hi> 394.</note> the Vertue of <hi>driving away Devils, curing the Sick, and foretelling Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turities.</hi> Persons are as little inclined to believe these Miracles, as the other part of this Fable. A piece of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise at the end of this Speech, where <hi>Gregory</hi> asks him his Advice <note n="‡" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 286.</note> for the better governing of his Flock. This Prayer hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of Rhetorick in it. There is likewise another place in this Speech, which may perswade us that the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints began to be in use at that time. <hi>Iustina</hi> represented <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 279.</note> 
                     <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>to help a Virgin in danger.</hi> In effect the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Miracles which were said to be done at the Graves of Martyrs, has a very great connexion with the Worship that is rendred to them several Ages since amongst Christians. As if we believed that the Ashes of Martyrs cured the Sick who drew nigh them, and did many other Miracles, there appeared no danger of making Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to them, to ask some Favour of them; since God did so many Miracles in favour of those that called upon them near their Graves. There is great probability that the belief of Miracles, which Saints did after their Death, is not much older than their Invocations. Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> in his English Life of our Bishop, saith not without Reason, that <hi>Gregory</hi> sometimes speaks to the Dead, by a Figure of Rhetorick, which has been observ'd <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 35.65, 66.</note> more than once; but there is no Figure in the Action of <hi>Iustina,</hi> which <hi>Gregory</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly did approve of; as appears by the manner he relates it; I shall not undertake to speak of all the Speeches of <hi>Gregory,</hi> it sufficeth to have given an Extract of his Principal ones. We have Two hundred and forty one Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his, the greatest part of which regard some particular Affairs, which are not well known to us, or contain Complements, or Morals, or even some Jokes. There are few considerable Facts, excepting those, wherein he complains of the Ill Manners of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of his time, and of their Disputes. These Letters are not of a Periodick Stile,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:103507:192"/>
like to his Speeches, yet they were written with Care, and generally very Elegant.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the Works which bear the Name of <hi>Gregory,</hi> it's doubted if two are his. 1. The Forty fifth Speech which treats of <hi>Divinity,</hi> and directed to the Monk <hi>Evagrius.</hi> The Author makes it his business to Expound how Three Persons can be in God; though we cannot say that there are Three Gods. He Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, like to <hi>Gregory,</hi> the Unity of God in the strict Union of the Three Persons, and in the <hi>specifick Identity</hi> of their Essence. 2. A Discourse upon the beginning of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is believed, that the <hi>Paraphrase</hi> of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastes</hi> which is amongst the Speeches of our <hi>Gregory,</hi> is supposed his, who is called <hi>Thaumaturge</hi>; and that the Tragedy which is at the end of his Poetry, Intituled <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Sufferings,</hi> is <hi>Apollinarius</hi>'s of <hi>Laodicea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we may reckon amongst the Works of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianze,</hi> at least, in regard to the Form, a Collection of Divinity, which he had made with his Friend <hi>Basil,</hi> in reading the Works of <hi>Origen,</hi> as may be seen by his Letter the LXXXVII to <hi>Theodoret</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tyane. Gregory</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Collection useful, the Doctrin it contains may be looked upon as that of <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Basil.</hi> We have already said, that the <hi>German</hi> Edition of the Works of <hi>Gregory,</hi> which lately appear'd, contains nothing but what is in the Edition of <hi>Paris.</hi> We shall only add here that two things might have been done in favour of <hi>Gregory,</hi> which would have rendred this Edition a great deal better. <hi>First;</hi> His Speeches should have been disposed according to the order of Times, as much as could possibly be found out by the very Speeches, which was easie, in regard to a great many of 'em, as appears in the Life of <hi>Gregory.</hi> The same should have been done in respect to the Epistles, which the Abbot de <hi>Billis,</hi> (tho otherwise a Learned Man) has not placed in any good Method. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It would be a thing to be desired, that some able Man should make a new Translation in Prose of all the pieces of <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. That which is in Verse is very bad, not only in regard to the Poetry, but also in respect to the Sense. He that did it being a very ill Poet, took excessive Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to fill the measure of his miserable Verse. These sorts of Translations are not regarded by the Learned, for they value them not, nor by those which cannot read the Original, without the help of a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, because it's too far above their Sphere, and they may be deceived. The Interpreter of <hi>Gregory</hi> has for Example, made <hi>Baronius,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Page. ad ann.</hi> 389. <hi>N.</hi> 5.</note> or some of his Copiers fall into an Error, since they believed that where <hi>Gregory</hi> a little after the death of his Brother <hi>Cesario,</hi> and his Sister <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> said that he was Old, that was to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of a <hi>prematured</hi> old Age, because the Interpreter made use of this term, in Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating the 363<hi>d.</hi> Verse of the Poem In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Carmen</hi> 1. <hi>de rebus suis</hi>; tho there is no such thing in the Original. As for the version of his Works in Prose, it is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably better; and we may say that the Abbot was as capable of writing Prose as he was unfit for Verse. It is wonderful that a Man of his Learning, should take so much pains to Translate into pitiful Verse, what he could have put much better into Prose. One thing notwithstanding may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Translation of the Speeches and Letters of <hi>Gregory,</hi> which will convince us we ought always to have recourse to the Original. And that is the Pointing of the Version, which is often very different from that in the Greek, that makes it appear more clear, and less incumbred: Tho that may in part fall out through the fault of those who have placed the Greek in the side of the Translation, (for he had Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished it alone) who have taken not care enough of the Correction, and partly by the liberty of the Translator, who has Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviated many Periods, and Lengthned those which appeared to him too short. However we may say in general, that it is one of the best Versions which has been made of the Greek Fathers, and at the same time one of the most difficult, by reason of the too figurate Stile of <hi>Gregory,</hi> and which is even Harsh and Obscure in divers Places where he treats of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Tenets.</p>
                  <p>We should here have ended the Life of <hi>Gregory,</hi> because we have nothing more to say of him as a certainty, but that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, a little too late, that what was said of the delaying of Baptism (Page 9.) may be cleared by <hi>Gregory</hi> himself. He dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes in his XL Speech, where he treats of Baptism against those which deferred it, under such pretences as we have before related. It appears by this Speech, that <hi>Gregory</hi> believed, 1. That by Baptism all past Sins were Pardoned and blotted out. 2. That it is difficult for a Man to reesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish himself in the State of Salvation, if he falls into a Mortal sin after Baptism. 3. That those who neglect Baptism, and die without being Baptized, are Damned. 4. That those who died without it, but who have not neglected nor retarded their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, by their fault, are neither Glorified nor Punished, whether they die in their Infancy, or in a more advanced Age, they desired to be Baptized. We may see by this Doctrin, and by several others, that the Christian Societies of this Age, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting one, cannot boast of following in all things the Doctrin of the Fathers. Divinity has its Revolutions as well as Empires.</p>

                     </gap> signifies; it is certain that the Ancients di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd Times by Generations, some giving Twenty five Years to each Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and some Thirty; and others allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three Generations to each Age. But all did not assign the same beginning to each Generation. According to some, the time of Infancy was reckoned for nothing, and often said that a thing was done in the time of their Fathers, tho' it happened after their own Birth, because they had share in it, and by reason of their under Age, and that they could not remember it. They accounted their Generation to begin no sooner than they succeeded their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the managing of Affairs. There were others, which begun to reckon their Generation from the very Moment of their Birth, and so <hi>Eusebius</hi> used to do, as appears by a place cited by the Author.</p>
                  <p>Supposing therefore that <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> begins to reckon his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the very time of his Birth,<note n="*" place="margin">§. 4.</note> it follows, that since he places it almost towards the end of the Empire <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi> he must be born under one of the Successors of this Emperor. <hi>Nerva</hi> reigned but a short time, the Empire of <hi>Trajan</hi> was much longer; so tho' the Reign of the first should be reckoned for nothing, it must be notwithstanding concluded that St. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> was born at the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Trajan,</hi> or else under the Empire of <hi>Nerva.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>We likewise read these words of this Father in the same Letter to <hi>Florinus: I saw you whilst I was but a Child, in the lower</hi> Asia <hi>with</hi> Polycarp, <hi>when you made a great Figure at the Royal Court, and endeavoured to insinuate your self into the mind of this Holy Man:</hi> He shews that by this <hi>Royal Court,</hi> that of the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> must be understood, who could not make so quiet a Voyage into <hi>Asia,</hi> as to give occasion to <hi>Florinus</hi> to pursue a Friendship with <hi>Polycarp</hi> before the Year CXXII. of the Common <hi>Aera</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us in the same Letter, That he often heard <hi>Polycarp</hi> say, upon the Subject of the first Founders of Heresie, who openly divided the Church in his time, <hi>O God to what time am I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served!</hi> We need then only know pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely the time in which the Hereticks <hi>Marcion, Basilides, Valentinus, Saturninus, Cerdon</hi> and others took off their Masks. Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> endeavours to shew, that it was in the same Year of the Voyage of <hi>Adrian</hi> CXXII. so that St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> being then Twenty five Years, it follows that he was born toward the XCVII Year of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> far from the common opinion; which says, he was not born till the CXL Year of our Lord.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> hath made appear in his first Dissertation, <note n="*" place="margin">§. 12. <hi>&amp; seq.</hi>
                     </note> that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks came from amongst the Jews, and separated by a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Schism from the Christians but under the Empire of <hi>Trajan.</hi> These are some of the Reasons he hath made use of; <hi>Hege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus</hi> tells us, in a passage which <hi>Eusebius</hi> preserv'd for us, that the Church remained a Virgin during the Life of the Apostles and the first Disciples of our Lord; and that it was after their Death, that Men publickly preach'd against the Truth. This same Author saith also, That the first that separated himself from the Church, was one <hi>Thebutis,</hi> because he was not raised to the Episcopacy of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, as <hi>Hegesippus</hi> says, after the Death of <hi>Simeon</hi> Son of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> and under the Empire of <hi>Trajan.</hi> Whence it follows that this <hi>Thebutis</hi> separated himself from the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:103507:193"/>
Church not till the Year CXVI<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of our Lord, and the last but one of this Prince, seeing that since the Death of <hi>Simeon</hi> the See of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was vacant but that Year. The Author confirms all this by Passages of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Iude,</hi> who observe, as he pretends, that there were many False Doctors arisen when they writ their Epistles, but that they only taught privately, being not as yet sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Church. He enquires into the time that all these Epistles had been written, and shews, according to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that this agrees very well with the Epoche which he hath observed of the first Schism that happened in the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Celsus,</hi> a great Enemy to Christianity, confesseth in <hi>Origen,</hi> that the first Disciples of our Lord were all of the same Opinion, and that they were not separated from one another until their number increased. He reproaches them with these Divisions, and had not omitted it, if there had been any in the time of the first Disciples, to have made a Demonstration of them in like manner.</p>
                  <p>The same Truth also appears by a place of <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>: This Author pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to prove that the Heretical Churches were of a later date than the True. To this purpose he divides the time which passed since the Birth of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> into three Periods; the first comprehends the time of our Saviour's Life, from <hi>Augustus</hi> to the fifteenth Year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Calculation of <hi>Clement</hi>; the second from the Death of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Paul</hi> under <hi>Nero</hi>'s Empire; and the third from <hi>Nero</hi> to <hi>Adrian. Clement</hi> shews that all Heresie began after these three Periods, thus agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> that they appeared not until <hi>Adrian,</hi> so that some were in being until the Emperor <hi>Antoninus</hi>'s time, which is true of the Heretick <hi>Marcion,</hi> and very likely of <hi>Valentinus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> having proved in his first Dissertation, that the Hereticks did not begin to disturb the Church until under the Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi> pursues this Subject in the Dissertation whereof we give the Extract, and proves in particular, that <hi>Marcion, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silides, Valentinus,</hi> and some other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, made <hi>Polycarp</hi> say so often, <hi>O God to what times am I reserv'd?</hi> That all these Hereticks, I say, did not discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves until under the Empire of <hi>Adrian</hi>; the reason hereof may be seen in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; we will be satisfied to remark, that he reprehends <hi>Tertullian</hi> by the bye, of some very gross Faults, as that he made but one Emperor of <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Claudius</hi> under the name of <hi>Tiberius Claudius</hi>; but this of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> will not seem so strange, as in <note n="*" place="margin">H.E. lib. 2</note> 
                     <hi>Eusebius</hi> one Emperor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three, <hi>Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Antoninus,</hi> and that the Historian says they were Brothers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">§. 21. &amp; seq.</note> After having spoke of the time of St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s Birth, Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> search'd after that of his Death; he rejects the pretended History of his Martyrdom by the Persecution of the Emperor <hi>Severus,</hi> because it does not appear in any Author of the four first Ages, that this Father was Martyred, there being none that gives him this name. To comprehend the strength of the Argument (which is a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this Subject) you must know that the Honour of Martyrdom was so Glorious, that this Praise was never forgot; so that St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> not having it from any Ancient Author, though they gave him many Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Titles, we ought to conclude that it was not due to him.</p>
                  <p>It's true, some of the following. Ages honoured him with the Title of Martyr; the first that gave it him was the Author of the <hi>Questions to the Orthodox,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> supposes to be one <hi>Iustina Sicilian,</hi> that is supposed to be writ about the end of the fifth Age; at least he is sure he did not live until after the Emperors embraced Christianity, and consequently his Testimony alone ought not to be taken for things that passed a long time before.</p>
                  <p>The second who calls S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Martyr is <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>In</hi> Esa. 64.</note> St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> but because this Doctor has not given him this name in the places wherein he ought to have given it him, if he had thought it his due, Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> judges it is some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark that might have passed out of the Margin into the Text, so that nothing can be concluded in favour of St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Martyrdom, neither from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Questions to the Orthodox,</hi> nor from the Testimony of St. <hi>Ierom</hi>; and <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> may be looked upon as the first that spoke of it affirmatively, but it is with so little Exactness, and upon so false Supposition, that one ought not to take notice of what he says: He will have him dye in the same Persecution that crowned <hi>Photion</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lions,</hi> whom nevertheless St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> succeeded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Besides it is certain that he lived when <hi>Victor</hi> was Pope, as appears by the famous Dispute that happened about <hi>Easter,</hi> which was undoubtedly in that Pope's time. And it seems under the Empire of <hi>Commodus. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> and the Chronicle of <hi>Alexandria</hi> make mention of this Father in the third Year of this Emperor. Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that it was upon the occasion of his Works against the Schism of <hi>Blastus</hi> and <hi>Florinus,</hi> that he put out under <hi>Commodus</hi> rather than <hi>Severus,</hi> by reason of the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Reign of this last, during which it seems this Dispute was quieted.</p>
                  <p>The last Actions of St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> which we have any knowledge of, end in the Year CLXXXIX of our Saviour, and the Tenth of the Emperor <hi>Commodus,</hi> so that it may be concluded this Father died about Ninety, but not full a Hundred Years of Age.</p>
                  <p>This Author attributes this long Life to Providence, that Tradition might be more compleat: The same also was said of the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:103507:193"/>
Patriarchs before <hi>Moses,</hi> because the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> were not writ; but the Writings of the New Testament being received and known, the like Necessity does not appear. Nevertheless Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> carries this thought further, and says, That it was more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, that the Churches planted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles should consent to an Error, than to convey Books under the borrowed names of Apostles; there would be nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fall into this Unhappiness, but the Perfidiousness of an Ill, or the too great Credulity of a Good Man. It's to befriend Tradition extreamly, to bring it from the Inconveniencies to which it seems a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times more subject than Scripture: For after all, how would it be possible to distinguish from the true Apostolick Tradition, what might be added under pretext of Explication, for some other end.</p>
                  <p>After having spoke of the Person of St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> passes to his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the following Dissertations: The design of his Work against Heresies, and the time wherein it was written, wholly takes up the fourth Dissertation: If this Father excuses the Rudeness of his Style, it is not that he was an Enemy to Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or that he despised it, but because his long abode in <hi>Gaul</hi> made him lose the Habit of speaking the Greek Tongue, and because he was not accustomed to write; whence it is concluded that his Work against Heresies was the first of his Writings; nor did he write it until he was far in Years, because he talks of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seen <hi>Polycarp</hi> in his Youth, as a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Advantage; which seems to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that there were but few then in the World that could say the same thing. He says also, that divers Bishops succeeded <hi>Polycarp</hi> in the Government of the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which shews it was a long time after the Death of that Holy Man; <hi>Irenaeus</hi> might be then about eighty Years of Age.</p>
                  <p>This Work against Heresies, was not all writ at the same time, nor was it built upon the same Foundation; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it appears by divers places, that the two first Books entirely took up the Design of the Author. It was after these were ended, that he thought of making a third, which soon followed the other two: After that he made a fourth and fifth Book, wherein he speaks of the Doctrin of our Lord. But though he writ these things at several different times, all the work was ended in a short time. <note n="*" place="margin">§. 7.</note> As <hi>Irenaeus</hi> himself says, in a Letter to a Friend that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to write upon this Subject. Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> acknowledges that he does not know who this Friend was, and makes no Scruple to refute those that thought it <hi>Turibius</hi> a Priest of <hi>Toledo,</hi> whom the Author of this Fable Confounds, with one <hi>Turibius</hi> of <hi>Asturia</hi> who lived not till the fifth Age; whether there were two of this name, or that they made two of one, which was often done, it was so that <hi>Anaclet</hi> was made two Popes, in taking away from him the two first Syllables of his name.</p>
                  <p>However this Friend must be a Grecian, because St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> writes to him in Greek, and makes an Apology for the Roughness of his Style: It may be he lived in <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> or in some place of the Continent that is near this Island, according to the Author's Conjectures, who pretends that the Heretick <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was of this Country. He desired him to explain the Doctrins of the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> and because they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced almost all the Opinions of the other Hereticks, it makes <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speak of them all in his Work; going back as far as <hi>Simon</hi> the Magician, pretending that they derived their Birth from him, as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox did theirs from <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and his Apostles: It is true, the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> and other Hereticks of St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s time, did not acknowledge this, for they maintained on the contrary, that they received their Doctrin from <hi>Theodad</hi> Disciple of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Basilides</hi> said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he received his from <hi>Glaucias</hi> Interpreter to St. <hi>Peter</hi>: But this Father proves that they descended by an uninterrupted Succession from the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>Menander</hi> Disciple to <hi>Simon</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician.</p>
                  <p>The better to apprehend all this, the Author observes that the new Hereticks used always to joyn themselves to the Ancient ones, and to enter into a Society with them, adding also some new Error to their Heresie, whereby to distinguish themselves. And as among Philosophers there was one <hi>Potamon</hi> that pick'd and chose what he liked in all the rest, to form his own Principles by: So it is very likely that the <hi>Valentinians</hi> formed their Heresie from what they found in the other Heresies that suited with their Design. This is the reason that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> calls it a <hi>Recapitulation of all Heresies</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </note>
                     <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> was one of the chief Disciples of the <hi>Valentinian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, who according to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim we just before spoke of, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded new Errors to those of his Masters. It's of him that this Father speaks of in the beginning of his Work. <hi>Marcus</hi> was Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> erected a new School, and is more spoken of in what follows than his Master. His Errors spread as far as <hi>Gaul,</hi> and all along the <hi>Rhine.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> proves that the <hi>Valentinian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, <hi>Colorbasus,</hi> was more ancient than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Marcus</hi> or <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> because he was contemporary to <hi>Valentine,</hi> of whom he learned his Doctrin, after which he form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a new School: All which is contrary to what <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writ. These Hereticks, like the <hi>Pythagorians,</hi> did not explain their Opinions, nor communicate their Books to any but them who were initiated into their Mysteries; which was the reason that very few were well acquainted with them, this caused St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s Friend to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:103507:194"/>
desire him to inform therein; therefore this Father design'd, as he himself declares, to discover the Practices of the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> and exclaim against their Manners: Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> Remarks upon this, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers used to represent the Ill Lives of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, thence to draw Consequences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Doctrins; according to the Maxim of Jesus Christ, <hi>You shall know them by their works,</hi> Matth. 7.16. Though this Consequence is not always lawful, for the Manners of one that is Orthodox in his Judgment, and may be corrupt; and on the contrary a Heretick may lead a pure and holy Life: But it was just against the ancient Hereticks, whereof the most part approved by their criminal Opinions, their lewd Practices. They affirm'd that one might deny our Saviour by word of Mouth, if Persecuted. That Magick was lawful, and that simple Fornication was not a Crime, <hi>&amp;.c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Author employs the rest of this Fourth <hi>Dissertation</hi> to find out the time wherein St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> writ this piece against the Hereticks; to which purpose he runs over all the <hi>Valentinian</hi> Hereticks, of whom we before have spoken, and by the great many helps of Conjectures and Inquiries, discovers the Times wherein they lived and Taught; and concludes at last that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> writ this Work after the Death of <hi>Photinus</hi> his Predecessor, about the Year CLXVII. of the common <hi>Aera,</hi> and the ninth or tenth of his Episcopacy; and because this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speaks of the Version of <hi>Theodotian,</hi> which is thought to have been later, he endeavours to shew that it is a Mistake, and that there is nothing in the whole but what agrees with his Calculation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Reasons may be seen in the Author, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot be alledged here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being Tedious.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth <hi>Dissertation</hi> treats of the Interpreter of St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and a Passage of St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> which joins St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> with the <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, that clear'd <hi>Erasmus</hi> from his doubt whether he writ in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> adds another, that neither <hi>Erasmus</hi> nor Father <hi>Feuardant</hi> who published an Edition of St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, which is, that St. <hi>Ierom</hi> says that he'll mention none of the <hi>Greeks</hi> but <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lyons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He adds Arguments to these Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. This Author excuses the Roughness of his Stile, because he lived along time among the <hi>Celtes,</hi> and was obliged to make use of their barbarous Language; but had he writ in <hi>Latin</hi> this excuse would not have taken, for there was not only a <hi>Roman</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony at <hi>Lyons,</hi> but also every fifth Year they celebrated the terrible Combat of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators in Honour to <hi>Augustus,</hi> of which <hi>Iuvenal</hi> speaks in these Verses: <hi>Aut Lugdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensem Rhetor dicturus ad Aram.</hi>

                  <p>St. <hi>Ierom</hi> says also that St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> writ learnedly and eloquently, and without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute this Father was too good a Judge to give this Praise to so rude Latin as that of St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was, if it were that which is now extant; it is not difficult to observe, that the Author of this Version understood <hi>Greek</hi> very well, but could not speak Latin; so that if St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had writ in Latin, we might justly apply to him the words of <hi>Cato Utican,</hi> on the Subject of <hi>Posthumius Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus,</hi> who being a <hi>Roman,</hi> would never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless write in <hi>Greek,</hi> and yet excused the badness of his Stile, saying, <hi>He did not well understand the</hi> Greek <hi>Tongue. He had rather,</hi> says this grave Senator, <hi>beg Pardon for his Fault than not to commit it.</hi> He has also Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions so proper to the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, that they could not have slipt from an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that had writ in Latin, had he been never so little versed in the Tongue; for Example this Author translates <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> goes much further, and maintains that this Latin Version is so far from being the Original, or made by St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> as some have believed, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not until a long time after the Death of this Father; since <hi>Tertullian</hi> quotes this Work always in other terms, though he writ thirty Years after. The first that produced formal Testimonies was St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> in his Books against <hi>Iulian.</hi> What is most strange is that it seems this Father did not know that St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> writ in <hi>Greek,</hi> this Version then must be made in the time that passed between St. <hi>Augustin</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi>; and whereas St. <hi>Ierom</hi> makes no mention of it in his Catalogue composed the Year of our Saviour CCCLXXX. and the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Theodosius</hi>; it must needs be made between the Year CCCLXXXV. and the time which St. <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks of. Our Author thinks it is the Work of some <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spaniard</hi> that was very ignorant in the Latin, who undertook this Version upon the account of the <hi>Priscillianists,</hi> who renew'd the Errors of the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> which St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had disputed against. This Version was the occasion of a very singular Action; which was, that after the Heresies were smothered, this Version was so rough and full of strange Matter, that it was quite despised; so that <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great could not find one simple Copy of it, after an exact Search which he caused to be made, and that none of the ancient School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men speak of it: But on the contrary the <hi>Greek</hi> Authors had several Copies of the <hi>Greek</hi> Original, and there are Fragments of it in all Places. And nevertheless now this excellent <hi>Greek</hi> is lost and the World is full of the bad <hi>Latin</hi> Translation; the Fate of Books very often is like that of Fountains; there are little Rivers that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their Name into the very Sea, and very considerable ones that lose themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Name.</p>

                  <p n="4">IV. Our Author in his last <hi>Dissertation</hi> of the other Works of St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> begins his Letter writ to <hi>Blastus,</hi> and by the first to <hi>Florinus,</hi> the first treated of <hi>Schism,</hi> and the second of <hi>Monarchy. Baronius</hi> thought that <hi>Florin</hi>'s Errors oblig'd St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to write the Books against Heresies; but Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> is not of his mind. It is manifest that it is against the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> that this Father intended these Works, and <hi>Florinus</hi> taught a quite contrary Doctrin to that of these Hereticks; for whereas these Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks establish'd two Principles, the one good, the other bad, them <hi>Florinus</hi> made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Doctrin of the Church, but he made that the Author of Good and Evil. As for <hi>Blastus</hi> he is acquitted of the Crime of <hi>Heresie,</hi> whereof many Ancient and Modern accused him, and its believed he was but a Schismatick, having done the Office of a Priest after he was deposed by his Bishop. These two Letters were writ at the same time after his Work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Hereticks, according to our Author in the Year CLXXXII, and the Third of <hi>Comodus,</hi> and the Eighty fifth of <hi>Irenaeus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Florinus</hi> did not stop at these Errors, he soon fell into the Dreams of the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> which obliged St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to write him a second Letter, which he entituled, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>of the Eighth,</hi> because it was writ against the Eighth, <hi>des Eons de Valentinians.</hi> Our Author believes that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was above Eighty five years old when he writ it, which was about the CLXXXII. Year of Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Irenaeus</hi> writ also an Harangue against the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Subject whereof was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the Science. It is known that <hi>Isocrates</hi> not having the necessary Talents for speaking publickly, contented himself in writing several Orations, with important Advise to them that ruled the People; he was imitated by a great many others, and the Christians themselves were assisted by this Custom to teach the Pagans the Truths of the Christian Religion, and did not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to embellish their Orations with the vain Ornaments of the Sophists, to move the Curiosity of the Readers, whose Gust lay that way: Such was then St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s Discourse of <hi>Science,</hi> that it was addressed to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that is to say, to all them that were not Christians; for as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church succeeded that of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the <hi>Iews</hi> called all them <hi>Greeks</hi> that were not of their Religion; so the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans gave the same Name to all those that did not embrace their Opinions. Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> believes, that this Work was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to refute the Opinion of some Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, who thought that by Study and Meditation one might raise himself beyond all that is sensible or material, and to the perfect knowledge of God, and of all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Beings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this by themselves; that St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> proved that Knowledge was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for the other Life, and that we do not know in this but only by Faith.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> writ another Work, which he named the <hi>Demonstration of Preaching,</hi> or of the Apostles Doctrin, and dedicated it to one <hi>Mavejon,</hi> to contradict several Writings that were father'd on the first Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Saviour, and particularly the Sermons falsly attributed to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> says, that the design of this Work was the same of that <hi>of the Prescriptions of</hi> Tertullian. The Ancients speak yet of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Work of St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> intituled <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, according to St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s Interpretations, a <hi>Book containing divers Treatises</hi>; our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor imploys a long Discourse to shew that St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had erected a School in his latter days, and that he taught his Scholars what he himself had learned of the Apostles Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that is to say, Apostolical Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that this Work we speak of, was a Collection of the Lessons that he made in that School. It is pleasant to see the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> gives himself to establish this his Opinion, and it is like he took it with pleasure, because it tends to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral end he proposed to himself of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Traditions of the two first Ages of the Church with the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>What is very advantageous, is, that all these Enquiries include many curious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, which may be read in our Author.</p>
                  <p>Besides these Letters of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> whereof we have spoken, this Father writ another to <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon a Dispute that happen'd about <hi>Easter</hi>: This gives the Author occasion to inquire why the <hi>Asiaticks,</hi> who had the Apostolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on their side, generally embraced the contrary Opinion, which was that of <hi>Victor</hi>: This question did not perplex a Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, who drew hence an Argument for the Supremacy of the Pope, through this deference which the Christians had for <hi>Victor</hi>'s Opinion. But Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> who is a good Protestant, alledges other Reasons for it. The <hi>First,</hi> that the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> sent to divers Roman Colonies in <hi>Asia,</hi> who carried their Customs along with them; and the Christians who were in these Colonies, the way of keeping <hi>Easter</hi> conformably to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> is, that the Christians removed as far as they could from the Jewish Customs, through the aversion they had for the Jews; that made them not scruple reveiving <hi>Victor</hi>'s opinion concerning the day that <hi>Easter</hi> should be kept on, because it was quite contrary from that of this Nation, to which the <hi>Asia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> that opposed <hi>Victor,</hi> joyned themselves.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> believes with Mr. <hi>Valois,</hi> that the Letter to the Church of <hi>Lions,</hi> whereof a great part is seen in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> belongs to S. <hi>Irenaeus. Scaliger</hi> said, there was nothing in all the Ecclesiastick Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that moved him more than that Letter did; and that he was as it were beyond himself when he read it.</p>

                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:103507:195"/>Of all these Works, there remains only the Latin Version of the first, and some Fragments of the others quoted by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> promised to write in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar against <hi>Marcion</hi>; but there is none of the Ancien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Author added to the end of these Dissertations, a piece of <hi>Philippe de Side,</hi> upon the <hi>Catechists</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with Notes of his own. The reason that made him Print these Fragments, was because it contains a proof of what he said in his Dissertations concerning the time that <hi>Celsus</hi> lived in, against whom <hi>Origen</hi> writ.</p>

                  <p>IT appear'd as if nothing could be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in the Edition that was given us at <hi>Oxford,</hi> of this Father, in 1682. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the great Learning of Mr. <hi>Fell,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pearson,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> appeared in all its Lustre: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless these Dissertations of Mr. <hi>Dowdell</hi> shew that this Edition wanted a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Ornament: They are thirteen in number, and upon important Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, selected out of the Epistles of St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the First is examined, whether what Mr. <hi>Rigaut</hi> pretends, be true, that in the first Ages the name of <hi>Clergy</hi> was given to all Christian People, but that the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks appropriated it to themselves by little and litte, to raise 'em proudly above the People. The Author as jealous as can be of the Honour of the Episcopal Party, refutes this pretension by very good Remarks, wherein he inquires after the first occasion of applying to the Christians the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Clergy,</hi> and shews, that tho the whole Christian Church was called so, yet this Title belonged by a proper Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and special Favour to Ecclesiasticks. He touches many very Curious Things, which he has proved at large in an English Book upon <hi>Schism</hi>; and this makes the first Dissertation short enough: The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is yet shorter, wherein he Treats of the signs of Distinction, by which one may know whether a Letter be Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious or no.</p>
                  <p>The Third Dissertation treats of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Custom in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time; there were some Nuns that lay with Boys without being less bold in maintaining their Virginity: They Swore it, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to suffer the examination of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives. Mr. <hi>Dowdel</hi> says, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Zeal against, this Abuse, there were some Examples of it in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Age: But to say the truth, they were less frequent, and in this that Father has not lost very many of his Censures, tho he hardly prevailed at all upon another Art, the which was, that these Persons of different Sexes, should not live at all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This Custom has out-lived this Father, because in the following Times the Fathers we fain to make Decrees against this, as it is proved here; and this the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor brings as to what concerns the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which were Persons of different Sexes yoked together by a great commerce of Friendship, and a continual commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Life in all things, except Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. It is reported, that <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Samosatenus</hi> was the first that brought this Custom into the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi>; to which perhaps the knowledge contributed that he had, that this practice under the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> was not now among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of that famous City. However it was, he took share of that Liberty which he permitted to others, for he always had with him wherever he went, a young and handsom Virgin; and it appears by a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Letter writ by the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he was Condemned, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested that there passed nothing Dishonest between him and them. The Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> expresly forbid this to all Bishops, Priests, Deacons, Sub-deacons, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to all in Orders. 'Twas enough to forbid it to such Persons, for 'twas only they that entred into those Conversations. It might be proved that these Commerces went sometimes as far as the community of the Bed; for St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> tells us, that when <hi>Leontius</hi> was forbid to continue the inclination he had for the Young <hi>Eustolia,</hi> by castration he put himself in a condition of Lying with this fair Friend, without being suspected of Unchastity. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor seeking the first Spring of these Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, goes back to the ancient Pagans, amongst whom were Women that were equal to Men in Philosophy and Wit, and upon that account joyned themselves in a very near Familiarity with them. The Mind had the greatest share in this Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, although the Body was not excluded; and upon this there are some of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philosophy explained, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Love, wherein is shewn how these Opinions might contribute to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of several Customs.</p>
                  <p>The following Dissertation relates to a Subject more worthy of consideration, <hi>viz.</hi> of Prophetick Visions. The Author proves that they lasted almost to St <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, without interruption, and blames them who attribute almost all to the Sect of <hi>Montanus.</hi> But because the chief diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in this matter is to distinguish false Visions from the true, he endeavours to shew us how they secur'd themselves from Error. What he says here upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, declares him to be a Man not only of great Wit and Learning, but also one that is very zealous to silence the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth Dissertation evidences a great knowledge of Antiquity, in relation to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:103507:195"/>
the <hi>Dypticks,</hi> wherein were written the Names of such as were Commemorated in Divine Service; the Changes which this Custom underwent, and the Source which the Author thinks it proceeded from, furnish him with a fair Subject. The degrees of several Priests and their Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Deputations furnish him with a no less pleasant entertainment in the Sixth Dissertation. The Seventh runs upon a very obscure Point, because it relates to the Principle of the Unity of the Church, and the different Arguments which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> drew from thence, for the several Disputes which he maintained. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Eighth is not less difficult, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to clear it well, we must go back to the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, to examine the grounds of such who being received in Peace, by the Martyrs after their Fall from the Faith, thought that to be reconciled with the Church, there was no need of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Bishops. We shall mention this but in general, no more than the distinction of Priests and Bishops, which is spoke of in the two following Disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; we are brief in them, that we may have more room to speak fully on the last Dissertations, wherein ancient Martyrs are treated upon, which is a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Subject for all sorts of People.</p>
                  <p>You must know then, that the Author had the same Fate as Astrologers when they endeavoured to number the Stars exactly; they believed without doubt, what the Commonalty does to this very day, that the Stars which are seen in a clear Night, are Innumerable, yet they hardly find 1022 in the Firmament, after they have contemplated the two Hemispheres. Thus it hapned to Mr. <hi>Dowdell,</hi> as to the number of ancient Martyrs; I do not doubt but that before he Studied the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whilst he believed common Tradition, he thought that the Pagan Emperors put to Death a prodigious number of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for so all the World represent to themselves the ancient Persecutions: We imagin Martyrs in Heaps and Piles, like to the Miracles in the History of <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> who tells us that such a day was Consecrated to the Memory of 1100 Martyrs and Virgins. It is certain that there are great abatements to be made in Peoples Imaginations upon this matter; and if we were exact in our account, it will be found that the Popes and Roman Catholick Princes, have made more suffer for the sake of Religion, than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperors ever did; but Prejudices are strange things, they lessen or augment the same Actions, as they proceed from such or such Persons. Let us be so just to the Christian Authors that wrote the first after the Heathen Persecutions, to think that they have not changed things much: 'Twas they who were remote from matter of Fact that gave us such false accounts; and 'tis the ordinary Fate of Human effects, as has been obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on the occasion of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing can be so strong a proof that few Martyrs suffer'd in the first Ages, as a passage of <hi>Origen</hi>'s, where he plainly says, that few died for the Faith of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Would he have said so who writ against a Heathen Philosopher? He that had so great a knowledge of things, if accounts were true in the Martyrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies which the following Ages compiled? Nor is <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s Authority less, in reducing the Martyrs to a small number, for there are not many spoke of in the two Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections which he made, whereof tho one was lost, there were Fragments enough of it preserved in his Ecclesiastick History, to let us understand what it contained. Here also are Proofs alledged which are strengthned before hand against that plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Objection, that during the great Tempests which tost the Church, it was not easie to collect <hi>Memoires</hi>; for it is clearly justified by the practice of the first Christians, that they were extream exact and devout in celebrating the Memory of their Martyrs, and that it was easie for them to learn their Names and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of their Punishment, for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine but than they had some good Intervals; and this is a point whereby the common Opinion is retrieved, in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Heathen Emperors were not always such Devils as they are though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to be; for of 'em some have been Friends and Patrons to Christians; and others have valued themselves so much upon Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, that they made the chiefest good of their Reign consist in that they could boast they did not cause the effusion of Blood. Nor must we believe that the Intendants of Provinces have put many to Death under these Emperors; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever brutal an Intendant might be, he would not think of making himself, a fierce and bigotted Converter, when he knew the Court would disprove it; and they seldom satisfied their barbarous or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Tempers, until they had brought the Prince on their side. St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> tells us, that the greatest part of Pagan Governors of Provinces gloried in leaving them without putting any one to Death. But whereas these general Reasons would not with all Readers be of sufficient force against the vast Collections of Martyrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, which have been a long time made, and are become the Subject of Meditation, not only to devout Souls, but also to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voral Rhetoricians, the Author takes a particular review of each Persecution of the ancient Church.</p>
                  <p>He begins with that of <hi>Nero,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently meets with a Passage of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> which does not seem to favour him, because this Author says that they <hi>put a great number of Christians to Death.</hi> The Author seeks for no frivolous subtilty to elude this Autorhity, but on the contrary he strengthens the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection with a false Remark, in applying to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:103507:196"/>
that Time these words of <hi>Tacitus, Repressar in praesens exitiabilis Superstitio,</hi> which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly relates to the Suffering of Jesus Christ. He acknowledges then <hi>the great Multitude,</hi> but pretends that this Storm fell only upon the Christians at <hi>Rome,</hi> and so diminishes much the Idea's that People framed to themselves of this first Persecution. He also believes that the Names of these Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs were not put in the <hi>Archives,</hi> whether it was that it was thought they ought not to be put in the number of Martyrs, who were not put to death under pretext of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but because they were suspected to have set <hi>Rome</hi> on Fire, or whether it was that the Custom of Anniversaries was not then established among the Christians; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this he gives us several critical Remarks, and passes to the Persecution of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and shews clearly that it was but little or nothing. Since that time to the time of <hi>Decius,</hi> the Church enjoyed great rest, if we believe <hi>Lactantius</hi>: It is already a great Prejudice to suppose that it was miserably torn in this Interval, for whence should <hi>Lactantius</hi>'s ignorance of all this proceed? But not to ground all this Affair on his Omission; all that concerns the Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Trajan, Adrian, Anthoninus, Marcus Aurelius, Severus,</hi> and <hi>Maximinus</hi> is careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, and the Advocates of Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rologies are shewn, that their account is to be much lessened: This place teaches us a thousand curious things concerning the History of those Times, and the Pretexts that animated the Gentiles against the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: These Pretexts were of that nature sometimes, that they shewed more Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence than Malice. As for <hi>Decius</hi> it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that though he had very good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and was very Mild, nevertheless he suffered himself to be possessed with much Hatred against the Church, but not to that degree as to have caused so great a Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as is attributed to him. Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> adhering to St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> the most he can, Remarks, that when he perceived that the People of <hi>Carthage</hi> sought to expose him to the Lions, he retired in hopes that his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence would appease the Tumult: A great Arguments against some Brain-sick-fellow, that would have People dare the Orders of a Prince as soon as he meddles with the Privileges of Religion, and think it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lawful for a Pastor to yield to the Storm 'St <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Flight was followed with two kinds of Persecutions; for until the Proconsul came the Magistrates of Towns having no Power to condemn to Death, contented themselves with Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Imprisoning, and nevertheless for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a great many to abjure their Religion. When the Proconsul came, he tried to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Faithful without making use of the most rigorous Punishments, but seeing them firm, he exercised the utmost Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. There were then many martyr'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til other Cares, or seeing the little benefit of such Cruelties, he grew less violent; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Mr. <hi>Dowdell</hi> does not think their number very great that Sealed the Truth of their Religion with their Blood; nor does he much value the Life of St. <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus,</hi> because it was writ more than a hundred Years after his Death upon <hi>hear-say,</hi> the most Fertile Subject of Fables and Hyperboles in the World. After this, he runs over the time that past between the Persecution of <hi>Decius</hi> and that of <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> (for as for <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate it's well known that he was not Cruel) and he finds great abatements to be made in every Place in the Computations of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrologies. He here gives a great insight into many things, especially concerning the Emperor <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and his <hi>Collegues.</hi> He does not forget to note one thing that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours him much, which is, that in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est heat of the Persecution there were no Martyrs; for Orders were given to Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Christians after such a manner that none might dye, that they might brag of their Clemency, and take from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians the Crown of Martyrdom, as <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> elegantly expresses it. The Author ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves that the Persecutors Stroke came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a thousand Artifices used before; which is but little credited by those Pagan Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors; for their Violences are represented to have been so brutish, that they had not the honesty to cover them with any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. This <hi>Dissertation</hi> ends with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark that will perhaps displease a great many; which is, that Anniversaries and Honours done to the Memory of Martyrs, were borrowed from the <hi>Apotheoses</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Twelfth <hi>Dissertation</hi> treats of the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of Martyrs, which was so admirable, whether the nature of the Torments they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured were considered, or the Age and Sex of a part of them that suffered, that People may desire to know whence that Constancy proceeded. It is well known that the Spirit of God was the chief Cause of it, but some may wish to be inform'd if there were no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives whereby the natural Strength mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by a Divine Providence might contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to it. Therefore Mr. <hi>Dowdell</hi> curiously examines it, and proposes a great number of Motives, the chief whereof follow here.</p>
                  <p>He says, that the Primitive Christians led so austere a Life, and that they so much accustomed their Bodies to hard Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, that they could easily resolve to undergo Punishments, the Thoughts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would make a Man tremble that had been brought up tenderly in Pleasures; and upon this he alledges the Undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Patience of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> which without doubt proceeded from the Austerity of their Discipline. He might have added what was said by a Voluptuous Man, who was witness of their mean Fare, that <hi>he would wonder no more why they so boldly dared Dangers</hi>; as if he would say, that their Condition was so hard that it would not seem strange that they should prefer a glorious Death to it. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor says, that though Christians were too
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:103507:196"/>
well instructed to be governed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Glory; yet it was strange if the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that was shewn to the Memories of Martyrs, and also to them that were but Confessors, did not make some Impression on their Souls. It is true, that the Fathers did not disapprove of their having a sense of the Honour that redounded to the whole Body, when any part thereof suffered for a good Cause. Moreover he says, that the Testimony of a good Conscience, and the certainty they were in of an Eternal Felicity, gave them great boldness against Torments, and even against Death it self. But as it is certain that the Christians chiefly contemn'd that Death that was joined to a Crown of Martyrdom; for sometimes a common Death would not be so pleasing to them; so we must of necessity examin the Reasons for this particular kind of Death; the Author concludes them to consist much in the Opinions which the first Ages had, that Martyrs would go directly to the Abode of the Blessed, without stopping at the Receptacle of Common Souls, there to expect the end of the World, without need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fire that's to consume the World, to complete the Purification of their Souls; and because this Fire was believed more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable than the most cruel Pains of Martyrdom; this Opinion much support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. It was thought likewise, that the Privilege granted to all Saints, of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining by their Prayers a shortning of the time destin'd for the Sufferings of the Church, belonged after a more eminent manner to the Martyrs; so that they were looked on to be the chief Cause of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Chastisement of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of Recompencing the Good by the Reign of a thousand Years: And they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the first Resurrection would happen in that Reign, that it would be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Just, and that the Martyrs would be very advantageously distinguished; for they lookt upon it to be so far off, as we do the Glory of Paradise; they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that the Reign of a thousand Years at hand; so that all these Hopes prevailed much with them towards a desire or Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I do not speak of the degrees of Glory that was assigned the Martyrs to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and which much surpassed the Glory of other Just Men. In fine, they were of opinion that all Faults were obliterated by Martyrdom, and that it was a <hi>Propitiatory</hi> Sacrifice, not only for the Martyr, but also for all such as had fallen, and were reciev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Peace by him before his Death: The Author explains how that does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the infinite Value of the Death of Jesus Christ; and lest he should be accused for not making the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Assistance of the Holy Ghost inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene oftner in Martyrdom, he shews at length that the hopes of this inward Grace that so often miraculously assisted the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, gave Courage to the Faithful.</p>
                  <p>His last <hi>Dissertation</hi> fully shews, that the ancient Church looked upon Martyrdom, as upon a Second Baptism: We might draw several Remarks from it, if this Article were drawn at length; and for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we will say nothing of the <hi>Appendix</hi> of this Work, where are the <hi>Fasts</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> Pieces for the most part that were never Printed, and that have a long Discourse before them, full of Historick and Chronologick Learning,</p>
                  <p>The Author has publish'd a Discourse lately upon a dark Passage of the <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chastity,</hi> where <hi>Tertullian</hi> seems to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that all Christians are Priests, and may in case of necessity Consecrate. Mr. <hi>Rigaut</hi> understanding the Passage in this same sense, was refuted by Mr. <hi>de Aubes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,</hi> and found it very convenient not to fall out with Bishops. But the Learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> that had not the same Reasons to dissemble, did not acknowledge this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates Reasons to be valid. He shews a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertation</hi> Published in 1638, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> had done very ill, if he had not believed Laicks had power to administer the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, and endeavouring to establish this Opinion upon Tradition, he allarmed all the <hi>Traditioners</hi>; therefore it was thought that nothing ought to be neglected that might prevent the Consequences of this dangerous Sentiment: Father <hi>Petau,</hi> for this end spared neither Study nor Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to answer <hi>Grotius</hi>; but Mr. <hi>Dowdell</hi> fearing that the Jesuit did not sufficiently shew the essential distinction of Priests, and lest the Divinity of Episcopacy should be exposed to any Intrenchments, has taken the Field with all his Learning to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Mr. <hi>Grotius.</hi> He tells us many fine things upon the Antiquities of the Church; it is with Reason that the <hi>English</hi> are cajol'd by him upon this Science, for in such Points as they have the same Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages with <hi>Rome,</hi> they furnish her with great Assistance, but they pay themselves well on other accounts.

whom it concerns to have some Idea of their Lives and Writings, because of the use made thereof now in Controversies, which divide Christians. The <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctors forget nothing to perswade the People, that the Fathers have been of their Sentiments, thinking that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable to reject a Doctrin upheld by the Suffrage of the most part of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. When they cite a Passage, which they think conformable to their Thoughts, they miss not to urge it, <hi>as a holy Father hath very well said</hi>; else if we oppose, any other words to them, from which they cannot well get free, they answer that it was but his particular Opinion, and reject it as an Error. The most part of Protestants esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the Consent of the Fathers, not as a Principle of their Faith, though some of them make not much another use thereof, in citing, than the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks do: Hence it cometh that in the Ecclesiastical Histories of both Parties, the Places of the Fathers are carefully remarked, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear proper for the Opinions and Practices which are this day received amongst us; and only mention by the by what we think defective in their Conduct and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. As we are perswaded that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, particularly those of the first Ages, received all those Opinions, which now we look upon as Essential, so we think we ought to praise them, and to excuse as much as possible the defects which are in their Writings, or in their Lives, so that their Panegyrick or Apology is insensibly made, with much more Passion than their History: Hence those who read Works of this nature are perswaded that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients were Men of consummate Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and of an extraordinary Purity of Manners: Hence it is concluded that if any were abused, there must needs be great reason for it, and that there was no danger either of their Relations, or the Confutations of the Opinions of Hereticks. It is thought they ought to be imitated, in their way of Reasoning and Acting, without taking much heed whether they are conformable to the Precepts of the Gospel. Thus it happeneth that there is no History of the first Ages sufficiently faithful, and that these Histories are not used as they should be.</p>
                  <p>They are far from flattering themselves of being able to remedy an Evil, which is so naturaliz'd as this, and this Work is not composed upon that design; but at least we think our selves obliged to keep off as much as possible from the ways of those who give passionate Panegyricks of them to the Publick, which expects uninterested Histories. This Method was attempted in the <hi>History of Pelagianism</hi>; and we shall endeavour to do it yet in the Life of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which we now come to relate in a few words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Titus Flavius Clemens,</hi> famous for his Knowledge towards the end of the Second Age, was born at <hi>Athens,</hi> according to some Authors, who believe they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile this Opinion with that of those, who make him to be of <hi>Alexandria</hi>; in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Athens</hi> was the place of his Birth, but that the long Abode he made at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> gave him the name of <hi>Alexandrinus:</hi> His Stile nevertheless, though pretty full of Figures, is often obscure and entangled, and has not much of the Neatness and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Accademies. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, it is certain he began his Studies in <hi>Greece,</hi> he continued them in <hi>Asia,</hi> and ended his days in <hi>Egypt.</hi> It appears he was not satisfied to be instructed by one Master, but travelled much to hear several; and thus to form to himself a more exact and universal Idea of the Christian Religion, as well as to acquire more knowledge in Human Sciences. His Masters had been themselves Disciples of the Apostles, or had conversed with the Disciples of these Holy Men, as appears by what he speaks thereof himself, though he expresseth not himself altogether distinctly. <hi>He saith that his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Writings are an Image and Representation of the lively and animated Discourses of happy and truly worthy Men, whom he had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to hear. The one, continueth he, which I saw in</hi> Greece <hi>was of the</hi> Ionick <hi>Sect. I have seen two in</hi> Calabria, <hi>the one of</hi> Syria, <hi>and the other of</hi> Egypt. <hi>I have met two others in the East, whereof the one was of</hi> Assyria, <hi>and the other, with whom I have conversed in</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine, <hi>was of Iewish Extraction. This last was the most deserving. I stopt in</hi> Egypt, <hi>where he was concealed, to seek for him. He was, as the Proverb saith,</hi> a true Bee of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily. <hi>He gathered the scattered Flowers, as it were, in the Meadows of the Writings of the Prophets and Apostles, by the means of which he could fill with a pure Knowledge the Souls of those who heard him. These Men having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the true Tradition of the Blessed Doctrin, immediately after the holy Apostles St.</hi> Peter, <hi>St.</hi> James, <hi>St.</hi> John, <hi>and St.</hi> Paul, <hi>as a Child who retains what he has learned of his Father, (though there are few who resemble them) have lived till our times, by the Will of God, to pour into our Hearts the Seed they had received from the Apostles their Predecessors.</hi> It is of a great Importance to know what Master an Author hath had, for to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand well his Opinions; for then, as at this day, Disciples applied themselves chiefly to the Methods of their Masters, and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Religion, as near as they could to the Principles of Philosophy, which they learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus Divine School men, who were Paripateticks, have since Expounded Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by the Principles of <hi>Aristotle</hi>; and thus in the places, where the Philosophy of <hi>Descartes</hi> is received, Divinity is treated on after the <hi>Cartesian</hi> way. Therefore the Learned of our Age have endeavoured to Divine, who those were which <hi>Clement</hi> spoke of. It appears, by the Version which hath been given of the words of this Father, that he had five Masters, but Mr. <hi>de Valois</hi> gives him but four, because he follows the manner of the Reading of <hi>Eusebius.</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:103507:197"/>
positively be asserted which is the Letter; but it may be said, that the Interpreters who have taken the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for a proper Name, have done it without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. There is no likelihood that <hi>Clement,</hi> who mentions not the Names of others whom he acknowledges for his Masters, should name this; there was none in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity who was named <hi>Ionick,</hi> and this name may mark the Sect of Philosophy, to which this first Master of <hi>Clement</hi> was chiefly applied. <hi>Thales</hi> and <hi>Anaximander,</hi> Philosophers of <hi>Milet,</hi> a City of <hi>Ionia,</hi> had been the Chief thereof. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> speaks honourably of both those Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers in his Writings: <hi>Thales,</hi> saith he, in a Place, <hi>was of</hi> Phoenicia, <hi>according to the Relation of</hi> Leander <hi>and</hi> Herodotus. <hi>He is the only Person who seems to have had Corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with the Prophets of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and we read not that any was his Master,</hi> &amp;c. Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, <hi>a</hi> Milesian, <hi>and Son to</hi> Praxida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, <hi>succeeded</hi> Thales, <hi>and had for Successor</hi> Anaximenes, <hi>Son to</hi> Euristratus, <hi>likewise a</hi> Milesian. Anaxagoras <hi>of</hi> Clazomenes, <hi>Son to</hi> Hegesibule, <hi>came after him; he transported his Auditory from</hi> Ionia <hi>to</hi> Athens, <hi>and was succeeded by</hi> Archelaus, <hi>Master to</hi> Socrates. Elsewhere, he saith, <hi>that</hi> Thales <hi>being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated, what Divinity is, he answered, That which hath neither Beginning nor Ending: And that another having asked him If Men can hide from God their Actions? How shall that be possible, answered he, seeing they cannot hide even their Thoughts from him?</hi> In speaking of <hi>Anaximander,</hi> of <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> Philosophers of the same Sect, he saith, that the first has established for the <hi>first Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Infinite,</hi> and that the two others have said, that the <hi>Mind</hi> governed the <hi>Infinite.</hi> The Principles of these Philosophers may be seen more at large in <hi>Diogenes Laërtius</hi>; and we may easily perceive, that there are some who agree well enough with those of the Jews and Christians, as that all that is upon Earth is come from Water, that the Night was before the Day, that the most part of Men are bad, that for to live justly we must not do that which we reprehend in others, that Heaven is our true Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not therefore incredible, that a Philosopher of this Sect had imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Christianity, and was the first Master of <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that can be said against this Thought, is, that the Succession of Philosophers of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Sect, ended in <hi>Archelaus,</hi> Master to <hi>Socrates.</hi> But though there had been no Masters of this Philosophy, who had immediately succeeded one another, that hindred not, but that those might have been Philosophers in divers Places, who followed the Opinions of <hi>Thales,</hi> and of his first Disciples. Thus <hi>Diogenes Laërtius</hi> saith in his Preface, that the <hi>Italick</hi> Sect, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was chief, ends at <hi>Epicurus,</hi> though there were <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> several Ages after <hi>Epicurus.</hi> It is no wonder that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian followed a certain Sect of Philosophy, because it is not to be understood, but as much as he judged it conformable to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. Thus <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> was a <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi> and <hi>Pantenes,</hi> Master to <hi>Clement,</hi> was a <hi>Stoick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Name of the <hi>Second,</hi> whom he had seen in <hi>Great Greece,</hi> or in <hi>Calabria,</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unknown. Some Authors believe that that of <hi>Assyria</hi> was <hi>Tatian,</hi> a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher and Disciple to <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi>; and others, <hi>Bardesanes</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> who had been a <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who never left intirely the Sentiments of this Sect, As for him, who had been originally a <hi>Iew,</hi> some believe he might be <hi>Theophilus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> though History does not observe, that he was descended of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Likewise others do conjecture that he was named <hi>Theodotus,</hi> whose Doctrin <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> had exposed in his Books of <hi>Hypotypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> or Justifications of Christian Religion; whence it comes that the Abridgment of this Work, which is seen at the end of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is entituled, <hi>An Extract of the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Doctrin of</hi> Theodotus. But some do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute these Extracts to <hi>Theodotus</hi> of <hi>Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> a Courier by Trade, but a Learned Man, who was Excommunicated by Pope <hi>Victor</hi> in CXCIV, for having Taught that Jesus Christ was but a mere Man.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the least of the Masters of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> whom he prefers to all the rest, and with whom he sojourned, was named <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus; Eusebius</hi> believes it is of him that <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> speaks in the last words of the Passage which hath been cited of him; and indeed <hi>Pantenus</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Taught in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when <hi>Clement</hi> sojourned there, and <hi>Clement</hi> called him his Master in his Books of the <hi>Hypotyposes.</hi> The Country and Parents of <hi>Pantenus</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; but we know he applied himself much to the study of Philosophy, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to that of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> won perhaps by the Manners and severe Maxims of these Philosophers, which agreed not ill with those of the Ancient Christians. There had been a publick School at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for a long time, and if some Authors may be believed, ever since <hi>Mark</hi> the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list, where the <hi>Cathecumenes</hi> were Taught, an employ which was given only to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Persons, and of a good Life. <hi>Pantenus</hi> was provided therewith, and Taught a long while in this City, by Words and Writing. He had made Commentaries upon Scripture, whereof we have only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining a few words, which are found in the Extracts of the <hi>Oriental Doctrin</hi> of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,</hi> where <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> speaketh thus; <hi>Our</hi> Pantenus <hi>saith, that the Prophets express themselves ordinarily by the</hi> Aoristus, <hi>and make use of the time present for the Future and Past.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a likelihood that <hi>Pantenus</hi> offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated as a Cathechist, when <hi>Clement</hi> arrived in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that he studied some time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, him, before he succeeded him. He applied himself there, as elsewhere, to the study of Philosophy, though he was far from taking all those who bore the name of Philosopher, for such. <hi>We do not simply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:103507:198"/>
saith he, <hi>every sort of Philosophy, but that only whereof</hi> Socrates <hi>speaks in</hi> Plato: Socrates <hi>observed, That there are a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny called, but few chosen. For he adds in the Sequel, that the latter, according to his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are those who have applied themselves, as a thing very requisite, to Philosophy.</hi> That People should not be taken for Philosophers, who perhaps had but a shew. <hi>Clement</hi> would not apply himself to any Sect abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, but followed this manner of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophising, which was then <hi>Eclectick,</hi> to wit, that of those, who chose out of all Tenets what appeared most reasonable unto them, and formed a System thereof for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Use. <hi>Potamon</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>Augustus,</hi> was the first, who had put in Use this manner of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophising. <hi>Clement</hi> could not choose a more commodious Method for a Christian Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, because there is no Philosopher, whose Tenets are all conformable to those of the Gospel, though there may be made a System drawing very near that of the Christian Doctrin, in gathering in all the Philosophers what they have said conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Light of Nature, or to some ancient Traditions spread almost over the whole Universe. It is <hi>Clement</hi> himself who speaks it, and who assures us that he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to the <hi>Eclectick</hi> Philosophy, for the Reason we have alledged. After hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing said that God sent Philosophers to Men, he adds, <hi>That he understands not, neither that of the</hi> Stoicks, <hi>nor that of the</hi> Platonicks, <hi>nor that of the</hi> Aristoteleans: <hi>But I give this Name,</hi> continueth he, <hi>to the Truths which these Sects have held, and which may incline Men to Iustice and Piety. I in no wise call Divine, the false Thoughts of Men. He saith elsewhere, that the barbarous Philosophy, and that of the</hi> Greeks, <hi>hath included some Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Eternal Truths in them, not from My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology of</hi> Bacchus; <hi>but of</hi> Reason, <hi>which has always existed. He that should rejoin,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues he, <hi>that which hath been divided, and which would compose a perfect System, could assure himself of acknowledging the Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A like Thought is in <hi>Lactantius,</hi> which affirms, that it is easie to shew that Truth altogether hath been divided amongst the different Sects of the Philosophers; and that if there was any who would gather the Truths scattered amongst all Sects, and make but one Body of Doctrin, certainly it would not be far from the Sentiments of Christians. <hi>Quodsi extitisset aliquis, qui veritatem sparsam per singulos, per Sectasque diffusam colligeret in unum, ac redigeret in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, is profecto non dissentiret à nobis.</hi> He saith afterwards, that none could do it but by Divine Revelation; but that if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, as by hazard, that some body should do it without this Succour, there would be nothing more assured than this Philosophy; and that though he could not defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by the authority of Revelation, Truth wou'd be maintained of it self, by its own Light. He afterwards blames those who apply themselves to a Sect, so that they would embrace all its Sentiments, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all others ready to dispute against all the Doctrins which they have not learned of their Masters. This design of gathering all which Philosophers have said conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Gospel, is undoubtedly very fine, and can much conduce to convine the Truth of Christian Religion. But for to succeed therein, the Christian Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Religion should be equally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, to comprehend the clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Articles, which regard Practice and Speculation. The <hi>Heterodox</hi> of those Times, for want of taking heed, had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into Christian Religion an infinity of Philosophical Tenets, which have no Relation with those of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Carpocratians</hi> believed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Relation of <hi>Clement,</hi> that it was permitted to meddle confusedly with any Woman whatever, and did it actually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having Supped in a great Company, and extinguished the Candles; they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd this Thought, because <hi>Plato</hi> would have Women to be common in his Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and that they had wrested divers Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of Scripture, to accommodate them to this Sentiment. <hi>Clement</hi> believeth, that they ill understood, not only Scripture, but also <hi>Plato,</hi> who, according to him, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing else, but that there should be no Girl in the Commonwealth, to which all the Citizens indifferently might not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; though after she being Married to one Man, others could no more hope to Espouse her. It might be well shewn, that <hi>Clement</hi> expounded not well the Thought of <hi>Plato,</hi> if this was a Place for it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Marcionites,</hi> who said that the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Nature are bad, and who condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Weddings, fell into this Opinion, so opposite to that of <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> because they expounded some Passages of Scripture, by the Principles of the <hi>Platonicks</hi>: Because the Scripture often describes the Miseries of this Life, and praiseth Continence; they imagined that the Sacred Authors had had the same Ideas of this Life and Generation, or Birth, that <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> had. These Philosophers believed, as it hath been remarked, that Souls existed before the Body, where they are only sent to be punished for the Sins, which they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in another Life; and that thus, to speak correctly, Birth should be called a <hi>Death</hi> rather than a beginning of Life; and Death a <hi>Life,</hi> because when we are born, our Souls are cast into the Prison of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, from whence they are delivered when we dye; that's the reason that these Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, and several Poets after them, said it was better not to be born, than to come into the World, and to dye in Childhood, than to live several Years, which is the Cause also that they speak sometimes in very harsh Terms against Matrimony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it served, according to them, only to build a Prison to some unhappy Soul, which was precipitated into the Body that they produced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="369" facs="tcp:103507:198"/>The <hi>Valentinians</hi> had also taken what they said of the Generation of their <hi>Eones,</hi> from <hi>Hesiod,</hi> as will appear by comparing the beginning of his <hi>Theognia,</hi> with the Doctrin of the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> related by St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who fail not to reproach them, that they had their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin from this Poet. There is some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance that they confounded the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>Hesiod,</hi> with that of the Scripture, because of some light resemblance which is found betwixt them. It would be easie to shew that <hi>Hesiod</hi> by the Marriages which he establisheth betwixt the Chaos, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Light, Heaven, Earth, Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate nothing else but that there was a Relation or Connection between the things which he united, and that it was that gave him occasion to marry them together. But it's only requisite here to shew, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of these ancient Hereticks, that the Primitive Christians made a great use of the Pagan Philosophy, and that several have abused it, as <hi>Clement</hi> has observed in divers Places.</p>
                  <p>As for himself, though he made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of following the Method of the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecticks,</hi> and to take of all the Sects what he thought fit, he had notwithstanding more Inclination to the <hi>Stoick</hi> Philosophy; because <hi>Pantenus</hi> his last Master, and whom he esteemed most (as it appear'd) prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this Sect above all the rest. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's observed, that <hi>Clement</hi> had a close and rough Stile, that he affected to speak Paradoxes, and to make use of new words; a Character by which the <hi>Stoicks</hi> are known, and those who had studied in their School. <hi>Stoicorum,</hi> saith <hi>Cicero, adstrictior est oratio, aliquantoque contractior quam aures populi requirunt. Nova verba fingunt, deserunt usi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tata: at quanta conantur? Mundum hunc om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Oppidum esse unum, &amp;c. pungunt quasi aculeis, interrogatiunculis angustis.</hi> Those who understand Greek, and read some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Clement,</hi> might easily have remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all this in his Style. There are several Paradoxes in his School-Master; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, he maintains in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Vers.</hi> 3. <hi>That their is none but the Christian only who is rich.</hi> A Paradox very like to that of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who said the same thing of their Wise Men; these Philosophers expressed themselves thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>That the Wise are only rich</hi>; and <hi>Clement</hi> hath changed nothing in it but the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Christian:</hi> The Reasons whereof he makes use to prove his <hi>Thesis,</hi> are not very different from those of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> as it may be seen by comparing what he saith with the Explication, which <hi>Cicero</hi> gives of this Stoical Maxim, in his <hi>Paradoxes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clement,</hi> in studying the Pagan Authors, was inspired with a more gentle opinion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, than Persons have been since. He Remarks in several Places, that all which they say is not false, and cites to prove it the Discourse which St. <hi>Paul</hi> made to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and which is related in the Seventeenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells them, that he Preaches unto them the same God, to whom they had erected an Altar, with this Inscription, <hi>To the unknown God</hi>; the same God of whom <hi>Aratus</hi> said, <hi>That we are of his Race. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> believes, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> approved what was good in the Inscription of this Altar, and in these words of <hi>Aratus,</hi> and that he only gave them a more perfect knowledge of the true God, whom they already had some faint Idea of, without knowing him well. He elsewhere cites a Book which was attributed to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and which was Entituled, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>The Sermon of St.</hi> Peter. It appears that <hi>Clement</hi> doubted not but this Book was really St. <hi>Peters,</hi> whence we may conjecture there was nothing in it disagreeable to the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Doctrins of that time, and that one might look upon it, if it were to be had, as the Work of a good Christian. The Place which <hi>Clement</hi> cites is too remarkable to omit it here, since it serves to shew the Opinions several Ancients, (who were not accused of Heterodoxy) had of the Pagans.
<q>Know that there is one God, <hi>said St.</hi> Peter, (<hi>in this Book</hi>) who has given Beginning to all things, and can bring them to an End; who is invisible and sees all things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to no Limits, and who compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all things, who needs nothing, and of whose Assistance all Creatures stand in want, since they exist through him; who is Incomprehensible, Eternal, and Incorruptible, who was not made, but he himself hath made all things by his powerful Word, to wit, by his Son, according to the Spiritual Interpretation which is given to the Scripture. <hi>He adds afterwards,</hi> continues <hi>Clement,</hi> Serve this God, but not as the <hi>Greeks</hi> do; <hi>because some good Men amongst the</hi> Grecians <hi>adored the same God with us, but without perfectly knowing him, of those who have received the Doctrin of his Son. He saith not,</hi> do not Serve the God which the <hi>Greeks</hi> Serve; <hi>but,</hi> Serve him not as they do, <hi>only chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner of Worship, but not Preaching unto them another God. He himself explains what he meant when he adds</hi>: For being pushed on by their Ignorance, and not knowing God so perfectly as we do, they imploy such things as God hath given them for their Use, as Wood, Stone, Brass, Iron, Gold and Silver, to make Statues; and instead of making Use of these things themselves, they Worship them. They also adore Animals, which God hath given them for their Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Fowl of the Firmament, the Fish of the Sea, the creeping things of the Earth, and Savage Beasts, as well as Weesels, Rats, Dogs and Monkeys: They Sacrifice unto Men what they should Eat, and offering dead things, to the dead, as to Gods, they testifie Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the true God, and deny thus his Existence. <hi>And that it may appear, that we and the</hi> Greeks <hi>know the same God,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:103507:199"/>
though differently, he continues thus:</hi> Serve not God neither as the <hi>Iews,</hi> for imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they only know God, they perceive not that they adore Angels &amp; Archangels, Months and Moons; for if the Moon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not, they celebrate not the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which they call the first, nor the New-Moon, nor the days of unleavened Bread, nor any Feast. <hi>In fine, he concludes in saying</hi>: As for you, learn the just and holy Doctrin, which we teach you, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, and adore God after a new man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by Jesus Christ. For we find in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that God saith: <hi>Ill make with you a new Covenant, different from that which I made with your Fathers, upon the</hi> Mount Horeb. He hath given us a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for those of the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> are ancient; and we who serve him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a third manner, which is new, are Christians. <hi>He shews clearly,</hi> saith <hi>Clement, That one and the same God has been known by the</hi> Greeks <hi>after a heathenish way, by the</hi> Jews <hi>after a Iudaical one, and by us, after a new and Spiritual manner. He shews besides, that the same God who hath given the Two Covenants, is he who gave Philosophy to the</hi> Greeks, <hi>by which the Almighty is glorified amongst them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As God intended the Salvation of the</hi> Jews, <hi>in giving them Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: So he hath raised amongst the</hi> Greeks <hi>the best Men, whom he hath distinguished from the Vulgar, according as they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving his Gifts, to serve as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets amongst them, in their proper Tongue. It is not only the Sermon of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>which teacheth this to us, it is St.</hi> Paul <hi>also, when he saith</hi>; Take <hi>Greek</hi> Books, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the <hi>Sybills</hi> Prophesied of one God only, and things which were to fall out. Read <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> and you shall find that he hath much more clearly written of the Son of God, and hath said, that several Kings should arm themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Jesus Christ, that they should hate him, for those who bear his Name, <hi>&amp;c. As the Preaching of the Gospel came in his time, so in their time the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were given to Barbarians, and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy to the</hi> Grecians, <hi>which accustomed their Ears to the Preaching of the Gospel.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <hi>Clement</hi> speaks after the same manner in divers other Places, and declares evidently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that he believed Philosophy was amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> what Prophecy was amongst the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and that God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gave equally to all Men the means of being Saved, which was also the Opinion of divers other <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clement</hi> believed also, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> had nothing good, but what they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Barbarous People, chiefly from the <hi>Iews,</hi> and from the Books, which he endeavours to prove in a thousand pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and we know that this was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion of the Fathers, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to Censure the Philosophy of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> said also the same thing, as is plain by a Passage of <hi>Aristobulus</hi> a Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick, who is said to have been Tutor to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Philometor,</hi> and who speaks thus:
<q>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> hath followed our Laws, and shewn that he studied them well. And before the time of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> before even the Empire of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and that of the <hi>Persians,</hi> they were Translated by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (besides the Seventy) as well as the History of what happened to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (our Fellow-Citizens) at their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of what Remarkable things they did and saw, and of the manner wherewith by force they possessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Country of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and how the whole Law was given, so that it's visible the Philosopher, whom we have mentioned, learned several things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for he had much Learning as well as <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who added to his Doctrin se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of our Opinions. But many things render this Author suspicious, and as he is the only Man who has spoke of a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion made before the Empire of the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>; there is reason to doubt this is a <hi>Iewish</hi> Fable. Howbeit, it appears, that in the time of this Author, true or suppsititious, the <hi>Iews</hi> accused the Pagans of having sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the Holy Books what good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions soever they had.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is very probable, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed several things of the Eastern People, as of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Babilonians,</hi> for they confess it themselves; but if the thing was throughly examined, it would perhaps be found, that in <hi>Greece</hi> they spake very clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of several things, before the <hi>Iews</hi> spake thereof after the same manner, and that these latter began to express themselves as the <hi>Greeks</hi> did, only since they have had Commerce with them. Proofs of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture might be brought, (at least as strong as all those which the Fathers urge, to prove the contrary) but as that would make us abandon too far our principal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, whereof we treat here, we shall not undertake to enter upon this matter.</p>
                  <p>It is more proper here to observe, that though <hi>Clement</hi> often accuseth the <hi>Grecian</hi> Philosophers of Stealth and Robbery: Yet he believ'd God had given them some of their Knowledge, by the Ministry of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Angels, whereas he instructed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians by that of his Son.
<q>The Lord of all Men, <hi>says he,</hi> of the <hi>Grecians</hi> as well as <hi>Barbarians,</hi> perswades those who will believe in him; for he forceth not him to receive Salvation, who can chuse, and do what depends upon time, to embrace the Hope which God offereth unto him. It's he who gives Philosophy to the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> by the Ministry of Inferiour An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; for it is a long time since, that by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, Angels were dispers'd amongst the Nations; but the Opinion of such as believe, is the Portion of the Lord.</q>
He after that proves at large, in the same place, that God is the Saviour of the Pagans, as well as of the <hi>Iews.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Ministry of Angels, to reveal Philosophy to the <hi>Greeks. Clement</hi> and those
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:103507:199"/>
who were of this Opinion, fell into it part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by reason of what <hi>Socrates</hi> said of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, who advertised him of several things, and whereof <hi>Clement</hi> seems to speak in terms which may make us believe that he was perswaded <hi>Socrates</hi> spoke truth. And this also doth not ill agree with the thoughts of the same Father and several others, who believed according to many Pagan Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, that each Person had his Guardian Angel, who would sometimes give him Advices.</p>
                  <p>It will be no wonder after that if <hi>Clement</hi> attributes a kind of Prophecy to <hi>Plato,</hi> chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we consider that the words of this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher agree so well to Jesus Christ, that scarcely at this day can the State better be described in which our Saviour was, when he was Crucified upon the Cross. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes an exact Virtue, and saith, Thus may be named the Virtue of a Just Man, who notwithstanding should go for a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, although he courageously follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Justice, and who in spight of this evil Judgment, which all the World should have of him, should to his latest Breath walk in the ways of Virtue; <hi>Yea, though he was scourged, though he should suffer divers Torments, though he was kept in Irons, though his Eyes were burned with a hot Iron, though all manner of evil should be inflicted on him, and lastly, though he should be Crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the rest, it was not that <hi>Clement</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualiz'd in any respect the Heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy to that of the Doctrin of Jesus Christ. He acknowledged that before his coming it was but like a Degree, or Preparation to Christianity, and that Philosophers could pass but for Children, if they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Christians. He looked upon Faith as necessary, since the Gospel was Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed throughout all the World. <hi>Our Saviour having given,</hi> saith he, <hi>his Commandments to the Barbarians, and Philosophy to the</hi> Greeks, <hi>hath shut up Incredulity until his Coming, at which time, whosoever believeth not in him, is unexcusable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the Books of <hi>Clement</hi> are full of these Opinions, which he defends every where with much clearness, and enlarges on them, so that we may see in those Times these Opinions were not looked upon, (at least commonly,) as dangerous; for there is no likelihood that he should have the Charge of Cathechist, after his Master <hi>Pantenus,</hi> nor that he shou'd have so many Praises bestow'd on him, as afterwards appears, if he had been considered, as a Man infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with dangerous Sentiments. St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> hath maintained the same thing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Salvation of Pagans, in his Thirty eighth <hi>Homily</hi> upon St. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was necessary to observe in a few words these Opinions of <hi>Clement,</hi> because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise divers places of his Writings could not be understood; and that it was upon these Grounds he retained all he thought ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in the Notions of the Pagans, rejecting only what appeared false unto him, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the Tenets of the Gospel, or what had been reprehended by Jesus Christ and his Apostles. Thus all the <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophers, until those who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd Fatality, believed that Men were Free by Nature, and might abstain from doing evil; as likewise that they could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves to Virtue, without having any knowledge of the way by which Jesus Christ and his Apostles undertook to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Opinions, by any express Discourse. <hi>Clement</hi> openly maintains, that Man hath the liberty of doing Evil, or abstaining from it: <hi>Neither Praises,</hi> (saith he) <hi>nor Censures, nor Recompences, nor Punishments, are Iust, if the Soul hath not power to be vitious, or to refrain from Vice, and if Vice is involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> It was not known amongst the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens what is since called <hi>Original Sin</hi>; and <hi>Clement</hi> not observing that the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Reproach the Pagans with this Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, (and teach them, that even Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, newly born, deserve the Flames of Hell) denies that Children are corrupted in any manner whatsoever. The Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, whom we have spoken of, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Marriage, amongst others, gave this Reason against it, that thereby nothing has been acted, but the bringing polluted Children into the World, seeing <hi>David</hi> said himself, That <hi>he was conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity,</hi> Psal. 51. and that <hi>Iob</hi> maintains, <hi>That there is no body free from Pollution, though he had lived but one day,</hi> ch. 14.4, 5. <hi>Clement</hi> opposes them, and says, <hi>Let them tell us how a Child newly born hath Sinned, or how he who hath yet done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as fallen under the Curse of</hi> Adam. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he Expounds the passage of <hi>David,</hi> as if the Prophet meant only, that he was descended from <hi>Eve,</hi> who was a Sinner.</p>
                  <p>It must also be observed, that a Man whose Judgment was thus disposed, wanted but little of believing that the Philosophers were of the same Sentiments with the Apostles, as soon as he could find any relation in their terms. So <hi>Plato</hi> having spoken of three Supream Divinities whom he acknowledged, (as appears elsewhere) in terms like to those which the Primitive Christians made use of, in speaking of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, <hi>Clement</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that of this Philosopher's was the same as that of the Christians.
<q>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, saith he, that <hi>Plato</hi> understood nothing thereby but the blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> and that the third Being, whereof he speaks, is the Holy-Ghost, as the second is the Son, by whom all things were made, according to the Will of the Father.</q>
And speaking of the Divinity of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> he described it no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than the <hi>Platonicks</hi> did Reason. <hi>The Nature of the Son,</hi> saith he, <hi>is the most Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and Holy, that which hath the greatest share in Empire and Government, and the most like unto him who only is Almighty: It is this excellent Nature which presides over all things, according to the Will of the Father, who best governs the Universe; who by an unexhaustible Power, and without Wariness,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:103507:200"/>
effects all that he makes use of to act in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and who seeth the most Secret Thoughts. The Son of God never leaveth the Place whence he sees all; he is neither Divided nor Shared, nor does he Transport himself from one Place to another, but is every where, and is Incircumscriptible.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Clement</hi> had another Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Human Nature of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which perhaps he fell for fear of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Body of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> inferior to that of the Gods of <hi>Homer.</hi> The Gods of this Poet <hi>eat no Bread, nor drank Wine</hi>: And our Saviour according to <hi>Clement,</hi> needed no Milk in coming into the World, and was not nourished by the Meats which he took, only through condescention, and which passed not into his Body by the same Organs as they pass into our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. It is also what made <hi>Origen</hi> his Disciple to believe that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> had no Blood, But a Liquor like that which <hi>Homer</hi> attributed to his Gods, which he calls <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>

                     </gap>licts Pains upon Men only for their good: And <hi>Clement</hi> observes it after such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to make us believe that he approves on't. <hi>Plato</hi> also said, that Souls are Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the other World by Fire, and that after their Purgation, they return to their first State. <hi>Clement</hi> believed that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles thought the same thing, when they spoke to us of a Fire which is to Consume the World; and his Disciple <hi>Origen,</hi> hath concluded from these Principles, that the Devils and the Damned will be one day delivered from their Sufferings.</p>
                  <p>The Apostles describe the Place where the Wicked shall he Tormented, under the Idea of a Lake of burning Brimstone: They made use of the same word that the Heathens did to denote the State of Souls after Death, to wit, <gap reason="foreign">

He has made mention of <hi>Cocy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> of <hi>Acheron,</hi> of <hi>Pyriphlegeton,</hi> and such like Places, <hi>where the Wicked are punished for their amendment. Clement</hi> also believed with most of the Ancients, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> really descended into Hell, and Preached there to the Damned Souls, of which he saved those who were willing to believe in him.</p>
                  <p>We might also bring many other Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by which it would be, plain that <hi>Clement</hi> expounded the Doctrins of the Christians, by opinion the most resemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling 'em which he found amongst Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers. But the Examples we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may suffice for those who have neither time nor opportunity to read this Author, as well as for those who will consult the Original, because they will find enough of themselves. One thing may be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by it, which most of those who apply themselves to the reading of the Fathers, do not much observe; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is almost impossible to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them well in abundance of Places: Which is, that before we begin this Study seriously, we must read with care the Heathen Philosophers, and particularly <hi>Plato</hi>; without which we could not well apprehend upon what grounds they reason, or examin with success the force of their Arguments, nor devise how they fell into so many Opinions, so distant from those which are this day received in our Schools.</p>
                  <p>But now, to return to the Life of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> the Ancients with a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent say he was Successor to <hi>Pantenus,</hi> in the Office of Catechist. He acquitted himself of this Employment with Success, and several great Men came out of his School, as <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> His method of instructing the Chatechumenes consisted in shewing them what there was that was good in the Heathen Philosophy, and so insensibly conducted them to Christianity, which they were in a much better way of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing, after having received several of his Maxims drawn from Natural Light, and distributed through the Writings of Philosophers, for whom they saw all the World had a respect: If they were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately told that they must renounce all their Opinions, and look upon all the rest of Mankind not only as Men who were in an Error, but such a had said nothing that was true. <hi>As Labourers cast Seed into the Earth, but not 'till after they have water'd it:</hi> So saith Clement, <hi>We take from the writings of the</hi> Greeks <hi>that which is necessary to water what we final Earthy, in those we Instruct, that they may afterwards receive the Spiritual Seed, and that they may be in a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We do not see that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and his Apostles have undertaken to give us a compleat System of all the Doctrins that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have any reference to Religion; they supposed that we were already prevented with divers thoughts established amongst all Nations, upon which they Reasoned; otherwise it would have been requisite, for example, that they should have exactly defined all the Vertues, which they have not done, because in respect to this, they found Idea's in the minds of Men, which tho imperfect, were yet very true; so they were satisfied to add what was l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or to cut off what evil Customs might have injuriously established therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:103507:200"/>Besides the Office of Catechist, <hi>Clement</hi> was raised to the Priesthood, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as 'tis believ'd, of the Empire of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi> because <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his History of the Events of CXCV, gives to <hi>Clement</hi> the title of <hi>Priest.</hi> It was about that time, that he undertook to defend the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion against Heathens and Hereticks, by a Work which he Entituled, <hi>Stromates,</hi> which we shall afterwards speak something of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in this Work, in making a Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Computation, he descends not low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Death of <hi>Commodus,</hi> whence <hi>Eusebius</hi> concludes that he compos'd it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Empire of <hi>Severus,</hi> who succeeded this Emperour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Severus</hi> enraged against the Christians, because perhaps of a Rebellion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> with whom the Heathens confounded those that professed Christianity, began to Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them violently. This Persecution ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing at <hi>Antioch,</hi> reached unto <hi>Egypt,</hi> and obliged several Christians to withdraw from their Habitations, where they were too well known, to escape the Violence of the Persecution. This seems to have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en occasion to <hi>Clement</hi> of proving it was lawful to fly in time of Persecution. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having said that Martyrdom purified them from all Sins, and exhorting them to suffer, if they were called to it, he says, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons ought to testifie that they are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Truth of the Christian Religion, as much by their Manners, as Words. After that he Expounds this Passage of the Gospel, <hi>When you are Persecuted in one City, flee into another.</hi>
                     <q>The Lord, <hi>saith he,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us not to flee, as if it were an Evil to be Persecuted, and bids us not to shun Death by flight, as if we should fear it. He will have us neither ingage in or assist any one to do Evil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Those who obey not, are Rash, and throw themselves without reason into manifest Dangers. If he, who kills a Man of God, Sinneth, he also is guilty of his own Death; he who presents himself to the Tribunal of the Jugde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he assists as much as is capable, the Wickedness of him by whom he is Persecuted. If he exasperates him, he is effectually the cause of his own Death, as much as if he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to vex a wild Beast, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards devoured him.</q>
A little while after the Apostles, Persons were observ'd to covet Martyrdom; but some after desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Executioners, scandalously falling from Christianity, at the sight of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; this Conduct was thought danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and those were condemned for it, who offered themselves freely to be Martyr'd, as appears by divers Passages of the Ancients, and by that of <hi>Clement,</hi> which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. As Men ought not to shun Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when it cannot be avoided, except by renouncing Christianity, or a good Conscience; so they ought to preserve their Lives as much as they can, whilst there is any likelihood of serving the Christians, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to prolong it by flight, than lose it by staying in Places where the Persecution is so violent, and whence they may get away without ceasing to make Profession of Truth. Those who blame, or make some difficulty of absolving some Protestant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, because they came from a Kingdom, where they could not tarry without an eminent Danger, should first prove that another Conduct would have been more advantageous to Christianity, than their Retreat hath been. Here depends the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this Question, which hath been disputed of late; If they have done well in withdrawing?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clement</hi> seems then to have quitted <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria,</hi> seeing we find that he made some Abode at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was soon after Bishop of this City, and to whom he dedicated his Book, Entituled, <hi>The Ecclesiastical Rules against those who follow the Opinions of the</hi> Jews. During his Abode there, he was very useful to this Church, as appears by a Letter to <hi>Alexander,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> whereof <hi>Clement</hi> was bearer, where this Bishop saith, that he was a Man of great Virtue, as the Church of <hi>Anitoch</hi> knew, and would still acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him so; and that he being at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> by an effect of Divine Providence, had confirmed and encreased the Church of the Lord. From <hi>Antioch Clement</hi> returned to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where it is not known how long he lived. All that can be said, is, that he survived at least some Years after <hi>Pante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and that he was not old, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed his <hi>Stromates,</hi> seeing he saith himself, that he did them to serve him for a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in his old Age, when his Memory should fail him. History teacheth us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning his Death, but it may be believed his Memory was blessed at <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria,</hi> if these words of the Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> be considered, which we have spoken of; who in another Letter to <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> saith, <hi>That they both acknowledged for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, these blessed Men, who had quitted this Life before them, and with whom they would soon be, to wit, blessed</hi> Pantenus <hi>and pious</hi> Clement, <hi>from whom they had drawn great Succours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Amongst several Works which <hi>Clement</hi> compos'd, we have but Three remaining, which are considerable. The First is, <hi>An Exhortation to Pagans,</hi> where he refutes their Religion, and endeavours to induce them to imbrace Christianity. The Second is Entituled, <hi>The Paedagogue,</hi> where he forms the Manners of Youth, and gives them Rules to behave themselves Christianly; where he mixeth Maxims very severe, and far from the Customs of this day. The Third are the <hi>Stromates,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistries,</hi> which he hath Entituled thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the variety of the Matters, which he treats of therein. He sheweth there the Conformity amongst divers Opinions of Pagan Philosophers, and those of the Jews and Christians; he censureth the Errors of Pagan Philosophy, he Maintains and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds Christianity; he refutes Hereticks, and manages every thing with much Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:103507:201"/>
But he scarcely observes any Order, as he confesseth himself at the end of the Seventh Book: He goeth from one thing to another, without forming any draught of what he is to say, and without having any other design, but to gather all that he had learned by Study and Meditation, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subjects which came into his Head. His Stile in this last Work is harder than that of the two preceding, where notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing there is more Affectation than Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and Neatness. He pretends that he had a Reason for so doing: But there are two great Inconveniencies in this Method; the first is, that the want of Order causes, that Men are not only ignorant of the force of the most solid Proofs, but also makes the Author too guilty of great Tautology, and heap up an infinity of Arguments, which conclude nothing: The Second is, that the negligence of the Stile often renders ones meaning unintelligible; for it is not Elegance only, which is a want, but Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity it self cannot be found in it. And any affected Obscurity, in hard Matters, such as <hi>Clement</hi> treateth of, is by so much the more to be blamed, as it is not very intelligible in matters which are more clear in their own Nature, though we neatly express them. As we ought to speak only to be understood, there is nothing that can excuse an Author for not speaking clearly, but an absolute weakness of better expressing himself; and in effect we find our selves naturally inclined to believe, that those whose Stile is obscure, have not a clear Mind, and that they speak thus, only because they do not more clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the things they treat of. It is true, we may censure the affected Ornaments of a sought Eloquence; but Clearness can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reckoned amongst these Ornaments. We must confess that there are very few Fathers, in whose Writings the same thing may not be observed, which is in <hi>Clement.</hi> The greatest part in excusing their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eloquent, strive as much as they can to appear so, after their manner, as may be seen by a thousand Tracts, and Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Expressions, which are not very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, wherewith their Writings are full; there being but a few who have thought that the greatest Care which a Writer ought to take, is to produce in the Mind of his Reader clear Ideas of what he saith, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing use of proper terms, and such as cannot be equivocal.</p>
                  <p>There is besides, an Homily of <hi>Clement,</hi> Entituled, <hi>Who is the Rich that is Saved.</hi> It was Printed in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> by <hi>Combefis,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> 1672. and at <hi>Oxford</hi> in 1683. with divers other <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Those who had the Care of the <hi>German</hi> Edition, whereof we have read the Title, were to blame for not joyning it to the other Works of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> which would have rendred their Edition Commendable, which without that is scarcely so, as those who make use of it will find. We have been contented to follow the Edition of <hi>Paris</hi> of 1641, without adding any thing whatever to it, excepting new Faults.</p>
                  <p>At the end of the Volume, is found <hi>an Abridgment of the Doctrin of</hi> Theodotus, <hi>and of the Doctrin which was called</hi> Easter <hi>in the time of</hi> Valentinus. They are nothing scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but Interpretations upon Holy Writ, which 'tis thought have been drawn from the eight Books of the <hi>Hypotyposes</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as we have already remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Eusebius</hi> teacheth us that he had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted Scripture in an Abridgment of this Work, <hi>without admitting,</hi> saith he, <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested Writings, as the Epistle of St.</hi> Jude, <hi>and other Catholicks, the Epistle of St.</hi> Barnaby, <hi>the</hi> Apocalypse <hi>of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and the Epistle to the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>which he assureth to be St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s, &amp;c. Photius,</hi> who had seen this Work, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, that the design also was to Expound Scripture; but he accuseth the Author of upholding that <hi>Matter is Eternal; That the different Forms which it receiveth are sent to it, by virtue of I know not what Decrees; that the</hi> Son <hi>is of the number of created things; that there were several Worlds before</hi> Adam; <hi>that</hi> Eve <hi>was formed out of him, after an other manner than Scripture saith; that Angels ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had concern with Women, had Children by them; that</hi> Reason <hi>was not made Flesh, though it seemed so to Men; that there are two</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>of the Father, the least of which hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to Men, and was made Flesh.</hi> If we had these Books, we might perhaps know more clearly, that these are but some <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick</hi> Tenets, some of which <hi>Photius</hi> has ill understood, because of the Equivocation of the Terms; and others did not pass in <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>'s time for Impieties, as they have since Systems of Divinity were formed amongst Christians. In the first Ages, where none were followed in Schools, and nothing was Expounded to young People, as at this time, every one plaid the Philosoper as well as he could upon the matters of Speculation, and expounded the Speculative Tenets, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Philosophy he had learned: Excepting some Sentiments, which for the noise they had made, or for some other Reasons, had been condemn'd by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, their Opinions were so extremely free. If any doubt of it, he might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced thereof by the strange Opinions which some amongst the Fathers had, who are put in the number of the Orthodox, and who have not been reprehended in their time. We may find divers Examples hereof in the 4<hi>th Chap.</hi> in the Book of <hi>Dail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus, of the Use of the Fathers,</hi> which in spight of the Panegyrists of Antiquity, will be always look'd upon, by those who know it, as a good Book. Such is, for Example, the Opinion of St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> who believ'd that Jesus Christ felt no grief whilst his Body was torn.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Photius</hi> suspects that Hereticks have corrupted the Works of <hi>Clement</hi>; and <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus</hi> had the same thought, as appears by his Apology for <hi>Origen,</hi> which is in the Fourth Tome of the Works of St. <hi>Ierom.</hi> Yet if there was only what <hi>Photius</hi> cites,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:103507:201"/>
there would be no reason to believe that there was a great Corruption, though it cannot absolutely be denied. The Reason of this, whatever this Learned Patriarch saith of it, is, that these same Sentiments, well understood, are found in the other Works of <hi>Clement,</hi> and are conformable to the Principles which he followeth every where. 1. He approves very clearly of the Opinion of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> who believed that the Matter of the World is Eternal, and even shews that he had an Esteem for him, because he distinguished the Matter of the World from its Form; the first where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is unmoveable, and the second subject to change. As to the Reasons for which the Matter receives certain Forms, <hi>Photius</hi> knew no more of them than <hi>Clement.</hi> 2. If <hi>Clement</hi> had said that Sovereign Reason had been Created, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) we ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that <hi>to create, to produce, to beget,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the same thing in <hi>Plato,</hi> and that it followeth not that he believed that Reason was begotten, or produced from nothing. 3. It is one of the Opinions of <hi>Plato,</hi> that in a certain number of Years the Form of the World would intirely change, and that several of these changes have happen'd afore the Revolution begun, which now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends us. One may see in his <hi>Politicks,</hi> that he maintains, the Revolution of all the Stars will cause an universal Change in the World. Thus, in his Opinion, what was said of Mens deriving their Original from the Earth, happened in the beginning of a Revolution. <hi>That is it,</hi> adds he, <hi>which our Predecessors have said, who have lived at the latter end of the first Revolution, and who drew near the second, as well as those who were born at the beginning of this. It is they who have assured us thereof, and several are to blame, for not believing it now.</hi> The Stoicks also believed the same thing, according to the Relation of <hi>Clement,</hi> who seems not to disprove their thought, and who faileth not to confirm it by the Authority of <hi>Plato.</hi> This Philosopher believed that the first Men were <hi>Androgynes,</hi> and that they had four Feet, two Heads, and so of the other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but that God afterwards divided them into two, as may be seen in his <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.</hi> Some <hi>Rabbins</hi> have advanced some such thing, and grounded their Sentiment upon this, that it's said, <hi>God created Man Male and Female.</hi> This seems to be but a Diversion of the Mind, and not an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which these Authors seriously embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Parhaps <hi>Clement</hi> sported himself to make some Reflections on the thought of <hi>Plato,</hi> with so much the more liberty, that perhaps he believed, as his Disciple <hi>Origen,</hi> that there were many Allegories in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Genesis.</hi> 4. As to what concerns Angels falling in love with Women, <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> testifies in more than one place, that he hath been of this thought; and most of the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers have thus expounded the beginning of the 6<hi>th Chap.</hi> of <hi>Genesis. Photius</hi> cannot reprehend this Opinion, without censuring at the same time all Antiquity; but it's his Custom to abuse the most ancient Authors, when he finds Sentiments in them which were not received in his time, or ways of speaking, which are not strong enough, to express those Thoughts which he believed Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty should have had, because it would have been a Heresie in his Age, not to have them. 5. Incarnation being a Mystery; which we comprehend not, and <hi>Clement</hi>'s Stile being not commonly very clear, it might happen that he expresses himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a manner which <hi>Photius</hi> did not well understand; and this is the more probable, because this Patriarch ordinarily Expounds the Thoughts of the Ancients, in reference to the Opinions and Manners of speaking of his time. The Writings of the Ancients are full of Equivocate Terms, which they use in such Senses as the following Ages were ignorant of. Terms which express <hi>Spiritual obscure things,</hi> and the <hi>most compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Ideas,</hi> are necessarily hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, because they took no care of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, or making an exact Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ideas which they applied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Perhaps it came not once into their Mind, that this would have been very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be well understood. At least we see, that when they strive to Expound themselves upon these obscure Subjects, they use as obscure Terms. 6. An Example may be remarked thereon, in regard to two <hi>Reasons,</hi> whereof <hi>Photius</hi> speaketh. Those who shall carefully Read the Second Tome of <hi>Origen</hi> upon St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> may observe that he establishes a first, or supreme <hi>Reason,</hi> which is the Divinity of Jesus Christ, and several inferiour <hi>Reasons,</hi> which are made after the Image of the precedent. It might be said in this sense, that there are only <hi>Second Reasons,</hi> which are become Flesh, because there are only they which animate Human Bodies; for though the first was united to the Humanity of Jesus Christ, it was not in stead of a Soul to him. Thus though <hi>Clement</hi> had said what <hi>Photius</hi> makes him say, he could not be accused of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie for that; but he did not say so, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Passage which <hi>Photius</hi> himself cites. <hi>The Son is called Reason, as well as the Paternal Reason, but it was not that which was made Flesh; and yet it is not Paternal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son neither, but Divine Power, (which is as an Emanation of this same Reason) which is become Spirit, (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) and which is come into the Hearts of Men.</hi> By these Terms <hi>the Son,</hi> we must not understand the <hi>only Son of God,</hi> but <hi>Man,</hi> as is clearly seen by the Sequel. Perhaps <hi>Clement</hi> had called it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> simply, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he might have sufficiently intimated before, whom he understood by this word. <hi>Photius,</hi> who has not well apprehended the end of this Passage, might easily have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocated concerning the Sequel of the Discourse; as the Jesuit <hi>Schotus,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a Learned Man, was altogether mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in the <hi>Latin</hi> Version of these words, as we shall soon observe by comparing it with that which we have already made thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:103507:202"/>But we have another Latin Work, which is attributed to <hi>Clement,</hi> and which is Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Commentariolam primam Canonicam S. Patri, in Epistolam Iudae &amp; tres Epistolas S. Ioannis Apostoli.</hi> There are indeed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things in these Notes, which are not far from the Doctrin of <hi>Clement</hi>; but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known whether it be a whole Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a part of the <hi>Hypotyposes,</hi> or only Extracts, corrected according to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Interpreter. It is known, that when the <hi>Latins</hi> translated something of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they were very subject to make Changes therein as they thought fit, as has been objected to <hi>Ruffinus.</hi> It is even need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to seek so far for Examples of this Ill Custom, seeing we have one concerning a part of the <hi>Hypotyposes</hi> of <hi>Clement,</hi> whereof <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> speaks thus; Clement <hi>of</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, <hi>hath expounded in</hi> Greek <hi>the Canonick Epistles, that is to say, the First Epistle of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>the First and Second of St.</hi> John, <hi>and that of St.</hi> James, <hi>where there are not only many subtil things; but also some things which he hath advanced, without well taking heed of them. We have translated him into</hi> Latin, <hi>so that having taken away what would Scandalize, his Doctrin thus purified, may with more safety be Read. Ubi multa quidem subtiliter sed aliqua incaute loquutus est, quae nos ita transferri fecimus in Latinam, ut exclusis quibusdam offendiculis; purificata Doctrina ejus, securior posset hauriri.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides this, <hi>Clement</hi> composed five Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, which are lost. 1. <hi>The Rule,</hi> or <hi>the Canon of the Church, against the Iudaizers.</hi> 2. <hi>Of the Passover.</hi> 3. <hi>Of Backbiting.</hi> 4. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes concerning Fasting.</hi> 5. <hi>An Exhortation to Patience, directed to the</hi> Neophytes.</p>
                  <p>After the particular Remarks which are made upon each of his Works, and what been said in general upon this occasion, there remains now only three things, which are much worth our notice.</p>
                  <p>He often cites supposititious Writings, as if they had been acknowledged by all the World, as may be observ'd by the Passage of St. <hi>Peters Sermon,</hi> which hath been a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before related, and by another of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> which seems to be taken from the Book of his <hi>Voyages,</hi> upon which, see <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and St. <hi>Ierom.</hi> This may make Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe that the great Reading of this Learned Man, had not refined his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for in fine, there is no need of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Scholar, to perceive what he cites, resembles not the Style of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, neither is it conformable to their Principles. It cannot be doubted, but that they believed the God whom the <hi>Iews</hi> ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was the true God, Creator of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who testifies it himself. Neither can the <hi>Iews</hi> be accused of having wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd Angels, Months and Moons, with any manner of Probability; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which the Author of St. <hi>Peters Sermon</hi> brings for it, is so ridiculous, that it can impose upon no body, who is not very willing to be deceived. It is true, that some Learned Men have otherwise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded this Accusation, which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes against the <hi>Iews,</hi> but it's plain by the Sequel, that he understood it more simply than they do. Howbeit, this Book being visibly supposititious, <hi>Origen</hi> act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much more prudently than his Master; seeing he had <hi>Heracleon</hi> a <hi>Valentinian</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, who drew Consequences against the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> from these pretended words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he begins thus, <hi>It would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper to examine whether this Book was really St.</hi> Peters, <hi>or if it were not wholly suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sititious, and if not, if any thing was not added to it</hi>; after which, he shews, that the <hi>Iews</hi> adored the Creator of the World. But it was the Custom of several of the Ancients to make use of all sorts of Reasons and Books, to perswade what they had a mind to. If it was so in our time, Men would be accused immediately of Simplicity, or of Falshood; but each Age hath its Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms. However its certain, that Rules of sound Sense have always been the same; and its not less true, that great Learning does not render the Mind more just, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the famous Maxim of <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> which <hi>Clement</hi> relates amongst his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clement</hi> also used to interpret Scripture allegorically, without rendering his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories probable, as the Ancients common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did: We may see what Mr. <hi>Huet</hi> says of the Origin of Allegories in his <hi>Origeniana,</hi> l. 2. c. 2. Qu. 14. But if what <hi>Clement</hi> saith be read carefully in the fifth Book of his <hi>Stromates,</hi> where he treats of it more at large, one may easily perceive, that what induced him chiefly to believe the Scripture was full thereof, was, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> had accustomed themselves to hide the Secrets of their Philosophy, under Emblems and Fables. It is true, that the <hi>Iews</hi> were fallen into this Opinion before the coming of Jesus Christ. It is true also that in the most distant times, this Nation expressed it self not only by dark words, but symbolick Actions, as appears by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing there is no Example by which it's apparent that the Sacred Authors were willing to hide the Tenets of the Jewish Religion, but on the contrary they expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them very clearly and simply. There are but few places of the History of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World, which may be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into an Allegory with any probability, and those which may only regard some Circumstances, which signifie nothing in respect to the Foundation of the History, and belong in no wise to the Worship of God, or good Manners, or Tenets, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they could not serve God, nor be honest Men, according to the Law. In the rest of all the History of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> nothing appears which in the least resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles an Allegory, all is simple and easie to be apprehended; which makes us believe, that those who writ it, were in no wise Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorists, and that if there was any thing in
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:103507:202"/>
the most ancient Events of the History of Mankind, which may be understood that way; the <hi>Hebrews</hi> have followed this turn, only because the Tradition, or the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, which they copied after, were thus express'd. We do not see that they amus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves with Philosophy, or gave any opinions of Physicks, either clearly or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely; and the places where <hi>Philo</hi> strives to find Philosophical Tenets, are wrested after so violent a manner, that there is no Person who perceives not that the Sacred Authors never thought upon what he makes them to say: Also if we reflect upon the origin of Allegories, amongst the Pagans, it will appear that they are but of a late date; and when Philosophers would give a Reason for Fables, or the ancient Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Gods; that is to say, to save the Honour of their most ancient Historians, who were accused of having absurd Ideas of Nature, as Excellent as that of the Gods, according to their Idea of it. Therefore it was necessary to make those believe, whom these scandalous Histories offended, that the Poets thought quite another thing than what they said, and thence comes, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) which signifies quite another thing than what is meant, and is what is properly call'd Allegory. It may be found out by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of three Works lately Printed at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi> and where mention is made in the 7th Tome of the Universal <hi>Bibleothick,</hi> p. 109. Thus Histories amongst the <hi>Grecians</hi> were turn'd into <hi>Allegories,</hi> fearing it should be thought that the Gods of <hi>Greece</hi> were only corrupted Men. The <hi>Iews,</hi> who never applied themselves to the study of Criticks and Philosophy, were no sooner amongst the <hi>Grecians,</hi> but they found this Method of Expounding Religion, and used it to explain the Sacred Books, after a manner more conformable to the Opinion of the Pagans, as is plain by the Example of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> who Expounds all the <hi>Old Testament</hi> like a Platonick. They even so much alter'd the Text, that they expounded allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, not only the places which might have any difficulty, but also the most clear and simple, without excepting even those that concern Manners, which being lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally understood, include excellent Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for the conduct of Life; nor the most simple Histories, whence most useful Instructions may be drawn, without search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other sense, but that which offers it self to the mind. <hi>Philo</hi> is full of such Examples. The Christians afterwards im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itated the Jews, and were not satisfied to interpret allegorically the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> but did the like concerning the <hi>New,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though neither Jesus Christ, nor the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, proposed no Doctrin after an emble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Manner, which they expounded not clearly enough themselves, to take away the trouble of seeking for the Sense, in having recourse to Allegories, which have nothing plain in them. For in fine, it must be granted, that according to this Method, though the Sacred Authors had said something different, or even quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what they did, if we would we might find a Sense equally fine, as those who examin will immediately be sensible of it. Also the Heathens themselves, who were the Inventers of this strange manner of Interpreting ancient Books, could not suffer that Christians should use it, as the Christians likewise in their turn laughed at the forc'd Interpretations of Pagans: Some Heathens also more ingenious than the rest, thought them ridiculous. The Christians and Jews had done much better certainly to apply themselves to the Letter, than to make use of so unstable a Method, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Scripture against the Heathens.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though with reason we may treat as erroneous divers Opinions of <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>; yet if we observe each particular one which we had, and that none this day holds, he shall Remark, that there are some which are look'd upon as Erroneous, only because the opposite Sentiments are established. I know not how, in most Schools, though there have been no new discoveries made thereon, so soon as any famous Person maintained a Tenet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being contradicted by People of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Reputation, or Authority, or even without any one's opposing it; this Tenet established it self so well in the minds of Persons, that Men insensibly accustom'd themselves to look upon the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as on Error, without knowing for what. Opinions are often introduced like Customs, that owe their beginning to some few Persons, which others imitate. They in time so well possess the minds of Men, that all others, except those which agree to it, seem ridiculous. A Garment which is seen but seldom, looks strangely, though it were in use in times past; it is even so with an Opinion which grows old, it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaseth because none still receives it. For Example, <hi>Clement</hi> believed that the Angels had a Body, and that also was the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Origen,</hi> and of most of the Fathers. Yet 'tis now treated as an Error, without any reason; for though Scripture teacheth us, <hi>that Spirits have neither flesh nor bone,</hi> and that Angels are Intelligences; it saith no where that they are not cloathed with any body. There has been since no Revelation upon this matter, nor no convincing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son discovered, which can perswade us of the contrary. Yet it is commonly said, that it is an Error, because Scholastick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors maintain it to be so. I confess, that the Fathers, who gave bodies to Angels, have not brought any evident Reason to prove their thought. But all that could be thence concluded, is, that they had affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thing which they know no more of than we do; so that it was better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in suspence, and assert nothing of a Subject, which was equally unknown to us. This Suspension was not ('tis true) accommodated to Dogmaticks, who are not very easie to grant, that they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of any thing, and who believe they
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:103507:203"/>
are wise enough to determin speedily upon all sorts of Questions. Indeed without that we cannot form a System so complete as we ought, to pass for Learned Men; and it would be a shameful thing to grant that upon each Article a thousand things may be asked, upon which nothing could be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, if we should say only what we know. There may be an Application made of this same Principle, on divers other Tenets of <hi>Clement,</hi> upon which it would be better to confess simply one's Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, than to condemn Sentiments, concerning which, we have no good Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                  <p>Neither have these Opinions hindred some Ancients from rendring him many Praises. <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, <hi>His Books are full of useful Learning.</hi> St. <hi>Ierom</hi> says, <hi>That he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed very fine Works, full of Learning and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and taken both from holy Scripture and profane Authors,</hi> and elsewhere. <hi>Clement,</hi> saith he, <hi>Presbyter of the Church of</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, <hi>the most Learned of our Authors, in my Iudgment, hath made eight Books of</hi> Stroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, <hi>as many</hi> Hypotyposes; <hi>a Book against Pagans, and three Volumes, Entituled,</hi> The Paedagogue. <hi>What is there in his Books that is not full of knowledge, and drawn from the depths of Philosophy? Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us, in his 6th and 7th Books against <hi>Iulian,</hi> That <hi>he was a Man of admirable knowledge, who had throughly searched the</hi> Grecian <hi>Learning, with such an Exactness, that few before him arrived at. Theodoret</hi> saith, <hi>That this holy Man surpassed, all others in the extent of his knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is easie to form an Idea of the Doctrin of <hi>Clement,</hi> upon what has been already said. It is necessary only to add a word of this Edition; two Defects may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in it, one of which is common to it, with several other Editions of the Books of the Ancients, and the other is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to it.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the first, one may easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark that the Editions, where there are no Distinctions nor Lines, as the way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, are destitute of one thing which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not of Consequence in it self, but is very useful for the Understanding of what is read. This beginning of a new Line serves for an Admonition to the Reader, who in casting simply his Eyes on a Page, sees how many Arguments, or Subjects it is filled with, otherwise this want of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction in some degree confounds the Mind, and makes more attention requisite to understand what we readhaond that we do not search for Connections where there are none, or not to confound two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in one. But one ought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diminish as much as possible, the trouble of the Reader, who has too much already to understand the very things. The <hi>Lines</hi> in some respects perform the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as the Distinction of Chapters, which cannot be neglected, without Confusion. It is true, that the Ancients neglected often to divide their Books or Discourses into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain parts; but if we take notice, we shall find this negligence was because there was not sufficient Order in several of their writings. It was easier to pass from one Subject to another, by reason of some slight reference which was among them, or to throw confusedly a heap of Thoughts upon Paper, than to pass them into a certain Order: As it would be easier, to lay in one mass the Materials of an House, than to dispose them each in their proper Place. If any one has a mind to have examples of Books without Order, he may only cast his Eye upon <hi>Seneca</hi> or <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who both said very enthusiastically, whatsoever came into their Minds, without almost any idea of Order which they had a design to follow. If these Authors were Printed dividing their Arguments by a <hi>Line,</hi> their meaning could be much better understood.</p>
                  <p>The other fault, which those who have the care of the Editions of ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors commit very often, is, that they do not distinguish with divers Characters the Citations from the words of the Author; so that if great attention is not given to what is read, that which is attributed to one Author, may belong to another. This is what happned to Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> in his <hi>English Life</hi> of <hi>Clement Alexandrinus,</hi> which hath been very useful to us in the making this. <hi>Clement</hi> in the Passage which hath been related concerning the Philosophy he approved, if as <hi>Socrates,</hi> who in his <hi>Phoedon,</hi> applies to Philosophers this Proverb, which they made use of in their Mysteries, <hi>There are many who bear the Thyrse, but few who are truly filled with the Spirit of Bacchus. Socrates</hi> adds immediately after, <hi>These are I believe, only those who applied themselves as they ought to Philosophy, of the number of whom I have endeavoured to be as much as I could,</hi> &amp;c. As the whole Passage is in Roman Character, Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> thought that these words <hi>Of the number of whom,</hi> &amp;c. were <hi>Clement</hi>'s, whereas they are <hi>Socrates,</hi> as appears in <hi>Plato,</hi> and even at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Page, where <hi>Clement</hi> Cites them. If all this Passage had been in <hi>Italick,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> would not have been deceived in it; which ought in no wise to appear strange to those who know that to write the Life of an Author, collected out of divers places, Attention must be given to so many things all at a time, that it is very difficult to avoid confounding ones self.</p>
                  <p>Besides, in distinguishing the Subjects by <hi>a Line,</hi> and the Citations by different Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, more Facility is given to those who have read an Author in finding such places again, as they may have occasion for, which is not of little use.</p>
                  <p>As to this Edition, there are three Index<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, one of the Passages cited by St. <hi>Clement,</hi> the second of the Subjects, and the third of the Words and <hi>Greek</hi> Phrases, either wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Remark, or such as this Author ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth to a particular Sense. If these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexes were complete and correct, they
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:103507:203"/>
would be without doubt very useful; but they are neither. There is an infinite sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is besides, a fourth Index at the beginning of the Work, which contains a List of the Authors cited by <hi>Clement,</hi> but the Pages where he cites them being not marked, it is altogether useless. It were a thing to be desired for the Republick of Letters, not only that Kings were Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, or that Philosophers were Kings, but also that Booksellers were learned, or that the Learned Men were Booksellers, and that they brought back the Age of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuces</hi> and <hi>Stephens,</hi> for to give us good Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Writings of the Ancients, and to level the way for a Study, which of it self is hard enough, without making diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties by our own Negligence.</p>
                  <p>Chap. 1. Our Author begins the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the word Church, as used in the Primitive Times, which since it agrees so much with the present general Definition, we shall pass it over to remark what is more uncommon. Afterwards he comes to treat of its Members, which he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes into the Clergy and Laity, in which he considers these three Particulars,

                  <p>The Clergy he considers in these three Offices, Bishops, Priests and Deacons. He begins at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where the Holy Ghost descended upon the Apostles and Disciples, induing them with the Gift of Tongues, working Miracles, and fitting them to Preach the Gospel to all the World. He assigns St. <hi>Andrew</hi> to <hi>Scythia,</hi> St. <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew</hi> to <hi>India,</hi> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> to <hi>Parthia,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>Asia</hi> the less, telling us also that the rest of the Apostles had every one their Commission and Allotment, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Clemens Romanus.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. He treats of Presbyters, and gives this Definition, <hi>That a Presbyter is a Person in holy Orders, having thereby an inherent Right to perform the whole Office of a Bishop; but being possessed of no Place or Parish, nor actually discharging it without the Permission and Consent of the Bishop of a Place or Parish</hi>; which he says, was much like the Instance of our present Ministers and their Curates.</p>
                  <p>He considers this Subject under Two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That Presbyters were the Bishops Curates and Assistants, and so infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to them in the actual Exercise of their Ecclesiastical Commission.</item>
                        <item>2. That yet notwithstanding they had the same inherent Right with the Bishops, and so were not of a distinct Specifick Order from them.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Which is as much as to say, they were not Bishops <hi>in Gradu,</hi> but <hi>in Ordine</hi>—To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this, he shews out of the Fathers, too long to mention in an Abstract, that a Presbyter could not <hi>Baptize, not Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the Eucharist,</hi> not chuse his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Preach upon, not Absolve Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the Bishops consent first obtained; in short, he shews that they had a Right to do every thing that the Bishops had, when leave was given them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the Fifth Chap. he treats of Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Offices, first of Deacons, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he says there is so little contest about in our Disputes, he is the more brief on it. In short he gives us to understand, that they were inferiour to Presbyters, and stood and waited on the latter, who sat down on their <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Then he comes to treat of <hi>Subdeacons,</hi> whose number was enlarged according to the greatness of the Church, and who were subservient to Deacons, as Deacons were to Presbyters and Bishops.</p>
                  <p>Besides these, he proves, that there were yet a meaner sort of Ecclesiasticks, such as <hi>Acolyths, Exorcists,</hi> and <hi>Lictors,</hi> which were only Candidates for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</p>

Lib. Pag. 204. And in another place the same Father adds, <hi>It was most unreasonable, that Philosophy only should be condemned upon this Account, and yet the meanest Arts, even those of a Smith and Shipwright, which are as much Human, should be commended and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; that they did not rest here and go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but having got what was most useful and profitable for it, they ascended higher un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true Philosophy, making this Humane Philosophy guide unto a Preparatory for the true Philosophy,</hi> Ibid.

<q>In some Churches they fasted one day, in others two, in some more, and in others forty hours; but yet they still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Peace and Concord, the diversity of their commending the Unity of their Faith.

'Twould be well if this Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Union was well considered on, by such as keep up the Dissentions amongst us at this day; they will certainly have a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Account to make one day to the <hi>Prince of Peace</hi>; nor will their Ignorance excuse them, in not making a due distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Fundamentals of Religion and mere Circumstances.</p>
                  <p>Our Author proceeds to shew what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descentions there were amongst them from <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> who speaking of those Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Converts, who adhered to the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Rites, says, <hi>That if they did this only through their Weakness and Imbecillity, and did not perswade other Christians to the observance of the same Iudaical Customs, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into Church-fellowship and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> Dialog. cum Tryphon.

<q>That at the last day Christ shall judge those, who cause Schisms, who are inhuman, not having the fear of God, but preferring their own advantage before the Unity of the Church, who for trivial and slight Causes rend and divide the great and glorious Body of Christ, and as much as in them lies, destroy it; who speak Peace, but make War, truly straining at a Gnat, but swallowing a Camel. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 62. <hi>Pag.</hi> 292.</q>

After having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned this Father's Opinion, he adds, that whether <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> or an <hi>African</hi> Synod, or <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> deserves most Credit, he leaves it to the Learned to judge; but however our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, gives his own Opinion, that they might both have condescended a little near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

                  <head>The Second Part of the Enquiry into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, Discipline, Unity and Worship of the Primitive Church, that Flourish'd within the first Three Hundred Years after Christ.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IN the First Chap. of this Second Part, he begins with the manner of their Publick Worship in the Primitive Church; when the Congregation was assembled, the first Act of Divine Service was reading the Holy Scriptures, and sometimes the Epistles and Tracts of Eminent and Pious Men; he that read the Scriptures was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly destin'd for that Office, being the <hi>Lector,</hi> which as we said, above, was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative for an higher Office; how long they read, our Author could not determin, but he says it was a considerable part of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service.</p>
                  <p>Then follow'd singing Psalms; the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he says was not always the same; some times, as he Cites out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> they Sung an Hymn out of the Bible, or one of their own composing; one of their Hymns, as he tells us, being made on the Praise of our Saviour, began thus <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. Hail Light,</hi> they sung with their Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces altogether, some times alternately, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen. de Orat.</hi> § 6. <hi>Pag.</hi> 7. <hi>Ep. ad Trajan.</hi> 'Twas in <hi>Rhime, Metre,</hi> and <hi>Consort.</hi> He mentions particularly the 133. <hi>Psalm, Oh how good and pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in Unity, &amp;c.</hi> After singing of <hi>Psalms,</hi> Preaching succeeded. <hi>Scripturae leguntur Psalmi Canuntur, ad Locutiones proferuntur,</hi> Tertull. de Anima, c. 3. p. 530. <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are read, Psalms sung, and Sermons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Subject of the Sermon was usually a Commentary or Explanation of the Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which were just before read, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Iustin Martyr, Ap.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 98.
<q>The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop made a Sermon by way of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Exhortation, to the Imitation of those excellent things which had been read; They usually preach'd about an Hour, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen Hom. de Engast. p.</hi> 29.</q>
The manner of their Sermons was thus; they began with a short Exordium, and then explained Verse after Verse, or Sentence after Sentence, shewing the natural and literal Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Words, and then the Spiritualiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or Mystical meaning of them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:103507:205"/>
with a suitable Application of all, regarding the Quality of their Hearers, and suiting themselves to their Capacity; he gives some Instances of the Laity, who by the Permission of their Bishops, were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to Preach some times, but never but upon sufferance; and they were only such as were <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The manner of their Praying was with their Faces towards the East, for these Reasons, which by the way, might give light why we make the Communion-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the East-end of our Churches. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Title of East is given to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the Old Testament, the Word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which signifies an arising or sprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, in the Greek 'tis rendred <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which signifies arising out, and by a Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymy is appropriated to the East. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it symbolized a Spiritual arising out of the Darkness of Sin and Corruption; Here our Author mentions <hi>Alexandrinus, Stromat. Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 520.
<q>Let Prayers be made towards the East, because the East is the Representation of our Spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: As from thence Light first arose, shining out of Darkness; so according to that Rising of the Sun, the day of true Knowledge arose on those, who lay bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Ignorance; whence the ancient Temples looked towards the West, that so they who stood against the Images therein, might be forced to look towards the East.</q>
3. The next Reason our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gives, is out of <hi>Origen,</hi> viz. to denote our Diligence in the Service of God, in being more forward to arise and set about it, than the Sun is to run his daily course. 4. Another Reason was the Opinion of the Excellency of this Quarter above others. — The Posture of Prayer, <hi>Clem. Alex. Strom. Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 519. was thus, <hi>We lift up our Head, and stretch out our Hands towards Heaven</hi>: There was a little Preface to their Prayer, as <hi>Let us pray,</hi> or <hi>Lift up your Hearts,</hi> and the People answer'd, <hi>We lift them up unto the Lord.</hi> Some times our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor says they used the Lord's Prayer, and some times not; St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> us'd it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly: I can't pass over notwithstanding the smalness I design'd in this Abstract, what this holy Father has said upon the <hi>Lord's Prayer. De Orat. Dom.</hi> § 1, 2. <hi>Pag.</hi> 309.
<q>Christ hath given us a Form of Prayer, he hath admonished and instructed us what we should pray for: He that made us live, hath taught us to pray, that whilst we offer unto the Father the Prayer which the Son taught, we may be the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily heard: — For what Prayer can be more Spiritual, than that which was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us by Christ, who gave us also the Holy Spirit? And what Prayer can be more prevalent with God, than that of his Son, who is the Truth proceeding out of his Mouth? so that to pray other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than he hath taught, is both Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Impiety. Let us pray there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, dearly beloved Brethren, as God our Master hath taught us: It is a friendly and familiar Prayer to ask God with his own, and to present the Prayer of Christ to his Ears; the Father will acknowledge his Sons Words. When we pray, let him that dwells in the Heart, be in the Voice; and since we have him an Advocate with the Father for our Sins, when we beg Pardon for our Sins, let us use the Words of our Advocate; and since he says, that whatsoever we shall ask of the Father in his Name, he will give it us; how much more efficaciously shall we prevail for what we beg in Christ's Name, if we ask it in his Prayer?</q>
For the manner of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, our Author says, he finds not such a thing as set Forms, or Liturgies, that were impos'd upon the People, nor (to use his own words) that having no imposed Form, they unpremeditately, immethodically, or confusedly vented their Petitions or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Chap. Third, our Author treats of Baptism, which was done by the Bishop, or whom he should order in cases of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity even to Laymen, but never to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: The Subjects of Baptism were of two sorts, either Infants or Adult Persons; to shew Infants were Baptized, he also proves that the Communion was never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven till after Baptism; and then he brings Instances of Children that received the Communion. <hi>Iustin Martyr, p.</hi> 97. To which he adds the Testimonies of <hi>Irenaeus, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 39. <hi>p.</hi> 137. and of St. <hi>Cyprian de Lapsis,</hi> § 7. <hi>p.</hi> 279. which he waves, because he would be fuller in Translating an <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Synod held <hi>Anno</hi> 254, which consisted of Sixty six Bishops; the occasion of which Determination was this: A certain Bishop call'd <hi>Fidus,</hi> had some Scruples, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of Baptizing of Infants, upon which the aforesaid Bishops determined the Case in the following Decree, <hi>Apud Cyprian. Epist.</hi> 59. § 2, 3, 4. <hi>p.</hi> 164, 165. <hi>As for the matter of Infants, whom you said, were not to be Baptised within the Second or Third Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Nativity, or according to the Law of Circumcision within the eighth Day thereof; it hath appeared to us in our Council quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; no one maintained your Opinion, but we all judged, that the Mercy and Grace of God was to be denied to no Man; for since the Lord said in the Gospel, The Son of Man came not to destroy, but to save the Souls of Men; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as much as lies in our Power, no Soul is to be lost; for what is there defective in him, who has been once formed in the Womb by the hands of God? To us indeed it seems, that Children encrease, as they advance in years; but yet whatever things are made by God, are perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Work and Majesty of God their Maker. Besides, the Holy Scriptures declare, that both Infants and Adult Persons have the same Equality in the Divine Workmanship:
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:103507:206"/>
When</hi> Elisha <hi>prayed over the Dead Child of the</hi> Sunamitisn <hi>Widow, he lay upon the Child, and put his Head upon his Head, and his Face upon his Face, and his Body upon his Body, and his Feet upon his Feet. This may be thought improbable, how the small Members of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant should equal the big ones of a grown Man; but herein is expressed the Divine and Spiritual Equality, that al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Men are equal, and alike, when they are made by God; that though the encrease of our Bodies may cause an inequality with respect to Men, yet not with respect to God; unless that that Grace, which is given to baptized Persons, be more or less according to the Age of the Receivers; but the Holy Ghost is given equally to all, not according to measure, but according to God's Mercy and Indulgence; for as God is no respecter of Persons, so neither of years; he equally offers to all the obtaining of his heavenly Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And whereas you say, that an Infant for the first Days after his Birth is unclean, so that every one is afraid to kiss him, this can be no Impediment to his Obtainment of heavenly Grace; for it is written, to the Pure all things are pure; and none of us should dread that which God hath made; for although an Infant be newly born, yet he is not so, as that we should dread to kiss him; since in the kissing of an Infant, we ought to think upon the fresh Works of God, which in a manner we</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">This they speak with reference to their Custom of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting one another at the Conclusion of their publick Assemblies.</note> 
                     <hi>kiss in an Infant newly formed and born, when we embrace that which God hath made. And whereas the carnal Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Circumcision was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on the Eighth Day, that was a Type and Shadow of some future good thing, which Christ the Truth being now come, is done away; because the Eighth Day, or the First day after the Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was to be the Day on which our Lord should rise and quicken us, and give us the Spiritual Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision: therefore was the Carnal Circumcision on the Eighth Day, which Type is now abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Christ the Truth being come, and having given us the Spiritual Circumcision. Wherefore it is our Iudgment, that no one ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from God's Grace by that Law, or that the Spiritual Circumcision should be hindred by the Carnal one: but all Men ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Grace of Christ, as</hi> Peter <hi>saith in the Acts of the Apostles, that the Lord said unto him that he should call no Man common or unclean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if any thing can hinder Men from Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, it will be heinous Sins that will debar the Adult and Mature there from; and if those who have sinned extremely against God, yet if afterwards they believe, are Baptized, and no Man is prohibited from this Grace, how much more ought not an Infant to be prohibited, who being but just born, is guilty of no Sin, but of Original which he contracted from</hi> Adam? <hi>Who ought the more readily to be received to the Remission of Sins, because not his own, but other Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> are remitted to him. Wherefore dearly beloved, it is our Opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that from Baptism, and the Grace of God, who is merciful, kind and benign to all, none ought to be prohibited by us, which as it is to be observed and followed with respect to all, so especially with respect to Infants, and those that are but just born, who deserve our help, and the Divine Mercy, because at the first instant of their Nativity, they beg it by their Cries and Tears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is as formal a Synodical Decree for the Baptism of Infants as can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, which being the Judgment of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod is more Authentick than the Opinion of a private Father; the Question put was not Whether an Infant should be Baptized, but When; which plainly supposes Infant Baptism in general Use, seeing so great a number of Bishops were concern'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the time of Baptizing them.</p>
                  <p>He passes on to the Baptism of Adult Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, such as came over from the Heathens; they were instructed or Catechis'd, and from thence call'd <hi>Catechumens,</hi> of which we have spoken above; the manner of their Baptizing was this, there were certain Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions propos'd to them, which consisted of Abjuration of the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, and an Assent to all the Articles of the Christian Faith,</p>
                  <p>Here our Author takes occasion to treat of the Creed call'd the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which he says was not made by the Apostles, nor was it made all at once, for some Articles were made and added in Opposition to the Heresies which sprung in the Church: Thus, <hi>I believe in God,</hi> says the Greek, <hi>I believe in one God,</hi> in Opposition to the Polytheism of the Heathens; nay, for above Four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years after our Saviour, it was not all made up, for then there were two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles wanting, <hi>viz.</hi> He <hi>descended into Hell,</hi> and the <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi> The Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Author has made of the Primitive Creeds is too curious to be past over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a general Transcription, as he had them from their Original Language, they are as follow.</p>

                  <p n="4">IV. In the Fourth Chap. he continues the Subject of Baptism, and says he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determin whether Sponsers or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were in use from the Apostles days; —but he not consider'd that this Practice, was amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> both in and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostles days: But before Baptism was <hi>Exorcization,</hi> which was thus, The Minister put his Hands on the Persons Head that was to be Baptized, and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Face, implying thereby the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcization</hi> or expelling of the Devil or evil Spirit from him, and a preparing of him for Baptism and Confirmation, when and where the good and holy Spirit was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and given, <hi>Theodot. Epitom. Pag.</hi> 573. <hi>Apud Cyprian. Pag.</hi> 445. But our Author shews, that the Continuation of this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom was grounded upon a Mistake of our Saviour's valedictory Speech, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17. for it was only to the first Preachers that the extraordinary gift of working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was limited: When <hi>Exorcization</hi> was finish'd, Water was consecrated, and the Person <hi>dipped</hi> over Head and Ears, and sometimes sprinkled or washed, as in the Case of <hi>Clinicks,</hi> or those that were sick in Bed, <hi>Ep.

                  <p>
                     <hi>That as far as he could conceive, he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended that the Divine Benefits could in no wise be mutilated, or weakned, nor that less thereof could be bestowed, where the Divine Gifts are received with a sound and full Faith, both of Giver and Receiver: For in Baptism the Spots of Sin are otherwise washed away, than the filth of the Body in a Secular and Carnal Bath is, in which there is need of a Seat to sit upon, of a Vat to wash in, of Sope, and other such like Implements, that so the Body may be wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cleansed; but in another manner is the Heart of a Believer washed, otherwise is the Mind of a Man purified by the Merits of Christ. In the Sacraments of Salvation through the Indulgence of God in Cases of Necessity, the Divine Abridgments convey the whole to those that believe; Nor let any one think it strange, that the Sick, when they are Baptized, are only perfused or sprinkled, since the Scripture says, by the Prophet</hi> Ezechiel, Chap. 36. v. 25, 26. <hi>I will sprinkle clean Water upon you, and ye shall be clean from all your Filthinesses, and from all your Idols will I cleanse you; a new Heart also will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you. Also it is said in</hi> Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, chap. 19.19, 20. <hi>And the Man which shall be unclean to the Evening, he shall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the third day, and the seventh day, and he shall be clean; but if he shall not be purified the third day, and the seventh day, he shall not be clean, and that Soul shall be cut off from</hi> Israel, <hi>because the Water of Aspersion hath not been sprinkled on him. And again the Lord spake unto</hi> Moses, Numb. 8. v. 6.7. <hi>Take the Levites from among the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>and cleanse them; and thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse them, sprinkle Water of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying upon them. And again, the Water of Aspersion is Purification: From whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that sprinkling is sufficient instead of Immersion; and whensoever it is done, if there be a sound Faith of Giver and Receiver it is perfect and complete.</hi>

                  <p n="5">V. The Fifth Chap. treats of <hi>Unction, Signation,</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi>; he brings his Authorities from them, who mention them as succeeding Baptism, but the manner how is not exprest; only about the last he gives us an uncommon Remark, to wit, that Absolution and Confirmation were the same; and that when they absolved Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, the Bishop put his Hands upon their Heads, and that this Confirmation was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeated.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. In the Sixth Chap. our Author treats of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> in which he considers three things; 1. The Time; 2. The Person; 3. The manner thereof:
<list>
                        <item>1. For the time he proves it to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly at Supper, some times Morning and Evening; and in times of Persecution, according as they had Opportunity.</item>
                        <item>2. The Persons that communicated were such as were initiated into the Church by Baptism; but Penitents, that were yet under Penance, and the <hi>Chatechumens,</hi> were not admitted.</item>
                        <item>3. The manner of Celebrating the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist.— In some places the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants made their Offerings first, as in <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> presenting according to their Ability, Bread, Wine, the first Fruits of their Encrease, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were employ'd to the use of the Poor.—<hi>Iustin Martyr Apol.</hi> 2. <hi>Pag.</hi> 97. says, <hi>Bread and Wine are offered to the Minister, who receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, gives Praise and Glory to the Lord of all through the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and in a large-manner renders particular Thanks for he present Mercies, who when he hath end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

his Prayers and Praise, all the People say</hi> Amen. And <hi>when the Minister hath thus given Thanks, and the People said</hi> Amen, <hi>the Deacons distributed the Elements.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Our Author tells us, that the Prayer consisted of two Parts, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving</hi>; in the former they prayed for the Peace of the Church, the Quiet of the World, the Health of their Emperors, and in a word, for all Men. In the latter they gave God Thanks for sending Christ, and for the Institution of that comfortable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, desiring his Blessing on, and the Consecration of the Elements then before them: After some Prayer, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster consecrated both the Elements toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, blessed and distributed them amongst the rest to Children, as above. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of Receiving at <hi>Alexandria</hi> was <hi>Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> in other Places <hi>Kneeling,</hi> especially at <hi>Whitsontide</hi>: After Distribution was over, they Sung an Hymn or a Psalm to the Praise and Glory of God, and then they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a Prayer of Thanksgiving; and made a Collection for the Poor.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. He treats of the Circumstances of publick Worship, as, Time, Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He says the Primitive Christians had their Churches and appointed Places, except in times of Persecution when they took the best Opportunities they could: Their Churches were erected high, and in open Places, made very light and shining, in Imitation of the Holy Ghost's descending in Fire; they built them towards the East, as we said above.—They imagin'd no San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity or Holiness tied to them, or that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service was more acceptable there than elsewhere, but for Convenience, <hi>Clem.

                  <p n="8">VIII. The Eighth Chap. treats of the Primitive <hi>Fasts,</hi> which were of two sorts, <hi>occasional</hi> and <hi>fixt,</hi> the first not determin'd by any constant fixed Period of time, but observed on extraordinary and unusual Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, according as the variety and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Circumstances did require, as as in case of eminent Dangers in Church or State, particularly against Persecutions; thus <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome, Ep.</hi> 57. § 3. <hi>Pag.</hi> 159. was writ to by St. <hi>Cyprian, That since God was pleased in his Providence to warn them of an approaching Fight and Tryal, they ought with their whole Flocks diligently to fast and watch, and pray, to give themselves to continual Groans and frequent Prayers; for those are our Spiritual Arms, that make us firmly to stand and persevere.</hi> The fixt Fasts our Author tells us, were <hi>Fridays</hi> and <hi>Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,</hi> some times till Three of the Clock, sometimes till Night. Besides these, they had an Annual fixt Fast, <hi>viz. Lent,</hi> the reason of it (says our Author) was from these words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.15. <hi>The days will come when the Bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they Fast.</hi> They imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this to be an Injunction of Christ to all his Followers, as appear'd by some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he quoted out of the Fathers.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. In the Ninth Chap. we have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Primitive Feasts, the first we meet with is <hi>Easter,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Tertullian</hi>; upon which we find there were some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the Churches, as to the precise time of keeping it: The next was <hi>Whitsun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide or Pentecost,</hi> spoke of by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Origen.</hi> The next was <hi>Christmas,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi>; here the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor takes notice that the Ancients disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree'd about the time of our Saviour's Birth-day; some were for the Twenty fifth of <hi>December,</hi> some the Twenty sixth of <hi>December,</hi> some the Twentieth of <hi>April,</hi> some the Seventeenth of <hi>April,</hi> and some the Sixteenth of <hi>May.</hi>—There was yet another Feast amongst them, called by us, <hi>Epiphany,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>; The Author observes they kept no other Saints days, nor did they call <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="10">X. In the Tenth and last Chapter, our Author comes to consider the Ceremonies of the Primitive Church; for instance, when they Baptized in some Churches, the new Member had <hi>Milk and Hony given to him</hi>; and in some Places, before they prayed, they washed their Hands, they had Exorcism before Baptism, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction after, and innumerable more such Ceremonies, which crept in partly by a Misunderstanding some Texts, and partly by being amongst the Superstitious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: Yet the Churches retain'd their own Liberty and Customs, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing or being impos'd upon, by one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. I shall give only one of those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Instances that our Author has brought for his Purpose; 'tis out of a Fragment of an Epistle written by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and other Bishops of <hi>France,</hi> wherein <hi>they affirm, that</hi> Victor <hi>was in the right with respect to the time of</hi> Easter, <hi>that it ought to be celebrated, as he said, on the</hi> Lords Day, <hi>but that yet he had done very ill to cut off from the Unity of the Church those that observed it otherwise; that it had never been known, that any Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were Excommunicated for a disagreement in Rites, an Instance of which there was not only in the time of</hi> Easter <hi>its self, but in the Fast that preceded it: Some fasted one day, others more; some forty hours, which variety of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations began not first in our Age, but long before us in the times of our Ancestors, who yet
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:103507:208"/>
preserved Peace and Unity amongst themselves, as we now do; for the Diversity of Fasts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Unity of Faith: And as for this Controversie concerning the time of</hi> Easter, <hi>the Bishops which governed the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>before</hi> Soter, <hi>viz.</hi> Anicetus, Pius, Higynus, Telesphorus, <hi>and</hi> Xystus, <hi>they never cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated it the same time with the</hi> Asiaticks, <hi>neither would they permit any of their People so to do; but yet they were kind and peaceable to those who came to them from those Parishes, where they did otherwise observe it, and never any for this Cause were thrown out of the Church; even their Predecessors, though they did not keep it, yet they sent the Eucharist to those that did keep it; and when in the times of</hi> Anicetus, <hi>blessed</hi> Polycarp <hi>came to</hi> Rome, <hi>and there were some Controversies between them, they did not separate from one another, but still maintained Peace and Love: And though</hi> Anicetus <hi>could never perswade</hi> Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp, <hi>nor</hi> Polycarp Anicetus <hi>to be of each others mind, yet they Communicated one with another; and</hi> Anicetus <hi>in Honour to</hi> Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus, <hi>permitted him to Consecrate the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in his Church, and so they departed in mutual Love and Kindness; and all the Churches, whether observing, or not observing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>After all, our Author concludes with a most passionate Exhortation to Love and Peace amongst our selves, protesting, that in this Treatise he has not been byass'd by any Party or Faction whatever, but has endeavour'd a plain, full, and impartial discovery of Truth, leaving every one to their Liberty, as to the Judgment they shall make of it: He says he has left out many Ancient things, and handled mostly those Points that are now in dispute amongst us. He has taken a great deal of pains in citing his Authorities all along; In short, he has out-done all that ever have Wrote in this kind before him, and yet with a Spirit of so much Modesty and Humility, that every Party may see their Errors, without having any cause to be angry withe their Exposer. He has given a Table of the Fathers Names, which he has made use of, as also their Ages and Countries, that we may thereby be able to ghess at the Original of some Customs amongst them, and the Places where they were chiefly practised.</p>

The Ancients all agree that St. <hi>Clement</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but they do not agree upon the time he was so, nor upon the Order which ought to be given him in the List of the first Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of this City: <hi>Baronius</hi> himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that he was not well assured of the order of the Succession of these Bishops, until the Year CLXXIX, <hi>Vandelin</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in this Dissertation to resolve the Difficulties, by the means of the old Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viaries and Martyrologies; after which, he speaks of the time in which the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of St. <hi>Clement</hi> were written. As his Dissertation is extremely short, the Reader is desired to consult it. We shall only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that according to this Author, St. <hi>Peter</hi> being upon the point of parting from <hi>Rome,</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> in the Year of our Lord LV, he established <hi>Linus</hi> to govern the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in his absence, whither being returned in LXVI, he found it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Pastor, <hi>Linus</hi> being dead during his absence. A little time after, being cast into Prison, he established <hi>Clement</hi> in the place of <hi>Linus,</hi> towards the time of the Pass-over, in LXVII, a few Months before his Death. St. <hi>Clement</hi> held the See nine Years and eleven or twelve Days, after which, great Contestations arose in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which obliged St. <hi>Clement</hi> to quit the Episcopacy. It would not be permitted, if we believe <hi>Vandelin,</hi> that St. <hi>Clement</hi> should succeed in the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> by virtue of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Testament, fearing lest this Example might render the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:103507:208"/>
Hereditary; and St. <hi>Clement</hi> having declared, <hi>That if it was upon his account that these Contestations happened, he was ready to retire in what place of the World they would have him</hi>; he was taken at his word, and <hi>Cletus</hi> was chosen in his place, to whom <hi>Anacletus, Evaristus, Alexander, Telesphorus, &amp;c.</hi> succeeded in the order we have nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vendelin</hi> believes, that the first Epistle of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> as it is commonly called, was written by this Holy Man, not in his own particular name, but in that of the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> in XCV, after the death of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletus,</hi> and during the Vacancy of the See; though according to him, <hi>Evaristus</hi> had been nominated to succeed <hi>Anacletus</hi>; so that this Letter was written during the most violent Persecutions of <hi>Domitian</hi>: But <hi>Vendelin</hi> pretends, that which is called the Second, was written in a time wherein the Christian Church enjoyed an entire Peace, in LXXV; after which account the second would have been written twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years before the first: He grounds what he says chiefly upon a Letter of <hi>Denys</hi> Bishop of <hi>Corinth</hi> to Pope <hi>Soterus,</hi> written about the Year CLXVII, where <hi>Denys</hi> speaks thus to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi>

                     <hi>We have celebrated</hi> Sunday <hi>this day, in which we have read your Letter, which we always read for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, as well as the former, that</hi> Clement <hi>writ to us.</hi> He believes the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be that which is called the second of St. <hi>Clements,</hi> and that the other is the first, which <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> calleth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Remark of Mr. <hi>Colomies, the Epistle of the</hi> Romans <hi>to the</hi> Corinthians.</p>
                  <p>After the Dissertation of <hi>Vendelin,</hi> are the two Epistles of St. <hi>Clement</hi> in Greek and Latin; the first of the Version of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and the second translated by <hi>Vendelin.</hi> Mr. <hi>Colomies</hi> hath joined to it little Notes, where 1. he corrects some places of the Text, which <hi>Iunius</hi> had ill transcribed from the Original. For Example, from the first Page there is according to the Edition of <hi>Iunius</hi>; That <hi>Grace and Peace which come from God-Allmighty, through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, be abundantly poured upon you (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c. upon every particular Person amongst you, and upon one towards another. We have thought, most dear Brethren, a little later then we should have done upon what you have demanded of us, by reason of the evils and accidents which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, &amp;c. but according to the MS. of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>the Phrase is much more clear, since there it is, That Grace and Peace, &amp;c. be given to you abundantly, by reason of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreseen Evils and Accidents, which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to us one after another, we have thought, &amp;c.</hi>

                     </gap>. Mr. <hi>Colomies</hi> Remarks also in a place or two, wherein the Original was not observed; but these Passages are not of the same Importance with that which we have cited. 2. Some Conjectures are in these Notes, and varieties of Reading, taken from <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who has several times cited St. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which places are all marked here, as well as the rest of the Ancients, who have ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the latter <hi>Clement.</hi> 3. Mr. <hi>Colomies</hi> in some places corrects the Latin Version. 4. He Expounds divers words of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. 5. Upon the occasion of St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> he makes some critical Observations about Ecclesiastical History: Thus also upon what St. <hi>Clement</hi> saith § 21. of the death of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he affirms that the time of their death is not certain. A Council held at <hi>Rome</hi> under Pope <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> says, that the Hereticks pretend that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> received the Crown of Martyrdom, in divers times; nevertheless it was the Opinion of <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> and St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who said St. <hi>Paul</hi> died five Years after St. <hi>Peter. Philastrius</hi> also rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned amongst Hereticks those who give the names of the Seven Planets to the days of the Week, though St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin Martyr</hi> followed the received Custom therein.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Clement,</hi> in Chapter 28th. cites a Passage of the <hi>Psalms</hi> under the name of <gap reason="foreign">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p n="2">2. There have been in <hi>England</hi> several Learned Men who having consumed all their Life in the study of Antiquity, seem to have studied only for their particular Satisfaction, without caring to impart to the publick their admirable knowledge therein; Such was <hi>Richard Thomson, Gerard Langbaine,</hi> and <hi>Matthew Bustus,</hi> whose few Writings which remain amongst us serve for almost nothing but to discover to us what these great Men might have done had they been willing. Mr. <hi>Colomies</hi> adds <hi>Thomas Bruno,</hi> Chanon of <hi>Windsor,</hi> who left several Collections with his Friend Mr. <hi>Vossius,</hi> but of which there is scarcely any thing that is fit for the Press. The Disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which we have of it here, <hi>De The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapeutis Philonis adversus Henr.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Works of <hi>Philo,</hi> is found a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of <hi>a Contemplative Life,</hi> where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the <hi>Esseans</hi> manner of living, who dwelt near <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and solely applied themselves to Contemplation.

                     <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> for saying so; and many times that these <hi>Therapeutes,</hi> as <hi>Philo</hi> calls them, never were Christians, but only <hi>Essean</hi> Jews. Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais</hi> in his Annotations upon <hi>Eusebius,</hi> holds with <hi>Scaliger,</hi> that the <hi>Therapeutes</hi> did not embrace Christianity, and also brings some new Reasons to prove it; but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that they were <hi>Esseans.</hi> He will have them to be a sort of Jewish Philosophers, who all applied themselves to Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reading of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and to Prayer. He brings several Reasons thereof, which may be seen in the Original. Mr. <hi>Bruno</hi> undertakes in this Dissertation to refute <hi>Scaliger</hi> and Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois.</hi> He maintains that the <hi>Contemplative Esseans,</hi> who were near <hi>Alexandria</hi> were converted by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> contrary to these two Learned Men, and endeavors to shew that Mr. <hi>de Valois</hi> in particular was mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken when he said that the Contemplatives were no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>As to this last Opinion we shall make no stay at it, because it is particular to Mr. <hi>Valois,</hi> and the Refutation can be read in Mr. <hi>Bruno,</hi> in half a quarter of an hour. He is of the Opinion, that the <hi>Therapeutes</hi> of <hi>Philo</hi> were converted to Christianity. 1. Because we find in the <hi>Lausiack History</hi> of <hi>Palladius,</hi> a Description of a Place, wherein the ancient Christian Monks of <hi>Alexandria</hi> kept themselves, exactly like that which <hi>Philo</hi> gives of the Habitation of the <hi>Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peutes,</hi> and that there is no appearance, that 200 Years after the time of <hi>Philo</hi> the Christian Monks could have driven the Jews from this Place, seeing in that time the <hi>Iews</hi> were more powerful than they were in <hi>Egypt.</hi> There is much more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood that St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and some other Solitaries of <hi>Thebes</hi> joined themselves to the Christians, who before lived very austerely, and introduced thereby the Rules for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastical Life, a little time before <hi>Palladius</hi> lived. 2. It being very certain, that in the time of <hi>Iosephus</hi> there were three Sects amongst the <hi>Iews, Pharisees, Sadducees,</hi> and <hi>Esseans,</hi> and that these Sects were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately lost; it's very strange that from that time there should be no mention of the <hi>Esseans.</hi> But the Wonder will cease, according to Mr. <hi>Bruno,</hi> if it be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that these <hi>Esseans</hi> embraced Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. <hi>Scaliger</hi> following the Opinion of this Author, proved that the <hi>Esseans,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining <hi>Esseans,</hi> viz. <hi>Iews,</hi> could not be Christians; but hath not proved that they were not become so by abandoning Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism. He speaks more largely in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of Mr. <hi>de Valois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Learned Man said particularly, that <hi>Philo</hi> observed, that the <hi>Therapeutes</hi> had Writings from some ancient Authors of their Sect, who interpreted the Law after an Allegorical manner, which did not agree with Christians, who then had no Ancient Author of their Sect. Mr. <hi>Bruno</hi> answers to that, that they might have been some old Jewish Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who since the time of the <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi> had expounded the Law allegorically, and had thus rendred the <hi>Iews</hi> more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to receive the Gospel, than if they were kept only to the Letter of the Law. Such were <hi>Eleazar</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> whereof <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaks in his <hi>Evangelical Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Book 8. c. 9. It may be that St. <hi>Mark</hi> sent the <hi>Essean</hi> Converts to these Books, to convince themselves of the Truth of the Gospel, by seeing the Law was expounded therein after a manner conformable to what he told them. Mr. <hi>Bruno</hi> believes even that it was these Books that Jesus Christ had respect two, when he said to the <hi>Iews, Search the Scriptures, they are they which speak of me:</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iean. V.</hi> 39.</note> Because to take Prophecies according to to the Letter of the Word, it would not be easie to form a clear Idea of the Messia. It was necessary that the Christians should be satisfied at that time, with the Books of the ancient <hi>Iews,</hi> seeing that under the Emperor <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> the Books of the New Testament were not as yet published. We shall say no more concerning the Dissertation of Mr. <hi>Bruno</hi>; it is so short, that those who have a mind to examin his Opinion, may read it in less than an hour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>Colomie</hi> added to the end of this Volume a Collection of Fifty five Letters of divers Learned Men, both of the past and present Age; there are several which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were Printed, and it is certain, that those which have already appeared, either are more correct in this Edition, or such as were become so scarce, that it was not easie to meet with them. There is no Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion treated on in these Letters; but some Events of the Times are spoken of in which they were written, or some Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance about the Life of these great Men, or other Places, which will divert those who love to be instructed in the least things, which concern Manners, or the Genius of those whom their Knowledge, or their Employments have rendred Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious. There is, for Example, a small Address of Father <hi>du Moulin</hi> in the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Letter to <hi>Lancelot Andrews,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winton.</hi> Father <hi>du Moulin</hi> writing to this Bishop, calls Episcopacy a thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived since the Age which followed that of the Apostles, <hi>Rem. à saeculo Apostolis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximo receptam</hi>; but as the Bishop reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with it, he immediately writ, <hi>à saeculo Apostolorum,</hi> from the Age of the Apostles. After that he blotted out the word <hi>Apostolorum,</hi> and substituted those of <hi>Apostolis proximo</hi>; yet so, that what he writ at first might be read. The Bishop su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects him to have made this Correction in favour of those who inclin'd to the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>; and of having but half blotted the word, which he at first writ, to make People suspect that he was
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:103507:209"/>
not a zealous Presbyterian, seeing this word slipt from him before he was aware: For the Letter otherwise is so short, that it was easie to transcribe it, which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly had done to a Person of the quality of Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> if he had not the design we observed.</p>
                  <p>All these Letters are short, and there are a great number which were written by <hi>English men</hi>: Amongst others, the XLII Letter which is directed to Mr. <hi>Anthony de Dominis.</hi> It's <hi>Ioseph Hall</hi> who writes to him, and testifies that he is very much scandalized through the Reports which ran then concerning this Arch-Bishop, and which were found to be true afterwards. It is that he would not quit <hi>England,</hi> but to return into the Bosom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. This Letter is very fine, and worthy to be read, although it had then no effect. Some others will be found, which are not less curious, as the LI, tho it treats ill enough of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> under the name of <hi>Traducianus.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>He begins with <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> whom his Ecclesiastick History hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred so celebrated, of whom he gives a very dissinterested Judgment, <hi>Pag.</hi> 19.
<q>Although he found no difficulty in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to acknowledge the Son of God was from all Eternity, and that he absolutely rejected the Impiety of <hi>Arius,</hi> who said that he was Created out of nothing, and that there was a time when he was not; yet he always found it hard to believe the Term <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantial,</hi> that is, to confess that the Son is of the same Substance with the Father; and after he had received it, he gave such a Sense of it, as establish'd not the Equality of the Son with the Father, since he speaks thus in a Letter that he writ to his Church, to give it an account of his Conduct: <hi>When we say that the Son is Consubstantial with the Father, we Mean only that the Son hath no resemblance with the Creatures, which were made by him, and that he is perfectly one with the Father by whom he was begotten, not of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Hypostasis or Substance.</hi>—When we would justifie <hi>Eusebius</hi> in respect to the Divinity of the Son; it is more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to defend what he says of the Holy Ghost; For he affirms not only in his Books of the Preparation and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Demonstration, but also in his third Book of Ecclesiastick Divinity, that he is not the true God: <hi>The holy Spirit is not God, nor the Son of God, because he has not taken his Original from the Father as the Son has, being in the number of such things, as are made by the Son.</hi> This shews, says Mr. <hi>du Pin,</hi> that <hi>Socrates, Sozomenes,</hi> and and some Modern Authors, have been mistaken in excusing him entirely; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other side 'tis a very great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice to call him an <hi>Arian,</hi> and even the head of them, as St. <hi>Ierom</hi> does. His Judgment upon other points of Religion appears very Orthodox to the Author; and in respect to his Person, he says he was very much dissinterested, very sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, loved Peace, Truth and Religion; He authoris'd no new Form of Faith, he no way endeavour'd to injure <hi>Athanasius,</hi> nor to ruin those of his Party. He wisht only to be able to accommodate and unite both Parties.—I doubt not, adds Mr. <hi>du Pin,</hi> that so many good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities was the Cause of placing him in the number of the Saints, in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrologies of <hi>Usard</hi> of <hi>Adon,</hi> and in some ancient Offices of the <hi>French</hi> Churches. It is true, he continued not long in the peaceable Possession of this quality of Saint: But it would be, in my opinion, a very great boldness, to judge him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely unworthy of it.</q>

But he did well in not pushing things to that Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity as his Predecessors have carried them to.

Country, their to live in rest, and reserv'd to God the Vengeance of their Crimes. This alteration of his Conduct, sufficiently shews, that this Prince on these occasions acted not according to his own Reason, but according to the different Motions that inspired the Court Bishops, who made him the Instrument to execute their Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He was not of himself inclin'd to persecute Men for Opinions in Religion; for the 27th of <hi>September,</hi> the CCCXXX Year, he granted the Patriarchs of the <hi>Iews</hi> an Exemption from publick Charges.</p>
                  <p>In the Month of <hi>May, Anno Dom.</hi> CCCXXVI, he made an Edict to forbid the admitting into the Clergy Rich Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or such as were Children to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State. The occasion of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict was, because many Persons entred themselves amongst the Clergy to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from publick Charge; which was a great Oppression to the Poor. And <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> thought it very reasonable that the Rich should support the burthensom Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Age, and that the Poor should be supported by the Riches of the Church.</p>

                  <p>As the Life of St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> is one of the most remarkable of the Fourth Age, for the variety both of his good and bad Fortune; so Mr. <hi>du Pin</hi> relates it more at large. It's plain, that from the time of this Father, Persons were very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to the Exterior parts of Religion, since two of the greatest Crimes which the <hi>Arians</hi> accused St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> of, were breaking of a Chalice, and Celebrating the Mysteries in a Church that was not Consecrated. <note n="*" place="margin">

He approved not of the Disputes at that time upon the Subject of the <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> because he look'd upon those that received Three into the Trinity, and those that admitted but of one, to be of the same Opinion, and only to differ in the manner of Expressing.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Basil</hi> was not so moderate, for accod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Opinion, those were <hi>Sabellians</hi> that said the Father and Son were two in Thought, and one in Substance.

Wherefore (continues <hi>du Pin</hi>) we have almost no Books of the Ancient Hereticks remaining.</p>
                  <p>Many Men believe, that the Disputes with the Heterodox have been the Cause of the Catholicks inventing Solutions, which have afterwards pass'd into Opinions; such is the Doctrin of the Infallibility of the Church, which was not regarded till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Luther</hi>'s time.

                     <hi>It's surprising, that</hi> Titus <hi>of</hi> Bostres, <hi>whose Arguments are solid and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, had not recourse in his Treatise against the</hi> Manicheans <hi>to Original Sin, which he might have made use of as a general Solution to almost all their Difficulties. For we may easily apprehend why Man is inclined to evil, why he suffers, why he is subject to hunger, to grief, sickness, miseries, and to death it self, where once we have admitted Original Sin. Neither doth this Author speak of the Grace of Iesus Christ, and he seems to have supposed, that Man can of himself as well do good as evil.</hi> The Disciples of St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not find <hi>Dydimuss</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> much more Orthodox, since he maintains, <note n="*" place="margin">P. 389.390.</note> that Predestination is nothing else but the Choice, which God hath made of those, that he foresaw would believe in Jesus Christ; and would Act according to it. He likewise believed with his Master <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> that the Incarnation of the Son of God was beneficial to Angels, as well as to Men, and that it took away the Guilt of their Transgressions. As to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Eternity</hi> of <hi>Spirits,</hi> he speaks on't without condemning or approving it. In Truth it would be absurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious to fix Eternity to any other Being than God, if by this word was understood an Absolute Eternity or Existence by it self; but if we suppose that the Souls of Men were Spirits created a long time since, which have offended God, and which he sends into mortal Bodies, there to do Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for their Faults, this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would be instrumental to discover many Difficulties in Divinity, which have hitherto appeared Unexplicable.</p>
                  <p>All the World hath heard of the <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> of the Ancient Church, that few well know what they were. 1. <note n="†" place="margin">P. 395.399.</note> When an Infidel presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be admitted into the number of Christians, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to instruct him in private, but he was not suffered to enter into the Church, nor to assist at publick Exhortations. 2. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when he was believed to be well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived of his old Errors, he was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to go to the Church, but only to hear Sermons, and not to assist at any Prayer. Therefore this second kind of <hi>Catechumens</hi> were called <hi>Hearers.</hi> 3.

                     <q>It's true, pursues Mr. <hi>du Pin,</hi> that the same St. <hi>Ierom</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Ctesiphon,</hi> speaks of <hi>Priscillian,</hi> as of a notable Heretick, which hath made Mr. <hi>du Quesnel</hi> believe, that this place of the Ecclesiastical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was corrupted. This Conjecture which is grounded upon the Authority of a Manuscript, would be of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence if we knew not, that St. <hi>Ierom</hi> hath often spoke differently of the same Man; besides, it's apparently the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that St. <hi>Ierom</hi> speaks in his Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, which placed <hi>Priscillian</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronian</hi> his Disciple, in some Martyrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies amongst the Holy Martyrs.</q>

<q>That though it be true, that there were placed in some Churches Pictures, that represented the Histories of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Actions of the Saints and Martyrs, it cannot be said that this use was general; and that it must be granted that St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> hath disapproved it, although without reason, (according to him,) for I believe, continueth he, that it would be contrary to the Candor and Sincerity that Religion demands of us, to give another Sense to these words.</q>

The XXXIV Canon and the XXXVI, have given much Exercise to the Roman Catholick Divines. The one forbiding to light Wax-Candles in the Church-yard, because the Spirits of Saints must not be troubled; and the other Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in Churches, lest the Object of our Adorations should be painted on the Walls.
<q>They have endeavoured to give several Expositions on these Passages; but it seems to me, saith Mr. <hi>du Pin,</hi> that it is better to understand them simply, and to allow that the Fathers of this Council have not approved the use of Images no more than of Wax-Candles lighted in open day. But, continueth he, these things are of Discipline, and may or may not be in use, and do no Prejudice to the Faith of the Church.</q>
The XXXV Canon prohibits Women to pass in the Night in Church-yards, because often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Praying, they in secret committed great Crimes. The LX de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives such of the quality of Martyrs, as are killed in pulling down Idols publickly, because the Gospel commands it not, nor is it read that it was practised by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in the time of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>The same Spirit of Parties, which wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Canons of the Council of <hi>Elvira,</hi> hath caused Men to doubt of the History of <hi>Paphnusius,</hi> related by <hi>Socrates,</hi> lib. 1.

Although he himself had never been married, he maintained that this Yoke was not to be imposed upon the Clergy, and that it was to bring the Chastity of Women in danger.
<q>I believe, saith Mr. <hi>du Pin,</hi> upon this speaking of the Roman Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that this doubt proceeds rather from the fear they are in, that this act should do some hurt to the present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin, than of any solid proof. But these Persons should consider, that this Regulation is purely a Disciplin, which the Disciplin of the Church may change according to the times, and that to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, it is not necessary to prove it hath always been uniform in all places.</q>

                  <p>THis Author, who published a Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Universe,</hi> in five Volumes in <hi>Octavo,</hi> in 1683, with a curious Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a thousand things concerning Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and History; had also published these <hi>Travels of Mars</hi> some Years since. The Work was esteemed by the most Learned in that Science. It was immediately Re-printed at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and was soon translated into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral different Languages. It is a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon this Second Edition, that it hath been <hi>inriched with many new Treatises, several Maxims and particular Remarks, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath endeavoured to conform to the excellent Maxims</hi> of famous Mr. <hi>Vauban,</hi> one of the chiefest Men in the World in these sorts of matters.</p>
                  <p>He gives us in the first part of this Work the Explication of the Elements of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which are necessary to Fortification. After that, he Expoundeth not only the Construction of regular places, whether on Paper or on the Earth, and the method of raising and leveling the Ground, but also the manner of Fortifying all sorts of irregular Places in what Situation soever.</p>
                  <p>He gives and examines in the second place, the divers methods of Fortifying Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which have been invented by the most
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:103507:213"/>
able Authors or Ingeniers, as <hi>Errard, Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois, Tritach, Stevin, Dogen, Marchi, Sardi, de Ville, le Comte de Pagan,</hi> and others. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares their methods with his own, and adds to all this, several fair and ample Dissertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for and against the use of <hi>Cazemates,</hi> second Flanks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which he adds, the different manners of laying Foundations, transporting the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Work will hold its place above all others, seeing we may find there faithfully exposed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, that the greatest Masters approve of, and that which the Author judges the best.</p>
                  <p>The third part is very fine and proper for all manner of Persons, because there they may learn an infinite deal of things, which they would be glad to be instructed in, though they have no design of going to War. There may be found the Names, the Charges and Duties of the Officers of Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Cavalry and Artillery. There are seen all that regard Military Exercises, the March of Troops, the use and difference of Arms, the Service of Cannons, artificial Fires, the Instruments used for Assault or Defence of Places, the Sieges of Cities, the duty of the Besieged, and the War of the <hi>Turks.</hi> This latter Article is replete with a great deal of Curiosity, by reason of the War they have with the Emperor, which will make the Book of <hi>Debricius</hi> to become dear, although it has been laid by, since the Rout of the <hi>Turks.</hi> The meaning of it is, that we must neither assure our selves of, nor be frightned at any thing.</p>

                  <head>The Education of Daughters, by Mr. <hi>Feuelon</hi> Abbot, according to the Copy Printed at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> Sold by <hi>Peter Abouin, 1687,</hi> in Twelves.</head>
                  <p>THis is a matter of one of the most grave and important Concerns of Life. Mr. <hi>Abbot Feuelon,</hi> concern'd at the negligence wherewith Virgins are Educated, thought he could not better Consecrate his Cares, than to the Instruction of this Fair Sex. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in reference to publick Good, or by a blind Inclination to Young-men, abandon their Daughters almost without giving 'em any Education. <hi>Notwithstanding,</hi> saith he, <hi>they are destined to fulfil the Duties which are the Foundations of human Life, and which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide that which most nearly concerneth Mankind.</hi> There is then nothing more important than the Precepts that are given us here. And indeed the Source of Men cannot be too pure. But the difficulty of Succeeding is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than is imagin'd. For if to give a good Education to Young-women be to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd intirely from the World to apply them to what concerning Housewifery and House-Government; it is to be feared, that their Restlessness and natural Curiosity, will push them upon other impertinent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments. That whereof <hi>Moliere</hi> gives a Model of natural Simplicity, and which seriously asked,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If Children that are begotten, were made by the Ear,</hi> being clear'd of its doubts, made him repent himself for being jealous of the Ignorance he had taken care to Educate his Daughter in. Some pretend also, that it is not less dangerous to let Maids take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in Reading and frequent Conversation, fearing they should fall into the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Learned and knowing Women, who never come down from Heroism and Refined Wit.</p>
                  <p>Let us then see what way Mr. <hi>Abbot Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elon</hi> traceth out for Mothers to prevent these two Defects. He begins with the tenderest Infancy, and even regulates the Diet to give a more sweet Blood, and strengthen the Organs. He pretends, that the Pleasure which is taken about lusty Children, spoils them, because they begin too early to be applauded, and to hazard all that comes into their mind, and that thus there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains with them all their Life time a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of precipitate Judging. It is better to moderate these first Heats, to render them more quiet and patient, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them rather when they doubt, than when they decide well, because thus Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty insensibly enters into their Mind. As Curiosity is an Inclination of Nature, which prevents Instruction, he takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion whereby to instruct them in every thing, and hastens to settle in their Brains the most perfect Images, because Traces are more easily imprinted in this Age, and hardning, become indelible. And that there may be no delay in the least Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, Mr. <hi>Abbot Feuelon</hi> enters into the most particular Condescensions, and prescribes amongst others, that in passing by Shops, they should be instructed in the just price of all things; which is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of OEconomy, the Portion of Young-women. He adds as a thing that ought not to be omitted, <hi>viz.</hi> That the best Education befals Children that feel nothing. This Towardness renders Care useless. For if such as are naturally sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble have great Errors, they likewise have great Helps.</p>
                  <p>After that coming to a more advanced Age, he saith, that nothing backwards Young-women so much, as the bad Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of those Mothers, who make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Lessons, and render Virtue odious by too much Preaching on't: Wisdom
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:103507:213"/>
ought not to be shewn to this Age, but under a Smiling Countenance, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pleasant Image. The most serious Occupations ought to be seasoned with some honest Pastimes; and a familiar and open Conduct makes more progress than a more severe Education, and a dry and absolute Authority. Notwithstanding it's the common Injustice of Mothers, who taking always an Austere and Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Countenance, judge not of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures but by the Sorrow and Care of their Age; instead of Judging thereof, by the Joy and Sportings they had in Times past. It falleth out often, that they cry out against Pleasures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they themselves cannot taste of them. Howbeit we cannot be Old as soon as we come into the World; and Mr. <hi>Abbot Feuelon</hi> condemneth these constraining Formalities, and these dimm Ideas of Virtue, which render it Sad and Tedious to Young-women. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, continues the Author, as they are destined to moderate Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, it is good to give them a slight Imploy; for Idleness is an unfathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Source of Troublesomness; and besides, the wandring Imagination of a Young-woman turns it self easily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dangerous Objects. Therefore also he will not have them to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom themselves so much to sleep, because that mollifies the Body, and exposes the Mind to the Rebellion of the Senses.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Abbot Feuelon</hi> condemns utterly Romances, because according to him, Young-women fall into Passions for Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Intrigues and Adventures. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charmed with what they find ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and marvellous in them; what a Distaste is it to them to abase them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto the lowest part of House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery, and to this ordinary Life we lead? He is not yet altogether against their Learning some Languages; but he Rejects the <hi>Italian,</hi> because it's only proper to Read dangerous Books; and he prefers the Latin Tongue by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>Divine Office.</hi> But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning other Inconveniences, he forgot that <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Martial</hi> are Poysoners, far more pernicious than <hi>Amintas</hi> and <hi>Pastor fido</hi>; for besides the Obscenity of <hi>Martial,</hi> there is in <hi>Ovid</hi> all that Love can inspire, most Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, most Ingenious, and most Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. In Truth, it were a thing to be wished for, that the Modesty of a Young-woman should make her Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of all things that concern Love; but it is convenient enough to know it in order to prevent it as much as possible. At least it was the Advice of Madam <hi>de Chartres,</hi> a Grave Author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess upon this Matter, and which well may be opposed to Mr. <hi>Abbot Feue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> The greatest part of Mothers imagin, (saith the Author of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of <hi>Cleves</hi>) that it is not sufficient to speak of Gallantry before Young Persons to make them keep from it. On the contrary, Madam <hi>de Chratres</hi> often depainted Love to her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. She would tell her what there was pleasing in it, the more easily to perswade her of the Misfortunes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into Engagements lead us.</p>
                  <p>This Conduct hath something in it very Acute. For nothing is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than to expose a Young-Woman to know Love by an interested Persons Mouth, who far from making her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Troubles that follow this Passion, hath no greater Care than to hide them from her. So that it is very hard, that a Young Person should resist Love, whilst never hearing men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of it, she begins to know it by that which is taking in it; and how shall she defend her self from a Passion, which only Promiseth Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and which offers such pleasing Baits! But the Question is too impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to be decided so; we shall pass to the Chapter which speaks of the Faults of Young-women.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Abbot Feuelon</hi> says, That they must be Corrected for those Tears they shed so Cheap. They have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Reproached with a marvellous Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of Speaking, and it's even presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that there is a little Lewdness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix'd: For according to Mr. <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> a Handsom Woman when she is in Tears, is by the half more Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. It is without doubt a great Art to know how to shed some Tears to the purpose. Notwithstanding the Author condemns these over-frequent Tears, as marks of Weakness and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice. It's also sometimes the Effect of a sensible and compassionate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It's needless to say, that they should be told of Expressing themselves in a few words, and not to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with a Faculty of Speaking, and Vivacity of Imagination, which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to them. Mr. <hi>Abbot Feuelon</hi> spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not these Affectations of Grief; these perpetual Complaints, these little Indispositions, which always shew a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent Countenance; and these preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate Decisions of the curious Ladies which so much displease Men of good Judgment. A Poor Man of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, saith he, will be the Ridicule of five or six <hi>A-la-mode</hi> Ladies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Peruque is not of the best make, or because he wants a good Grace, though he hath an upright Heart, and a Mind Just and Solid: When a Courtier is preferred, whose whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts consist in Fashions and Cooks,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:103507:214"/>
and who hideth a low Heart and False Mind, under an Exteriour Politeness.</p>
                  <p>Finally, he enveighs mightily against the Vanity of Women, their violent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Pleasing, and the Passion of Dressing themselves, which they make their most important Business. He pretends that this Haughtiness draws after it the Ruin of Families, and the Corruption of Manners; and he neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decides, That <hi>Beauty is noisom, if it doth not advantageously serve to Marry a Young-woman.</hi> This Sentence is a little Rigorous. It's true, that the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an Ugly one seems to be more secure, because she is sheltered from the Attacks to which a Fair one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exposed: But on the other side the Virtue of a Handsom Woman shines more by the Conquests she goes through; and we may doubt of her that never was Attacked. The one is inured by the Assaults which she repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; and the other that is not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to defend her self may be more easily surprised. On the other hand, seeing the ways that Conduct Men to Authority and Glory, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to Women, and that they have for their Lot only the Charms and Graces of Nature; what a Spite then is it for 'em to deny 'em their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most they are capable of doing, to raise and preserve the Lustre thereof? What! Because Men are too sensible of it, must they be deprived of all their Pleasingness, and cloister up all their Charms to expect patiently an advantageous Match, that is to say, to become the Prey of some happy Fop, or Capricious Fellow? In Truth, it is a crying Injustice, and I should as soon have the Stars condemned to give light no more, because Men being surprised by their Lustre, adored them. Beauty makes the Glory of Women, as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that of Heroes. Therefore one of the most polite and refined Authors of this Age opposeth a Fair Virgin to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and maintains, that she had more Right to make Conquests than him; because Beauty hath a natural Right to Command over Men, and that Valour hath a Right only acquired by Force. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conquerors are permitted to set fire upon whole Cities and Kingdoms; And must not Fair Women be able to fire Hearts, or make Conquests in their Territories, without being expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Censure? We shall then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Article by a Passage of the same Author, That <hi>the chief Merit of a Woman is to be Handsom,</hi> and that <hi>there is no Prettier Condition than that of a Pretty Woman.</hi>

                  <p>WE have spoke in the Novels of <hi>October</hi> 1685, of the Institution of this Acca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy <hi>of the Curious in Nature</hi>; and we have mentioned several of their Observations in their Journal of the year 84: Now we hope that their Journal of 85, is furnished with no less rare Curiosities. Nature does not grow old, what ever People say: She is always fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile in all Productions; and we may observe her Effects, to see that She Signalizes her self every year in some Country or other, and sometimes in all Countries, by Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, singular Cures, Monsters and other rare Phenomena. I may be suffered without doubt, to place among the Works of Nature, that do not happen often, the heat that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in a dead Body for 3 or 4 days; which is the Subject of the 18th. Observation of this Book; wherein is seen that a Man of 72 years of Age, but Strong and a great Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, dying of a <hi>Burning Fever</hi> on <hi>Christmas-day,</hi> 84, was found Hot by his Domesticks at night; who were curious to feel him for a certain Superstition which reigns in several places of <hi>Germany,</hi> whereby they believe that if the Deceased do not grow Stiff, it is a Sign that many of his Friends will dye soon after: This Mans Servants having found him hot the 1st. day, tryed next day, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he continued so, tho the Weather was very cold; and they found him as hot as the day before, both at his Back and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Abdomen</hi>; and they found him Luke-warm the 3d. day and 4th. and it was but the 5th. day that he became intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cold. A <hi>Gangreen</hi> that had possessed his Bowels, did without doubt much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to this Heat: For th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s poor Man having lost the parts of Generation before his Death, by a Descent of his Guts into his <hi>Scrotum,</hi> which occasioned a Castration, and made the rest disappear after such a manner, that if it did not concenter inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it mixt after an insensible manner, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the other Excrements which were taken from the Sick Mans Body. M. <hi>de le Boe,</hi> had already observed that the Bodies of <hi>Hydropicks,</hi> remain hot some time after Death, for 2 or 3 days: Nor is it after all, so surprizing, seeing that Plants parted from what nourished them, ferment after a marvellous manner.</p>
                  <p>Let us pass to the 32d. Observation, where the Opinion of <hi>Scaliger</hi> is refuted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Cry of Crikets. It is a Noise that agrees with the <hi>Africans</hi> very well, and serves as delicious Musick to lull them asleep: This makes them nourish Crikets in Iron Cages, and purchase them at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Rates: And they receive them as acceptably at <hi>Fez</hi> it self, the most learned place of all <hi>Africk.</hi> We find the noise of these little Animals, sometimes troublesome; but because tis thought an Ill Omen if they quit the House, we do not wish to be rid of them. M. <hi>Konig</hi> having searched the Organ of the Cry of Crikets, found that it was not the Passage or Fistule of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> believed, but that it is a very dry Membran that foulds it self as a Fan, and which is fastned under the Wings to a <hi>Tendon</hi> that is pretty long, and which when the Muscle shortens, forms them, folds upon the Membran, and thence comes the sound, which can be renewed in some man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in a dead Criket; so that the <hi>Tendon</hi> be dexterously drawn: And it is remarked that a Criket cut in two, sings and lives a long time.</p>
                  <p>The same Mr. <hi>Konig</hi> furnisheth us in the Four and Thirtieth Observation, with the Anatomy of an Owl: He found that the Eyes of this Bird are shut up in his Scull, that they, are immovable, and that they neither have an Elliptique Figure as Mens Eyes have, nor a round one as other Birds; they are like a Globe, in the midst of which, a Turner would make a Hole on both sides, and there are seen the Parts of the Bones all in a row. There has been mention made the 10th. year of this Journal, of some Flyes, that did great Damage in <hi>Poland</hi>; their Figures are seen here in different Fashions, as they appeared in a Magnifying Glass to M. <hi>Pelisius,</hi> who tells us a very strange thing in his 43d. Observation; which is, That a Rosemary-Branch which was according to Custom put in a dead mans Hand, grew so strangely, that it spread it self and covered with its Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the whole Face of the dead Person; as it has been found to the great Admiration of many, some years past, on uncovering the Coffin.</p>
                  <p>The 106th. Observation contains one of those happy Temerities, that are seen some times as well in Physick as Politicks. A Peasant of the Dutchy of <hi>Meklenburg,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Wife almost dead in Child-birth, pressed the Midwife so much, to draw the Child from her with a great Scale-hook, that the Midwife was at last obliged to make Tryal, and hit so well the Nape of the Childs Neck, without knowing what she did, that she brought the Child into the World in a very good Condition, and with little hurt, and is living yet. In the following Observation, we are entertained with a Child already Rotten and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that was delivered from a dead Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which confirms the 42d. Observation, that says, some 7 days after the Death of a poor Woman that dyed a Month before the time she should be brought to Bed at, was put in a Byer; the Child was observed to have rouled to the dead Womans Feet; and it is more credible that a Child should come into the World of it self from a dead Mother, than that pieces of Gold, Brass and Iron, fall with the Thunder in the <hi>Indies.</hi> However that is, M. <hi>Rumphius,</hi> the Historiographer of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company in that Country, has sents to M. <hi>Menzeliur,</hi> a Physitian of <hi>S. A. E.</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:103507:215"/>
other Rarities, whose Catalogue is here to be seen, a piece of Brass weighing about 12 Ounces, which he says fell from the Skies in a great Tempest. The <hi>Indians</hi> make great Account of these Metals, which they pretend do fall with the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, and make Rings of them, believing them Powerful to preserve their Healths, and to render them Victories over their Enemies. Few Physitians will meet with as much Satisfaction in these things, as in the Remarks of M. <hi>Harderius,</hi> Professor of Philosophy in <hi>Basil,</hi> upon the Venom of Vipers; he gives M. <hi>Redi</hi> an account of the different Effects of this Poyson upon several Beasts, and admires the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Experiences of M. <hi>Redi,</hi> and M. <hi>Charas,</hi> about the Yellow Juice which is in the Vipers Gut, which M. <hi>Charas</hi> says is very innocent; but in the Opinion of M. <hi>Redi,</hi> it is their very Poyson: He seems to be inclin'd to this last Opinion.</p>
                  <p>Let us now speak of the Appendix, which is worth as much, if not more than the whole Work. We first meet with the <hi>Mystical Key to the Doctrin of the Chinois,</hi> about <hi>Pulses</hi>; composed in 1658, by the Polish Jesuit <hi>Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> Missionary of <hi>China.</hi> The Title of this Book insinuates that Mr. <hi>Cleyerius,</hi> first Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company in the <hi>Indies,</hi> had gathered some Fragments, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them into <hi>Europe,</hi> and that now at last he has sent 'em all well corrected, having received them from <hi>China</hi> by the hands and care of Father <hi>Couplet,</hi> a <hi>Flemish</hi> Jesuit, that was lately sent to <hi>Rome</hi> in Embassy about the concerns of that Country: I find something dark in the Title, for I do not see why that Jesuit returning to <hi>Rome,</hi> could not bring that Manuscript along with him, but must leave the Glory to a <hi>Dutch</hi> Physitian, of sending the Work of an other Jesuit into <hi>Europe:</hi> However it be, the Treatise of Father <hi>Boymus</hi> is very curious, and shews he had a great deal of leisure, which he well employed in learning the Foundation of the <hi>Chinois</hi> Physick; he explains the System very neatly, and it is easie to see, by what he says, that the <hi>Chinois</hi> are very able men. 'Tis true, their Principles are not the clearest in the World; but if we had them in the time of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Philosophy, they would be much admired, and there would be found in them as much Reason and Evidence at least as in our own. But they were unluckily brought into <hi>Europe,</hi> when the Mechanick Principles invented and received by our <hi>Modern Naturalists,</hi> had given our Physitian such an Aversion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the first Physitian of that Nation, was their Emperour <hi>Hoamti,</hi> who lived 400 years after the Deluge, and 2697 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Birth of our Saviour. We took notice last year p. 97, that the chief Ability of the <hi>Chinois</hi> Physitians, consists in the Knowledge of the Pulse, wherein they are very expert. This is the reason why this Jesuit thinks to learn the Subtilty of their Precepts, if he can explain unto us their Speculation and Practice upon the Pulse; to render which, he says more likely, he observes that that several <hi>Chinois</hi> Physitians apply themselves solely to certain Distemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and particular Persons; some undertake only Hectick Fevers, some Children, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Women, and these last have most Trouble, because they are not permitted to see Women of Quality; they must divine by their Pulse, which they will without the help of the other external Signs, which they consult with Success in the Distempers of Men; a strange Madness of these People that will not suffer that their Wives be seen, even when they prove rather Objects of Pity than an incentive to Lust. The <hi>Eastern</hi> Christians are yet more foolish about their Wives; for there is a certain <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Tavernier,</hi> liv. 4. chap. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Armenian</hi> that has never yet seen his Wife, whom he married Ten years ago; nor ever heard her speak.</p>
                  <p>When she lyes with her Husband, she takes not off her Veil until the Light be first put out: And in whatever Season it is, she gets up before day, and never eats with her Husband. The <hi>Chinois</hi> want one thing very necessary to the Perfection of Physick, which is, the Anatomy of Human Bodies; whoever would undertake to direct any Person upon what account soever, must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a publick Execration. The Author conjectures that they have not always been of this Humour, because they have very exact Draughts of our internal Parts; and it were hard to imagine that the Emperour <hi>Hoamti,</hi> had formed the Theorie of the Pulse, without the help of Dispection: His Precepts upon this are very different from those of <hi>Galen</hi>; for as this latter will have the Pulse to be felt but in one place of the left Arm, the <hi>Chinois</hi> have ordered it should be felt in Three different places of both Arms, and by Three different Degrees of Pressure: First to the Flesh, then to the Nerves, and at last to the Bones. <hi>Galen</hi> confesses that he knew not the number of the Beatings of the Arteries, for any considerable time; but <hi>Hoamti</hi> has given a very particular Table of them, taking his Rules from the Intervals of Respiration.</p>
                  <p>It will do well to acquaint the World with the Abilities of the <hi>Chinois,</hi> that their Observations may be compared with those of our Moderns, who are certainly more acquainted with the Qualities of the Pulse, and have a far more perfect knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in than <hi>Galen</hi> himself: This appears by the Treatise <hi>de variatione Pulsus</hi>; Printed at <hi>London</hi> in 8<hi>vo.</hi> and Writ by Mr. <hi>Abercromblus</hi> Physitian, that made himself known before by his Method of curing veneral Distemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, without the help of Mercury, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mercurial Salivation.</p>

A Letter of M. <hi>Lauranti,</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian at <hi>Boloyn,</hi> to Father <hi>Ferroni,</hi> a Jesuit and Professor of the Mathematicks in the same place; upon the <hi>erecting of Figures in an Optick Chamber,</hi> for so is that Chamber called that is close on every side, one place only excepted, that gives passage to the Light to shew plainly upside down upon a piece of clean Paper, all the Objects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that are opposite to this Hole, wherein a convex Glass is put: It wou'd be much more pleasing to the Eye, if Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects cou'd be so represented as to give their true Situation; and for this purpose, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients have been thought to redress the Figures, before they came too near the Glass, or to the utmost end of the <hi>Radius,</hi> which is before they came to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The Author mentions 10 of these Expedients, and in every one, are some inconveniencies; at last he finds one that is without any, and which by the means of a Prisme through which the sight is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by which the Images are seen in Paper, in their natural order, that so it increases the vivacity of their Colours: We are oblig'd to Chance only for the Discovery of this Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomeny.

                  <p>There are in the 4th. place two Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts, composed by two Fryars of <hi>Corbie</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi>; one of these Fryars is called <hi>Isibord D' Amelaxer,</hi> and the other, <hi>Alexander</hi> of the <hi>Island,</hi> both very good Gentlemen, of an extraordinary Application to Learning, which was more commendable, because they lived in those ill times wherein the Fryars of <hi>Corbie,</hi> as well as of other places, were too much addicted to Vice and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. These two Religions made a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of memorable Adventures, which had remained a long time unknown, and all covered with Dust; but at last M. <hi>Paullini</hi> published them with Notes of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the places that have any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Relation to natural History; there are many things very remarkable, as that the Cook of <hi>Corbie</hi> getting up at Midnight, the Eve of St. <hi>Vitus,</hi> the year 86, and opening the Larder Door, it appear'd to him all of a light fire. <hi>Cocta autem comestaque in festo pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon this <hi>M. Paullini</hi> says, That <hi>Bartholin</hi> and <hi>Aquapendente</hi> have made the same experience.</p>
                  <p>The Journal of the Learned informs us, That on the 14th. of <hi>Iune</hi> 83. at <hi>Orleans,</hi> Meat has been seen at the Shambles to shine like <hi>phosphore.</hi> The Conjecture of <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> is not altogether improbable, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Glo-worms sticks to this Flesh and communicates this shining. There is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in one of the <hi>French</hi> Novels of the foregoing Month, That <hi>M. Lanzwerdo</hi> does not much credit such Generations as are called Equivocal; that is to say, where the Mother is of a different kind from that which engenders, or is produced; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless one of these Fryars assures us, that in the year 874. a Woman brought forth a Black Cat, and that a Mare brought forth a Calf. He adds, That this Black Cat was burned, because the Father of it was supposed to be of Devils. <hi>M. Paullini</hi> makes mention of several such Generations; and it may be concluded in general, that the Text and Commentary thereon, make a very curious Treatise. There is likewise the History of a Dog that lived in the year 897. at <hi>Corbie,</hi> which was of an Exemplary Devotion, hearing the Mass very modestly, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served all the requisite Postures at the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Evangelists, or when the Priest rais'd up the Host: Besides this, he kept Fasting Days with so much exactness, that all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Civility could not engage him to tast Flesh. If he had seen any Dogs piss against the Walls of the Church, he went present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bite them with great Zeal, and if there were any that barked in the Yard during the Mass, he would not fail to quit the place without disturbance to quiet them; he never suffered any Dog to enter into the Church. Father <hi>Iohn Eusebe</hi> of <hi>Nieremberg,</hi> brings yet a more admirable Example of a Dog; if the Crow of the Abby of <hi>Conrad</hi> were as wise as that Dog, he had not felt an Excommunication that took away his Appetite, and ordinary brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the cause whereof was thus: <hi>Conrad</hi> having a mind to wash his Hands, took the Ring off his Finger, and could not find it when he wanted it again; he caus'd it to be sought for in every place, without hearing of it, so that he had issued out an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication against whoever had stole his Ring; the Crow that took it, presently felt this stroke, and confin'd himself within his Nest, with a heavy heart; this raised the Abbot's suspicion, that it was he that had stole his Ring, and in effect so it proved, for it was at length found in his Nest, upon which the Crow came to his first Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as may be seen more at large in the Holy Recreations of Father <hi>Angelin Gazee. A Work full of Pious Iests and Diversions for Devout Souls</hi>; as the Sieur <hi>Rems</hi> remarks, who has Translated them into <hi>French</hi>: It may be truly said, that there are more pleasing Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts in this Book than in that of <hi>Bocace.</hi> I do not know what to say to that which Fryar <hi>Isibord</hi> relates concerning a Cat of their House, which hatch'd Ducks Eggs, and took all possible care of the young ones, to whom she communicated her Nature of warring against Rats. But for what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the inability of the Ears of a certain young Girl, the Abbot of <hi>Marolles</hi> has left no room to doubt of it, being so confirmed

by the Philosopher <hi>Cressot,</hi> in the 32 page of his Memoirs, <hi>She much resembled</hi> (says he) <hi>the Figures or Pictures of the</hi> Cynick <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers that are in the Closet of the Curious, being as dirty as they, with a long Beard and Hair uncombed; she had a very particular thing which I never took notice of in any but in her, which was to raise her Ears and to fould them at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure without touching them.</hi> Father <hi>Messie</hi> in his 24th. Chapter of his first Part makes mention of a Man which St. <hi>Augustin</hi> has seen not only to move his Ears at pleasure, but also his Hair, without any motion of Hand or Head. This little Girl then is not so great a rarity as the Relation of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had 4 Breasts, corresponding to each other before and behind, equally full of Milk; she lived in the Year 1164, and had thrice Twins who sucked her on both sides. Nevertheless what we hinted at the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars of <hi>Corbie,</hi> does not hinder, but there have been very famous Men amongst 'em, which may be seen in the Account that <hi>M.

                  <p>WHen <hi>Orthuinus Gratius</hi> (alias <hi>Graes</hi>) Publish'd this Work, there was a Council call'd, for a Reformation of the Church, and the Catholick Princes did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly desire it from the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; yet it was doubted very much whether they shou'd obtain it. Nevertheless the Collector of these Pieces believed he ought to publish 'em, that in case the Assembly met, they might draw thence some very necessary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions to satisfie such as were for a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Abuses: Wherefore he added it to his Title, which was since a little chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in this new Edition. <hi>Quod si futurum Concilium celebrari contigerit, summopere, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam cognitu necessaria, ab optimis quibusque expostulabuntur.</hi> All these Advertisements being unprofitable, this Collection is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very scarce: Whether it was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to be suppress'd, because it has been condemn'd by the Index's of many Books; or that length of time only had produced this effect, is uncertain: However 'twas, this perswaded Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> to publish this Book anew; though the <hi>Roman</hi> Church having not received those Truths it contain'd, 'tis not likely they shou'd be more welcome now than formerly; also the World hath not seen this Collection, because of the fewness of the Copies. I will in brief give an account here of what it means: It's compos'd of 66 different pieces, all which relate to some Abuses of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> either in the Doctrin, or in the manner of the Clergy, or some Scandalous Histories which this Church hath produc'd since the Popes have had a desire to usurp a Despotick Power over the Revenues, and even the Consciences of the Christians, or of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Priviledges of the Church, which is there refuted, and of which he shews the evil Consequences; or, in fine, of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies condemn'd some time since. One may gather from all this, that there were great Abuses in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for which there was no remedy in the times of <hi>Orthuinus Gratius,</hi> nor is there any to this day.</p>
                  <p>There are four Pieces which give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the History of the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> who have declared the Authority of the Councils Superior to that of <hi>Popes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The First is an Account of this Council by <hi>Aeneas Silvius Picolomini,</hi> since Pope, under the Name of <hi>Pius</hi> the Second—This History is so ingenuous and plain, that in the reading it seems as if one were present at the Council, and even heard the Fathers speak which composed it. There is no doubt but it has been faithfully done, since he that wrote it was Secretary of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and whose interest it was as much to speak ill as well of its Authority: Since ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Remarks of <hi>Iohn Mason,</hi> the Popes gave Benefices, whereas the Council gave nothing. Thus, although the Author had retracted it, 'twas not of less conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, because he was Interess'd so to do, when he became Pope; whereas when he wrote it, he was engag'd of neither side. The reasons of the retraction, which was found in a Bull at the head of his Works Printed at <hi>Basil,</hi> are very weak; as <hi>Edmund Richer</hi> proves in the fourth Book of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the General Councils.</p>
                  <p>The Second Piece concerning the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Basil,</hi> is a Letter of the same <hi>Aeneas Silvius</hi> to a <hi>Spanish</hi> Divine, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates after what manner <hi>Amideus</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was Elected Pope, under the Name of <hi>Felix,</hi> to oppose <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. who had refus'd to submit to the Council. This Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was dated at <hi>Basil, August</hi> 12. 1440.</p>
                  <p>The Third Piece consists in two Letters from <hi>Iulian Cardinal</hi> of St. <hi>Angel. Iulian</hi> the IV. Predecessor of this Pope, had call'd together the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> and Nam'd this Cardinal as President, who had taken much care to Assemble it; but <hi>Eugene</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Council might be some preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Council of <hi>Rome,</hi> resolved to Dissolve it, and enable the Cardinal of St. <hi>Angel</hi> with a sufficient power to do it. Nevertheless this Cardinal, who foresaw the scandal it wou'd cause, cou'd not perswade
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:103507:216"/>
himself to obey it; but writ to <hi>Eugenius</hi> all the Arguments he had against it; although those Reasons are in bad Latin, they were nevertheless Vindicated very strongly: He saith also first in other things, <note n="*" place="margin">

Richer</hi> has also in his fourth Piece, which is much more Correct than this last, an Appeal from the University of <hi>Paris</hi> in 1517. to the following <hi>Council</hi> again <hi>Leo</hi> X. where appears a List of the chief Abuses, that reigned then in the Eastern Churches, and which made the Convening of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil necessary; with the proofs which the University shews contrary to <hi>Leo,</hi> that the Council of <hi>Basil</hi> was Canonically Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and cou'd not be rejected. The U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity protests also against the Treaty that <hi>Francis</hi> I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath made with <hi>Leo,</hi> as pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all the Kingdome in general, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in respect to <hi>Dauphine.</hi> At this time was made the Elegy upon the <hi>Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Sanction</hi> (after which succeeded this Treaty) and is express'd throughout the whole with more Life and Courage than they dare do at this Day. For although <hi>France</hi> has much Learning, yet it hath as little Valour.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Orthuinus Gratius</hi> had had any regard to order in his Collection, 'twou'd ha' been seen here in the extract which is at the 123. Page of the Works of <hi>Nicholas de Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mengis,</hi> where this Author reports, That <hi>Eugenius</hi> spoke freely against the Council of <hi>Basil.</hi> There would also have been the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>Brunswick</hi> (a little while after chosen Emperour) to <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. King of <hi>France,</hi> where he desires him to send Deputies to <hi>Mentz,</hi> to try if they cou'd remedy the Schism that was then in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches. It's Dated 21st. of <hi>May</hi> 1400. and it might contribute much to the knowledge of what was treated of in the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> concerning the Peace of the Church.</p>

After this of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> are some Pieces concerning the Doctrin of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and the manner how they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, <hi>viz.</hi> in a Book of one <hi>William Woodward,</hi> who lived at the end of the 14th. Age, against the Opinions of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> in 18′ Articles which are at the beginning of this Treatise; and with a much greater number of Articles which were attributed to <hi>Wickliff,</hi> whether true or false, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd in the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> with the Censure and Refutation of 44 in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: Without doubt several of these Treatises are attributed to <hi>Wickliff,</hi> as some Learn'd <hi>Protestants</hi> have made appear. Some seem to be ill understood, as the last. <hi>Omnes Religiones indifferenter introductae sunt à Diabolo</hi>: If <hi>Wickliff</hi> had said, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by Religions the <hi>Order of the Monks,</hi> against whom he was much Incensed, as it appears by the Articles of Page 277. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Religions; Nevertheless the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this Proposition supposes that we must take the word <hi>Religions</hi> in the most common sense of the different manners of serving God, as are the <hi>Iudaick</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religions.</hi> But when they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn any one, or take all that he says in the worst sense, it ought to render their Explications extreamly suspected, who has given us his Opinion of the <hi>Ancient Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> as well as the <hi>Orthodox Fathers,</hi> hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by their Zeal, ordinarily ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd 'em as worthy to be condemn'd as possible.

                  <p n="10">10. There are afterwards two Writings which contain the Examination of <hi>Iohn de Wesel,</hi> Doctor of Divinity, accused of Heresie; he was brought before two <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans, Gerard Elten,</hi> and <hi>Iames Springer</hi>; the first being an <hi>Inquisitor of Faith,</hi> in 1479. Some <hi>Thomists</hi> had remark'd in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Propositions they judge Heretical. There are some Opinions suppos'd to be faithfully reported, which agree to those of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> touching <hi>the Scripture, the Authority of the Ecclesiasticks, and fasting.</hi> He says (for example) that the holy Scripture must be expounded by its self, and that we are not obliged to comply with Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, or other Writings of Doctors. There are also some particular Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons very remarkable, as this, <hi>Raro reperio vel duas unanimes literatos, etiam in fide. Nullus tenet mecum, dempto Evangelio, ubi omnes sumus concordes. I rarely find two Learned Persons of the same Opinion, even in matters of Faith; but no Body is of my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except in regard to the Evangelists, in which we all agree.</hi> He also says, <hi>Quod Papa &amp; Episcopi &amp; Sacerdotes nihil sint ad sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem; sed sola concordia sufficit &amp; pacificeè vi vere; that the Pope, Bishops and Priests, are nothing to our Salvation; but Unity alone suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to live happily.</hi> He believed also that one ought rather to give Faith to St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who says, that <hi>the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father</hi>; than to that Article of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>'s Creed, that these Doctors cite under the name of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>; which Article says, <hi>the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father and the Son.</hi> In the Assembly, where the Inquisitor <hi>Elten</hi> was President, he demands of the accused Doctor, if those Propositions of which we spoke, were his? The Doctor would have explain'd himself more at length, and said, that he did not know that he had writ any thing against the decisions of the <hi>Church</hi>; but if it was so, he was there to retract it. <hi>Magister noster Gerardus</hi> immediately interrupted him, and told him, after having heard that he was ready to retract the Errors that he had committed: <hi>Petis nunc grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am? Do you beg pardon?</hi> The Divine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him, that <hi>he could not for errors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him</hi>: And upon that, the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor said that he shou'd be put in mind of 'em by examining 'em. He came to this <hi>Examen,</hi> which they read in the Original, where they might mark the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Inquisition, or those who imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated it. <hi>Magister noster Gerardus</hi> did all he cou'd to manage this poor Doctor, so that he might not justifie himself, or draw him from his pretended Errors without a noise, by good reasons: But to render him infamous and guilty, in malignantly explaining all his words; 'twas this made him say with sufficient reason to this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune: <hi>After the manner you have used me, if Iesus Christ were here, you might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him as a Heretick</hi>; to whom it was answered laughing, <hi>That if he were, he wou'd overcome him by subtilty.</hi> In fine, Whether convinced or no of his errors, Mr. <hi>Wesel</hi> was obliged to make a publick Retraction, and so submit to what pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance they pleas'd to impose on him.</p>
                  <p>He that writ the relation of this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ends with considerable Remarks upon the understanding of the Divines of that time, <hi>except,</hi> says he, <hi>the Article of the Procession of the Holy Ghost,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports very little; it seems not to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd so deep a censure as the others. If they had given him time and liberty to consult persons about 'em, he might have clear'd himself, if the most part of the Judges had not been <hi>Realists</hi>; or if the Religious had not had a mind to insult over a secular Priest, who had no esteem for St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> he might have been proceeded against with more humanity. I can take God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that their manner of dealing with him until he had retracted and burn'd his Books, hath extreamly displeased Mr. <hi>Engelin de Brunswick,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Kei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sersberg,</hi> who were Men of Learning and Integrity. Mr. <hi>Engelin</hi> in particular, thought they acted with too much Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation against so great a Man as <hi>Iohn de VVesel</hi>; he confesses freely, that the most part of his Articles may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. He dissembled not the hatred that the <hi>Thomists</hi> had against the <hi>Moderns</hi> (he observes some amongst the Divines of that age, who did not believe St. <hi>Thomas</hi> to be infallible) and the satisfaction the-Monks took in triumphing over <hi>Seculars</hi>: This can be nothing but the Devil, who sow'd this Division amongst the Divines, which caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so much Inveteracy amongst 'em, and diversity of Opinions, as those who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Thomas Ascot</hi>; and if any should deny the <hi>Universals</hi> to be <hi>Realists,</hi> they judge him <hi>guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost,</hi> which they think to be a most culpable sin against God, the Christian Religion, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and all Policy; from whence comes this but from the Devil, who deludes our Imaginations, and draws us to the search of useless things, and cold Speculations, which make us neither devout nor chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, lest we should oblige our selves to what is more honest, and learn how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:103507:218"/>
our Manners, and to procure Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to our Souls? This is the reason that none is edified, and that the Zeal of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> diminishes daily.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The greatest part of the rest of the Writings which compose this Volume, are Complaints that the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>French</hi> made some Ages past against many Abuses, whereof they demanded a Reformation at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who troubl'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves not much with it. Most of these Pieces are very well known; therefore we shall mention 'em in a few words: There are divers Grievances, that the <hi>Dyets</hi> of the Empire made known to the Pope's Legat, which was sent to 'em, and the Answers of these Legats, to evade the Complaints; <hi>Nicholas de Clemengi</hi>'s Writings upon a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, and Abuses that ought to be reform'd. The Harangues of <hi>Iohn Francis,</hi> and of <hi>Anthony Cornelius Linnecau,</hi> upon the Depravation of Manners and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, with the Book of <hi>Erasmus</hi> of the manner whereby their Controversies, which divided the Western Churches, are sufficient to put a Period to all these Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. In fine, there is some Discourse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Original, and Power of the <hi>Turks</hi> with the manner of its Abatement, and Reasons that introduce <hi>Christian</hi> Princes not to despair of their overthrow. <hi>Orthui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Gratius,</hi> who hath often placed unuseful Prefaces and Advertisements both at the beginning and ending of his Works, of which I have treated, ends his Collection with a Discourse, where he protests the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of his design in publishing so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heresies and Complaints against the <hi>Roman Church</hi>; he makes it appear by his Declamations against the Hereticks, which were spread through the whole Work and Advertisements, that he was zealous for the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, although he wish'd they had Corrected some Abuses which insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly slip'd into their Manners. He made the <hi>Elegy</hi> upon the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> and University of <hi>Paris,</hi> and defends others who have opposed themselves to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Authority of the Popes. 'Tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that all his Zeal against the Hereticks cou'd not hinder him from ranking this Work at <hi>Rome</hi> amongst Prohibited Books. There is more profit in reading the great Preface of Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> where he not only makes useful Remarks upon this Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and upon those of its Supplement; but also relates some curious Pieces, that had not been seen until then, which hath been already spoken of: There are some never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless since this Collection is not for the People; he that publish'd it might very well have sorborn many Invectives in his Preface and Notes against the <hi>Roman Church</hi>; and there are a thousand Pieces more proper to declaim against, than a Work of this nature; this is a fault for which <hi>Orthuinus Gratius</hi> hath been often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reprehended.</p>

                  <p>SInce Laws punish Poligamy with so much severity, it seemeth there was no need of the assistance of Divines to stop the disorders which might have given life to a Book, call'd, <hi>Poligamus Triumphans,</hi> written by one Mrs. <hi>Lyserus</hi>; yet this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion wou'd nevertheless be as dangerous to the Heart, as to the Mind. For if it was true, that there was a Legitimate priviledge, of which the Laws have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived Man, so as he cou'd act no farther, except he violate them without their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice that he was not exempt from their Penalties: Yet Industrious Love would not want means to laugh at their unjustice, and enjoy a liberty which should set no limits to his desires. Thus Mr. <hi>Maye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> who is a learned Professor at <hi>Harder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> finding the Question important, and worthy of his utmost endeavours, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh here to overthrow the imaginary <hi>Triumph of Poligamy.</hi> His Work is divided into three dissertations. The first regards <hi>Polygamy,</hi> the second treats of <hi>Incest,</hi> and the last of <hi>Divorce.</hi> He observes, that the first care of Legislators ought to make Laws for Marriage, which is the Basis and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Common-wealths. Therefore, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God had imprinted in Man the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which induceth him to Wedlock, he ordered him besides to <hi>encrease</hi> and <hi>multiply.</hi> The Author grants, that these words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Command, which concerneth not only Men, but Women also; so that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ought to bury their Talents. Yet he adds, that the Obligation was much more indispensable immediately after the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deluge, because the World was then a vast Desert. But the rule ought no more to be taken in the Rigour: Yet he maintains with the Fathers of the Church; that <hi>Adam</hi> looked not on <hi>Eve</hi> as his Wife, nor had for her the tenderness of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, until after his crime. This is it which hath given place to the pleasant Imaginations of the <hi>Rabins</hi> upon the Apple gathered on the Tree of Life, which the Serpent tempted the Woman to taste, who having found it delicious, corrupted the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of the first Man, and made him become the Father of Mankind. Doth it not seem that Mr. <hi>Sarazin</hi> hath sweeten'd this Thought to make his Sonnet so much the more famous against Women?</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Mugerius</hi> afterwards maintains, that the Polygamists can draw no advantage from the Command of God, <hi>Encrease and Multiply,</hi> because it bears an unlimited Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to mix himself indifferently: For this is understood only in relation to a just Marriage, such as God hath instituted from
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:103507:218"/>
the beginning of the World, to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two persons. The proof drawn from the example of Beasts cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to Man who governs himself accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws of reason, which abhors this confused mixture. If he was govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a blind instinct meerly, it might be maintained, that there is nothing criminal in the most unlawful Copulations. After all, Is not the Turtle-Dove with its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Cooings, and Sighs, the Symbol of Conjugal Fidelity? Its true, that Men sometimes resemble wild Beasts which tear one another, the most powerful destroy the weakest. His Passions, which tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise over him, and keep him as a Slave in Chains, often overwhelm Reason which distinguishes him from them. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they enjoy, say they, much more than he does this precious liberty, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes to whosoever will buy it; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Montaigne, We are but the Tenants of our life.</hi> But these disorders suffice not to take from Man all his Prerogatives. The Arts and Sciences which enlighten his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and enrich his mind, give him a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence which suffers not these odious Comparisons. It is not to lose his liberty when it is limited only by reason, and the Laws of Society: It is on the contrary a more noble liberty which cannot be put in competition with this natural brutality which makes the liberty of Animals. It followeth then, that he ought not, as they say, to trample under foot Modesty and Chastity, and being endowed with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, he ought to distinguish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from Beasts in the very things which he resembles them most in, to shew that he doth not behave himself like unto them, by a brutish impetuosity, and that he can bridle his desires.</p>
                  <p>Having answered the vain Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Polygamists, the Author strives to shew that Polygamy is repugnant to the Law of Nature; and he calls the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> the Will of God, who hath fixed Laws of Nature in the Creation of one only Man, and one only Woman, which he hath formed upon that account. He pretends also that it overturneth natural E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; because it is not just that a Wife should be constrained under the Yoak of an exact Fidelity, whilst the Husband is prodigal of his Conjugal Love elsewhere: Both of 'em, according to him, are strictly tyed by this Precept of Law, <hi>To give to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one what belongs unto him.</hi> Men, if we believe St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain only because they have made Laws which take away a tyrannical authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Sex, which hath no other power to defend its Rights, but that of Charms and Natural Graces. The Wanderings of a Husband then are Frauds and Stealths, and directly contrary to the Fundamental Contracts of Marriage, by which he obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himself <hi>solemnly</hi> to his Wife. Mr. <hi>Mye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> adds, That Poligamy is opposite to the tender Union which ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Marry'd Persons. Diversity of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men divorces and weakeneth the Desires and Transports of the Heart. It is with them as with <hi>Brooks,</hi> which being divided into several Branches, leave dry those Meadows from whence they arose in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. It was for this reason that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> called him who kept himself single <hi>a sad half of Man</hi>; whence it's easie to conclude, <hi>that he hath need but of another half.</hi> The Jealousie which would infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly kindle amongst the Women, seems yet another important reason to the Author, against the Opinion of Polygamists. For it would be a Civil-war as dangerous in the small Domestick State, as in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth wherein every one would be Master. Those which unhappily find, that

                        <l>Of Palling Ioys, and Tedious Nights.</l>
                     </q>
Will not perhaps think these Arguments convincing. As Marriages are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Works of Love or Fortune, how can we still apply our selves to the same person, when the Heart hath not chosen her; or to make our tenderness live longer than the Charms which gave it birth? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriages would remedy all, and would be a kind of Infidelity, and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy without a crime, Besides, the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie of several Women animated with a design to please and to be preferred, is not without Charms. Is it not said, That the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> was rejoyced by the Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Lea,</hi> which had given Mandrakes to obtain what was due to the Beauty of <hi>Rachel?</hi> Whilst a Woman which hath no Rival, keeps the heart of her Husband without any fear of losing it. But this is to be understood something more seriously, and it is maintain'd, that the reasons which favour Poligamy are suggested by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and corruption of the Heart. And indeed Honesty (which is an inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Law in good Manners) doth not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer these Extravagant Conjunctions, and Immoderate Transports. Love, who only looks on the heart of the person beloved, cannot consent to those new Engagements which divide his Cares and Wishes. But Debauchery may be extended to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, because it hath but unsetled Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. After that the Author enters into a Calculation of numbers, to perswade Men what a rashness it is to have several Women at once. <hi>Iuvenal</hi> saith, who reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd it amongst the Troubles of Marriage, that if a poor Husband hath slept quietly all Night, nothing is in order the next day, and the Wife expresseth nothing but Discontent, after a most Terrible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

In fine, because Errour seems to have its spring as much from the Temperament, as from the Heart, Mr. <hi>Mayerus</hi> prescribes ways how to overcome it. He compareth the Flesh to a mad Horse, which ought to be tamed by Temperance and Work.</p>
                  <p>In the 4th. Chapter he answers the great Argument of the Polygamists, which is drawn from almost all people who have ever made use of it. To end the Dispute of this History, the Author observes, that the Author of Poligamy was <hi>Lamech,</hi> and his example, though a great Libertine, was almost generally followed: So that the <hi>Rabbins</hi> maintain, that before the Flood, they were wiser than we in following Ages, because they took two Wives, one for Pleasure and Delight, and the other only to get Children. The Emperors <hi>Theodosius Arcadias,</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> in 393. forbid Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligamy by an express Law. It is certain that until then it was very common throughout the whole Empire, and with the Nations of the <hi>East.</hi> The <hi>Romans,</hi> which were a little more severe in their Manners, did not put it in practice. <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> being seduced by the Charms of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> was the first who took the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of marrying two Wives; although some pretend, that <hi>Caesar</hi> had introduced the liberty by a Law which was since renewed by the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> the I. Whence <hi>Polygamists</hi> may conclude, that it is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, because <hi>Grotius</hi> confounds the Law of Nations, with that of Nature. And Mr. <hi>Mayerus</hi> is of Opinion, that the Corruption and Errors of Nations consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute not the Laws of Nations, since we have seen some so barbarous as to feed on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Flesh: So we must consult the Laws of Nations the most polite, and see if they have been enlighten'd by the Gospel, and conducted by Reason in the Establishment of their Laws. As for <hi>Caesar,</hi> it is not true, that he published such a Law; but as he was the most voluptuous of all Men, it was said of him, <hi>that he was the Husband of all VVomen, and the VVife of all Husbands. Suetonius</hi> saith, that he intended thereby to authorize his Baseness under the vail of a Lawful <hi>Polygamy.</hi> They say, the same thing of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who renewed not the Edict of <hi>Caesar,</hi> as <hi>Socrates</hi> hath reported it, or who did it through the same motive; to wit, that he abused the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to colour his double Marriage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Purity of Christianity. The Examples of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> seem to be more pressing, and better to fortifie the cause of <hi>Polygamists</hi>; but Mr. <hi>Mayerus</hi> sheweth, that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no <hi>Revelation,</hi> followed the custom which was in that time: Yet their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance can be no proof for it, and we must not imitate them, seeing we have Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a Guide. As to <hi>Moses,</hi> it is not agreed on, that besides <hi>Zipperah,</hi> he married the Daughter of the King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> as <hi>Ioseph</hi> testifies. After that, the Author taking all the Passages of Scripture, which command Man to be satisfied with one Wife only; he clears this matter with a great deal of Learning, and attacks the Chimerical Opinion of the <hi>Polygamists</hi> by most positive Authorities, drawn from the New Testament (amongst others, by the 12<hi>th.</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>) which whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blots out the strong impression that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples could make, which God had tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated under the Old.</p>
                  <p>The second Dissertation is imployed to speak of unlawful Degrees of Kindred, and in which it is not permitted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Marriage. If we considered nothing but the Law of Nations, every one would have a full liberty in his choice. The Persons that are the nearest related, would not be excluded thence, that they might joyn to that of Blood, a more tender Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tye the Knot still closer.</p>

                  <p>But God having prohibited us to marry in certain degrees of Proximity, no body ought to oppose it. To that end, Mr. <hi>Meyerus</hi> gives us a Theological Explication of all the Precepts of <hi>Leviticus</hi> upon this matter. He speaks accidentally of several Questions which spring from those Laws, where all the Cases are not expressed. The Decision of it might be expected from Lawyers; but so many curious things would not be found in them, and chiefly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Karaites,</hi> whose Opinions are here expounded, and which may be read with a great deal of profit: Yet we shall stop but at one general difficulty, which is to know if the Levitical-Law is a moral and natural Law, or simply a Ceremonial one, which the Church may pass by: Those who extol the power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> stick not at flattering him with this Power, excepting in a direct line. Some Protestants have embraced the same Party, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that these Politick Laws had respect only to the Republick of the <hi>Iews.</hi> The Author is of the contrary Sentiment, and pretends that as there is <hi>Incest</hi> betwixt the Father and Grand-Daughter, there is no difference for the other prohibited de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. According to him, the Commands in <hi>Leviticus</hi> are not pure Ceremonies, and Rules of Policy; they are the Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Reason and Sense, and the Decrees of Nature, which God hath engraven in our Hearts. In effect, natural Modesty resists these Marriages betwixt Persons so near, in whose Veins the same Blood seems still to run. As Decency and Honesty ought always to preside, it is better to be too
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:103507:219"/>
scrupulous, for fear of wounding good Manners, than to expose our selves to give a scandal to the publick. Consequently, the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot dispense with the Precepts of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> which are of a positive right. It was the Opinion of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> that <hi>these Laws are Obligatory, and of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Observation, with which the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dispense, because his Authority is Inferiour to him that made them.</hi> The greatest part of the Doctors which were consulted upon the famous question of the Divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. which made so much noise in the last Age, upheld the same Sentiment. To this we shall add but one thing; That there ought to be some difference put betwixt the Degrees of Consanguinity and Affinity. The latter do not produce so streight a connexion, and often are but fictious, which Men have invented for Decency, whilst the first are formed by Blood, and Nature it self.</p>
                  <p>In the third Dissertation, which treats of Divorces, Mr. <hi>Mayerus</hi> maintains that under the ancient Law, Women taken in Adultery were punished with the utmost Punishments. But since that time, Men have been mighty slack in this: For now the whole affront is on the Husbands side; and it hath been very prettily said, that <hi>if a young Woman commits Uncleanness, it is for her self; and that if a VVife doth as much, it is imputed to her Husband.</hi> Neither is it remark'd, that this extream rigidness was practised amongst the <hi>Iews.</hi> On the contrary, here its related, that there was amongst them two Opinions, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them: The one maintained, that the Bill of Divorce could be given for Adultery only; the other, that it could be done on other occasions, provided they were of consequence; Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity for example, old Age, or ill humour, or <hi>for boyling the Meat too much.</hi> Howbeit, Mr. <hi>Mayerus</hi> proves, that Adultery is the only cause for which Marriage may be dissolved; and shews it plainly by the words of Jesus Christ in the Gospel. This truth cannot be withstood; but the use on't would be dangerous in so corrupt an Age as ours, and where the disloyalty of Women is only a pleasant entertainment. The best on't is, that each quietly dissembles his Disgraces and Sorrows, without rushing into sad demonstrations of it: And Men laugh as well at the Accuser as the accused. It is then better prudently, not to clear our selves herein, and to believe our su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicions and restlesness ill grounded. When all is done, there are such Husbands, as it is difficult to be faithful to them, and whose Person is a kind of excuse for the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and Errors of a young Heart. For in fine, we do not love by Reason and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and nothing is truer than,

                  <p>THere is all the likelyhood in the World, that these Dicourses were made by the same Father of the <hi>Oratory,</hi> who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>of the Art of speaking, and of the new reflection upon the Art of Poetry.</hi> He is a Man that understands the Mathematicks, examins things with much application, expresses himself clearly, and who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no fine Thoughts. As he has studied much, it was impossible for him not to observe the usual defects, as to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods which are followed in studying: He gives us his Reflections thereupon. They are sometimes superficial enough, but it is a mark of his Judgment; for a Book that is for the use of all those that stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, must not be filled with Depths and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions, which is to refer all to God. All the World needs to be advertised there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the Men of Letters more than others.</p>
                  <p>The first of the seven Discourses where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with this Work is composed, shews the Profit of Learning: But after that we are shewn that it is prejudicial to certain Men, because it swells and spoils their Mind, and that it procures them nothing which doth free them from this loss. <hi>A man,</hi> saith this Author, <hi>whom too violent an Application to his studies hath made sick, and reduced into Poverty through his neglecting his Affairs, amongst Persons which neglect or despise him, which is the common lot of Learned Men: This man, I say, is esteem'd by perhaps a dozen Scholars,</hi> English, German, Italian, <hi>&amp;c. whereof one speaks of him advantageously in strange Countries, another cites his Works with Encomiums; but these praises which scarcely do reach him, do not deliver him from his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, do not feed him, nor secure him against the Iudgments of God.</hi> We are moreover advertised, that over-curiosity is no less prejudicial to Men of study, than Pride; it is necessary notwithstanding, very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to study. <hi>Let the Debauched boast as much as they will of their Genius and Wit,</hi> the Author cannot believe their Ability, even in sensual Pleasures. <hi>To advance in Letters,</hi> saith he, <hi>we must love Solitude; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our selves of pastimes, resist the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Mind, which requires change; we must oblige our selves to a certain rule for ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, for going to Bed, for taking our Meals, and our Recreations, that we may fix the hours of our Study, and find time, which we should employ thereat.</hi> These are Labours es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:103507:220"/>
necessary to become Learned. After that, we must no more admire that amongst so many that are destined for Studies, there are so few that succeed. True it is, that we see People who pleased themselves in naming certain Learned Persons, which have been very disorderly in their Youth. The name of these Learned Men is cited in all places; but it is an ill excuse for the Slothful and Voluptuous to make use of where they see that they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided with the Abuse which they make of their time; and that they are foretold of the sorrowful Consequences thereof. It is an unhappy Illusion: It is impossible, that those who constantly study may not become very Learned; but it is almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that a Man who doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly study, should acquire much Learning; and if the few Examples which are alledged were examined well, it would be found, that they are neither extraordinary Wits, nor have they much Learning, but only a little Address to hide their Ignorance. Scarcely do we know any thing, when we study Night and Day. How should we be learned without studying much? The Author gives some Advice to them that would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct others, and maintains with a great deal of reason, that it is <hi>by good Logick that we ought to begin to study.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After having given us some general Counsels, he descends to particular ones in the third Discourse, as to that which we call the Study of human Letters. He saith, that as in a Common-wealth there must be People who inhabit Mountains and Barren places; <hi>it is also in Letters ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, and even of the order of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that there should be Persons that are willing to cultivate the most unfertile Grounds. A Man which looks upon it as a great thing,</hi> (adds he) <hi>to know what was the order of the Months of the</hi> Macedonians <hi>is despicable; but he that collects this order</hi> (if there was occasion for it) <hi>the clearing thereof deserves so much the more praise as his work is the more painful.</hi> Its unnecessary, that all the World should study <hi>Arabick</hi>; but 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary some Body should be found, whom one should have recourse unto, when this Language is of any necessity. This is for the instruction of those who absolutely condemn all the Studies which have not a continual use in the course of civil Life, and which do not bring as great Riches into the Country, as the Occupation of Merchants: Several other good Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be seen in this third Treatise.</p>
                  <p>The fourth begins with very pious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, which are followed with several Considerations upon Poetry and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar. The Author describes the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and necessity of Eloquence, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises to the reading of <hi>Cicero. There is no Author amongst the antient Heathens,</hi> saith he, <hi>whose Study is more useful for the solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Thoughts, for the admirable Maxims, for the Idiom of the Latin Tongue, and for the fine way of discovering Truth, and making it known with so much variety and fruit, that the Minds of the most distracted are necessitated to perceive it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fifth Discourse contains a Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Life, which the Congregation of the Fathers of the Oratory had. The Author speaks very finely thereof; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that although they do not make the three Vows of Poverty, Chastity and Obedience, they are notwithstanding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd. <hi>There is no Indulgence,</hi> saith he, <hi>for the opposite Vice to Chastity. Those that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be profitable to Persons of a different Sex, never to speak to them, though they are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to God. Those which are confessed, are seldom seen out of the Tribunal of Penitents. What Conversations they have with them are short, never by nights, nor in remote places, but as publick as can be, and in presence of Witnesses. By this means Scandal is avoided, and suspicions, being vigorously punished, the Crime is not committed.</hi> He adds, that they undertake nothing which engageth them to great Expences, as Magnificent Buildings, Guildings, rich Paintings; and that also they have no <hi>necessity of making recourse to rich Persons, not in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying their Ministery by baseness and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riee: It is a Crime with us,</hi> pursues he, <hi>to intrude into Families, to meddle with Marriages, or Law Suits.</hi> He speaks much of their manner of studying, and instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young Persons. He saith, that when they find any penetrating and great Wit, which hath a good <hi>Genius</hi> for their Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he is disburthen'd of all other Affairs; and they believe, that he cannot render better Services to the Church than by stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying. He saith also, that they use great Precaution to those who desire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into their Society; for if they have any Inclination to Vice, and feel themselves weak, they are advised to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold themselves by Religious Vows, and to shut themselves up in Cloysters. If they have fallen into great Crimes, they are perswaded to fix on Monasteries, and to pass their whole life in Repentance therein, without ever making themselves Priests. But if they give marks of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Calling, without perceiving themselves called to an Austere Religion, they are received without speaking to them of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any Order; but after being puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a long Penitence, in which, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate Life, and remote from all Commerce with the World, makes the Principal part. He relates several other things infinitely glorious to this illustrious Congregation, but he advertises us in two or three pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that he makes not <hi>an Encomium, but gives an Image of an Holy Community</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in may be seen what Men ought to be. He adds to his fifth Discourse, what hath been said of the <hi>Cycopedie</hi> of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that it was not an History, but the Idea of a wise Government, <hi>non ad Historiae fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, sed ad effigiem veri Imperii Scriptum esse.</hi>

It is the means of appeasing a little the other Orders of the Church, which might perhaps believe that they had a design to oppress them.</p>
                  <p>The two following Discourses are plac'd in a Library which is valued at more than 20000 Crowns. There are considered the Books that are most necessary for each Science, and the most proper Method to make a good use thereof. He speaks very contemptuously of the Scholasticks, and maintains it is sufficient to read one or two of them, because commonly they do but copy one another. He has not more consideration for the Casuists, but believes them dangerous for the most part, because they seem to confirm Sinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and teach them the means to shuffle with him, in shewing them how far they may offend him without his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a right to punish them.

                  <p>At the end of this Book are two Letters of Morality: The first treats of the beauty and necessity of Order: The second pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to an Ecclesiastick, who would leave his Retreat to take a Benefice upon him, the danger he exposed himself to by this change. He shews him how the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the World is dangerous, and how it sometimes happens, that a Priest, who hath resolution enough to renounce lewd Pleasures, yields to the temptation of Good-fellowship. At first the necessity of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is pleasing to him, which afterwards he prevents, and eats between Meals, will have Sauces, and imploys in them the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he at first gave the Poor. He gets him Friends who are people of pleasure and Goodfellowship. He thinks himself no longer rich enough, but seeks after Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; he is distasted at a Regular Life, and in a little time becomes like the <hi>Laicks, Commixti sunt inter Gentes &amp; didicerunt opera eorum: For in fine, he keeps not Company with them in their Pleasures, to Preach Repentance. They invite him, to divert themselves with him, and he strives to be neither Incommodious, nor Displeasing. He, like to them, esteems Goodfellowship, they Sing, they provoke one another to Drink.</hi> It is indeed a most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Temptation for Ecclesiastical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: They are too much afraid, lest they should pass for Formal Men, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Pleasures of a good Meal. They are too solicitous, lest People should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that they are not contended only to be tedious in their Sermons.</p>

                  <head>A Recital of the Conference that <hi>Luther</hi> had with the Devil, given by <hi>Luther</hi> himself in his Book of the Private Mass about the Vnction of Priests; with Remarks upon his Conference at <hi>Paris,</hi> by <hi>John Baptista Coignerd,</hi> 1684.</head>
                  <p>THis is the third Edition of this Work of Monsieur <hi>Cordemoi.</hi> He relates the Dispute, that <hi>Luther</hi> confesses himself he had one Night with the Devil, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing private Masses, and draws from them most grievous and odious Consequences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Protestants.</hi> The <hi>Lutherans</hi> who have made so great a number of Books, ought to oppose him. It looks as if he was not willing to destroy the disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Idea that it represented to the mind when in a Dream, or any other manner, an Instruction is received from the Devil; for as he is call'd in the Evangelist the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lies, so there is no great Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion necessary to make one believe he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver spoke truth: But we ought to conclude otherwise when a Spirit is so wicked as himself, which delights in the disorder of the World, and in committing many Crimes, so that nothing is more hateful to him that the Truth, that he shou'd be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to Induce Men to speak the Truth: 'Tis not wonderful that the Providence of Almighty God, who often to his end makes use of second Causes, and sometimes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys the Malice of the Devil to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of good. Now in part omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting here the Question, Whether <hi>Luther</hi> Preaches the Truth, or not? It is easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, that 'tis possible that an Evil Spirit might at that time believe a Lye would be less proper than the Truth, to excite cruel Passions in their minds. It is not very likely that any thing was more pleasing to the Devil, than the Discord that was caused about the Contest of Truth. As for Example, The Ten Persecutions of the Ancient Church sufficiently shew.</p>

                  <p>THis Work was Counterfeited at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> with the consent of the Bookseller of <hi>Paris</hi> who first Printed it; its composed of many little Volumes, which contain the most considerable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of <hi>Christendom</hi> in general, and of <hi>France</hi> particularly, from the Year 1637. to 1682. An <hi>Italian,</hi> Native of <hi>Genoa, Marana</hi> by Name, gives these Relations as Letters Written to the Ministers of the Ports, by a <hi>Turkish</hi> Spy, who conceal'd himself at <hi>Paris.</hi> He pretends he Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated it from <hi>Arabick</hi> into <hi>Italian,</hi> and relates at length how he found them. It's probably suppos'd 'tis the product of an <hi>Italian</hi> Spirit, and an Ingenious Fiction like to that which <hi>Virgil</hi> made use of to praise <hi>Augustus.</hi> This Poet very often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces <hi>Anchises,</hi> sometimes <hi>Vulcan,</hi> who to praise this Emperor more artificially, begins by little and little, and falls by degrees into the <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> which was the Poets main design; this is much hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somer than to praise a Prince purely with a prospect of Interest. Its thought, that the Sieur <hi>Marana</hi> had no other design, than to make an Elogy upon His Most Christian Majesty; the better to conceal his Game, and to render him something marvellous, he puts into the mouth of a Turk, that which himself had studied upon the Glorious Actions of this Puissant Monarch; but before he hath done, makes his Spye say many other things; 'tis no matter whether it be a <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Genoese</hi> that speaks to us, provided he gives us a good Book. The first Book is very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it contains the History of the last Month, from the Year 1637. and of the most part of the Year 1638.</p>

                  <p>A Title so well Circumstantiated as this, seems to leave nothing for the Journalists, or the Novelists of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to add.

Nevertheless if we had seen it, we wou'd observe many things of this Anatomical Bibliotheque; but how can we see it, not being yet publish'd, but hope it may be soon ready for the Press. 'Twill be a most useful Work, because it unites in one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy many Books of Anatomy that were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers'd, and being joyn'd together from a Compleat Anatomy, there are divers pieces of Mr. <hi>Malpighi,</hi> and some Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Authors, which never appear'd in the World.

                  <p>I Have in the first Article of the last Month said, that 100 Officious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters might please themselves infinitely in imploying their Pens to the Glory of the <hi>Fair Sex</hi>: He needs be no great Divine that says so; and he must have but a little Memory, and a very mean Knowledg of Books<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who without this Treatise, is afraid of being deceived in judging as we do, since so many have Written in favour of Women in all Countries, and all Ages of the World. We shall always find some who exercise themselves with pleasure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this repeated Subject. How many Books have we seen in favour of Women? Those Written by <hi>Monks,</hi> wou'd stock a Library; even the Chief Magicians, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Common Opinion) have Written upon this Inviting Subject, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Discourse of <hi>Agrippa, De no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitate &amp; praecellentia foeminei Sexus.</hi> I know some have Writ against them, but their number is inferiour to those who spoke in their Praise. There are too many, as well on the one side as the other; but those who know how to Write, being sensible of the trouble there is to keep the Mean, more easily pardon the Extreams these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors fall into. 'Tis very difficult to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Marriage without decrying <hi>Celebacy,</hi> and speak for a single Life, without bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Marriage into Disgrace. Therefore we ought to excuse those who cannot shun this Rock. St. <hi>Ierom</hi> had so little power in this Affair, that his Friends were forc'd to suppress some of his Books, where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of establishing Continency, he entirely ruin'd the Doctrin of the Church concerning Marriage. Some say, that Mr. <hi>Chausse</hi> runs upon the different Rock, when he says, <hi>That Marriage is the only way to Paradise, and 'tis to rob himself of the greatest happiness, and the most solid Blessings of this Life, to forbear entring into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial State.</hi> But certainly when they only imputed these thoughts to him, they forgot the Declaration which he made in these decisive Terms, <hi>Nothing is better, nor more excellent than Marriage, except an absolute Continency.</hi> There are some who indifferently regard the Disputes of these Authors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and only divert themselves, as if they saw different Persons acting a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Yet there cannot be seen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some agreeable Sentiments, two Books publish'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> both at the same time, each well arm'd with <hi>Approbation and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> which maintains absolute Contraries upon the great Theme of <hi>Matrimony.</hi> One of these Books is an Answer of Mr. <hi>Ferrand</hi> to his Apology for the Reformation; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that of which we are going to speak. Marriage is in it every where, almost ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to the highest point of perfection, where Fidelity continues during this Life; but in the other Book 'tis to Virginity, that this advantage is attributed, and that in so violent a manner, that if we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Maxims of the Author, cited step by step, we shou'd look upon Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Persons but as Vultures and Swine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We ought certainly to remit something of each side, and say, that <hi>Celebacy</hi> and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage are, speaking Morally, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves neither good nor bad. Those who remit nothing on the part of Marriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will immediately shew us how to prove the Excellency thereof, by these three Reasons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Because it was God that Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Marriage in the Earthly Paradice, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the State of Innocency.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is nothing agrees better with Man than Marriage, nor is more adapted to his Necessities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Marriage is the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary thing in the World to maintain Society, Wisdom, and Chastity.</p>
                  <p>These three Proofs are clearly amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, these two Considerations annext.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That Marriage is the most perfect Bond, the sweetest and most beneficial of all humane Unions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second, <hi>That 'tis the most legitimate and agreeable exercise, and of the most abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Authority in the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This he proves by most lively Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and observes, that this Union includes both Body and Souls, that it represents the greatest Mysteries of Religion, that 'tis a Source of sweetness, and infinite Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and which furnishes us with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Vertues, as Patience, Charity, and a desire to improve our selves amongst the number of the Elect, and Fellow-Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens: He adds, that the Father of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is Master of a little State, where he exercises the Function of a King, Priest, and Prophet. It allows him a very lawful and priviledg'd satisfaction of that desire which rules in a Man: He ends with this Consideration, <hi>That in one sense nothing can be more excellent than Marriage, since 'tis an Universal Custom, and the most general of all. Societies in all times, all places, and all sorts of persons, how different soever.</hi> This seems to me a just Abridgment of the first part of the Work.</p>
                  <p>In the second is represented the Infamy of Incontinency, considering three sorts of people that plunge themselves therein, one by Inclination, another by Habit, and the last by both, but with this difference, that the first look upon Lasciviousness as their <hi>Sovereign good,</hi> whereas the second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:103507:222"/>
there in <hi>spight of themselves,</hi> being subjected to the force of Custom and Temper; but the last look upon these Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities as an <hi>Innocent Gallantry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Author considers besides that, four sorts of Importunities; that of the <hi>Heart,</hi> of the <hi>Eyes,</hi> of the <hi>Mouth,</hi> and that of the <hi>Hand</hi>; he shews wherein they consist; he proves 'em Criminal, and gives the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why God hath so severely prohibited such things to Man, as he was Naturally inclined to, and why he tolerated <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy</hi> in the Ancient <hi>Patriarchs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third Part contains the full End and chief Design of the Author; for he writ this Book only to perswade the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Marriage to <hi>a considerable Person whom he extreamly Honoured, for his Merit and Family,</hi> where in this place he displays all his force to represent to the life, those Motives that ought to perswade People to Marry, he immediately proposes this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>there is nothing but Marriage that can naturally preserve Man from the guilt of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chastity, and by consequence that 'tis necessary for Salvation.</hi> After that other Reasons seem Superfluouse: Nevertheless, the Author sticks not to this great Principle which he ought to make appear, since he believes it is true, but he brings many other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages with abundance of Truth; he urges the unusefulness of Continency, he says, <hi>that the most Favourable Iudgments of the Wisest about a single life is, that 'tis a vertue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor bad and that being without Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is a kind of Vice.</hi> He maintains that God made Two Sexes in Nature, to shew they cannot subsist without being joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he sends us to learn of the Animals amongst which the Mutual love of Males for Females, and Females for Males is common to every Individual; after this he considers Men, as Men in a <hi>State,</hi> in a <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and in a <hi>Church,</hi> and he says, that in all these regards they are obliged to Marry, because (adds he) 'tis necessary to endeavour to preserve their own kind, as they are Citizens to the Republick, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors to their Families, and Servants to the Church; he speaks very large upon these three Duties, and considering the Beauty and Perfections of Man, he is wrapp'd up in admiration, and says, can there be any thing more Noble than the Ambition of Producing Creatures so perfect? He asks if it is possible that we <hi>should be so much moved with the Glory of making a fine Book, drawing a Beautiful Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or a handsome Statue, and shou'd not be sensible of the Glory of making of Man.</hi> This appears so Noble and Admirable that all men that we read of in Scriptures, have thought themselves very happy in it; as <hi>Ibstan</hi> and <hi>Abdan,</hi> of which the first had 30 Sons and 30 Daughters, and as many Sons and Daughters in Law; and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond had 40 Sons and 30 Grandsons, whom he saw altogether on Horse back. <hi>O God,</hi> (cries he out) <hi>can any thing be added more to the Happiness of a Father, can any thing be seen more memorable in the Life of Man! In my Opinion it exceeds all the Acts of</hi> Cesar <hi>and</hi> Alexander. <hi>such an Increase is more Noble than any Action that can be found in History.</hi> Hence he supposes that <hi>Augustine</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd more Glory, if instead of leaving so many Volumes he had furnished he World with 30 Children, and he wou'd perswade us that the Invention of <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> and <hi>Des Chartes</hi> are Trifles in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the Exploits of a simple Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Fellow, who helps to People the World by lawful means; I say lawfully, For the Author thinks no Off-Spring good that is not from Marriage. He fortifies his Proofs as much as possible, and goes back to the Antient <hi>Iews,</hi> observing that Marriage being one of these things which generally happen, sooner or later, it is better to engage our selves in happy time, than after a thousand declamations against it, whilst we are hurrying on to old Age, when Marriage can produce nothing but vexatious consequences, <hi>Dom. Anthonius de Guevare,</hi> Preacher to <hi>Charles</hi> the 5<hi>th.</hi> represents it very Ingeniously in one of his florid Epistles.</p>
                  <p>Yet what Reasons appear so fine and commodious to <hi>Monsieur Chauss,</hi> are subject to a little Inconveniency, because they are the same which are brought for <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamy,</hi> and which indeed is the best Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it; and because they ruin a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was very common, even among those, who for Political Reasons ascribed a kind of dishonour to a single Life. The Notion is, That a Widow which Marries not, is more esteemed than she that a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time admits another into her Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces: We have not much Authority for this, only the words <hi>Virgil</hi> makes <hi>Dido</hi> speak, teacheth us that it was the opinion of the Ancients.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Ille meus primus qui me sibi junxit Amoris,</l>
                     <l>Abstulit, ille habeat secum servetque sepulcro.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>The <hi>Ideas</hi> of Honesty are more Favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to second Marriage, therefore we must agree to 'em: But 'tis as certain that these Weddings were formerly, and still are subject to many Canonick Penalties; and if you'l believe the Learned Counsel, who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in the <hi>Laws of the Queen,</hi> the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution that hath been in certain Countries was established there but to keep the widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from Incontinency, and prevent their second Marriages, to the great prejudice of the first Wives Children; all this is silenced by the principles of our Author: For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we agree with him, we shall find that a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow which Marries not at the end of six Months at the least, is answerable to God, her Country, and Mankind, to the State, her House, and to the Church, all the time she lives in Widowhood, since she robs the Publick of a great Advantage, and <hi>Generation,</hi> the most memorable thing, that can be done of the handsomest Action of life, and of atchieving a more Illustrious
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:103507:222"/>
Glory, than <hi>Alexander</hi> and the <hi>Cesars</hi>: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these Principles, the man where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of St. <hi>Ierom</hi> speaks, that had been a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower 21 times, and Married a Wife that buried as many Husbands, was an <hi>Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Hero,</hi> and that he and his Wife ought to be received into the Catalogue of Saints: We may say also, according to the same Principles, that Incontinence is a great Sign of Gods Favour, since it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges Man to keep in the State of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and make himself as Famous as possible by the Increase of Children. This may be said in the abuse of <hi>Monsiur Chause</hi> his Reasons; but no Equitable Persons will put so far fetch'd an Inference upon the Intention of the Author. Now let us review the 4<hi>th</hi> Part.</p>
                  <p>It is designed as an answer to those which exclaim against Marriage: The Author is consider'd as an opposite against all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and it ought not to be taken for a Contradiction, altho he acknowledges in another place that all the World should Marry, for he had drawn from thence a proof of the Excellency of Marriage. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless 'tis next a Contradiction what he says here, provided it be true that those who are Marry'd speak ill of the State. If men will Criticize, it must not be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what they ought to do, but rather upon the extream difficulties which the Author represents in the Combat he undertakes, since it is certain all that is said against Marriage, hath been only for a little mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, and is very little perswasive, since it makes but a slight Impression upon the greatest number of Men; he refutes these Railery's who speak contrary to their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; for very often, if they lose their Wife, they take another in three or four days after: But as the Author hath writ his Book in Favour of a Man of another Temper, that is to say, who wou'd not so much as hear of the Conjugal Bond, he endeavours to make all the Apologies he can for Marriage, First, against those who raise Accusations against the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Women. Secondly, Against those who found it upon the Nature of Marriage it self. Thirdly, such as say, the consequences and obligations are an unsupportable Yoke. These three chief Accusations furnish him with a large Field, in which the Reader may trace him with pleasure.</p>
                  <p>The first Head is composed of divers Branches, which the Author displays with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dissimulation: Having collected faithfully the chief Invectives against the Sex, he afterwards answers them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, using the same sincerity in relation to the Reasons that respect the other two Heads; and says, amongst other things, That <hi>the state of Angels and Saints, ought not to be alledged as a prejudice against Marriage, since on that account their possession is equal with the Devil and the damn'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last part is very important, for it treats of the most likely means to make our Marriage happy. The Author gives us thereupon many good Counsels; first, that after having recommended our selves to God, who presides in a more particular manner over that state, we make a Choice of such a Person as pleases us, and who has an agreeable Temper. It wou'd not be unpleasing to have her handsome; but since 'tis not very common to find such a one, we ought to be contented, if she please us, whether she does others or no; and that 'tis not always advantageous for the Wife to please all the World: But 'tis not sufficient to be pleas'd with her Beauty, except there be a Sympathy in Humours. The Author ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises us to study the Genius of those we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to marry, that may the better succeed in spight of the Address that some make use of to hide their weakness; he adds for the better security, that we may choose one that is young, and resides near our own habitation. In the first place he advises to a choice in a well ordered Family, and to observe the equality of Condition and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and to take care that she has no such pre-engagements as may make her marry him by constraint: To these things only, which regard the Lover he adds two others for the choice of a Husband, which relate both to Women and Children; he adviseth them upon the whole to a conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Amity, good Example, Devotion and Moderation in the pleasures of the Bed, and gives good reasons for what he says. There is upon this subject also one of the elegant Epistles of <hi>Anthoninus de Guerre</hi>'s Advice, touching the Education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. In fine, we may say without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Mr. <hi>Chause,</hi> that there appears in the whole Book the Character of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Man, and good Christian, without prejudicing his Favour; we may see, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides good Wit, much reading of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poets, many things that divert the Reader at the same time that they instruct him. I believe that a good part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, wou'd be glad that this Work might have the same Success that the discourse of <hi>Socrates</hi> had at <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s Feast; this great Philosopher, so sensibly touch'd the Guests in speaking to 'em of Love, that those amongst 'em who were yet Batchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, made Vows to marry, and those that had Wives, immediately took Horse, and ran full speed home, that they might soon embrace their Wives.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a good Observation, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who in his Book exhorted Men to marry, says not a word to perswade Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to the same: He well foresaw, that this Silence would surprize some of his Readers, therefore he has put 'em out of pain in the Preface, by acquainting them that Virgins are sufficiently convinced of the necessity of Marriage, therefore want no Exhortations thereto; <hi>'tis certain,</hi> (says he) <hi>that though a Virgin never proposes Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, because of her modesty, there is nothing she so passionately wishes for; her Heart often gives her Mouth the Lye; she often says I will not, when sometimes she dyes for desire.</hi> The rest of the Passage ought to be read.</p>

In the Title the Authors which are made use of, are commonly marked, and the place is sometimes marked in the Margen. Neither do the Licensers fail to say, that <hi>tho' Men make a kind of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of Piously cheating others in the matter that the Author treateth on, after having first abused themselves: He on the contrary advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no fact, but for which he hath Witnesses, which cannot in Reason be denyed, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that how bright soever the Actions of Saints are, they alwayes makes less Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the hearts of Men, as soon as there is any Ground to doubt of them.</hi>

                  <p>TO say that Mr. <hi>De Fontenelle,</hi> hath aspired to the Prize of Eloquence, the Distribution whereof is made every Two Years, by the Judgment of the <hi>French Academy</hi>; and to say that he hath carried this Prize, is the same thing. For if he is so much distinguished by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Works that he hath given the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, nothing can come from his Pen which is not immediately followed with a general Approbation: The <hi>Academy</hi> alone gave him the Prize, which no body could reasonably contest about. It Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled according to Custom last St. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s day, which is the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August</hi>; and the Discourse of Mr. <hi>Fontenelle, Upon Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and its opposite Vice,</hi> was proposed by the Deceased Mr. <hi>De Balz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>c,</hi> for the Prize of Eloquence. To undertake to give here an Abridgment of this Discourse, would be the same thing as to take away the greatest part of its Grace. Those that will have the Curiosity of seeing it, as undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly its very well worth the while, will find it in this Collection. He will not have much difficulty to find out the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Illustrious Author of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of the Dead; of the Plurality of Worlds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every where he commands this happy turn that he knoweth so well to give to things, the same Elevation of Thoughts, the same Purity of Expressions. Can there be any thing more Ingenious; but at the same time more True, than what he saith to shew how much corrupt Reason, and divine Revelation are oppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? <hi>O blindness of Nature, O Heavenly Lights of Religion how contrary you are! Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by its inordinate Motions augments our Grief; and Religion teaches us to profit by 'em, by the Patience it inspires us with. If we believe the one, we add to necessary Evils a voluntary Evil, and if we follow the Instructions of the other, we draw from those necessary Evils, the greatest of all Goods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this Discourse should be copied, if we should remark all the fine places of it. Nothing weak appears in it, nothing lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth in it, and it's difficult in reading it, not to conclude, that if the <hi>Academy</hi> hath done Justice to Mr. <hi>de Fontenelle</hi> on this occasion, it may also very soon acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Merit after a more solemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; whilst receiving him into its Bosome, it will give him the place, that great Men, whose Name he bears, have so worthily enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>But what Honour soever the Prize doth to Mr. <hi>Fontenelle,</hi> the Prize he hath already carried, to wit, the <hi>Ode</hi> of <hi>Madamoiselle de Houlieres</hi> was Crowned the same day, is still more Glorious to him. What a wonder to see a person of her Sex, in so tender an Age, to Triumph over so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Learned Rivals, who expected nothing less than such a defeat! We should scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe it, if these words that are at the end of her Poem, <hi>Non degeneres progenerant Aquilae Columbam,</hi> did not teach us that she being Daughter to the Illustrious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>des Houlier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But Custom must be obeyed, my acknowledgment must appear; and what Expressions must I make use of to shew it to you altogether? How shall I Express the joy I feel, in seeing my self Associated to all that is Great and Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this Kingdom?</p>
                  <p>Here it is that the first Men of State di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest themselves of all the Pride and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, and seek for no Distinction but by the greatness of their Knowledge and Capacity. For <hi>Sirs,</hi> it is neither Birth, nor Dignities alone, which render your Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so Famous. To have gon through, the greatest Employments wou'd not suffice, to come amongst you: Wit and Knowledge have opened to you the Doors of the <hi>Academy.</hi> This is it which distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth you amongst the rest of Men, and which makes you to be admir'd amongst Great Divines, profound Philosophers, Poets and Orators of the first Order, and Historians that will Transmit it to Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Wonders of our Age.</p>
                  <p>When I see my self placed amongst these great Men, whom hence forward I shall call my Brethren, I feel my self ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by a Noble Emulation to follow their Examples which are now going to be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to me. My Assiduity in your As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, will be to me instead of Desert, and perhaps will give me some: I think I feel in my self the Spirit of the <hi>Academy,</hi> which raised me above my self, and that I need to repair the loss which you have sustained by my Admittance. It is He Great <hi>Sirs,</hi> whose place I fill that deserves your Regrets and our Praises.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely was he out of his Infancy, but he runs into Combats; and Glories, in the steps of his Ancestors. He was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Battle of <hi>Vaudrevange</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Dola,</hi> and more Dangerously at that of <hi>Graveline</hi>: And if for the future he seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth occasions every where, to make his Valour shine, the reason is, that this Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, this Ardour of Glory, which makes <hi>Herces,</hi> did fill his Soul so, that it being too great and lively to be contained, did shew it self outwardly.</p>
                  <p>Which of you, Sirs, hath not known the Elevation and Vigour of his Mind? At every moment he would give some strange Instances thereof. Governour of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, Duke and Peer, first Gentleman of the Chamber, notwithstanding which Charges, he yet found time for the Muses, and was honoured with the Title of <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Bounty of his heart engaged him to serve all the World: It was enough to be a Man of Wit, or miserable to have his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular protection; but that which alone would make his Elogy, he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies an Inviolable and Tender Deference to the Kings Person; this great Prince did honour him with his Benevolence.</p>
                  <p>So many Advantages that distinguished him in the first Court of the World, could not exempt him from the common Law; he is dead. But he hath left in <hi>France</hi> a Son, a worthy Heir of his great Soul and Vertues, who from his tenderest Youth in the midst of Court and War, of Favour and Pleasures, hath Consecrated all his moral Vertues by a Christian, singular, universally acknowledged and respected Piety.</p>
                  <p>To you it belongs, <hi>Sirs,</hi> to mark by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Tracts, the Actions of this Great Man, whose loss will be for a long time sensible unto you. You will do it: His Memory will for ever live in your Works: All that parts from your hands partakes of the Genius of your Founder.</p>
                  <p>If it hath been said in times past, that as <hi>Cesar</hi> by his Conquests had augmented the Empire of <hi>Rome; Cicero</hi> by his Eloquence had extended the Wit of the <hi>Romans</hi>: Can we not say, that <hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi> only hath done in <hi>France,</hi> what <hi>Cesar</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> had done at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that if by the Spring of our admirable Policy he hath extended our Frontiers; he hath Raised us, Polited, and if I may say it, Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our Wit by the Establishment of the <hi>Academy.</hi>

                  <p>But <hi>Sirs,</hi> if he hath done so much for the State, in forming, your Society, he hath still done more for himself. In vain for his Glory had he found the means to pull down the Haughtiness of this proud House, that dared to stand in Comparison with that of <hi>France</hi>; in vain by the taking of <hi>Rochel</hi> had he given the first blow to the Monster which even now hath expired before our Eyes: His name would still perish, and the most part of his Actions tho' marked with a singular Character of Grandeur, would have been unknown to the following Ages, if in founding the <hi>Academy,</hi> he had not founded at the same time the eternal Remembrance of his Glory.</p>
                  <p>At his death the <hi>Academy</hi> being at a loss found an <hi>Assylum</hi> in an Illustrious Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor whose Memory will be always dear unto you, and who in the space of 35 years, that he was the head of Justice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways passed for the most Learned of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestrates.</p>
                  <p>But when you had lost him, being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into new Allarms, uncertain of your Destinies, what a joy it is to you and what glory! A thing the greatest of Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth himself your Protector; receiveth

you into his Palace, and make you equal to the first Company of his Kingdom. By this, Gentlemen, by this I say, your Names becoming Immortal, will not be far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his, and you may answer unto your selves for the Immortality which you know how to give to others. You surely know how to give it, and you will give it to <hi>Lewis</hi>: There is a Commerce of Glory made betwixt you and this Prince; and if his Protection does you so much honour, you may flatter your selves of not being unprofitable in his Glory. Yes Gentlemen, this Prince so necessary to all men, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his own Subjects, which he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready rendred the most formidable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the World, and which he is going to make the most happy to his Allies, to whom he grants every where a Protection so powerful; to his very Enemies, whose happiness he causeth inspight of themselves, in forcing them to a peace; this Prince, who alter the example of God, whose Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Image he is, seems to stand in need of nothing but himself, stands in need of you for his Glory, and his Name how great soever it is, would scarcely pass to the last Posterity without your Works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> You have already apply'd your selves to it, and shewn him to the Eyes of Men equally great in Peace and War. But what is the Valour of the greatest <hi>Heroes</hi> being compared to the piety of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians? It reigns in this Glorious King, and always mindful of the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he oweth to him from whom he holdeth all, he continually thinks of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this God Reign in his Heart and in his Kingdom, who for so many years hath poured upon his Person such a continuation of Prosperities. Hath he not silenced those Wretches, who notwithstanding the natural Lights of the Soul, affect an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety at which they cannot arrive? Hath he not repressed this furious Blasphemy which is so audacious as even to attack God in his very Throne? He doth more, He burns with Zeal for the House of God: He spares neither Cares nor Expences to augment the Kingdom of of Jesus Christ; his Zeal goes over the Seas, and to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the Earth he seeks out People buried in the darkness of Idolatry; the first difficulties do not deterr him, he constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followeth a design that Heaven hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired him with, and if our Vows ase heard the Faith of the True God will be quickly Triumph antunder his Endeavours in the Kingdoms of the <hi>East.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What shall I further say? This Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Heroe</hi> openly engageth this formidable party of Heresie, which had caused the Kings his Predecessors to tremble; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats in less than a year what they durst not undertake for almost two Ages; and the Infernal Monster at the last gasp, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever re-enters into the Pit, whence the malice of <hi>Novators</hi> and the corrupted Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of our Fore-Fathers had caused it to come out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Happy <hi>France,</hi> thou shalt no more see thy Children rend thy Entrals! The same Religion will make them take the same Interest; and it is to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great, that thou owest so great a good: Let us speak more just, it is to God; and the same God, for to assure our Happiness, hath now preserved this Prince unto us, and given him to the Ardent Prayers of all <hi>Europe.</hi> For <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> The <hi>French</hi> are not the only People who do interest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in so dear a Health; and if some Princes jealous of the Kings Glory, have testified the same by vain projects of Leagues which they were willing to believe might profit the State, their very Subjects and all the People of <hi>Europe</hi> made sure Vows for him, knowing well that in his Person alone resides universal Tranquility.</p>
                  <p>But how far doth my Zeal carry me? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but just placed amongst you, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take what would make the greatest <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> tremble, and without consulting my Forces, I dare speak of a King, of whom to speak these only are permitted. As you <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and do it, after a manner wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE Eloquence, the Wit and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteness of the Thanks you give the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy,</hi> restores in you the loss of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Duke <hi>De St. Aignan</hi>: And I can tell you also, <hi>Sir,</hi> That it could not give you a more honourable Mark of the esteem it made of you, than in receiving you in the place of a Man of this Merit, whose Memory should always be honoured and cherished by it.</p>
                  <p>It's very just that the Dukes Letters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Love he had for them, and that by Eternal Marks of their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, they may shew that there is no Man, in any rank of Fortune whatever, to whom it is not an Honour to have loved them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monsieur</hi> the Duke of St. <hi>Aignan</hi> loved them with the same passion with which he loved Glory; and he had taken all necessary care to get what they adjudg'd to be most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and most agreeable. He was very far from the vain Error of those who i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that all Desert consists in the chance of being born of an Ancient House; and he considered the Advantage of having so many Illustrious Grand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yres, but as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible Obligation of augmenting the Luster of their Name by a personal Merit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="422" facs="tcp:103507:225"/>As soon as he could read our History he saw there with a Noble Emulation his Third Grand-Father, the Count of St. <hi>Aignan</hi> Governour of <hi>Berry,</hi> and chief of the Counsel of the Duke <hi>De Alenson.</hi> He presently resolved either to Dye in the Careir of Honour as the Count <hi>De St. Aignan</hi> his Father, or to advance farther in it than his third Grand-Father, as he has done in deserving the Esteem and Confidence of the King.</p>
                  <p>He judged that the best means of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at this height of Honour, was to joyn Letters with Arms, by an Alliance which is no less Natural than that of the Mind with the Heart; and seeing it self applyed to the service of a Prince, whose Heroick Vertues give more employment to Letters, than have done all the <hi>Heroes</hi> of Antiquity, he still took more affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them. He acquired to himself the manner of speaking and writing what was Noble, Easie, Eloquent, and made <hi>France,</hi> see, the Roman Urbanity, which was the Character of the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s and most Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twas after the example of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors of Nations, who returning from their Campagnes loaden with the Spoils of their Enemies, he came to study with <hi>Terence,</hi> and know as well how to manage the Intreagues of a Scene, as the Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems of War: It was, I say, after their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, that Monsieur the Duke <hi>De St. Aignan</hi> had so often manifested, that a Lieutenant General of Arms to the King, might be a Poet, an Orator, and an His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian; that whilst he himself undertook the Noblest Actions, he knew besides how to praise them in others; and that with this same Heart which seeks but to sacrifice it self to the service of the King, he every day produced Sentiments, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed after the most delicate and most eloquent manner.</p>
                  <p>By these Qualities truly <hi>Academical</hi> he obtained in this Society the place that he hath so worthily discharged, and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so deserved to be Named Protector of an Illustrious <hi>Academy,</hi> which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into our Alliance; which is an immortal Honour to him, and so much the greater in that the King is willing to bear a like Title, and to add to those which his Vertues and Conquests have acquired him.</p>
                  <p>But Monsieur the Duke of St. <hi>Aignan</hi> was not only Protector of a famous <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy</hi> by a particular Title; but also it may be said, that he was so in general of all <hi>Men of Letters,</hi> by a Generosity which excepted no bodies Desert, whatever stranger he was, what part soever he came from, he was sure to find in him a Prop and Protection. He received with marks of Friendship all those that had some Talent of Mind, and he did let them feel his Rank and Dignity by the good Offices that he took Delight in heaping upon them. He also loved all our Exercises, and came to us much oftner than we dared to hope from a Person who could not come to us without quitting all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Court.</p>
                  <p>Methinks I yet see him in that fair Day, when assembled to testifie our joy for the Establishment of the King. Then was Read a Magnificent <hi>Ode</hi> which he had made upon that Subject, where Wit and Zeal equally appeared, and shined through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with the Fire of the most lively Brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which he hath always preserved by a priviledge which Nature only grants to extraordinary Genius's.</p>
                  <p>Finally, After a long and happy Life, he dyed in all the Sentiments of Christian Piety, loaden with Honours and Rewards, which his Courage, his Zeal and Fidelity in the Kings Service had deserved; and he had in dying, the Consolation of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind him a Son which will still aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this Succession of Glory and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                  <p>This Illustrious Son, in whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lives, hath always distinguished him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with Honour, and without Affectation. A great deal of Courage hath always been seen in him, with a great deal of Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and admirable Purity of Manners, a perfect uniformity of Conduct, penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Judgment, Application, Vigilance, constant Love for Truth and for Justice; chiefly a solid Piety, which makes him act secretly in the eyes God alone, as if he were seen of all Men.</p>
                  <p>So many Vertues have well deserved that in an Age so little advanced, he is made Chief of the Counsel of <hi>Finances</hi>; and justifies each day so good a choice, and shews that the King is a just Dispenser of his Favours, and has the Supream Gift of discerning Minds. Happy is he whose Memory we Honour, to have so worthy an Heir of his Name and Vertues.</p>
                  <p>And we should not be less happy to give him a Successor among us; tho' having chosen you Sir, to repair so great a loss we hope you will publickly a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Academy</hi> asketh nothing of you for it self, that you are not obliged to do for your self. You owe it to the Reputation you have acquired by your Works; you owe it to the Blood you derive from the Grand-Chancellor of the Hospital, your Third Grand-Father; more Illustrious still by his Excellent Writings, than the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of the First Employment of the Kingdom; you owe it, in fine, to your Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Mother which may be compared to the <hi>Cornelia</hi>'s, who speaks her Tongue with so much Grace and Purity, and who having made you receive such Eloquence from her Breast, hath given us occasion to believe that you were born for the <hi>Academy,</hi> and that you were Educated for it, in the Arms and Lap of the <hi>Muses</hi> themselves.</p>
                  <p>But what Talent soever you may have for Eloquence, the New Obligation that
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:103507:225"/>
you have to Consecrate your Studies to the Glory of <hi>Lewis the Great,</hi> our August Protector, will make you more and more feel how difficult it is to speak worthily of a Prince, whose Life is a contiual Series of Prodigies.</p>
                  <p>Poets complain they have not Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons enough to Represent the Marvelous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Exploits, and Historians on the contrary that they have not Simplicity enough to keep so many Marvels from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supposed so many Fictions. What Art, what Application, what Conduct must not one have to present a probability of the great things which he hath done?</p>
                  <p>I speak not of his Astonishing Valour, who hath taken as it were in running a Race, the strongest Cities of the World, and from before which the most numerous Armies have always fled for fear of a Fight. I think now only on this Glorious Peace which we enjoy, and which was made in a time, when there were on every side, nothing but Provocations by our Victories, nothing but the <hi>States</hi> declaring themselves Enemies to our Interest, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Princes</hi> jealous of our Advantages, all with different and incompatible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. How then appeared on a sudden this happy Peace? It is a Miracle of the Wisdom of <hi>Lewis the Great,</hi> that Policy cannot comprehend: And as he alone was able to give it to all <hi>Europe,</hi> he alone also is able to keep it.</p>
                  <p>How much of Action, of Insights into matters of Provision is there in him to cause that so many free States, and whose Interests are so contrary, should submit to the terms that he hath prescribed unto them? We must equally see what is past and what is to come, as well as what is, to have a Genius of an extraordinary force and extent which no Affair burthens, that no Object deceiveth, which no Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty stoppeth; such in fine, as is the Genius of <hi>Lewis the Great,</hi> which is dispersed thro' all the parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded therein, acting both without and within, with an unconceivable power.</p>
                  <p>It is as far as the utmost Bounds of the Earth, that you have heard of so many holy Missions maintain'd by the continual Aid of his Power and Piety.</p>
                  <p>It is in Foreign Courts, where it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts and enlightens their Ministers, that we only need to Read and Hear, what his Prudence hath Dictated.</p>
                  <p>It is in the Frontiers of the Kingdom where he Fortifies after such a manner, unravels our Enemies Designs, and makes 'em all despair.</p>
                  <p>It is at the Ports, where he builds those Prodigious Vessels which carry through all the World the Glory of the <hi>French</hi> Name.</p>
                  <p>It is in the <hi>Academy of War</hi> and <hi>Sea-Affairs,</hi> where Noble Education joyned with the Nobleness of Blood, produces Wit and Courage equally capable of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Execution in the greatest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises.</p>
                  <p>It is, in fine, every where, and causeth that every thing is ruled as it should be: The Garisons always Crowded, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazins always full, the Arsenals always guarded, the Troops always in breath, and after the Travels of War are now bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied in Magnificent Works which are the Fruits of Peace. Thus it is that this great Prince acting at the same time on all sides, and doing things which continually inspire Terror to his Enemies, Love to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and Admiration to all the World, can in spight of Hatred, Jealousies and Mistrusts, preserve the Peace which he has made, because there is no State which seeth not how dangerous it would be to break it.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Princes of the <hi>Empire</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have some Thoughts, and begun to form new Leagues: But the King always equally Just and Wife, not willing to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise nor be surprised, sent the Emperour word, that if in two days after the date of his Declaration, he received not positive Assurances from him of the Observation of the Truce, he would take the Measures which he thought necessary for the good of his State. His Troops at the same time Fly on the Borders of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Emperour gives him all the Assurances which he could desire. Thus <hi>Europe</hi> oweth him a second time, the Rest and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which it enjoyeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Spain</hi> on the other hand had done an Injustice to our Merchants, and constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to pay a violent Tax under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence they Negotiated in the <hi>Indies</hi> against the <hi>Ordinances.</hi> The King suddenly to stop these beginnings of Division, thought fit to send before <hi>Cadiz</hi> a Fleet Capable of Subduing all the <hi>Indies.</hi> Immediately <hi>Spain</hi> Allarmed, promised to restore what it had taken away, and the King who was contented therewith, hath appeared still more great by his Moderation than his Power: For it is true, that there is nothing upon Earth is so taking as to see a Prince, who being able to do all that he pleases, will do nothing but what is Just.</p>
                  <p>But it is the Natural Character of <hi>Lewis the Great,</hi> It is the bottom of this Heroick Soul; where all Vertues are pure, sincere solid, true, and make up one, an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Union, which declares that he is not only the greatest of all Kings, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the most Accomplish'd of all Men.</p>
                  <p>Those that shall Read these two Speeches may easily observe in them, all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singness that Politeness and a great Study could give. Some after having compared them, have made a Judgment equal to that which <hi>Belzac</hi> did in Times past of the Famous Sonnet of <hi>Urania.</hi> He blamed not the Eight first Verses thereof, but he found that all the Nobility and the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur was behind them; and he added, that they made him laugh in calling into his Memory the <hi>Pageants of Italy, where Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Precede their Masters.</hi> We should value the Speech of Mr. <hi>Abbot de Choisy</hi> at
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:103507:226"/>
too low a rate, if we judged with so little favour on't. It not only hath the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by Right of Age, but also may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute a Preheminence amongst his other celebrated Works. What Mr. <hi>Bergeret</hi> hath said of the King, that <hi>so many holy Mission's are maintained by the continual Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of his Power and Piety</hi>: It's doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether the Consequence drawn from thence can be admitted; it is certain (say they) that there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ancient and new Christianity. The ancient one maintained it self by it self, and the sole force of Truth served for a Prop and Recommendation to the first Christians: But at this day things have changed Face, and Catholick Truths are not so easie to be perswaded as when a great Monarch makes use of his whole Authority, without which, this great number of Missions, made within and without the Kingdom, would have little or no effect.</p>

His Majesty presently gave his order for this Project: I am assured that some days past there were brought to <hi>Paris</hi> 300 Volumns of these Books of <hi>China</hi>; some being of the Civil, and some the Natural History of that Country, others of Mathematicks, and divers curious Treatises: That besides there are two Translators come, one a Jesuit, who has been 30 Years in <hi>China</hi>; the other a <hi>Chinois,</hi> who belonged to the last Embassage, and understands <hi>French, Latin, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Portuguese, &amp;c.</hi> That these will translate these Books out of hand, beginning with the most curious, and will publish them as soon as they are fit for the Press. Since it is known that the King of <hi>China</hi> takes delight in the Jesuits, there are Eight young Jesuits sent thither, who receive a Pension from their King, and are to learn that Country Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and to instruct the <hi>Chinois</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> that they may be brought into <hi>France,</hi> to go on with the Translation.

                  <p>I shall say somewhat of this little Book; and first observe that the Pope not being able by all the means he used to oblige the Women to cover their Breasts and Arms; and understanding that the fear that all <hi>Italy</hi> was in when the <hi>Turks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged <hi>Vienna,</hi> did not hinder this disorder, he had recourse to his last shift, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which he published by a Decree the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 83. <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all Women and Girls to cover their Shoulders and Breasts to the Neck, and their Arms to their Hands, and this with no Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent, but thick Cloth,</hi> under pain, if they did not exactly obey it within six days, to be excommunicated <hi>Ipso facto,</hi> that in no other case but at the Point of Death, none but the <hi>Pope</hi> himself should absolve them: For it was declared, <hi>That the Confessors that durst presume to absolve from this Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, should incur it themselves, and should become subject to what Temporal and Spiritual punishments the Pope would be pleas'd to lay on them, to which Temporal punishments, also the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Husbands, Masters, or other heads of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies should be subject, that continued at, or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Wives, Daughters or Maids, to disobey this Ordinance.</hi> This is all there at length, with two Letters which relate to it; one was writ through the Pope's Order, by the Procurer general of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> to all the Provincials of his Order, to oblige their Preachers and Confessors, to endeavour more than ordinarily against the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Manners, and chiefly in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Women, to strive to bring them off their Dresses that are too Luxurious, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest.</hi> The other Letter is that of Mr.

                     <hi>Stravius,</hi> Administrator of the Nuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Low-Countries, which he writ to the Bishops the 31<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 35. by order from <hi>Urban</hi> the VIII. to put them in mind of proceeding against worldly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>who uncovered their Breasts and Shoulders, and cover'd their Faces with Patches</hi>; And to proceed against them to the very shutting them out of the Church, if it could be done. This shews that for a long time they have taken pains to remedy these Nakednesses, and that they are obstinately resisted therein. This in all likelyhood will be an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that will never be wanting to the Preachers of Reformation. All these pieces which I have quoted, come after the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Nuns; the Clergy-man that writes it to them, directs it only to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Mothers.</hi> He represents to them to the Life, the extent of that disorder, which <hi>Innocent</hi> the XI. punished with so much severity. He adds, that its their business chiefly to endeavour this Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as well because the Publick trusts them with the Education of their young Daughters, as that it is easie for them to instruct 'em in <hi>all that is modest</hi> in such a tender age, wherein they have all the Bashfulness and Tractableness of their Sex. He tells them, that in the best go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd Monasteries, <hi>It happens but too often that for want of applying themselves sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to express the first motions of Youthful Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and forward of giving them an aversion to ill Books, and immodest sights, for too ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der friendships, and the too great love of their Bodies, and for the Inclination of shewing such parts as Modesty and Decency require to be covered with the greatest care and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: These young Scholars have their Hearts full of the World and its desires, and with a great impatience of having the full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all the pleasures and liberties that they think their Cloysters kept them from, or the vigilance of their Mistresses.</hi> Experience is a very strong Proof of this, and all the World acknowledge it; whether it really proceeds from what he pretends here, that the first Progress of corruption is not repressed with viligance and care enough, or whether it be that Nature is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing than all the dexterous endeavours of Art. Nature is an inward Master, whose Precepts lead a young Disciple very far, without the assistance of any one, though his Precepts be exposed by contrary ones; Then what cannot this Nature do, when it is assisted by the Dictates of an outward Master, who passionately Caresses, and cajoles a young Pensioner but lately come from a Convent? 'Tis said, he does more in an hour, than the <hi>Reverend Mothers</hi> in a 1000; and in 2 or 3 times head to head; he blots out all their Repetitions. Here is what one may do that works upon Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter naturally well prepared. This does not hinder Peoples getting their Children brought up at Convents, for it is thought the evil would be the more universal, if they were not armed with this defence before they imbarked in the World. And moreover, it is thought Family Examples should not be suffered to their knowledge.</p>
                  <p>This Author shews a great Zeal for the Education of Young Women; he would have them to be made to comprehend well, that it is but in vain, that they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themselves with having a Chaste Heart, or a love for Purity, either in the Cloyster, or in the World, if they do not love these things in others, as well as in themselves; and to convince themselves of this Love they ought to keep from all that may lessen it in their own Hearts, or in their Neighbours, and always forbid themselves the use of these ill Fashions, which by Violence, and open force made passage for desires, and designs opposite to Chastity into the best disposed Hearts. He proceeds, and says, that it is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to cover what might give scandal to our Neighbour, and hurt Chastity, but they are to cover it modestly, and they must be learned; that very often these worldly Ornaments, and these cheating Vails that cover without hiding, serve only to irritate and multiply in a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand different ways, the desires and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a corrupted Heart; and it is for this, that the Pope's Edict has in express terms enjoyn'd them, <hi>They shall cover themselves with a thick, and not with a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent Cloath</hi>: This takes away all Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation which might be made use of to cheat the Governours Vigilance. For though according to remark of a certain <note n="*" place="margin">

He does not quote the Fathers, which he might many on the same occasions: He suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that those he speaks to, have no need of proofs for what he says. It must be allowed, that the principles of this Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are agreeable to Christianity; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, there are many Casuists who have pardoned Nakedness on many accounts, which the famous <hi>Voetius</hi> reproaches them with in the 4th. Volume of his <hi>Disputes,</hi> p. 461. where he takes notice, that he knew but one Divine of this Communion, which was <hi>Alstedius,</hi> who has said, that a Woman might go naked, or covered with slight Gause, in the Countreys where it is the custom to go so. This Clause serves to excusest the Casuists, because it is certain that Nakedness loses the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of its Allurement by custom.

                  <p>As for the rest, This Stranger that gave me the account of the publishing this Book for the <hi>Nuns,</hi> was the occasion that I made an Article of it in my Novels, he also was the cause of my speaking of the <hi>Factum</hi> of the <hi>Iansenists</hi>: For it was thro him that I understood it was published. Both these advices came to me at the same time, from the same place, and with Glosses that have not been found true; perhaps People may be willing enough that I should add at the end of this Article, the present condition of the <hi>Iansenists</hi> Process.</p>
                  <p>I say then, that they published a Second <hi>Factum,</hi> wherein they declared, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the advice of some godly Persons they were willing to end the debate some mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er way than by a rigorous Judgment; that for this end they Declared to Mr. <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> presenting him a Form of Retractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be sent to Father <hi>Hazart, That they were ready to desist from all Pursuits.</hi> If that Father and Mr. <hi>Hoesslaegh</hi> Signed this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del and Published it afterwards, its at length here accompanyed with the 19<hi>th.</hi> Decree of the 12 General Congregation of <hi>Iesuits,</hi> because it might engage Father <hi>Hazards Superiours to bring him more Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciously, to which he could not refuse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out renouncing his hopes of safety. This Decree speaks in most express Terms how the Superiours of the</hi> Jesuits <hi>are obliged to impose rigourous Penance on those of their Society who offend their Neighbour, through the indiscretion of their Pen, and must make them presently lawful satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>; Mr. <hi>Internance</hi> has promised to send the Model to Father <hi>Hazard,</hi> and has Named Judges, which makes some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is nothing to be hoped for from the expedient, that the Plantiffs have offered. This is the more manifest by two Letters, that this Jesuit has writ to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Quality, that he is not inclin'd to do what is propos'd to him.</p>
                  <p>The first of these Letters contains a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sharp Invective against the <hi>Iansenists,</hi> and a promise to answer in writing the complaints of the Plantiffs.</p>
                  <p>The Second shews, that Father <hi>Hazard</hi> will make no answer at all, both because the Judgment of many Lawyers and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines determined it beneath him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he sees his Adversaries abhorred by the Catholicks, and even refuted by the Hereticks; to prove which he alledges what we said of the <hi>First Factum,</hi> and makes Observations thereon, which are not so just as those that are made here of his two Letters; the two Articles of our <hi>Nouvelles,</hi> which concern the <hi>First Factum,</hi> are inserted in these <hi>Factums,</hi> and may be well enough understood by the Reader, without our Commentary.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Father Hazard</hi> imitated <hi>M. Arnaud,</hi> he would fairly have shewn the model of Retractation, which was propos'd to him; for Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> understanding that Mr. <hi>Southwell,</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Protestant, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained how unjustly he had been dealt with in the Apology of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Tryal, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently offered him any fitting satisfaction; and as soon as he had seen the proofs of Mr. <hi>Southwell</hi>'s Innocency, he writ to him in the most honest and obliging way in the World, for the reparation of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and that the matter might become publick, he desired one of his Friends to print all that passed in clearing this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It was done according to his Wishes; since a second addition has been Printed, for the first part of the Apology of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> in which addition are the Letters about M. <hi>Arnaud</hi> writ upon this Subject, those which M. <hi>Southwell</hi> has answered, and what justifies the innocence of this last.

At <hi>Francfort</hi> and <hi>Lipsia,</hi> at the Costs of <hi>Henry Greut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius, 1686,</hi> in <hi>4</hi>to.</head>
                  <p>THE first of the two Treatises that is given us here, was made by one of the Magistrates of <hi>Bonn</hi> in the Country of <hi>Cologne,</hi> to justifie the Practice of some Judges of <hi>Germany,</hi> who for a long time make use of the proof of Water, when they have a mind to try if a Woman is a Witch. All her Cloaths are taken off, her right Hand is tied to her left Foot, and the left Hand with the right Foot; then she is cast into Water, and if she doth not sink under water she is believed guilty, and is burned. Great Wits which examine but by halves what they deny, are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with this Objection, they say, that they are all <hi>Chimeras,</hi> and that there must be no belief given to such Stories: but those that penetrate into things with an extream exactness before they affirm or deny them, are incomparably more irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute upon a fact so strange as this; on the one hand they have difficulty to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend why this proof availeth 'not but in certain places, and why if it be certain, all the Tribunals of the World do not make use of it when they have occasion. Besides, their knowing that the proof of a hot Iron, that of boyling Water, and some others made use of in times past in divers places to discover where the unjustice or justice of an accusation subsists, and that they have been condemned by the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause without doubt they perceived there was illusion in all this, and that Knaveries were intermixed, which often times did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Innocence, and justified Criminals. However it is, our Author pretends that this Tryal of Witches is lawful. His name is <hi>Rickius,</hi> and speaks very bad Latine. Perhaps he was a better Citizen than a Wit.</p>
                  <p>He at first proposeth to himself a great number of Objections which usually are made against the practice he maintaineth, and which are for the most part weakness it self. The best of all is, that God must not be tempted, and that this is to tempt him, to commit the decision of a Process to a most Signal Miracle of his Providence. But this Objection would not be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if we were assured that the proof whereof we speak hath never fail'd; for we should have reason to believe in that case, God hath established the immersion of People Confederate with the Devil, as an occasional cause of the discovery of this Plot, in engaging himself to hinder the natural effect of heaviness. An Experience constantly reiterated would be a revelation significative enough of this Institution of God, so that without tempting him we might have recourse to it when it would be necessary. There are an hundred ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in Scripture which shew that God hath not disapproved that Signs should be required of him and Prodigies, to be well assured of a matter, and we must hold as undoubtful, that the Church would never have condemned the proofs of <hi>Hot iron,</hi> if they had not strong Reasons of doubting that they were a good Warrant of Justice or Unjustice. The Objection that is founded upon the Supposition that it is the Devil who holds Witches Suspended upon the Surface of the Water, is miserable, for it is against all the light of a good Reason, that the Devil should employ his Forces to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray Creatures which are the most devoted unto him, and to make Judges Triumph over his Subjects who have a Design to send them into the fire. It is, say they, because God forceth there Proud Spirits to Act against their proper interest: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, they say this without forming a distinct Idea of the manner wherewith these Spirits may be forced to produce cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Actions; Who seeth but a constraint of this nature ought not to hinder Magistrates to verifie by the Experience of Water if a Woman be a Witch, seeing that whether God Acteth therein by his immediate Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or forces the Devils to work this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digie, it is still his wise and admirable Providence which would make use of this means to teach Judges what they know not? These Two Objections, which are the best of all, being ruined, it seems that the only means to refute this practice is to make the foundation of these Proofs sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of falshood; but as the Author strives only against those that agree with him in the fact, there is nothing to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that side.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="428" facs="tcp:103507:228"/>We must do him this justice that he is not of those who have precipitately recourse to the Essay of Immersion; he will have men recourse to it but upon very probable <hi>Indices</hi> of Sorcerie; and he gives thereupon very good Counsels to the Judges, chiefly exhorting them to take heed that the Hangman acquit himself faithfully of his duty, for without it there would happen great abuses in this matter, because the persons which are cast into the water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sometimes very innocent, do not swim, and then the Hangman ought to be active to draw them out, for fear they should be drowned. But if he is too hasty he may save the guilty, because there are Witches which being immediately descended a little under water, would soon come up again of themselves, and would manifest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their crime, whilest they pass for inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent if the Hangman doth not give them time to come up again. It may also be that a Woman which weigheth not much, may have motions which swell up some Muscels to form a perfect <hi>Equilibrium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her weight and that of the water. The Emotion and Tonick movement of the Muscels would perhaps soon cease, and then this Woman would sink and would justifie herself. But if she be judged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the effect of the <hi>Equilibrium</hi> where she is in at the first Moment, she is lost with all her Innocence. There are then many things to be observed, and apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is one of the best difficulties that may be made against this proof. The Author hath heard say, that there are certain Countries where the Women who are sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of Witchcraft, are weighed in a Ballance, and saith, they have experienced that Witches of the greatest and thickest Stature weigh no more than about 15 pounds.</p>
                  <p>He brings several proofs of his sentiment which are good enough, considering the quality of the matter. This is not the less convincing that the Judges must not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused this Essay of the Immersion, seeing it is so difficult to assure themselves of the truth by the Testimony of the Accomplices; for saith he, a Witch that accuseth another, Grounds very often but upon that She ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth to have seen her at the Caterwaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or meeting of Witches. And what as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance can one take upon such imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which might have been deluded by the evil Spirit, as the Author shews in the fourth Chapter? Besides, it being known by the Deposition of several of these Wretches, that Witches of quality walk nor dance at that Assignation but in a mask, whence it followeth, that they are known but by their Mien, and Stature; and other signs very suspicious. A strange thing is that in the Books of <hi>Pagans</hi> where so much is spoken of Witchcrafts, no Women are found which are thought to go to the Assignation. Is not it because the Devil changes customs and manners according to the diversity of times and places? The Author answers very largely to the objections of his Adversaries; but sometimes he saith things which have not the least solidity, as when he supposes that the Water of all the Elements is subject to the Devils power, and where uncertain facts may be best discovered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Exorcisms and Consecrations whereof Water is commonly the Subject in the Administration of Baptism. He finisheth his Book with a very devout O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which he believes the Judges ought to make to God before they make use of the Proof.</p>
                  <p>The Author of the Treatises is called <hi>Herman Neuwalds</hi>; he refutes a Letter which is seen here, and which was written at <hi>Langow</hi> in the County of <hi>Lippa</hi> the 4<hi>th. October</hi> 1583, by <hi>Adolphus Scribanius,</hi> who assures, that a few days before he had seen Women accused of Witchcraft cast three times into the Water in presence of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of People, which sunk no more than a bit of Wood. He cites divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors which have spoken of this proof, and after having expounded this <hi>Phenomen,</hi> in supposing that as soon as a person makes agreement with the Devil, he is so posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with him, that he contracts a great lightness by the habitation of a Being so light and volatil, as he concludes he is, that the use of this proof is very lawful.</p>
                  <p>The Treatise which refutes this Letter is curious enough: many things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated there touching the Origin, Practice and Abrogation of the proofs by a hot Iron, by cold Water, hot Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In it also are related several Traditions of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People which regard the mark of Wizards, the Feast of <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>It were to be desired that now there are great Philosophers in the World, some one would give a good Treatise upon Witchcrafts. It's supposed as a constant Principle that as soon as Wizards and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians have been seized by the Authority of Justice, the Devil cannot do the least thing for their deliverance, and yet in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasions he makes a hundred Actions more difficult than the breaking open a door. They are constrained to admit of a hundred other silly qualities. Men should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly reason upon all this: And seeing this Age is the true time of <hi>Systems,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should be found out touching the Commerce which may be betwixt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Man. There is no Philosophy more proper for that than that of Mr. <hi>Descartes,</hi> chiefly because men have so well disputed on the occasional causes. It seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:103507:228"/>
that hitherto the question of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts hath only been treated by Judgments either too incredulous or too credulous. Both of 'em are very unfit to succeed in this, since they are commonly guilty of the same defect, which is, to determine or deny, or to believe without searching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to things. There never were People more bold to deny Extraordinary Facts than the wretched <hi>Spinozists.</hi> Yet they are very ill grounded, seeing there is scarcely any thing whereof their Hypotheses do not engage them to hold the Possibility. I do nevertheless grant that the Discovery which is made from time to time of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sorts of Knaveries, is for them as well as for others a Reason of uncertainty. There hath of late hapned an Accident at <hi>Campen,</hi> in the <hi>Over-Issels,</hi> which will not be unacceptable to give an Account of here.</p>
                  <p>It is that in the Month of <hi>December</hi> 1685, a Boy of 13 Years shewed by great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torsions of Body and Sinews that he was fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously Tormented. They even would say, that he emitted Nails, Needles and Pins by Urine, and all that was shewn in a Glass wherein he had Piss'd in presence of those which kept him. He accused a Woman which had given him a Root to have bewitched him: Several believed it, and being moved for him, with a great Compassion Recommended him to God by Ardent Prayers. Others not believing that in this there was reason enough to accuse the Woman of Witchcraft, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned notwithstanding that the Devil did put these strange Bodies into the Glass where the Boy pissed. Notwithstanding the People were so moved that if the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Magistrates had not interven'd this Woman had been in great danger. In fine, they ceased to say that this Boy emitted Pins, at any other time but only towards the end of the Month of <hi>Ianuary</hi>; he bethought himself of another thing, which was to cast Stools and vomit Hairs, bits of Scales, and other things of this kind. The Wisest, who were far from thinking that there was any Magick in it, concluded it to be a pure Artifice, and the Magistrate applied himself so well to find it out, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Threatning this Boy, sometimes in making him promises; at last he declared that his Father and Mother-in-Law had made him learn all this Play of a Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond Woman who asked but 100 pence for such a secret: He gave the Magistrates the Spectacle of his Vomits, of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, and of the Activity with which he would make Pins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fall in the Glass which he was to piss in. His Father and Mother in Law, which had a Reputation of Piety, were brought before the Judges; but because there was not found where withal to convince 'em that they were Partners in the fraud, and that the Boy had declared he had unjustly accused them, they were absolved, and the Son was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be whipt by his Father.</p>
                  <p>This Accident puts me in mind of one which is related in the <hi>Iournal of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; of the 11<hi>th. September</hi> 1682. They were some young Women that were of the Neighbourhood of <hi>Thoulouse</hi> which vomited Pins and Ribbands, and that suffered other Accidents so singular that they were taken to be possessed, and they were endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be cured by Exorcisms: But the able <hi>Physicians</hi> which the Parliament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to observe well the matter, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these <hi>Phenomens</hi> might be expounded by Principles purely Natural; and they were not a little confirmed in this opinion, when they observed that feigned Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms produced upon these Persons the effects as the true ones. The difference that is betwixt them and the little <hi>Boy</hi> at <hi>Campen,</hi> is, that the latter did thro' Malice what the first did by a Hypocondriack Malady.</p>
                  <p>He that Inform'd us of the Affair of the little <hi>Boy</hi> is an Advocate of <hi>Zceol,</hi> Named Mr. <hi>Nuis,</hi> who hath published in <hi>Dutch</hi> a very considerable Treatise of <hi>Geometry.</hi> He Entituleth it, <hi>Gebruyk Uan Het Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctangulum Catholicum Geometrico-Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Te Zwolle,</hi> by <hi>Gerard Tide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> 1686, in 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He also speaks of <hi>Trigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nometry</hi> of Draughts, and of the use of this Instrument to measure the Visual Angles, Height, Draughts and Distances. In the Second he Treats of Solar Dyals, and gives a new general Method to Trace the Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Circles, the Azimuths, the Almucan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taraths, the Signs of the Zodiack, upon all sorts of Surfaces, and that in Three manners, one by Rule and Compass, and the Two others by this new Instrument. Besides its probableness, here is shewn how to find the Declination, Inclination and the Reclination of Draughts. All this is maintained by Mathematical Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Third speaks of Spherick Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonometry, and of the Astronomical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems which are thereby resolved, and of the Construction of an Universal Clock comprehended in this Instrument, and fit to find the Hours and Azymuths by the Sun and Principal Stars in all places of the World where the Elevation of the <hi>Pole</hi> passeth not the 65 Degree.

Mr. <hi>Matthews</hi> was not discouraged at these displeasing Obstacles, he has turned over with a deal of Patience, the old <hi>Pancreas</hi> and <hi>Archives,</hi> and has drawn from thence a great many Memoirs and curious Pieces, which have not been as yet Published, and which serve as a light to several dark Places of History. He endeavours most to clear what concerns the Town of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> his own Country. He Explains the Form of its Government, its Rights, the Authority of it's Bishops, and Vicissitudes of all that past in them. He likewise applies himself very particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the History of the Province of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and shews the <hi>Epoch</hi> of these Courts which is generally given. He clears by the by several things concerning the History of other Nations, that of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and in particular that of the <hi>Franches,</hi> and makes many learned Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon all the Dignities mentioned in his Title, so that its a very useful Work. The Church was always so embodyed in the World, the Disorders of which he sheweth, that the Author cannot get for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward without falling foul on all sides, so that the Reader may expect in this great Volume a long account of what concerns the Clergy. He finds there Fryars and Canons of all Sects and Kinds, Convents where the Religious and Religiouses liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together; I do not say in the same Cell, but under the same Roof and in the same Apartment. The World Naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the Chastity of Cloisters, hath given occasion to think very oddly thereon, and it was to take away that Scandal that the Civil and Canon Laws have forbidden both Sexes to live in the same Convent. Nevertheless Mr. <hi>Matthews</hi> Reports that St. <hi>Briget</hi> founded several of this Nature, and that <hi>Gilbert</hi> of <hi>Semplingham</hi> founded a great many by Advice of St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other Authors he quotes the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of <hi>Montserain,</hi> which saith, that in the Year 1223, because they would send a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad many of the Convent Sisters, many glossed thereupon, that the time of their Lying In drew near. <hi>Consueto Laicis more loquentes dicebant Moniales illas à Monachis stupratas esse quibus jam pariendi tempus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staret.</hi> He quotes a Poet named <hi>Nigellus,</hi> who said that the Mother <hi>Abbess</hi> very well deserved that name by her Marvelous Fertility.</p>

                  <p>As he is a Satyrical Poet it would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill done to believe this upon his bare saying. It is generally believed that St. <hi>Willibrord</hi> was the first Preacher of the Gospel amongst the <hi>Frizons.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Matthews</hi> shews that St. <hi>Eloy</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> had Instructed these <hi>Barbarians.</hi> It is true, that the greatest part of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions was reserved for those that came after them; for St. <hi>Wilfride,</hi> St. <hi>Willibrord,</hi> St. <hi>Vulfran, &amp;c.</hi> had a great hand in them and so had <hi>Pepins</hi> Troops, and them of <hi>Charles Marlet</hi> his Son: For Mr. <hi>Cordunoy</hi> acknowledgeth in his History of <hi>France,</hi> that tho' the <hi>Frizons</hi> suffered <hi>Wilbrord</hi> to speak to them of the Christian Religion, <hi>Pepin</hi> could not trust to that, because most of them left off the worship of their Gods only by force. A little after he saith, they Revolted, and <hi>Charles Martel</hi> having Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished them, beat down their Idols and Temples, and cut down the Forests which they thought Sacred, and caused all them to be killed which would not submit. It was a good time in those Countries for those which converted. Mr. <hi>Matthews</hi> quotes <hi>William Malmesbury,</hi> who saith, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> and the <hi>Frizons</hi> were Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the pressing care of <hi>Martel,</hi> who threatned one, and promised a recompense to the other. If it were <hi>Charles Magne,</hi> St. <hi>Willibrord</hi> would not have received any profit, for he did not live so long; but under <hi>Charles Martel</hi> St. <hi>Willibrord</hi> and St. <hi>Boniface</hi> might have passed for Famous Converters, at the Expence of the manner of doing, and of their Masters Purse.</p>

it requisite to remark them. Indeed these general reflections are not unprofitable, provided we do not exceed those bounds. For as soon as we come to particulars, we may chance to give for Maxims, contested things, and so force, or spoil the Genius of a young Man, instead of perfecting him. This is what those who shall read the Books, which we are going to speak of, may easily observe, and which we shall endeavour to make here as plain as we can.</p>
                  <p>The Author of the work, whose Title we have set down, is a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Preacher, who has thought convenient to remain Nameless, apparently for the same Reason, which hath hindred him a long while from Publishing these Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Art of Preaching</hi>; the reason was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saw every day so much Jealousie amongst Persons of the same imploy: <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Every Orator has par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular turns and methods, which seem good to him only. That leaves always some suspicion, that he blames unjustly in others what agreeth not with his particular Genius.</hi> He hath divided his work into Four Books, which are as so many Conversations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he Treats after a particular manner, (and which have no Taste of the Style of Schools) of the principal qualities neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for a Preacher.</p>
                  <p>The first Book concerns the Studies which a Christian Orator ought to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute. Herein is maintained, that he ought to read the Precepts of the Heathens, and that they are necessary to attain Christian Eloquence.</p>

That <hi>Logick</hi> is not less necessary, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided thereby is understood the Art of Reasoning well, to discern what is true from what is false, the certain from the doubtful, and that which is evident from what is probable; because this <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p n="3">3. In regard to <hi>Physick,</hi> he thinks that that Part only which regards Man, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to be known, because he ought to be acquainted with all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Dispositions of the Mind, and all the general and particular Truths, which make him more able and ready to say, this is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> true.</p>

But he answers him, that true <hi>Scholastick Divinity</hi> is nothing else than the Doctrin of the Church, Examined and Established according to the solid Rules of true <hi>Logick,</hi> which teach how to define, divide, and reason exactly. The <hi>Abbot</hi> having replyed, that if so, Men have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obligation to the Master of Sentences, nor to his Commentators, than for having made the Science of the Church <hi>Scholastick</hi>; or filling it with an infinite deal of unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and Chymical Questions, and of having given it a very Barbarous Style: the Author replies, That we must distinguish what this method hath in it Essential in it self, from the defect which the misfortune of Times, and imprudence of several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors have suffered to slip into it. 2. That the only Design of these Authors was to include, in one body of Doctrin, all the vast Science of the Church, which was confusedly disposed in Scripture and in the Ancient Fathers, without any natural Order, and to Reduce all the Truths, which God hath Revealed to us, to certain principal Heads, which comprise them all, and give them an Order, founded upon the nature of things, or upon the Subject. 3. That before this Reduction, this Study did extreamly displease the Mind, not only by its length, but also by the confusion of matters. That according to the opinion of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> Men put themselves into great danger of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church approves not that Men should indifferently read Scripture. 5. That there are a great many Errors in the Works of the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> which they advanced with a good intention; but that they have been since condemned. That they have made very Orthodox Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Mysteries of their time, and in the sense they gave them, which ought no more to be mentioned, without some Mollifying.

So that Scholars found themselves at the end of their Study, altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of true Divinity. The reason of this conduct, and that which has never yet been observed, is, of that to settle to the Study Divinity only, Men must Read, Think, Digest <note n="*" place="margin">

It must be confest also that the Air of Schools is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Eloquence.</p>

                        <hi>P.</hi> 85.122.</note> Whether a Minister ought always to Preach us the most severe Morality?

                     </hi> The strongest Reply to this is, That their Maxim is dangerous, and makes room for the <hi>Calvinists.</hi> Its in fine concluded, <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p n="2">II. The Second Book treats on the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how to gain the attention and good will of the Auditors to a Christian Orator; and it is affirmed that the principal means is to give them an advantageous Idea of his good manners and probity, not in praising, or abasing himself by a Foolish and Proud Humility, or in making Compliments to them; but in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Amongst what serves to encrease the first, place an inviolable Application to the most exact Truths, which banish all those extravagant thoughts, that are called <hi>Concetti</hi>; and even to shun excessive Hyperboles. 2. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream horror to Vice, and a sincere desire of inspiring it into his Auditors: Which engage him to be very grave in all his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; to avoid all sort of Railleries, even the most honest ones; never to paint Vice so as to may make the Hearers laugh, and not to speak Comedies, or Satyrs, instead of Sermons; to avoid all Tones of the voice and all such Gestures, which render a man contemptible or ridiculous. 3. He must appear extreamly Modest, and be so far from all manner of boastings, as to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied to make others sensible of the beauty, solidity, and force of his thoughts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out seeming to take notice thereof himself, and without making use of his Wit, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All that may be said or done, against a Minister, he cannot mention in his Sermons, without its producing a very ill effect. The best Apology is to appear as if one did not so much as think one had been affronted. 5. To give to these Expressions a Noble and Affectionate turn. 6. To make a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and judicious use of Sentences, or often to make use of general Expressions conceived in few words, which express that which is done, or is not done; what we ought, and what we ought not to do, in relation to the general conduct of Men. 7. To advance nothing but what is certaian and undoubted: Which oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth never to relate <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 205.209.</note> in the Pulpit such facts, as are known only to particular Relations, or common Report, which may be false; nor even such things as we know to be certain, when the certainty doth not appear so clearly to all men, that many cannot doubt thereof. We often see Persons cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down in many things, wherein they are really very innocent. If it be said in a Pulpit, that such or such a thing is done in the City, immediately People cast their Eyes upon the Persons, which are the most suspected thereof; and there is no more doubt but Suspicions are true, since they are spoken of in a place where only Truth is expected. This Rule requires no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to be cited, which are not in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or that can be called in Question. The more these examples do appear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, or miraculous, the more they annoy the Authority of the Preacher, by reason of the great inclination, which the generality of the People have to doubt of
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:103507:230"/>
all things appear prodigious, 8. It is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon the same Principle that we ought never to take a party in Questions, wherein the <hi>Catholick Doctors</hi> are lawfully divided; but to be satisfied simply to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Opinions, when that is requisite; because absolutely to assert a thing, is to give an Opinion which may be false, for the Word of God. 9. Finally, its maintained and proved much at large <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 316, 228.</note> against the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Preachers of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church,</hi> that passages in Latin ought not to be cited, neither of Scripture nor the Fathers; because these Citations dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their Auditors, by giving them so many Reproaches of their ignorance, and causing unavoidable distractions. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Objection, which is drawn from Custom, is, that if it was as inviolable as its pretended, the whole Sermon should be made in Latin, as was done some few Ages ago in <hi>France</hi>; or to preach as much or more <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> than <hi>French,</hi> as was also done at the beginning of this Age. We judge now, pursueth the Author, that our Fathers have done very wisely to change these Customs that the People might the better understand the Word of God. Those who shall come after us, will give us thanks, if we perfectly banish from our Christian Discourses all the Languages, which the greatest part of Christians understand not. Afterwards we are taught how to make use of the passages of Scripture and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, after a manner which is not tedious.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. All the Studies of a Preacher, and the care he ought to take to acquire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Authority over those who hear him, tends only to perswade them, and to create a value upon the strength of the proofs which he brings. This then is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and it is that for which particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are given in the Third Book. It is nevertheless, what is most neglected; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause good and solid proofs are always truths which appear common, and that we apply our selves much more to what may render the Orator Admirable, than what may efficaciously perswade the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. We do not perceive that this desire of appearing Famous hinders us from say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost any thing Essential to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and makes us fall into a thousand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies. If we should retrench, saith the Author, from a hundred Sermons that are heard every day, all that we should dare to say, to any honest man, for fear of making our selves ridiculous in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what would remain would be a very small matter, and often nothing at at all.</p>
                  <p>To remedy this abuse it is proposed as an uncontestable Maxim, that an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ought to prove every thing, and to advance nothing, which has not some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in it, or which may not serve to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish it, or to give it more force or clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The very Exordiums, which serve not for this, are not only unprofitable, but also contrary to the end of Eloquence; and so much the more contrary, as they appear adorned and polished with more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice. Similitudes, which prove nothing and which are of pure Ornament, may in some manner be suffered, provided they are not frequent, and that they are expressed in so few words, that they give not leisure to the Auditors to take notice that they are Similitudes: but not in vile false Lustres, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which the Author declaims in many places; and with much reason.</p>
                  <p>He Treats afterwards of the choice of the Matter, and asserts that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath made <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Preachers a long time since to judge that it is more useful to choose one impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Subject only, which should be treated throughly on in a Sermon, than only to make Paraphrases upon the Gospels, or on any other Book of the Scripture. But in making this choice, we too often fall into a considerable defect, which consists in fixing on such Texts as we may say are extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and curious things.<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 261.</note> I see no other reason but this, pursues the Author, which hath obliged one of our most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Preachers of this Age to make a Sermon upon the Kingdom of Devils: Such a subject is very fit to make one say many particular things, known but of few. Tho' it never appeared proper to me to produce any other effect than what it one day did which was to oblige a Prince of the Blood, at the end of so extraordinary Sermon, to go and tell the Preacher that he had Preached in a Devil and a half. Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently our Author would not approve what is related of a Famous <hi>Protestant</hi> Preacher, who having taken his Text upon <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. <hi>If thou art the Son of God, bid these stones to become bread,</hi> begun his Sermon much after this manner.
<q>My Brethren, it hath been usual to Preach to you in this Pulpit the Word of God: but I go about to Preach to you this day the word of the Devil.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The principal subject of a Sermon ought commonly to be somewhat general, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Author, the Auditory being composed of all sorts of Persons. But he judgeth it not convenient it should be drawn from the <hi>Existence of God, from the immortality of the Soul, or from Predestination</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 264. <hi>&amp; Seq.</hi>
                     </note>. He maintains there is almost always more harm than good done, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking throughly to expound these great Truths, to uphold them with all thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> proofs, and to answer all their Objections. As to Predestination, how able, saith he, and prudent soever a Preacher is, he cannot treat of all that is Essential to it, without producing in the minds of the Hearers such perplexity as he cannot so well dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, but that there will always some doubts remain. As to the Two others, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is never capable of those reasons which establish them, and each man is always more perswaded of himself, than he can be by all the reasons which may be alledged. Understanding Persons have these truths
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:103507:231"/>
so well Established in their Minds, that they doubt when they think on them without a design of examining them, or proving them. Ill proofs, which are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times given thereof, are fitter to mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> them suspected than any thing else. As to the Impious, it's certain they never are more obstinate against Divine Truths, than when they are threatned to have them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, making them then to deny several Propositions, which at another time they would have granted. These Truths being the foundation of all Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we ought never to speak of them but as undoubted Principles. If we have any sensible and popular Reasons, it may be added in a few words, without making a shew of proving them; these sorts of Proofs convincing better than long Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The same Precepts are given, in respect to the other Mysteries of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, as the Trinity and Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and its affirmed that there is no better manner of Preaching them, than in making People observe what glory they owe to God and Jesus Christ, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large yet more upon the good and useful Sentiments which these Mysteries ought to inspire into us. This method is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, chiefly for <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whose Religion is not very demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable, and who are to deal with a People who have accustomed themselves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve rather by Prejudice, than be perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Reason.</p>
                  <p>After that he speaks of Division, and as its to be taken for granted that Christian Orators are always Masters of their Subject, and of the Propositions, which they would form thereon: So they will do wisely to propose to themselves only two or three Truths to establish in so many different parts. Several Reasons, and divers Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Precepts are given on this matter: As that all Propositions must be Moral and Practicable; except those which are formed upon matters of Faith, which import the necessity of Sanctification, and that they given an occasion to come to some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the ordinary actions of life. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he marks the qualities that the proofs ought to consist on, by which these Propositions are maintained. 1. Their Sense must be different from that of the Proposition: 2. The truth must appear more plain in 'em. 3. They must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive. To make sure of the force of an Argument we need only, according to the Author, to consult our selves, before we make use thereof, and to examine if this reason would content our mind, when another should coldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it. <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 323.</note> As to Novelty he proves here that it consists not in making digressions, and in seeking for subtil rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; but in expounding things after so natural a turn, that no other form but that of truth is given them: In following this method it may happen, by the ill Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the generality of Preachers, who reject every thing which does not appear extraordinary, that the most common things will seem the newest to the People, being such Truths which never were Preached unto them.</p>
                  <p>We should be too long if we related all the fine things the Author speaks upon the Method of understanding a solid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, without coming into teedious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, by applying it to the pretence of Preachers, and particular cases.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The Fourth Book treats of what may preserve in the Auditors a favourable disposition to the Speakers, and its believed that the whole Artifices is to render them attentive, by proposing things to them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an easie and acceptable manner: For Attention cannot be easie; 1. Without clearness in the expressions and in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it self; which obliges us to banish all words that are too old, or too new, as well as the Terms of Art, and of the Schools, and all Methaphysicual Speculations. 2. Briefness in Periods, without which the Discourse becomes Unintelligible, and in the Sermon it self, which ought never to last longer than an hour. The attention is rendred agreeable by variety in Subjects and Phrases, by diversity of the Style, by Figures and Ornaments, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever spoil all when they are excessive, or far sought: And in short, by sweet and affectionate Motives through the whole Sermon. Upon all this, are remarked the Defects, which we ought to take heed of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we are taught how to avoid, being lifeless and insipid. He finishes the whole work by giving rules for Panegyricks.</p>

                  <p>THE Work is in Two Parts, Writ by Mr. <hi>May,</hi> Professor of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Tongues at <hi>Durlac,</hi> upon Animals, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon those which the Scripture speaks of. He undertakes to make the History of Four footed Beasts, Fowls, Creeping things, and of Aquatick, or Amphibious Animals. He designs Four things in this piece. 1. To Search after the Etymology of their Names, chiefly in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> because this Disquisition may serve for the understanding of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Passages of Sacred and Profane Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. 2. To make an exact Description of Exteriour forms of Animals, of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of their Qualities. 3. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:103507:231"/>
the usefulness which may be drawn from them in the various occasions of life. 4. To speak of the Superstitious use that <hi>Pagans</hi> have made of them, in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Ceremonies of their Religion. Amongst the Authors that have written upon this Subject there are few who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knew the <hi>Eastern</hi> Tongues. <hi>Bochart</hi> is perhaps the only Man who was so well read in this point as to undertake without Temerity to write upon so difficult a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But <hi>Bochart</hi> himself confesses, that he has yet left a great many things to be discovered. Besides that, his Book is very large of the Animals spoken of in Scripture, and of full Citations, which few are capable of understanding, Therefore Mr. <hi>May</hi> thought it would not be unprofitable to examine this matter, according to the Ideas of this great Man, whose faults he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make known and augment his Discoveries. The First Book treats of the Four kinds of Animals, and the Second of divers Four Footed Beasts in particular. This Second Book is divided into Two Sections, the one for Domestick and the other for wild Animals.

G.</hi> 7.2. He hath an inclination for the opinions of <hi>Heideggerus,</hi> who believes the Sacred Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor calls such Animals <hi>clean as nature hath no aversion to, and those unclean which are only fed upon thro' necessity, such as are Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles, Serpents, Crows and the like.</hi> But he decides nothing in this place.

He is for the negative, and strives to shew the abolishment of it in spight of powerful Adversaries, whom he opposes, as <hi>Grotius, Salmatius, De Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles, Gerard Vossius, Blondel, &amp;c.</hi> In the 6. <hi>Ch.</hi> of the same Book is the discussion of some Questions of this Nature, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Animals which God brought before <hi>Adam,</hi> and the names he gave them. It is asked, if there were of all sorts there, and how much time was requisit for Elephants and all the Animals formed in another Continent, to come from the remotest parts of <hi>America</hi> or <hi>Indies,</hi> to do homage to our first Father? It is answered that tho' an Author expresseth himself after a very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral manner, it is still a natural equity not to press his expressions beyond the limits in which the circumstances of the Discourse restrains them: That the terms cannot be understood of <hi>all the Animals of the Earth,</hi> and <hi>all the Fowls of the Firmament,</hi> but of those of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> which were about the places where <hi>Adam</hi> had been Created: That there is no contradiction; that God, who produced Frogs and Lice of <hi>Egypt,</hi> made <hi>Bears</hi> come forth against the Children who jeered the Prophet, and sent <hi>Lyons</hi> against the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> should bring so many Animals to <hi>Adam.</hi> The Knowledg and Judgment of the first Man is much insisted upon, and its pretended that he gave all Animals Names which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press very well their Natures, because this supposition is the Foundation of all the Etymologies which are sought for in the rest.</p>

An <hi>Ethiopian</hi> dreaming at Sea, that a <hi>Tyger</hi> was ready to devour him, went next night to hide himself in the <hi>Prow,</hi> but this Precaution did not avail him; for the Vessel being then at Anchor not far from the Coast, a <hi>Tyger</hi> entred and chose out this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Negro,</hi> and tore him in pieces, not touching any of the <hi>Europeans.</hi> The Wolf, the <hi>Hyena</hi> and the <hi>Ihoes,</hi> take up the three following Chapters. <hi>Bochart</hi> deriveth the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">II. The Author confesses that divers <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p n="3">3<hi>d.</hi> He that Prayed could not Read, if he had his <hi>Eyes raised towards Heaven.</hi> And this the Author endeavours to prove by <hi>Tertullian, Clement Alexandrin,</hi> St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Arnobius, Lactantius, Denys</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) than <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> had; which is not necessary simply to Read a <hi>Liturgy.</hi>
                     <q>The passages which the Author cites here, seem to have a respect to Prayers in general. To which we answer him, That what is said of Prayers, which we make our selves,<note n="*" place="margin">This was not in the Extract,</note> ought not to extend all manner of Prayers; and that now <hi>Liturgies</hi> are to be excepted which are read. As for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as it often sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply signifies <hi>Assurance</hi>; So we may say, that those who read the <hi>Liturgy</hi> ought to do it with confidence, that the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which they make shall be accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: We observe this in short, that it may be perceived, that the Citations of Authors will not go for concluding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in the minds of many Readers. As these Citations cannot be related, this remark was necessary.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Ancients never make mention of any Book of Prayers, in such places where they would have spoken of them, if they had any such Books. We have Catalogues of Vessels, Utensils and Books of Churches, as Bibles, Gospels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Fathers speak of the good and bad use that hath been made of them; but there is no mention made of a Book of Publick Prayers. One of the First Books of this kind is the <hi>Libellus Officialis,</hi> which is spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of in the 25 Canon of the IV Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> held in DCXXXIII. But it was only a short instruction of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner whereby Prayers ought to be formed. If there had been then any <hi>Liturgy,</hi> the 2, 5, 6, and 8, Canons, even to the 17, would be useless. Traditors of <hi>Liturgies</hi> have never been heard of, <hi>viz.</hi> People that in time of Persecution, gave up these Books to Heathens. And this wou'd have appeared, because it was not so much the opinions of the Christians, that they were persecuted for by the Pagans, as their Worship, which consisted, as 'tis believed, in the Reading of <hi>Liturgies</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> were much more against new. <hi>Liturgies,</hi> than new Gods; as appears by a passage of <hi>Titus Livius</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 25. <hi>C.</hi> 1.</note> who relates that the Senate Prohibited a new manner of Worship, which was introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into <hi>Rome,</hi> and caused the Books to be Seized, which those who were of this new Profession made use of. <hi>Edixit ut quicunque libros latinos, precationesve, aut artem saorificandi conscriptam haberet, eos libros omnes literasque ad se, ante Calendas Aprilis, deferret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. We do not see that in the First Ages <hi>Liturgies</hi> were cited, to refute Errors or decide Controversies; as they wou'd have been, if they'd had any, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Pelagian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. How came it to pass that nothing was said of the Changes, that probably might have been made in them, or of the occasions which might have rendred these alterations necessary? <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosatenus</hi> prohibited the use of <hi>Hymns,</hi> which were Sung in Honour of Jesus Christ; the <hi>Arians</hi> oft enough changed the <hi>Doxology,</hi> the words prescribed by Jesus Christ in the Administration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and the Confessions of Faith; yet we do not find that they have done so, in regard to <hi>Liturgies,</hi> wherein they would doubtless have had much stronger reasons for it. The addition of the Terms, <hi>who was Crucified for us,</hi> in the <hi>Trisagion,</hi> caused great troubles, but we see none that happened on the account of <hi>Liturgies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Ancient Christians, chiefly in the Fourth and Fifth Age, were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary careful in keeping secret from the <hi>Catechumens</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> the Symbols, Ceremonies and Prayers, which were used in the Celebration of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> St. <hi>Basil</hi> saith, that even the words, which were used before, after and in the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, were not written. It's in his Treatise of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> C. 27 <hi>Innocent</hi>
                     <pb n="440" facs="tcp:103507:234"/>
the First Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his Answer to <hi>Decentius</hi> of <hi>Gubio,</hi> sends him to no writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Form; he will not even add in this Work the words which were used in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Chrison,</hi> for fear of publishing the Secrets of the Church. He testifies an equal reservedness in regard of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> which shews they had no publick Form thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">II After having <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 44.</note> made these general Remarks, the Author comes to consider the <hi>Eucharist</hi> in particular.</p>
                  <p>He cites the 23 Canon of the Third Council of <hi>Carthage; Ut nemo in precibus, vel Patrem pro filio, vel filium pro Patre no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minet, &amp; cum ad Altare assistitur, semper ad Patrem dirigatur oratio,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Et quascunq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e sibi preces aliquis describit, non eis utatur, nisi prius eas cum instructioribus fratribus contulerit.</hi>
                     <q>That no man in his Prayers name the Father for the Son, nor the Son for the Father; and let him that is at the Altar always direct his Prayers to the Father. What Prayers soever any man makes for himself, let him not make use of them, before he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated them to one of the better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed Brethren.</q>
The Author from thence draws divers Consequences, to prove that there was then no <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</hi> He chiefly founds his Argument up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, that this Canon permitted those that Officiated, to make use of what Prayers they pleased, provided that they first communicated them to some wise Persons. Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi> explains these words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by those of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> against the <hi>Donatists L.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 25. <hi>Multi irruunt in preces non solum ab imperitis loquacibus, sed etiam ab Haereticis compositas &amp; per ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae simplicitatem, non eas valentes discernere, utuntur iis, arbitrantes quod bonae sint.</hi>
                     <q>Many, saith he, throw themselves upon Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers composed not only by ignorant Men and great Speakers, but also by Hereticks. Being too illiterate and too simple, to make a just distinction they make use of such as they think good.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Author after that considers the 70. Canon of the Collection of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Africk,</hi> which in effect is the same as the 12. of the Council of <hi>Milan,</hi> the Terms of which are these: <hi>Placuit etiam hoc, ut preces, quae probatae fuerint abomnibus celebren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, nec aliae omnino contra Fidem proferan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, sed quaecunque cum prudentioribus fuerint collatae dicantur.</hi> The Author observes from this, that the necessity of using cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Prayers was imposed upon those that could not distinguish the good from the bad; and besides, all they had to do was but to communicate them to some Person who was more capable of judging thereof than themselves. As for those who had more knowledge, they were permitted to make use of such Prayers, as they thought fit. Besides, here is only condemned the Prayers which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Faith. And it was allowed that those might be made use of, which were approved by a Synod, or by able Men; whence the Author concludes, there was no common Form, or at least that there was none, which Persons were necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily obliged to follow. After that he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to some Objections, which are made against the Exposition he gives upon this Canon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the 12. Canon of the Second Council of <hi>Milan,</hi> instead of <hi>cum prudentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus collatae,</hi> there is <hi>â prudentioribus tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatae,</hi> If they were Examined, to see if they might be approved of. This sense of the word <hi>tractatae</hi> agrees, according to the Author, with the other Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of of the Church of <hi>Africk,</hi> and with their practice; such as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> represents it, in the passage which was cited. The Author also makes some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon these words; which I shall omit to relate for fear of being too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As to the general Prayer, for all the Bishops, which was used in Celebrating the Eucharist, the Author endeavours to prove that it was not always conceived in the same terms by the Epistle of St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> This Bishop had heard that St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was accustomed to insert these terms in his Prayers. <hi>Domine praesta Ioanni ut bene credat, Lord grant Iohn may entertain a true Faith.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> complained of this addition, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his Belief suspicious: But such terms could not be added, if it had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to change any thing whatever, in the Prayer which was then used, and <hi>Iohn</hi> wou'd not have had the occasion of complaining as he did. St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in answering to that, exclaimeth not as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Calumny, which the practice of the Church should destroy, but saith only, <hi>noli nos in tantum putare rusticos, ut hoc tam aperte dicere potuerimus</hi>: He adds <hi>Pro te quoque dicimus: Custodi illum qui praedicat verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. Vel certe, ita: Tu, praesta Domine, &amp; custodi, ut ille verbum praedicet veritatis sicut occasio sermonis se tulerit, &amp; habuerit oratio consequentiam</hi>: We also say for thee: Keep him who preaches the Truth, or at least thus, do thou O Lord, keep him, and make him to preach the Truth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the occasion of the Discourse shall, and as the Sequel of the Prayer shall require. We see by these latter Words, that St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did not always express himself after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Mr. <hi>Clerkson</hi> believes not also that the Prayer of the Consecration was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in such terms, as was constantly rehearsed. To prove it he cites <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Apol.</hi> 2. <hi>P.</hi> 129.</note> who saith, that the <hi>President made Prayers and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings as far as his Capacity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thereof,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as those who maintain the Antiquity of <hi>Liturgies</hi> have omitted nothing to give

this passage, a sense conformable to their opinions; So the Author doth what he can to shew that in the First Ages, no regulate words were written, which ought to be made use of in this occasion. He likewise endeavours to shew that there was no conformity amongst the Churches, in the expressions which were used on this occasion, or in giving the Symbols to those who communicated; from whence it follows that there was no <hi>Liturgy</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received as at this day.</p>

Some thought they were not obliged to Baptize expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Name of the Father, of the Son, and the Holy Ghost</hi>; but were satisfied to do it, in the Name of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> St. <hi>Irenaens,</hi> St. <hi>Basil</hi> and <hi>Theophilact</hi> declare, that they did not disapprove of this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and sufficiently shew'd that they did not think Men ought to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too much to the words: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients were so far from constraining one another to it, that according to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, there was not so much as unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the Terms of their Confessions of Faith. He Remarks by the by, that he who first Introduced the Custom to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse the Creed in Publick Service, was <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Foulon</hi>; and shews in what time the same Custom was Introduced, in the Churches of the West.</p>

This Renouncing is also seen diversly expressed in the writings of the same Author.

                     <hi>Baptism against Donatists,</hi> speaking of the words which they made use of in Baptizing, saith, <hi>Si non santificatur aqua, cum aliqua erroris verba per imperitiam Precator effundit, multi non solum mali, sed etiam boni fratres in Ecclesia non sanctificant aquam.</hi> If the Water is not Sanctified whilest he that Prayeth is mistaken thro' ignorance, in some expressions, there are not only several evil Persons, but even good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who cann't Sanctifie the Water in the Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi> after having brought diverse proofs, by which he pretends to shew that there was no Form, in the First Ages for the Administration of the Sacraments, cites <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 155 <hi>&amp; Seq.</hi>
                     </note> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of the Fathers, which seem against Forms in general. 1. For example, he Expounds at length the passage of <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> which is already related: He adds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto what <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, (<hi>Apol. ch.</hi> 30.) of the manner how Christians Prayed: <hi>sine monitore, quia de pectore, precantes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>We pray without being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised of the terms, which we ought to make use of, because we pray from the bottom of our heart. In this place <hi>Tertullian</hi> opposes the Christians to the Heathens who rehearse their Prayers after a Person that Read them, <hi>Qui prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibat de scripto.</hi>
                     </q>
Some thought that <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> meant that the Christians rehearsed their Prayers by heart; but then instead of saying <hi>de pectore,</hi> he should have said, <hi>de memoria</hi>; and it would be no small la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to learn by heart all the Prayers, that the Christians then made. In their meeting together, which lasted 9 hours, and sometimes 12. and which were done twice or thrice a week, all the time was almost imployed in Prayers; not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quantity of others that were done on Vigils, Feasts, Sundays, in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Baptism, in the Ordinations, in the Reconciliations of Penitents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Besides that the Generality of the Christians being obliged to no Form in respect to the Hymns they Sung, as appears by <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Apol. c.</hi> 39.</note> 
                     <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>; there is no likelyhood that the Pastours were more confined in their Prayers. Indeed in the time of <hi>Origen</hi> they Prayed according to their Capacity, as is evident by some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of this Father, which may be readin the Author, who makes use of divers other Reasons, which we cannot stay to relate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We find these Terms, in this Book of St. <hi>Augustin, de Catechiz. rudibus, ch.</hi> 9. where after having said that those who had some Learning and entred into the Church, must be taught, that God hath much more respect to the Heart than Words, he adds, <hi>Ita enim non irridebunt, si aliquos Antistites &amp; Ministros Ecclesiae fortè animadverterint, vel cum Barbarismis &amp; solecismis Deum invocare</hi>:
<q>For thus, saith he, When it shall happen that they will hear both Bishops and Priests commit Solecisms, and Barbarisms in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, they will not laugh thereat.</q>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 5. <hi>C.</hi> 21</note> 
                     <hi>Socrates</hi> who lived in the middle of the Fifth Age, says, that two Prayers could not be found, which in every thing agreed with one another. The <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 134</note> Churches of <hi>Spain</hi> had no Liturgie in DCXXXIII, and
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:103507:235"/>
in <hi>France</hi> it was but in <hi>Charles Majus</hi> time that they were established there. In the Diocess of <hi>Cologne</hi> there were divers sorts of 'em, until the middle of the Tenth Age; and the same was observed in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with which the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> agreed, until the Twelfth Age.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The last thing that the Author does in this <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 135.</note> Work, is to Refute the Reasons, which are brought to prove the Antiquity of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To that purpose is cited a passage <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Strom</hi> 7.</note> of <hi>Clement Alexandrius,</hi> who says, <hi>That the Assembly of those who Pray'd had but one Voice in common, and but one thought</hi>; And the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor replies that that signifies nothing else, but that the Pastour speaks in the name of the whole Assembly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for the passages of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and St. <hi>Basil,</hi> where they say, that the Christians asked certain things of God; Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi> maintains that hence can no other Consequence be drawn, but that the matter of their Prayer was the same, tho' the Terms might be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Divers places of <hi>Origen</hi> are cited, where he speaks of the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the Christians, of which he relates some Words; but if we believe the Author, <hi>Origen</hi> by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> meant in some places, nothing else but the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> where these words are found; and it appears not by other passages of this Father, that they were obliged constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make use of the same expressions, but only that sometimes those which he relates were made use of.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some Learned Men have believed that the words of <hi>Dominica Solennia</hi> in <hi>Tertullian</hi> (c. 9. <hi>de Anima</hi>) signifie the Liturgie, which was read on Sunday. Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi> believes on the contrary, that these Terms mark nothing else than the reading of Scripture, the singing of Psalms, Prayers and Homilies, and that this is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible by the Sequel of <hi>Tertullians</hi> discourse, which may be read in the Original, or in the Author. <hi>Solennia</hi> is also taken for the same thing in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>; and in the time of <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the care of remarking what was to be read was left to the Pastours. After the Examination of these passages drawn from the Authors of the First Age, Mr. <hi>Clark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> comes to later Testimonies; amongst which the Liturgie of St. <hi>Iames</hi> ought to be read, which is manifestly Supposititious, and which according to the Author, was unknown before the Seventh and Eighth Age.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The 18. Canon is cited of the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> where it is said, <hi>That the Liturgy (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) of Prayers ought every where to be the same at Evening and Morning.</hi> To that the Author answers, amongst other things, that the word Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie signifies Originally a <hi>publick Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and is taken in the most ordinary signification, for the Exercise of this Change, and not for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing on't. Thus in <hi>Theodoret</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Hist.</hi> L. 2. C. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>The Liturgy of Hymns</hi> not for a Form of Canticles, but for the very Action of Singing them. In <hi>Iustinian</hi> the <hi>Liturgy of the Scripture which was read,</hi> is the very reading of <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> and not <hi>a Rubrick,</hi> which notes in what place it ought to be Read. The same Emperour condemns to death those who shou'd undertake to <hi>trouble the Divine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies</hi>; to wit, the Publick Service, and not the Forms of Writings.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Author after that treats, in a few words, of the Liturgies Attributed to St. <hi>Basil</hi> and St. <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that these two Bishops have been supposed as well as St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> Authors of new Liturgies, because they introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a new manner of Singing, in their Churches. <hi>Flavianus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished at <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Hist.</hi> L. 2. C. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Singing of the Antiphones, when the <hi>Arians</hi> had forc'd them to meet together in a particular Assembly, after having taken from them the Publick Churches. They were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in that by Saint <hi>Basil,</hi> whom Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> imitated, as he himself served in that as a Model to other Churches St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was the first amongst the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,</hi> who put them in use at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> fearing lest the <hi>Arians,</hi> who made use thereof, should draw the People to them by this means. It ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that this manner of Singing, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Liturgy,</hi> by St. <hi>Chrysostom. Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Iustinian,</hi> as this Author says After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the same word being since taken to sinifie a <hi>Form</hi>; those who read in the Writings of the Preceding Ages, that these Fathers had introduced new <hi>Liturgies,</hi> thought without Reason that they had made new Forms.</p>
                  <p>This Conjecture is maintained by these Two Remarks; First, a Liturgy has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed been Attributed to St. <hi>Iames,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord, because <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> call him <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Liturgus,</hi> or, <hi>Publick Minister.</hi> Secondly, amongst the <hi>Latins</hi> in the time wherein these Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies were supposed to be extant, the most part of these Forms were called <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Singing,</hi> without excepting even the Prayers as the Author shews by several Examples. So those who had introduced new ways of Singing, might pass for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of new <hi>Liturgies,</hi> when <hi>Cantare</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> came to signifie the same thing. The Author believes it is a like expression, which made some say that St. <hi>Ierome</hi> made a Liturgy, tho' he did nothing else, but introduce a new manner of Singing, in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi> examins after that the 15 Canon of <hi>Vannes,</hi> held towards the end of the Fifth Age, where there is <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crorum ordo, &amp; psallendi una sit consuetudo.</hi>
                     <pb n="443" facs="tcp:103507:235"/>
The word <hi>ordo,</hi> according to the Author, signifies only the disposition of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spontes. Prayers, Hymns and Psalms, in the order they ought to be, which he proves by the 21st. Canon of a Synod of <hi>Agatho,</hi> held some years after, in the same Country. Besides this, if by <hi>ordo,</hi> a Liturgy is understood, or a regulate Form, that which is in question must be Attributed to Six Bishops only in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>France,</hi> and that upon the end of the Fifth Age. These are, according to the Author, the principal citations of of the first Five Ages, which are alledged in Favour of Liturgies. He speaks after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in few words, of the <hi>Benedicite</hi> the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and Song of the <hi>Three Children,</hi> which he maintains to be of the Sixth or Seventh Age.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In short, the Author examining the Reasons why Liturgies were introduced into the Church, attributes this use to the Ignorance and Corruption of the Times, which became excessive since the Fourth Age. Those who Govern'd the Church did it with an unsupportable Tyranny, not only at <hi>Rome,</hi> but else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; they were Negligent, Lasie, and Ignorant after a scandalous manner, as appears by the complaints which St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianze,</hi> St. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> and St. <hi>Basil,</hi> &amp;c. made of them in their time. Several Bishops knew not even how to write their Names, so that they were forced in the Councils to make others Subscribe for them; which by-like was very common, seeing they made no difficulty to confess a thing, which should have covered them with shame. The Author relates several Examples thereof drawn from the Councils of <hi>Calcedon</hi> and <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where Subscriptions are found after this manner: <hi>I such a Man have Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the hand of such a Man, because I cannot Write: Such a Bishop knew not how to write, I underwritten have subscribed for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After that if these Assemblies judged well of Controversies, it must have been a great Chance or Miracle. The Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune still is, that if we are now a little more expert, there are yet so many who know not how to pray to God, that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies are little less necessary than at that time. But the Author advances nothing that he endeavours not to prove by pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the Ancients, which he cites in the Original Languages. Those who would throughly Examin these matters, will not do amiss to read this work, and compare them with the Originals.</p>

                  <p>ALtho' the Title of this Work is so well known, that the Design of it is easily perceived, yet since the Matter is new, and the manner it is promised to be treated on, is difficult, Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> thought it very necessary to Instruct the Publick more particularly in a Preface, of the assistance that he had, and the Method he follow'd to accomplish this work: He divided it into Two Parts, and begins the First with Justifying the Title of <hi>Bibliotheque,</hi> shewing for example, that 'tis a Name that ought to begin <note place="margin">P. 1.</note> to <hi>the collection of many Authors, and to Books that treat of their Works.</hi> He afterwards shews that the Custom of writing <hi>Bibliotheques</hi> is very Ancient, and that it was introduced amongst the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, in the First Ages of the Church; <note n="*" place="margin">P. 3<hi>d.</hi>

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Opinions and Thoughts of an Infinite Number of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and the History of <hi>Eusebius</hi> may be call'd a <hi>Bibliotheque</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Authors,</hi> since he hath done almost nothing else in this Work, than Writ their Life, give a Catalogue of their Writings, and relate many Passages out of them. After having spoken of those who have taken like pains, and above all <note n="*" place="margin">P. 4.</note> of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> adds that Authors never took so much pains, especially <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks,</hi> as in the Last Ages, in which Learning was renew'd, and Criticks car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to such a point as they never were before; Both Catholicks and Hereticks, have endeavoured to out-vy one another in making <hi>Bibliotheques. Erasmus</hi> (pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues he) in Printing the Fathers, hath put Prefaces and Notes before their Works, which contain must Judicious Criticks; and that altho' he is sometimes too confident in rejecting some Pieces; It must be confessed nevertheless that he has broke the Ice for those that have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him. He speaks with the same freedom of other Authors of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and in respect to the Protestants, altho he accuses them of Passion and of being very Erroneous;<note n="*" place="margin">P. 7.</note> he confesses nevertheless, as to what regards Criticks, they were sometimes
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:103507:237"/>
sharper and more quicksighted than the Catholicks, and that the Protestants have discovered many things therein, that they were obliged to acknowledg and aprove of. The Author afterwards tells the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that engaged him to undertake this Work, which were, that no body before him had done any thing Compleat upon it. He shews the design of his Book, by a Comparison between a number of Books well ranged, which is properly call'd a <hi>Bibliotheque</hi>; and the Order that he has observed in this Work, to which he gives the same name. There is only this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between these two <hi>Bibliotheques,</hi> it is that in the first, if we content our selves only to read the Titles, no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to Learning is to be received from it; and to run through all the Authors which compose it, much time and pains is required: Whereas in this we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct our selves in many important things with great Facility; since there is not only the Titles of the Books, but also the Abridgment and Sum of what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with a Remark upon the particular Sentiments in them.</p>
                  <p>In the Second Part of the Preface, Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> shews the necessity there was to make use of such a Method as followed; to write the Life of the Authors, to make a Catalogue and Remark of the Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of their Works; the Circumstances of the Time, Place, Age, and Condition of him that writ, and of the Persons he was concern'd with, changing the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Discourse according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Subject. An Author that engages against a Heresy of his own time, that is the Head of a Party, and who hath Personal Contestations with those that Attack him, expresses himself very differently from him that writes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Heresy that is extinguisht, who takes no part in the Quarrel, and has no other Motive in writing than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Truth. <note n="*" place="margin">P. 18.</note> St. <hi>Cyprian speaks of the Reconciliation of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, following the different Circumstances of the Times; St.</hi> Augustin <hi>writing against the</hi> Pelagians, <hi>speaks otherwise of Grace and Free-Will, than he had done before: And from the time that his head was possess'd with these Hereticks, and the Donatists,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">P. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>he speaks continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all his writings (even in his Homilies) of the Church and of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He afterwards tells the Reason why many Works are attributed to some Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Authors which is none of theirs; <hi>viz.</hi> the Malice of Hereticks, the little Piety of some of the Orthodox, the Levity of some Men, Ignorance, or Avarice of the <hi>Copyists,</hi> of the <hi>Printers,</hi> and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of those that have taken for Authors of certain Dialogues, such Persons as are made to speak in those Dialogues. So 'tis that <hi>Vigilius</hi> of <hi>Tapse</hi> has made Five Books under the name of Saint <hi>Athanasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>; and it may be that also under the same name he made the Creed that is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to this Father. In short the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of Titles, and the Resemblance of Names have often caused Pieces to be attributed to such Persons as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not to. After that he establishes Rules for true Criticks, remarking that the Proofs or Conjectures that we can make of any Work, are <hi>Internal</hi> or <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> Time is one of the most certain <hi>Internal</hi> Marks, and nothing is more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of convincing an Author of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, than when the date of his Work is false, or that he speaks of Persons that have lived a long time after him, whose Name is affixed to the Work. 2<hi>ly.</hi> The matter that is contained in a Book disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers whether it be Supposititious or no. 1. When we find Opinions in it, that were not maintained till a long time after that Age. 2. Expressions concerning those Opinions, Ceremonies and Customs that were not then in use. 3. Errors that are of a latter date, or such matters as were not treated on in that time that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor lived, whose name is affixed to the Work. 4. Opinions contrary to such as are seen in their writings. 5. Or Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries manifestly Fabulous. 3<hi>ly.</hi> The turn of the Discourse, the manner of Writing, the Elocution, the Figures, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod being a thing most difficult things to Counterfeit, are of very great use to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover whether a Work be supposititious or not. Tho'we must not always reject a Book for a small alteration in the Stile without any other proof, because Persons may write differently according to their Age, Places, and the Subject of the Discourse; nor should we receive a piece as true only for the Resemblance of Stile; for an Ingenious Man often imitates the Phrases and Genius of an Author very well in a Discourse that is not long.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>External</hi> proofs whether a Work is supposititious or no are taken. 1. From Ancient Manuscripts, in which we find not the Name of the Author, or find that of an others. 2. The Testimony of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authors that reject this work, or that say nothing at all of it.</p>

Following this Method, the Author to prove that <hi>Moses</hi> writ the Books that bear his Name, Cites in the Notes many passages of the Old and New Testament. He says, that the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Pentateuch being writ in ancient Hebrew Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, must necessarily be composed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Captivity</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where the use of these Characters were lost. He relates the Testimonies of <hi>Manethon, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locorus, Atheneus,</hi> and other ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, that <hi>Iosephus</hi> and the Primitive Christians have preserved some passages of; to which he adds other Authors of a latter date, and whose Works still remain amongst us, as St. <hi>Strabo,</hi> the Abridgment of <hi>Trogue-Pompeus, Iuvenal, Pliny, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus, Longinus, Porphirius, Iulian,</hi> &amp;c. And from this universal Consent, he draws an invincible Argument to prove that <hi>Moses</hi> writ the Law, and that he was the Law-giver of the <hi>Iews.</hi>

In short, he maintains that when they wou'd suppose that the reasons that are alledg'd against the Antiquity of the Pentateuch, are all unanswerable, they shou'd prove only that there is some Names of Towns or Countries changed, some little words inserted to clear Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and in fine, that the Narration of the Death of <hi>Moses,</hi> was necessary to be added to finish the History of the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch.

And it is not only Contradiction of that Father, which he has observ'd. <hi>Always,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Du Pin, when St.</hi> Jerom <hi>Treats expresly of Canonical Books, he rejects as Apocryphal all those that are not in the Iews Canon; but when he speaks without making any reflection, he often cites these same books as Holy Scripture,</hi> Ib. p. 72. speaking diversly by <hi>Economie</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Persons with whom he had to do.</p>
                  <p>The Epistle of St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> which we have also an entire <hi>Latin Translation</hi> of, and great part of the <hi>Greek</hi> Original, is certainly his, since we see in it the same passages, that St. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Origen, Eusebius,</hi> and St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> cite out of it.

'Tis the business of the Church to declare it, and it's sufficient that it has not done it; therefore his Letter is look'd upon as Apocryphal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' 'twas certainly his own.</q>

We may see there in the troubles that were excited amongst the Christians, by the parties of <hi>Novatian</hi> and <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> on the account of those that were fallen by Persecution: The Moderation that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> observed to avoid the Rigour of the first, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Remissness of the second; and the Weakness of <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who suffering himself to be seduced by <hi>Felicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus,</hi> writ to St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> after a disobliging manner. These Two Schisms were not extinguisht before a third arose, upon the Question, whether Hereticks ought to be Re-Baptized, proposed by <hi>Ianuarius</hi> and the Bishops of <hi>Numidia,</hi> who upon that Account came to consult a Council where St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was. They that composed it, answered that this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was already decided by the Bishops that were their Predecessours, who had declared in the Affirmative. The Year following another Synod was Assembled in <hi>Africk,</hi> which having confirmed this Decision, sent to <hi>Stephen,</hi> who was then Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to perswade him to embrace this Discipline. But the Bishops was so far from complying with the Reasons of the <hi>Africans,</hi> that he was Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported with anger against St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his Collegues, and treated their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties very ill, calling them false Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, false Apostles, and Seducers, even forbidding all those of his Church to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them, and so depriving them not only of <hi>Ecclesiastick Communion,</hi> but also refusing them the Laws of Hospitality; but St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> testified great Moderation, being unwilling that any Person shou'd Separate himself from the <hi>Communion,</hi> upon this Dispute. Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards endeavours to prove in his Notes, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did not change his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the Churches of <hi>Greece</hi> were also a great while after his time divided about this Question: He directs the Reader to a Letter of St. <hi>Basil</hi> to <hi>Amphilocus,</hi> in which this Father relates the different Customs of the Church upon this Point.</p>
                  <p>Almost all the Letters of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> run upon those Subjects that we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spoken of, the extracts of 'em are given to our Author according to the
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:103507:240"/>
order of time. He relates many fine passages from thence upon the necessity of examining the Disposition of such as are admitted to the Communion, the Excellency of a Martyr, which principally consists in keeping in every respect an Inviolable Holiness in his words, and not to destroy the precepts of Jesus Christ at the same time that he's a Martyr for him. This holy Bishop made it a Law to do nothing in the Affairs of his Church without the Council of his Clergy, and consent of the People. Whefore in the Council of 37 Bishops, held at <hi>Carthage</hi> in 256. upon the Reiteration of Baptism, this holy Man gave this reason against Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating those that were of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion to him:
<q>For <note n="*" place="margin">P. 444.</note> no one amongst us, says he, ought to establish himself Bishop over the Bishops, or pretend to constrain his Collegues by a Tyrannical fear, because each Bishop has the same liberty and power, and he can no more be judg'd be another, than he can judge him; but we ought all to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Judgment of Jesus Christ, who only has power to propound to his Church and Judg of our actions.</q>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">P. 442.</note> In this question the Two Parties pretended to have Tradition on their side: And St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> opposed to the Tradition that Pope <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> brought, the Truth of the Gospel and the first Tradition of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Our Author says also, <note n="*" place="margin">P. 474.</note> that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was the first that spoke clearly of Original Sin, and the necessity of the Grace of Jesus Christ.

                     <note n="*" place="margin">P. 513.</note> In the time of <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the Third Age, one <hi>Nepos</hi> Bishop of <hi>Egypt</hi> writing of a Book to maintain the Reign of a Thousand Years, where he proves his opinion by the <hi>Apocalypse, Dionysius</hi> undertook to refute him.
<q>And to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Testimony of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse,</hi> that his Adversary quoted, he says, that some have slighted this Books, thinking it the Heretick <hi>Cerinthus</hi>'s, who admitted no other Beatitude than what consisted in Corporeal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments: But as for himself, he says, he durst not entirely reject it, because it was esteemed by many Christians; yet that he was perswaded that it had a hidden sense which cou'd not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by any one: That it was the Book of some Author inspired by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> tho' not St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> but another that bore his Name, as he endeavours to prove by the difference of the Stile and thoughts <note n="*" place="margin">P. 514.</note> 
                        <hi>Denis</hi> without doubt went too far upon this matter, as well as in the Letter that he writ to the Bishops of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapolis,</hi> when to refute the Error of <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who confounded the Three Persons of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> this slipt from him, <hi>That the Son is the work of the Father, and that he was to the Father as a Vineyard is to it's Vinekeeper, or a Ship to its Ship-wright, and that he was not before he was made.</hi>
                     </q>
That happen'd to <hi>Dionysius,</hi> adds our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that does almost to all those that dispute against an Error, <hi>viz.</hi> to speak after such a manner as favours the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Errors.</p>

                     <hi>Baronius</hi> thinks that a Letter that <hi>Turrian</hi> published under the Name of <hi>Dionysius</hi>; and which is inserted in the first Volume of the last Councils, <hi>P.</hi> 850. is certainly his. But Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> believes it a Supposititious Work, because the Author of this Letter approves of the Word <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> and says, that the Fathers have thus call'd the Son of God. Whereas it is certain that <hi>Dionysius</hi> and the Synod of <hi>Antioch</hi> received not this term, and that in his time they cou'd not say, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commonly made use of it. There remains nothing else of this Bishops but a letter to <hi>Basilides</hi> printed in the first Book of the Councils.</p>
                  <p>Besides many Fragments of <hi>Methodius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Olimpius,</hi> or <hi>Patarus</hi> in <hi>Lycia,</hi> that Father <hi>Combefix</hi> has taken from the Ancients, or Collections of divers Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts, we have now his <hi>Feast</hi> of the <hi>Virgins</hi> compleat, which we ow to <hi>Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Jesuit. 'Tis a Dialogue of many <hi>Virgins,</hi> each of which make a Discourse in praise of Virginity, nevertheless, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blaming Matrimony; <hi>a Moderation very rare to the Ancients,</hi> says Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi>: <note n="*" place="margin">P. 339.</note> This Work is composed of Ten Discourses, full of Allegories, and places of Scripture, and treats on divers matters as occasion serves. In the Second, to prove that God is not the Author of Aulteries altho' he Forms the Children that are produced by so wicked an Act, he brings some natural instances.</p>
                  <p>In the Eighth Discourse this Father speaking against the <hi>Fatum</hi> of the Stoicks, proves that Men are free, and that they are not necessitated to do good or evil, by the Influences of the Stars. At the
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:103507:241"/>
end of this Dialogue the Author speaks very Orthodoxly of the Holy Trinity, if we may believe Mr. <hi>Du Pin.</hi> We have only some Scattered pieces of <hi>Methodius</hi>'s, Treatise against <hi>Origen,</hi> taken from Saint <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and Father <hi>Sirmond.</hi> Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doubts whether the passage that <hi>Iohn Damascenus</hi> relates in the Third Prayer to Images, are <hi>Methodius</hi>'s or no. He affirms there, that the Christians made Images of Gold, to represent the Angels for the Glory of God. If this is our Bishops, says Mr. <hi>Du Pin,</hi> it must be that he meant something else than what <hi>Damascenus</hi> did, and that by the Word Angels, Principalities and Powers, he must understand the Kings of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>He adds to the Authors of the Three First Ages, <hi>Arnobius, Lactantius, Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus,</hi> and <hi>Iulius Firmicus Maternus,</hi> altho they pass'd the greatest part of their lives in the Fourth Age, because they imitated the First Fathers in disputing more against the Heathans than Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. He praises <hi>Lactantius</hi> very much, and confesses that in his Book of the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, he seems to Note, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> came not to <hi>Rome</hi> till the beginning of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Empire.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards he gives an account of the Councils held in the Three First Ages of the Church, and affirms that there are none more ancient than those that were held in <hi>Victors</hi> time about the end of the Second Age, upon the Celebration of <hi>Easter</hi>; and that they held no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to condemn the First Hereticks, the Disciples of <hi>Simon, Carpocratus,</hi> the <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidians,</hi> and <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> because the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> abhorr'd all their Errors.</p>
                  <p>He rejects all the Decretals attributed to the First Popes: And believes 'twas <hi>Riculphus,</hi> and <hi>Benet</hi> his Successor that counterfeited them in the Ninth Age. He ends this Volume with an abridgment of the Doctrin, Disciplin, and Morals of the Church in the Three First Ages. He Makes no Notes upon this Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because he takes it for granted, that he has proved all he says there, in the Body of his Work. Nevertheless we have not observ'd (says the Abridger) upon the reading of it, by what reasons Mr. <hi>Du Pin,</hi> in his Treatise maintains the following Proposition, which he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his short account. 1. That altho' all the Fathers agreed not that Children were born sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ect to sin and deserving damnation; yet the Church was of the contrary opinion. 2. That they Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the <hi>Sacrifice of the Mass</hi> in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Dead. 3. That they pray'd to Saints and Martyrs, and believed that they besought God for the Living. There are others also better maintain'd, and of great consequence in relation to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that now separate the Christians. 1. That the Ancients spoke of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> with much respect; that they went not so far upon the subject as they have done since; that for the Generality they did not believe she continued a <hi>Virgin</hi> after our Blessed Saviour was born; that they spoke not of her Assumption, and that there's a passage of St. <hi>Ireneus</hi> which is not favourable to her Immaculate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. 2. That the Scripture contains the chief Articles of our Faith, and that all Christians may read it. 3. That the Elements of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> were ordinary Bread and Wine mingled with Water. That they divided the consecrated Bread, into little bits; that the Deacons distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted it to those present, who received it in their hands, and that they also gave them consecrated Wine. That in some Churches this Distribution was reserved to the Priests, but in others each Person drew near to the Table and took his Portion of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> 4. That in these Three First Ages, the Unction of the Sick, which St. <hi>Iames</hi> speaks of, was not mentioned. 5. That Priests were forbid to intermix their Civil and Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual Affairs. 6. That the Priests were permitted to retain their Wives that were Espoused before Ordination, but not to Marry afterwards; Tho' Deacons were not forbidden the last. 7. That there were few Disputes in the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Morality.</p>
                  <p>There are many Tables at the end, some Chronological ones, observing the times in which the Holy Writers, and Ecclesiastick Authors Flourished, with that of their Birth and Death, others that serve to distinguish the true Works from the Supposititious. There are also Alphabetical Indexes for Authors, and for the Subjects they treat on.</p>

                  <p>THE Author speaks very freely against the Ambition of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for the Liberty of the <hi>French</hi> Church. He vigorously maintains the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Kings, Superiority of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and other points which have a long time caus'd many Disputes between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> which altho' it does not run into an actual Schism, yet it does into a <hi>Virtual</hi> one; but it wou'd be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very humbling to the <hi>Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> if its Divines had not wholly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken themselves to the <hi>Asylum</hi> of Providence. For in fine, never to agree upon the Principle of infallibity, and to dispute eternally upon Pretensions of the

greatest importance, and by a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Rule which the two Parties agree upon, I mean Tradition, is not this <hi>Eagle against Eagle, and Rome against Rome?</hi> It not this to discover its Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to all Passengers? And what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of it, if this last Remedy is wanting, that God being willing to try our Faith permits this great diversity of Opinions about the Authority of his Vicar? Indeed we must confess this is a great Latitude for a mans Faith. But let us see: Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min what Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> says in his 7 Desser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which are in very good <hi>Latin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He proposes in the I. to shew the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Form of Church-Government, and to this end he shews the division that was made of great Bodies into <hi>Metropolis</hi>'s, <hi>Iurisdictions, ArchBishopricks, Exarchats,</hi> and <hi>Patriachates.</hi> He tells us the Names and Privileges of those that possess'd these different dignities, and as these things had not a beginning all at the same time, nor have continued in their original terms, he forgets not to observe their rise and different changes; the name of <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> he believes was not used in the same sense we take it now, before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and he says, that that of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bishop was not known before the Fourth Age, when they some times gave it the Pope, and some other Prelates of the greatest Towns, but that afterwards it was given to all <hi>Metropolitans.</hi> There were also Bishops amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> which took upon 'em the Quality of Archbishops. Not because they did not see very well that to do things in order the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ought to add a Title with the real thing signified; but it depended not upon themselves to extend their Jurisdictions over other Bishops; they must therefore accommodate themselves to an abuse that they desired to cure by joyning with the Word, the thing it signify'd. <hi>Simplicibus Episcopis,</hi> says the Author, <hi>Speciosum Archopiscopi Nomen sibi vindicare haud dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficile fuit At subject as alijs Ecclesias sibi subere non i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> a facile.</hi> There are also at this time in <hi>Italy</hi> Archbishops who have no Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. What he says upon the word <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,</hi> is a very learned account of the Variations and Fortune of this Word, and may be surprizing to those that imagine Ecclesiastick affairs have been always the same. Tho' they will be yet more asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished (says the Abridger) when they shall know that Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> proves by very good reasons, that the charge of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan,</hi> or <hi>Patriarch,</hi> was neither insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> nor his Apostles, but that it proceeded from the rank that was held in certain Cities, according to the division of the Provinces, by those who in the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> had such a place in the Civil Government. Its very Natural to suppose that those who were Pastors in Capital Towns had some Authority in the Province, because its very necessary that the People shew'd have recourse to them if any difference happen'd amongst 'em, wherein they needed advice or determination. This introduced a Custom that displeased not these Pastors, and from whence they were very willing to deducea Title and Right to <hi>Possesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n</hi>; Natural <hi>Order</hi> requires it, and when Nature wills a thing its very rare that she does not accomplish it. Thus from the First Ages, the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>episcopal degree of Hierarchy began to form it self; which afterwards passed by little and little into custom, and then the Canons confirm'd it, and thus the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Government was divided accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Form of Civil Government, so that when some Cities were the chief of many Provinces, their Prelates had also some Authority over the <hi>Metropolitans</hi>; for that Reason the Churches of <hi>Rome Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> became the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ones; the First in the West, the Second in the East, and the Third in South. <hi>Constantinople</hi> was rais'd to the same degree after it became the Seat of the Emperours. As for the Church of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> it was the same, but not for the greatness of the place, but because of its Primogeniture. <hi>Rome, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> aquired Privileges beyond other Seats, either by time, Learning, or the Liberality of their Synods: Thus we may translate the words of Mr. <hi>Du Pin, Vel sibi vindicarunt, vel a Synod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>He gives many proofs for what he advances concerning the rise of <hi>Metropolis</hi>'s, after which he gives a particular account of the distribution of the Ecclesiastical Government, which was regulated after the form of the Civil Government; and when he comes to the division of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> he forgets not the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Archbishops of <hi>Arles</hi> and <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> nor the Priviledg of Primate which some <hi>French Metropolitans</hi> enjoy. He is very large upon the Authority of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,</hi> and maintains that <hi>Rome</hi> had always the First Rank, but that it's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction extended no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Suburbicary</hi> Provinces, since elsewhere he had no power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> which is one of the particular Prerogatives belonging to the <hi>Patriarchs.</hi> He confesses that the <hi>Popes</hi> have enlarged the limits of their <hi>Patriarchate</hi> more than they ought; and that they have since ruined the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledgs of all <hi>Metropolitans.</hi> He examins the Objections of the contrary Party, and many difficulties which are represented about the <hi>Patriarchate</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Sixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and some other Passages. One of these Two things cannot be deny'd when so many Innovations are Visible, either that for some time the <hi>Popes</hi> remitted a part of their Right, or that they have Usurped over other Prelates. The First is much more unlikely than the Second. But there is another Question which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:103507:242"/>
perplext those that are not used to dispute, <hi>viz</hi> how so great a number of Learned Men can be so confidently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of Innovation upon this matter, for they cannot Testifie this great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oldness without having some Matter of fact which favours them: From thence we must Judg that Tradition is intricate and uncertain, and condemn no body rashly. See what Father <hi>Lupus</hi> says, at the beginning of his Book of Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>Adversus prophanas vocum novitates, adversus quosdam temporum Novatores.</hi> Do's he seem to level this against the Protestants? And who wou'd believe that he refutes Mr. <hi>De Marca,</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bais,</hi> and Father <hi>Quesnel</hi> and <hi>Garnier?</hi> On the other side the Epithet <hi>Innovator</hi> is little less Prodigious.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> in the Second Part of this Treatise refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es F. <hi>Lupus.</hi> He First ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the Question of <hi>Right,</hi> and then comes to that of <hi>Fact</hi>; I mean that after having disputed to the utmost of his Power upon the sense of some Canons that seem to give to the Pope the Right of the last Appeal, he explains the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod they observed in the Ecclesiastick Judgments, before and since the Ancient Councils. 'Tis a very Copious Subject, and from whence a great number of fine things may be collected: The misfortune is, that Objections often prevail as much as Solutions to them who have already taken the Popes party.</p>
                  <p>The Third Part of this Work treats of Excommunication. He pretends here that 'tis a dependence upon the Keys that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> has given to his Church, and that altho' all the Faithful was the Primitive Subject of the Power of the Keys, 'tis only the Clergy that ought to deduce it to Act. He confesses however that in the First Ages Excomunications were made with the advice of the People, and that there are some Tracts of this Practice left in the Writings of St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> But by degrees the Laicks were excluded from this Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but not the Second Order of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks, for it was very rare former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Bishops made a Judgment in such Affairs without their Clergy. When a Man was Excommunicated by one Bishop, others must not receive him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Communion, but they might call a Provincial Synod upon it, and if the case was an Article of Faith, it was necessary to follow the resolution of this Synod. Excommunication in that time more employed the Church than it does now; for lest they shou'd be mistaken, they received no strangers into their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, except they carryed a Letter of Recommendation which declared their Pastors were well satisfyed with them.</p>
                  <p>The Author clears all these things with good proofs, and observes, that to shun all Surprize without much trouble, we must suppose that all the <hi>Western</hi> Churches were in Communion with those of the <hi>East,</hi> when the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> was united with the Pope; so also to shun the odious name of Schismatick or Heretick, and to have a good opinion of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians it was very necessary to agree with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and that it was without doubt the reason why the first of these two Churches, says our Author, obtained the Elogy of the <hi>Center of Unity.</hi> Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> confesses very freely that there may be some occasion in which a Person may separate from the Communion of the Pope, and not lose the quality of a good Catholick; and when he examins upon whom, and for what cause Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is allowable, he says, Kings come into the Number, but not after that manner that many Popes have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their power. <hi>viz.</hi> not any way that does any injury to a temporal Right, or dispenses with their Subjects Breach of Fidelity contrary to their Oath to the Prince. He maintains it more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to Christianity to abstain from these proceedings against Crown'd heads, than to make use of 'em, and that the Bishops of <hi>France</hi> are always against the Excomunication of their King. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he himself shews the contrary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to <hi>Philip</hi> the 1<hi>st.</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> He extreamly blames the flinging about Prohibitions, upon Towns, or Kingdoms, but thinks there's no harm in Anathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the Dead. In respect to the effects of Excommunication he wou'd not have it extend to the despoiling of a Man of his Natural Right, and the Right which others can confer upon him: Thus an Excommunicated Person should not be deprived of his Wife, his Children, his Friends, and those Offices which these Relations engage him in; but other men must not so much as eat with him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out necessity, or keep him company. We should never speak of it, if we read not the Order which is given us of shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Door against an Heretick, and not to do so much as wish him a <hi>good day.</hi> Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> Reasons Judiciously upon this, and thinks it no difficulty to believe that Excommunication hath any effect upon the Soul, and that a man who is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise disengag'd from the bonds of Sin, wou'd remain perfectly just under the Anathemas of the Church. The Journa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists of <hi>Lipswick</hi> have mentioned a Work which treats of Excommunications. It was Printed at <hi>Dijon</hi> in the Year 1683 in Twelves, at the charge of Mrs. <hi>P.H.B. T.C.</hi> who composed it. These Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men give a very advantageous Idea of it in their Month of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1684.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Disserta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> are destined to prove that the Pope is the Primate of the Church, that his Judgment may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and that the Council is above him. We shall speak but little upon his great Controversie, it shall suffice to say,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:103507:242"/>
that he proves here the Primacy of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> only by the passages of Scripture that speak of him the first in the list of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. As for these Famous Words, <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Stone.—Feed my Sheep.—I will give thee the Keys,</hi>—he shews that the Ancients have taken them in divers ways which cannot be adjusted to the Notions of the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> He maintains that the power of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles was equal, which nevertheless in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured not the Primacy of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> since this Apostle was only in quality of the first. Do we not every day, says he, see Brethren which have all precisely as much right to the Possession of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but who are all necessarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded except one, in the quality of the Eldest? (But this Argument wont be conclusive till our Author shews how the rest of the Apostles were excluded from either a Heavenly or an Earthly Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, when St. <hi>Peter</hi> was not; for so the Parallel of the Argument intimates.) He examins also what some have said of the Primacy's being founded joyntly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi>; he shews where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in consists the Prerogatives of the Pope according to his Flatterers, and what the <hi>French</hi> Divines say of it: He brings the the Examples of those Popes that have committed Errors.</p>
                  <p>He answers in particular to Mr. <hi>Schel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi> concerning the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> but says nothing to the difficulties that were published against Mr. <hi>Maimbourg</hi>'s Book. He says, the Manuscripts upon which Mr. <hi>Schelstrate</hi> founds his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are not of certain Antiquity, and that they come from suspected places, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Libraries, <hi>in quorum MSS. cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est pleraque eorum quae Curiae Romanae placitis adversabantur esse erasa aut omissa. It is certain that almost every thing which was contrary to the Maxims of the</hi> Roman Court, <hi>was either taken away or omitted in the Manuscripts of their Libraries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall speak more fully to the last Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertation of Mr. <hi>Du Pin,</hi> where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to prove that neither Pope nor Church have any power either direct or indirect over the Temporalties of Kings. 1. Because our Lord exercised no Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Jurisdiction. 2. That all the power that he gave to his Apostles was only to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the Gospel'Baptize, to Bind and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind Sinners, to Celebrate the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> to separate the Wicked from the Church, and Establish a Discipline. 3. Because Christ and his Apostles forbid the Church to exercise any Temporal Authority. 4. That according to the opinions of the Ancient Popes and Holy Fathers, the power of the Church extended no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Spiritual Affairs. 5. Because the Primitive Church exercised over its Members, only the pain of Deposition and Excommunication; for when She desired to put an end to her Rebellions by Penalties and Exiles, She had recourse to a Secular power.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> adds that if in the following Ages the Church had the power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning to Temporal punishments, it was by the Concession of Princes. To prove this, first he shews that Jesus Christ suffered not his Apostles to make use of the Sword, or to wish for fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon those that resisted them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he relates a hundred fine passages of the Fathers who say very positively, that Religion ought to constrain no one. These are the same passages that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugees alledge to the <hi>French</hi> Converters, to shew them the great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Maxims of the first Ages and these Dragooning Missioners who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd the Protestants to Sign another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith. But what use wou'd Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> make of this? Does not he see that M. <hi>Schelstrate</hi> will answer him, 'tis a mocking of the World to refer 'em to such Maxims as the Fathers themselves laughed at, when instead of suffering Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution they were in a Condition of making others suffer? Does not he see that if these Maxims were good, the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> cou'd not justify the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he has given of the Conduct he maintains? In a word, these Maxims are perfect <hi>Burlesk,</hi> if the Church can have recourse to a Secular power forcibly to constrain Hereticks to enter into its Communion: Common sense plainly says, that if Jesus Christ forbid his Church to use Violence, he has also forbidden their desiring such Assistance from Kings; and if he had permitted them to compel Persons by the Intervening of Kings, he has not command them in case of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, to make use of all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they can furnish themselves with, I mean by the credit they may have with the Multitude. But all this is inconclusive. Thus Mr. <hi>Schelstrate</hi> ruins his Adversaries if we come to Arguments <hi>ad hominem.</hi> But its true, the proofs of Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> considered abstractedly, are very solid; I mean those which I have already spoken of, and those that he founds upon the Nature of the Royal Power; for he plainly shews by Scripture and the Fathers, that it depends upon <hi>God Almighty,</hi> that its only justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in him, and that the Church is only obliged to suffer with patience, where Princes abuse their Power. These Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims were so evident to the Holy Fathers that St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> who durst not abandon them in retaining a Church contrary to the Orders of the Emperour; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he set a great value upon himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he practised no other Resistance than that of Sighs and Tears. See how Witty Men are mistaken; if they are not Orthodox in their Actions, they are at least so in their Words.</p>
                  <p>The Answering these Objections it seems Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> has found much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in; for altho' he proves very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the opinion that he wou'd refute is New, yet he cannot Demonstrate it to
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:103507:243"/>
his Antagonists, because they may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they are Truths that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a long time undiscovered, and now are made manifest to the Church. The Mystery of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is of this Number, since M. <hi>Allix</hi> has shewn us that before the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it was strongly rejected. This is therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what was never revealed as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith till the 16<hi>th</hi> Age. Why may not they also say, that the Power of the Church over the Temporalties of Kings, is another Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that lay undiscovered till <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh? This is a little perplexing, but the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> the Terrible Shield of the <hi>French Church</hi> is yet more difficult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I shall only speak a little to that of all the Learned Disputes of the Author against Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who to prove that the Temporalties of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riarchs ought to submit to the Tribunals of the Church, has Collected in one Piece all matter of Fact, that he has found in <hi>Ecclesiastick History,</hi> and the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> with all the Reasons that his great Wit and Learning cou'd furnish him with: From whence it appears that we may learn a thousand curious things in the answer of Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> to this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Cardinal.</p>
                  <p>We find many places in the Acts of the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> where it attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the Church, the Right of Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Princes; but we shall content our selves with relating the words of the 14<hi>th.</hi> Session, where 'tis Decreed that all those who observe not its determinations shall be eternally Infamous, and deprived of all Dignity, Estate, Honour, Charge, and Benefice Ecclesiastical and Civil, altho it should even be a King, an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, a Cardinal or a Pope. The Council of <hi>Basil</hi> Decreed the same thing. Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> answers to that, 1. That 'tis a Menace without effect. 2. That we may understand it shou'd be done only with the consent of Princes, and by their Voluntary Submission. 3. That as it was done in a time when the general Opinion attributed to the Church any power over Kings, so these Decrees were rash. 4. That these Councils determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it not in Form, since they did not examin it, but spoke only according to the General Style of the Prelates of that time, so that this cannot be a Decision made <hi>Conciliariter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It wou'd be needless to tell the Reader that these Answers neither taken together nor separately, can any way injure this Decree, from whence it follows either that the Church has a Right to depose So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns, or that it has made a very false Decision.

                  <p>THIS Treatise upon <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> was made in answer to Mr. <hi>Pajons</hi> Sentiments, but supposing they might with their Author Mr. <hi>Iurieu,</hi> be thought to have past it over in Silence, till he found that Mr. <hi>Pajon</hi> was not withou <hi>Proselytes</hi> to his Opinions, and therefore thought fit to Root out such Doctrins as he had plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before they were fixt too deep, <hi>To the end</hi> (says he) <hi>that if God raises our Churches from the dead, they may come out of their Tombs purified from the Corruption which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prey upon them</hi>: Indeed Mr. <hi>Papin</hi> is disposing himself to defend the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of his Uncle; but if Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> shou'd turn his Arms towards him, he cou'd expect no other fate, than that of <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus,</hi> who having put on the Armour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> wou'd therefore contend with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> and was soon foil'd by that <hi>Hero</hi>; Our Author thinks him not worthy of a Refutation, and contents himself only to say in an Advertisement, <hi>That it is a very rare thing to find one in an Age, that will go about to refute a Man who has not Commenc'd for some Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>After this severe Reprimand, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor passes on to the body of his Work, which is divided into Two Parts: In the First he treats of the <hi>Superintendence of Providence,</hi> and in the Second, of the <hi>Operations of Grace,</hi> for to comprehend well the difficulty of the <hi>Superintendence of Providence,</hi> it is necessary to explain the Followers of Mr. <hi>Pajon:</hi> They say, <hi>God before any thing had a being, did thro' his vast Intelligence Conceive the System of the World, the Concurrence of its divers Springs, and the manner whereby it was to be linkt together in all its parts</hi>: In fine, <hi>that he created the Universe upon the project which he had formed in his Mind,</hi> that is to say, after having Chained and Tyed all parts of the World together, he put the whole <hi>Machine</hi> in motion, after such a manner
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:103507:243"/>
that the indissolvable Connexion which is betwixt 'em, produces all the Events we have known to happen, and which shall hereafter happen to the end of Time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In a word, this Connexion of Causes and Events, and the force of this first Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression which every part of Nature has received, suffices to give motion to all things without any new Action or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of GOD. Thus we see the World is like a Machine whose Springs turn regularly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God after having created Second Causes, hath left them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Act according to their Nature and First Motion which he gave to the whole Universe; from whence it follows according to these Divines, That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of God is nothing else but his Decrees, by which from all Eternity he wills that Second Causes shou'd Act after a certain manner, and they pretend that they never interrupt the General Order which he hath establisht. So that 'tis but a necessary consequence to do which Men call a Miracle: In fine, he meddles not with the Will in particular Events. This System hath much relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that of Father <hi>Malebranch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> maintains on the contrary, that God immediately concurs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in all our Actions; and besides this first Impression and General Motion which he has given to Nature, he lends his immediate concurrence to all Events. Upon this foundation he vigorously at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks the System which we have spoken of: He pretends first, that without an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate concurrence he destroys the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite dependance of Creatures in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their Creator, in giving 'em, says he, the power to Act for themselves without a new Action of God; this is to draw 'em after a certain manner out of their <hi>Nothingness,</hi> and to raise them up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Quality of little <hi>Divinities</hi> which can dispose of Events. One may even assert, says he, that there is no Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at all in the Creature, because God is alwas the first Mover by vertue of his first Impression which he has made upon every part of Matter; whereas that is always to weaken this Truth of <hi>Nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which is of so great importance in <hi>Divinity,</hi> that without it, 'tis impossible to get out of the incomprehensible Abys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which the mind of Man finds in the Conduct of Providence. On the contrary this is to extol the Majesty of God, when we ascribe all the Operations of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to a perpetual dependence upon his immediate Concurrence, which seems (if we may so say) to add something to the Soveraignty of God over the Creature. 'Tis impossible without his immediate Operation (continues Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi>) to explain how objects strike the Organs of the Body, how they affect the Soul, and how the Emotions of the Blood follows that of the Mind; for 'tis certain that the Soul which is Spiritual, cannot be struck by sensible objects, nor excite the motions of the Body. Indeed if on one side the Mind cou'd be touched, it might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and if on the other, the Spirit has no material parts it cann't move the Body. Now all the difficulty is easily resolv'd by a continual Concurrence of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to maintain and form the Comerce which is betwixt the Body and the Mind, because (according to our Author) at the presentation of every object, God does by an immediate Operation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Idea which Men conceive in their mind about such Objects.</p>
                  <p>The finest Objection against this System, and which appears to be most to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is, that in denying an immediate Concurrence, he ruins the use of Prayer. You demand of God, perhaps, that he wou'd bless such a Marriage with a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fruitfulness; but if God intermeddles with nothing, and if there be a Chain of Causes whose effect is inevitable, then nothing is more useless than this Prayer: for things wou'd happen-necessarily, as they must happen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it be not so, then God intervenes and breaks this Chain to stay the course of the first Impression; and to punish Crimes or reward Vertue he inverts the General Order, and this is that which our Author calls doing a Miracle. Thus adds (Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi>) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more insipid than to tell a man that he must thank God, because, by vertue and in consequence of the first chaining together of Second Causes, there's a Temperament of Courage in himself, and that by the same means his Enemies are disposed to fearfulness; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by means of an immediate Operation, God, without inverting the Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives Victory to his People, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives their Enemies of Courage, and by consequence hears the Prayers of the Faithful without doing Miracles, or Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending the course of those Laws which he has establisht: God governs these Laws with a profound Wisdom: And as he keeps Second Causes in his hands that he may determine their Motions, so he produces Scarcity or Abundance accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he thinks fit, for the exercising of his Mercy and Justice.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the chief Difficulty which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults from both Systems is, If Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> reproaches the <hi>Pajonists,</hi> that they make God the Author of Sin, they may return the same Objection against him with greater force. Thus the Reader perceives his curiosity redoubled in this Work, whilst he sees an able Man a little over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and Mr. <hi>Iureiu</hi> in a danger worthy of himself. He says, then, that according to these Gentlemen, <hi>all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents which happen in the world, and by consequence Criminal Actions are the Effects of his first Impression.</hi> Now God having created the World Innocent, found an <hi>Innocent Chain of Second Causes,</hi> it must necessarily follow that he breaks this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:103507:244"/>
Chain of Events. For a Man can't break it without a Miracle which can't be attributed to him, and if God breaks it, he is evidently the Author of Sin. <hi>On the contrary he maintains that by saying, God concurs with particular Events, he makes him more evidently the Author of Sin, for in supposing an immediate Concurrence in every Action, God who is the first Mover, is by Consequence Cause of the Crime, and much more, if this Concurrence imposes a kind of necessity upon Mans Will which being not able to act of it self, is compelled to follow the Motion which is impressed upon it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> Answers, that when God moves and makes a man to Act, who commits a Sin, he determins him to the Action, but not to the wickedness of the Action. The Motion is from God, but the disorder which is observed in it comes from Man; for instance, when God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines my Arm to thrust a Sword in to a Mans Breast, he is not a partaker of the Crime, because this Action of Moving my Arm, and Stabbing with a Sword, is not morally an ill Action, for it is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in a Battle, or in ones just Defence; but all the wickedness depends upon the malice of the Heart, and the intention of him that Smites, of which God is not the Author.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, say these Gentlemen, <hi>God who knows the malice of the heart, does notwithstanding this knowledg lend his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Concurrence for the Execution of this Malice. Now if God refus'd his Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the ill Intention of the Man wou'd not proceed to its Effect but it seems by his immediate Concurrence he lends</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (if we may so say) <hi>his Arm towards the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of a Crime. Thus, is there not less danger to say, that God having once given Motion to the whole</hi> Machine <hi>of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, he leaves it to accomplish Second Causes according to his Eternal Decrees, and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Order he hath Establish'd? Else,</hi> add they, <hi>God lends not his immediate Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence only for an Exteriour Action, by which a Man lifts his Arm, but also according to Mr.</hi> Jurieu, <hi>for the inward Action of the Will:</hi> Now as a Crime resides in the Will, which cou'd not be determined without an immediate Operation of God, it follows that God is the Author of the Criminal motion of the Will; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, To hate God, its difficult to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how God can Act as to the Substance of the Action, and lend his immediate Concurrence for the Motion by which Man lifts himself up against God, without partaking a great deal of the Evil which is inseparable from the Action.</p>
                  <p>To remove this difficulty, Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> says, that in the hatred of God there are two things; one is the motion of the Hatred, the other is the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this motion on Gods Side: Now the motion of Hatred is not ill in it self, for one may very justly hate certain things and God may concur thereto very justly. But the determination of this motion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods part, is a Moral Evil, and a Moral Evil is not an Entity, but a Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being, with which God does not concur, because he does not concur to a Nonentity. God does well determin the Will to a Real and Positive Action, that is to say, to Good; but he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it not to <hi>Nothingness,</hi> that is to say, Evil or Sin. It is true, that God by General Laws is obliged to make use of Nature in things themselves, which are contrary to his Will: Thus he moves a Person who is advanced in Sin according to the desires of a corrupted Mind, and he makes him sensible of debauched Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in the abuse of Creatures, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Laws of the Union of the Soul and Body, which he himself hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, because the sensation of Pleasure is a Physical Good, and not ill in it self; and for God to will and do good as the occasional cause of this Pleasure wou'd be a Criminal abuse of the Creature; but God wills not that which is Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in it, and is not the Cause of Moral Impurity. He Illustrates this by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a Stone, which being thrown towards Heaven, instead of following the Impression of the Motion which the Hand gave it, it stops its course and falls back again upon the Earth; Because 'tis carryed on by its natural Heaviness. Thus God lifts up the Will, to make it produce an Act of Love. Doubtless if it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the motion which was imprest upon it, it wou'd be carry'd towards its Good; but the Will corruptly determining this Love which is Imprinted upon it by the first Cause, causes it to fall upon a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Object.</p>
                  <p>In the Second part Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> refutes the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Pajon,</hi> upon the manner how Grace works upon the Will. Mr. <hi>Pajon,</hi> after having laid down as a Principle, that God lends not his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence to particular Events, and that the Will is subject to the first Impression, which we have spoken of, conceived a certain meeting together, and a certain management of external Circumstances, which joyned with <hi>the Word,</hi> do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, make all the Efficacy of Grace. These principal Circumstances, are the Disposition of the Organs, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, Education, Age, which often repair what the Passions of Youth have spoild; Poverty which makes People sooner hearken to the Exhortations of Repentance; whereas Prosperity blinds 'em with Security and Pride, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances which confirm the Faith, whereas Adversity weakens our Affiance in God. Now Providence presides over all these Circumstances, so that being assembled together, they necessarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their Effects, the Conversion of Souls.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> reduces this Opinion to Ten Propositions, which he engages Successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: We shan't undertake to follow him
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:103507:244"/>
throughout, we shall content our selves to examin three of 'em, which will suffice to give a thorow knowledg of Mr. <hi>Pajons</hi> Sy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tem, and the manner how he is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt in this Work: One is, <hi>that ye will always follows the Understanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to enlighten the Understanding, its suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficient to encline the Passions and the Will.</hi> That is to say; before all things we must perswade the Understanding, because a Man can't will or consent where he is not convinc'd; whence it follows, that the Understanding inclines the Will; when it is perswaded, there must not be an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Action of the Mind upon the Will, because there must be only a Predication to enlighten and convince the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by the Evidence of Truth. Mr. <hi>Iurieu,</hi> who hath studied much the heart of Man, and knew all its foldings, tells us quite contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and not the Understanding which determins the Will. They prevent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation; the violent Motions which they cause, leave not the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time to judge.</p>

They raise up an Eternal War in themselves, and after much strugling they are carry'd away to sensible Objects and Charms, in spight of the Light of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Man believes a thousand things, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because he wou'd believe 'em, and his Passions plead for an Interest; even the Air of a Mans Face changes accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Nature of the Passions, so much is Passion the Mistress of the Judgment. In fine, according to Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is so little Master of the Will, that we ought to look upon it as a Passive Faculty, which receives Ideas as they are imprest upon it; 'tis an Ice which receives Images and reflects 'em more or less distinctly; now as it acquiesces it determines not; the Will ceases not to revolt and follow the Motions of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. If the Understanding resists, it is only in those things wherein it hath not acquir'd a habitude of Sinning without remorse, and which stay upon the brink of the Precipice, being at a loss how to free themselves. The Understanding is almost always subject to the Will, which disposes of all its Reasonings; whence we may conclude, that 'tis not necessary to pass through the Understanding in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to penetrate the Will; and as it is this which determines, so 'tis this by which the Holy Ghost also Acts immediately upon the Mind: Thus the Joy that the Souls of the Faithful possess, is not a <hi>Reason'd Motion,</hi> nor does it arise from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; 'tis inward Grace which gives it birth: In fine, it must be an immediate Action of the Holy Ghost upon the Will to overcome its inclination to Evil, and draw it back from sensible things.</p>
                  <p>The other Proposition we have chosen, is this, <hi>That the Word of God contains Moral Demonstrations, capable of themselves only to produce a full and intire certainty of the truth of it.</hi> That is to say, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has such Evident Characters of the Divinity of its Author, that they are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to form this certain perswasion, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Scripture is Divine. I know not,</hi> (says Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi>) <hi>that ever man yet durst advance what these Gentlemen have done, without having a design to lessen the Power and Light of these Holy Characters: I dare affirm that there's not one which can't be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by the profane, not one that will amount to a proof, or to which nothing can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But (say these Gentlemen) It is true, there's nothing which the Mind of Man can't turn into Darkness; nevertheless; if these Characters of Scripture are not sufficiently evident to produce this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, will it be a fault in the Wisdom of God to make use of means which are incapable of producing the Effect which he proposed? And will it be a lawful excuse for those who are chain'd in the Darkness of <hi>Paganism?</hi> God will only reprove the mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce of their heart and the source of their incredulity; since he hath hid his Word under so great obscurity that the Characters of Divinity which it bears along with it cannot <hi>make one proof.</hi> They add, that if by the Assistance of the Holy Spirit, there are not found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sufficient proofs to produce a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty which excludes the <hi>fear that the Contrary can't be true,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> says himself, then there will be an eternal restlesness: For a man can't be fully assur'd that the Scripture is Divine by the Scripture it self; doubtless Grace can form a confidence which excludes all doubts that the <hi>Scripture is Divine</hi>: But as Grace is not so prevalent that one can't sometimes be perswaded by the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and darkness of Reason, instead of that of Grace: So that one shall be at a loss to be so much assured of the Divinity of the Scripture, that there won't rest some doubt, and <hi>some fear that the contrary will be true.</hi> In fine, can't the Scripture be said at least to produce a certain and humane Faith without the Assistance of the Holy Spirit, and can't we convince a Heathen that it is Divine by the Light of Reason only?</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> confesses that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appears more contrary to Reason than that these Character of themselves shou'd be able to produce an intire cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. For Man is full of Errors and prejudices, which blind his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hinder him from discovering the Truth. Besides, the subtilty of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and their disproportion with the powers of the Soul, distract the Reason and cause Insurrections in it. Thus he pretends we can have only that certainty
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:103507:245"/>
of the Divinity of the Scripture that he calls <hi>Adhesion,</hi> which is produced from the Importance and not Evidence of the thing. For Example, <hi>I believe that such a one is my Father,</hi> I have no demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, says he, but the importance of this Truth upon which the Obedience I owe him is founded, and the right to his Succession makes my Will adhere thereto. Thus as Sensible Advantages recur from this great Truth, <hi>the Scripture is Divine,</hi> so it is the visible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of man to believe whatsover that Commands, and that his Will shou'd be absolutely determined by it. In a Word, the Holy Spirit which acts in us, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces with these Characters a greater certainty than naturally could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and creates an inward sense of the sweet Efficacy of the Word. Without the Operation of Grace the Scripture wou'd continue like an unfruitful Seed upon the heart; for it is that which strengthens and encourages the Mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all its doubts and diffidence.</p>
                  <p>The last Proposition that we shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, is, that <hi>the Word of God Preacht under Proper External Circumstances, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd by Providence, may cause an Irresist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible Grace, and overcome all the wickedness of Mans Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Foundation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy in Question; Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> makes no scruple of saying that this is a <hi>Pelagian</hi> Opinion, and that it wou'd be to make use of the Hereticks Arms which have disturb'd the Church. God, said <hi>Pelagiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, works in us the Will to do what is Holy and Good, by Inflaming us with the Prospect and Recompence of future Glory to draw us back from Earthly Concupisence in which we are overwhelm'd.</hi> Now the Scripture is full of such passages as intimate that God by an Almighty hand and by an invisible and internal Efficaciousness, independent of External Circumstances, Acts in the Depths of our Souls, and that Grace pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates even into the deepest and most secret Faculties. It wou'd follow from the System of these Gentlemen, that the Progress of the Gospel and that of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy is the same; Philosophy perswades by a happy Concourse of Circumstances, that is to say, by its Eloquence, turn of Wit, Art of well managing its Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to the inclination of the Auditor, and its Address, which must give an Air of Evidence to all its Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. These are not the methods of the Holy Ghost; its very true that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances are not without their use, but we ought not to give 'em any force which <hi>Necessitates</hi> or attribute to 'em an <hi>Irresistible Grace.</hi> On the contrary, a new Action of the Holy Ghost is displayd upon the Will and makes it feel a certain secret Charm at the sight of an Evangelick Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which begins to wean it from sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible things, and disposes the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a favourable Judgment of Truth and Vertue: In fine, it causes preventing and over-ruling Grace upon the Will, and God Seconds our Endeavours and places us in necessary Circumstances which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Act immediately upon the Heart.</p>
                  <p>We shall conclude with a proof which Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> here makes use of, and which deserves our consideration. He maintains that if a Concourse and Order of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, is the only Source of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and if Grace depends upon the first admittance of the knowledge of the Truth, then the greatest Wits ought to be the greatest Saints, altho', says he, Experience shews the contrary: God hath not made choice of the greatest Scholars to be partakers of his greatest Graces; the Church was first taken out of the Bosom of the Vulgar, and the great Wits which are distinguisht in the World, have not embrac'd Christianity. <hi>We may ordinarily observe that those whom God hath endued with the most Elevated Devotion and Fervent Zeal, are Common Persons.</hi> However we find a few great Men who are as Examplary for their Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as Merits. Mr. <hi>Iurieu</hi> himself is an Example. Nevertheless it is true, this is a reproach which is always cast upon great Wits, they often resemble Persons whose gust is too fine to abide any thing but Meats well seasoned. Ignorance more surely finds Devotees. Now if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these Gentlemen, the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is the great Spring which Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates all the Faculties of the Soul, one might conclude from thence, that those who have the most Light shou'd have more Zeal, and certainty in Religion than meaner Spirits. Wherefore, adds Mr <hi>Iurieu,</hi> we can by no means doubt that the Faith and Piety of these Devout Souls, these who are <hi>Poor in Spirit,</hi> was not produc'd by an immediate Operation of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which hath imprinted the Efficacy of its Grace in their Souls.</p>

                  <head>A Relation of the Inquisition at <hi>Goa,</hi> At <hi>Leyden 1687.</hi> in <hi>125.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ALL the World knows in General what the <hi>Inquisition</hi> is; some Books have given such descriptions of it (and not exceeded the Truth) that one cannot read without Horror and great Emotion: 'Tis even very surpizing to Reflect, that Religion that ought to inspire its followers with Justice and Humanity, can Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorise these Barbarous Formalities, and horrible punishments which make this Tribunal so formidable. But few men know the particulars of what passes, for the Mysteries thereof are almost impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable. This Author is one that informs us by his own Experience; he is a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> that relates this sorrowful Adventure, who confesses 'tis not without some
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:103507:245"/>
regret that he makes it publick; because the <hi>Inquisitor,</hi> according to their General Custom had forced an Oath from him never to discover the Secret. Some Pious Persons, that were Timerous, Strengthened his scruples; till others of a better Judgment convinced him that the benefit of the publick Dispensed him from an Oath that was extorted by his Tormentors. His Relation ought to be so much the less suspected, as his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay shew'd he was not in hast to publish it, since 'twas above Eight Years after his return; so that his resentment being lessen'd by time, it has little or no part in his recital.</p>
                  <p>He tells us, that being a Catholick and well Instructed in Divinity, he had a great mind to go into the <hi>Indies,</hi> which he prosecuted and Landed at <hi>Daman</hi> an <hi>East-India</hi> Town under the Dominion of the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> which are the most Superstitious People living, and the <hi>French Catholicks</hi> are Hereticks when compar'd to them. They use to carry into their Assemblies the Image of some Saint, and if there's any one that will not give Alms he must at least kiss the Image. Our Traveller not being able to contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at this sight from Laughing at them, all the Devotees were Scandalized at him, his refusal rendring his Faith sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious; some time after being at a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese</hi> Gentlemans house, who always had an Image in his Bed which he kissed with much Ardour, our Author instructed him upon it, and told him that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks Interpreted the worship of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages much to their disadvantage, and therefore it wou'd be better to Moderate it. It happened the same time that one of his Neighbours seeing a Crucifix at the head of his Bed, piously advised him to cover this Image, lest by chance he shou'd have some Amorous adventure in his Bed. Upon which the Author had the Imprudence to Laugh, (the Scruple appearing to him so very pleasant) and to make some profane Raileries upon the Holy Custom of the Women of that Country, which wou'd not grant any Favours untill they had Lockt up their Chaplets and covered all the Images in their Chambers.</p>
                  <p>This multitude of Crimes made him to be taken notice of in the <hi>S. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>: Besides, he had another Misfortune, for he made frequent Visits to a Lady which a Priest was in Love with, that was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to the Inquisition: This Priest was very much disgusted at it, and some appearances gave him great Disquiet; this Jealousie animating his Zeal, he rid himself of his Rival by casting him into the <hi>Inquisition.</hi> The description he gives of his horrible Prison is capable to touch the hardest heart with Compassion. The Stench and Darkness of it was so insupportable that Fifty Persons Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themselves with Despair. He was afterwards removed to <hi>Goa,</hi> where resides the greatest Tribunal of the <hi>Portuguese Inquisition</hi> in the <hi>Indies</hi>; all the Favour that he found there, was the choise of the lightest Chain of all the Criminals. He had there the Mortification to see his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val there, who came to feed his Eyes with his unworthy Triumph.</p>
                  <p>As soon as ever he came he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoiled of every thing that he had; they shaved off all his Hair, as is the Custom, without Distinction of Sex, when first they come <hi>into the Holy Prison of the S. Office.</hi> The Sacraments are never Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to any one there, nor do they ever hear Mass: There Reigns so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a Silence that they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ease themselves by Complaints and Tears. There are Two <hi>Inquisitors</hi> at <hi>Goa,</hi> he which is call'd the Grand <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor</hi> is always a <hi>Secular Priest</hi>; and the other is a <hi>Dominican Monk.</hi> The <hi>Huissiars</hi> are Persons of the Chiefest Quality, who think it a Glory to be of the Noble Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and have no other Recompence than the Honour of serving <hi>so holy a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal.</hi> Afterwards he Relates the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Formalities he observed there. He says, tis no wonder that such Men as only Examine the outside and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of things should be deceived in Favour of the Integerity of this Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; For they make a great shew of Justice and Humanity. There must be Seven Witnesses to Convict the Accused, and if the Criminal Confesses he's guilty, he is acquitted of his Fact for the Confession, and obtains the Favour of being Suspended to the <hi>Secular Power.</hi> But in Reality they violate all the Laws of Justice and Charity, never suffering him to see the Witnesses that accuse him nor is he never permitted to reproach them with it.</p>
                  <p>They persist in the Desiring him to confess the Crime that he is supposed guilty of, and almost force him by this detestable Maxim that is amongst 'em, <hi>we will rather burn thee as guilty, than suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to be thought that we have imprisoned thee unjustly.</hi> Thus the Inquisition is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the Right, and cannot Err, which infatuates the People, and makes them believe that the Holy Spirit presides over all their Actions; for the Miserable Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims <hi>of the S. Office</hi> Reciprocally accuse one another, to make others alike guilty of their imaginary Crimes; so by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence a Man may be very innocent and have Forty or Fifty Witnesses against him. In short, the Goods of those that are punished with Death, and those that escape it by Confession are equally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscated, since they are all reputed guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nevertheless that which is very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, is, that these pretended Offenders from whom by Torture they very often force a Confession, are also obliged to Declare publickly that they used much Clemency towards 'em. If a Man pleases himself
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:103507:246"/>
after being escaped from their hands, with endeavouring to justify himself he shall never more have forgiveness; and on the Contrary, he that will live secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is forc'd to tell the World his Goods were most justly Confiscated. He is not therefore permitted to discover the least thought of his Heart. This is certainly an imitating the Cruelty of <hi>Caligula,</hi> who after he had caused the Sons of a <hi>Roman Knight</hi> to be Stab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>Those that they treat most rigorously, are the <hi>Iews,</hi> which were chased by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> and <hi>Isabella,</hi> and fled for refuge into <hi>Portugal.</hi> They force them to turn <hi>Christians</hi>; and altho' they have been there near two Ages, they still call 'em <hi>New Christians</hi> by way of contempt. The scandal of Heresie or Judaism, is never defaced; for <hi>Rome</hi> always preserves her Suspicions and Distrusts: It looks very su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiciously, as if she was not well perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the force and evidence of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons she makes use of, since she distrusts the sincerity of those Converts she has made. Be it how it will, yet these new <hi>Christians</hi> have not got the good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Inquisitors; and Suspicions, in respect to them, are more severely punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than a real Crime in another.</p>
                  <p>But to return to what personally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards our Author; he says, that after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long time shut up in the dark Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <hi>of the Holy Inquisition,</hi> he was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Audience. He prostrated himself at the feet of the Inquisitor, by this humble posture and his tears to prevail upon him. But this obdurate Judge having commanded him to rise up, conjured him coldly, <hi>by the Bowels of the Mercy of our Lord Iesus Christ</hi> to confess his crime: He with a good courage recited all we have related, and alledged the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to justifie himself about Images. He observ'd only, that the Inquisitor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared surprized, and that he was so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, he never heard that Council mentioned before: But they sent him back without making any explanation of the Crimes he was guilty of. He was carried three or four times back to the same Audience, and the same desires were reiterated to make him confess without further clearing of the Matter, so that at last he abandoned himself to Despair through the slowness and cruelty of these dumb Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and resolved to put a Period to his Life. To effect which, he feigned himself sick, and said he wanted bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they let him Blood, and assoon as he was alone, he again opened his Vein, and had bled to death, if the Keeper had not entred; who instead of having that Compassion, which such a sight ought to have produced, chain'd up his Flands and his Neck: What redoubled his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, was, those that served him with what he had, never spoke to him, that by all manner of Circumstances they might encrease his Terror.</p>
                  <p>As to what they call <hi>the Acts of Faith,</hi> which are the days wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Guilty, and absolve the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, they come but once in two or three years, so he expected that time with much impatience. He was howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver very much surprized, when at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night a Keeper brought him a suit of black Cloth, streaked with white, and roughly commanded him to put it on; he doubted not but it was to be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to his punishment: Thus after many efforts, being fill'd with mortal Apprehensions, he took the Habit; two hours after he was brought out, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted under a Gallery, where was a doleful sight, there he saw 200 of his miserable Companions, set in order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Wall, to whom they did not so much as permit the use of their Eyes. They were not all cloathed after the same manner: For their Habits were different according to the nature of their Crime and Condemnation; those that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined to fire, have Garments, whereon the Picture of the Sufferer is laid upon fire-brands, with flames and Devils all about him. As they were ignorant of the formalities of the <hi>holy office,</hi> so there might be observ'd in their Faces the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers motions of fear, shame and grief, wherewith they were inspir'd. For it seems 'tis a part of their Ingenuity to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get nothing that may add to their fear. As soon as the day appear'd, the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wretches were conducted to the Church, holding in their Hands a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Wax Candle for the <hi>Act of Faith,</hi> where every one received his Judgment. After two years Imprisonment, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was condemned to serve five years in the Gallies, with Confiscation of his Goods; those who were to be burnt, were given up to the Secular power, by the holy Inquisition, with instant prayer to use them with Clemency, or at least, if they thought them worthy of Death, <hi>that it might be without effusion of Blood.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Justice doubts not of the Infallibility of the holy Tribunal, but burns 'em im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately without Examination, agreeing with much Humanity, that that is no Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of Blood. They carry also with 'em some Boxes full of dead Men's Bones, that have been accused many years before, and this makes up part of the Process. But to return to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, after he was redeemed from the Gallies, by the Credit of his Friends, he return'd into <hi>France,</hi> being resolv'd to <hi>pay no more Visits to the Inquisition, nor engage a Rival Inquisitor above all Rivals.</hi>

                  <p>THis Edition of <hi>Virgil</hi> is not less fine for its being one of the first Books, which were Printed in <hi>England</hi> in the same form as the Authors printed it in <hi>Holland, cum Notis Variorum.</hi> And it may be said, that no Authors have been better printed in <hi>France,</hi> than this; and its hoped that divers more will be printed in the same manner. There is at the end an Idea of all the Words, which may almost serve as well as that of <hi>Erythraens,</hi> provided it is correct, which is pretty difficult in so great a number of errors. As for the Text, it lacketh much of being so correct, as it is well printed, which happens undoubtedly in that the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers have not made Proofs enough thereof to be revised, as it also happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in <hi>Holland,</hi> but too often.</p>
                  <p>All the World knoweth what the method of those is, who have comment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Poets for the <hi>Dauphin.</hi> Father <hi>de la Rue</hi> complains justly, that the Learned, who had laboured until now upon the Ancients, applyed themselves more to acquire Reputation in making long unnecessary digressions on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, which they commented upon, than to make young folks comprehend well the sense thereof. He might besides have said, that it's easier to play the Learned Man, in putting off his collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the occasion of one word, which is not more clear thereby, than to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Author step by step, and to leave no obscurity in his Expressions and Thoughts, as those who have studied for the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> have endeavoured to do. This last Design is equally advantageous for those who begin to read the Writings of the Ancients, or who hardly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them; and painful for those who undertake to remove all the difficulties which are found therein. This is what ought to oblige the Publick, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the faults which may be remarked in Interpretations, otherwise so exact and agreeable to the Author.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding a part of what we have proposed to our selves, in this Work, consisting in making known the Opinions of the Publick, or even of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular People, upon Books which are Publisht, as well as to tell what they contain, it will not be amiss to remark here what the Publick finds fault with, in some of the <hi>Authors</hi> which are for the use of the <hi>Dauphin.</hi> The Reader may observe if he pleaseth, that we only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late here what we often heard said of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers able Persons in such things, and not our particular Opinions. It cannot be denyed that it is not a thing which Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially belongeth to the History of Books, to tell what the Learned have thought thereof, as soon as they were made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. And as an Historian ought not to have the boldness to relate any false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, so there is no Truth but what he ought to speak of, he ought to flatter no Body, nor testifie hatred against any whosoever. <note n="*" place="margin">

                        </gap>quid veri non audeat; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua suspicio gratiae sit in scribendo, nequa simultatis.</hi> We were obliged to make this small Digression, fearing it should be thought that we have forgotten our Promise, which we made three years ago, of not judging of the Works where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we should make mention.</p>
                  <p>Some Persons who have carefully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed themselves to the Study of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, find, two things to be reprehended in several Authors in Question. The First is, that in the Paraphrase they have not only applyed themselves to Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase the Original by an equal Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Words, but also have for the most part retained certain Metaphorical Terms, which helpeth on with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity of the Authors Style. They have even been contended to put the Terms of the Original, according the Order of Construction without expounding them in the Notes, tho' they were not clear. It would therefore be a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable that they had so scrupulously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed themselves to the number of Words. 1. Because it is impossible to speak plainer than the Author, without adding some Terms. For Example, <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> saith in his IV. Eclogue, <hi>Ultima Cumaei venit jam Carminis aetas</hi>; word for word, <hi>The last Age of the Camae'an Verses is come.</hi> F. De la Rue Traslates, <hi>Nunc attigimus extremum saeculum vaticinij Cumaea Sybil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae.</hi> Those who begin to read <hi>Virgil</hi> may believe that this Signifies, that we shall soon cease to respect the Verses of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bil of <hi>Cumes,</hi> and that they are going to be buried in Oblivion; or some such thing. He should have said, <hi>Attigimus extremam aetatem Mundi à Sybilla Cumaea decanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi> we are come to the last Age of the World, so call'd by the <hi>Sybill</hi> of <hi>Cumes.</hi> 2. What availeth it to Paraphrase <hi>Idle Epithets,</hi> chiefly when they are clear, as when they Paraphrase <hi>Cast a Lucina,</hi> by <hi>pudica Diana</hi>? There hath never been an <hi>impudica Diana,</hi> and this <hi>Epithet</hi> doth but render the Prose flat and affected; for it's known that <hi>Poets</hi> have Priviledges which <hi>Orators</hi> have not. 3. In keeping a Metaphor in the Paraphrase, they speak as obscurely as the Author. <hi>Virgil</hi> had said, <hi>Si canimus Sylvas, Sylvae sint Consule dignae</hi>; if we Sing, we Sing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:103507:247"/>
Songs, let them be so fine as that a Consul may not Scorn to hear them. <hi>F. de la Rue</hi> saith, <hi>Si cantamus Sylvas Sylvae deceant Consulem.</hi> It's true, he expounds in his Note <hi>Sylva</hi> by <hi>Country Song,</hi> but if he had put it in his Paraphrase, that would have spared him a Note; and the Terms of <hi>deceant Consulem</hi> are at least as obscure as those of the Original. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be that it had been better to render the Metaphors into simple words, that the Young Folks should Learn the Figured Style, and that which is not so.</p>
                  <p>Besides this manner of Reckoning words hath produced another obscurity, which is not of a less consequence; which is, that when the Author hath put no Particle to remark the Connection of his Discourse, none hath been put likewise by the Commentator, which makes those who want Notes to understand it, not understand the Sequel, and think they read a <hi>fiddle faddle. Virgil</hi> thus begins to his IV. Eclogue.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Sicelides Musae paulò majora canamus,</l>
                     <l>Non omnes arbusta juvant humilesque myricae.</l>
                     <l>Si canimus Sylvas Sylvae sint Consule dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>We do not immediately see what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection this Third Verse can have with the Preceeding, beause there is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction missing, which <hi>F. de la Rue</hi> hath also omitted in his Paraphrase. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Conjunction should have been joyned in this wise. <hi>O ye Muses of Sicilia</hi> (or <hi>Bucolicks</hi>) <hi>let us sing Subjects a little more elevate, for every one is not taken with Verses, which treat of Shrubs and Brambles</hi> (or such as speak of Country Subjects) <hi>Or if we Sing Country Airs, let 'em be so fine, &amp;c.</hi> the Particle <hi>Vel</hi> or <hi>Aut</hi> omitted at the beginning of the Third Verse causes here an obscurity which hath so much troubled the greatest part of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>These faults which are found every where in many Authors who have taken pains for the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> without doubt lessens the great profit that Youth might draw from thence. But he says, that besides these defects which regard the Method, there's a great many places wherein these Gentlemen have not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the true sense of the Original. There are some who believe that we shou'd not speak Latin if we said, <hi>Magnus Saeculorum ordo, Magni Menses,</hi> in the same sense as we say, <hi>Alexander Magnus, Pompeius Magnus.</hi> However thus it is that Father <hi>la Rue</hi> explains the Epithet <hi>Magnus,</hi> in the Verses of <hi>Virgil,</hi> from whence the words that we have cited are taken. He says also, that the word <hi>adeo,</hi> in the 11<hi>th.</hi> Verses of the same Eclogue, does not signify <hi>porrò,</hi> as F. <hi>la Rue</hi> believes, but <hi>Yes</hi>: So that <hi>Virgil</hi> after having said that the Golden Age is about to come, and after having used Seven Verses upon that, he wou'd continue thus, Yes, Pollio <hi>it shall be under your Consulship, that this Child, the Honour of our Age, shall have its Birth, &amp;c.</hi> F. <hi>de la Rue,</hi> by <hi>Decus hoc aevi</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the Golden Age, since he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands it <hi>Gloria haec aetatum inchoabitur</hi>; whereas it is generally believed <hi>aevi decus,</hi> can signify only the <hi>Honour of our Age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, whether it be so or no, there has been diversity of Opinions upon these sorts of things; and a Person must be so very well Verst in ancient Authors, to distinguish who is in the Right, that few Men are capable Judges in this affair. But here's another thing which depends upon good sense, and not barely upon the study of the Latin Tongue, which is to be observ'd, <hi>viz.</hi> to mark frequently where the Ancients have varied from certain Rules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being founded upon Reason ought to be reviewed in all Ages. For, in fine, as it wou'd be foolish to despise these Admirable Models of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, so we ought on the other hand to avoid falling into an over-respect to them, or approving of their oversights: The finest Wits sometimes mistake and commit Errors, which Persons inferior to them can observe: 'Tis not amiss to preserve this same natural Liberty, which the Ancients themselves have used with so great a freedom, which consists in blaming what is blameable, and praising what is paise worthy. On the contrary, the greatest part of our Learned Men at this day, can't forbear boasting of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, nor suffer the least thing to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, as if a Fault, and an Ancient Poet or Historian were incompatible. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless this is to spoil the Judgment of Youth, and to accustom them to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire every thing, without judging any thing; and this General Observation is also more dangerous than some Judgments that are a little freer; for Nature has given us a Right, to determine after a solid examination. There's also another Preamble which we shou'd be very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pass over, but that the Humour of our Criticks has made it necessary to be observ'd.</p>
                  <p>To give an Example of an Error, for we must call it by its right Name, <hi>Virgil</hi> ought to be reprehended; we shall relate some Verses of a Discourse which <hi>Iupiter</hi> is made to speak with <hi>Venus</hi> the Mother of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> in the First Book of his <hi>Aeneids. Iupiter</hi> there informs his Daughter what was to be the Destiny of <hi>Virgil</hi> and his Posterity. After having spoken of him he comes to his <hi>Ascanius,</hi> and speaks thus to <hi>Venus,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>At puer <hi>Ascanius,</hi> cui nunc Cognomen Iülo.</l>
                        <l>Additur, Ilus erat, dum res stetit Ilia regno.</l>
                     </q>
                     <q>But this little <hi>Ascanius</hi> who is now Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd <hi>Iulus,</hi> and who was called <hi>Ilus,</hi>
                        <pb n="467" facs="tcp:103507:247"/>
whilst the Kingdom of <hi>Troy</hi> stood.</q>
This Reflection upon the Name of <hi>Asca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> is insupportable in the Mouth of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> speaking to the Grandmother of this Child, and in a Discourse so serious as his; if the Poet wou'd have made <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius</hi> known, he ought to have inserted that in his Narration, and not to have made <hi>Iupiter</hi> spoke of it, nor even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert it by a Parenthesis in so fine an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue. One might perhaps say, for the Excuse of <hi>Virgil,</hi> that the NUNC shews that this was not the Poet that spoke. He seems to have imitated <hi>Homer,</hi> who to instruct his Readers in the Customs of the Gods, introduc'd <hi>Iupiter</hi> speaking to <hi>Thetis,</hi> as if she knew not more than Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, that <hi>what he consents to by nodding with his Head, is irrevocable</hi>

                  <p>THIS Work is Composed of three parts, since 'tis a Collection of <hi>Greek</hi> Pieces, before which are long Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, and after them very fine Notes.</p>
                  <p>The Collection is not only made of rare pieces; for the Epistle of St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and that of St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> which are at the beginning, are common enough, but there are others which are very curious, as, <hi>A Treatise of the Occumenic Councils by</hi> Germain, <hi>Patriarch of</hi> Constantinople: <hi>The Preface of</hi> Euthymius <hi>upon the Psalms: An Account of the five Patriarchates of the Church, by</hi> Nilus Doxopatrius: <hi>A Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a Christian and a Sarazen, by</hi> Bartholomew <hi>of</hi> Edessa: <hi>A Conference between a Grecian and a Roman.</hi> The Latin Version is annexed to all these Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and they have been taken either out of the King's Library, or that of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> or <hi>Leyden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may consider the Prefatory Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses as divided into four parts, and for the first take all that the Author says about his being engaged by chance to Compose this Work, and how he has brought it to that perfection it now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us in. He dissembles not the Grief and Vexation that he received from a new Edition of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> being begun at <hi>Oxford</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For as he had made it the Care and Study of his whole Life to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and Explain it; so he thought none else shou'd ever have had the Glory of giving it to the Publick. Having been prevented of his hopes, tho' not without great Mortification, he e'en resolved to be content with that Printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and go upon this design, of Collecting these Pieces together. The three other parts of these Prefatory Discourses, are so many Dissertations, one upon St. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp</hi> and his Writings; the second upon St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> and his Epistle; the third upon <hi>Hipolitus,</hi> and the greatest part of the Works that are Attributed to him.</p>
                  <p>Before he begins his first Dissertation, he tells us, That he had no design to publish the Epistles of <hi>Polycarp</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> because they were already so well known; but coming into <hi>Holland,</hi> he heard every where a great Rumour, that was surprizing enough; <hi>viz.</hi> That M. <hi>Rulleus,</hi> who was Chaplain to Mr. <hi>Paetus,</hi> during his Embassy to <hi>Spain,</hi> and who afterwards making a Voyage into <hi>Italy,</hi> brought back from thence a Manuscript of the Epistle of St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> above twice as big as any that has yet appear'd as his. Mr. <hi>Rulleus</hi> was very Inquisitive after it, and himself intended to publish this rare Treasure; but Death preventing him, his Brother made a Present of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script to Mr. <hi>Le Moyne,</hi> who soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they had taken the Epistle of St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> for part of St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were both joyned together, without any distinction. The Jesuit <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> a very Learned Man, and very much accustom'd to Manuscripts, was also fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the like mistake. Which made me remember, that formerly the piece of <hi>Minucius Felix's</hi> was taken for the eighth Book of <hi>Arnobius,</hi> because it was affixed to his seven, and that it was ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined instead of <hi>Octavius,</hi> which was its true Title, it ought to be read <hi>Octavus.</hi> It must be very welcome to the World; that the Author, according to the last Will of Mr. <hi>Rulleus,</hi> made an Impression of these two Epistles, for there are many fine Observations added, which are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new.</p>
                  <p>In his first Dissertation he maintains, That St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> suffer'd Martyrdom on one of the Days of <hi>the Great Sabbath,</hi> which was the beginning of the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick Year, the first Day of the Month <hi>Nisan,</hi> according to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> He says, That the Jews gave the Name <hi>of the Great Sabbath</hi> to the two first Days of the Civil and Ecclesiastick Years, the first of which began in the Month <hi>Tisri,</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> and the last in the Month <hi>Nisan,</hi> or <hi>March.</hi> These two Days were call'd by preference <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but the first Day of <hi>Tisri</hi> was prefer'd to the other, insomuch, that the first Day <hi>Nisan</hi> was only the <hi>second Great Sabbath,</hi> whence it comes (adds Mr. <hi>Moyne,</hi>) that in the Gospel according to St. <hi>Luke</hi> there is mention made of a <hi>second first Sabbath,</hi>

                     </gap>, which perhaps is so nam'd, because they call'd the first Day of the Year <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This Observation will appear very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to those that understand both Lan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guages The Author says, There is much reason to believe that <hi>Polycarp</hi> dyed in the Year 167. under the Consulship of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratus,</hi> and he maintains this Cronologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Observation very learnedly against all those that affirm he suffered Martyrdom in any other Year, and to remove all difficulty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he shews that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Quadratus</hi>'s. There was <hi>T. Numidius Quadratus,</hi> who was Consul in the Year, 167. and <hi>L. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There is a happy Illustration of a very considerable matter of Fact; amongst the Circumstances of the Death of this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr; some tell us, That a Dove which came out of his side, fled into the Air, having lighted upon the Pile of Wood, without being injured by the Flame, was killed by a Soldier. Neither <hi>Eusebius</hi> nor the Antients speak any thing of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, they only say, That St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> was wounded in the side, and that a great quantity of Blood issued from the wound. The Author believes, That there was formerly in the Epistle of the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> wherein the Martyrdom of this Holy Man was related, these <hi>Greek</hi> words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which signifies a Dove, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they were piously believed, and as confidently published, that a Dove went out from the side of St. <hi>Polycarp. M. Le Moyne</hi> supposes also, that <hi>Lucian,</hi> who lived in the same time with St. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp,</hi> only composed his <hi>Peregrinus</hi> to insult over this Martyr, and to turn <hi>Christianity</hi> into Ridicule. He believes, that the <hi>Novus Empedocles,</hi> to whom <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistius</hi> compares the Emperor <hi>Iovinian,</hi> was <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and proves it by Reasons that appear very solid, and in refuting the Opinion of M. <hi>Petit,</hi> who maintains in his <hi>Miscellanea,</hi> Printed in the Year 1682, that this <hi>Empedocles</hi> is infallibly the <hi>Peregrinus</hi> of <hi>Lucian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Discourse upon St. <hi>Bernard</hi> is also full of <hi>Curicus Remarks.</hi> The Author observes, he was of the Isle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where there was so great a number of <hi>Iews,</hi> and that once they put all the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters in that place to Death.

                  <p>Thus having maintain'd that this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was a Christian, and that it was to the Empress his Wife, that <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> writ Letters, as well as <hi>Origen</hi> had done to the same Lady, the Author shews, it was not this <hi>Hyppolytus</hi> that contributed so considerably both by his Exhortations and Purse to the <hi>Works</hi> which <hi>Origen</hi> composed upon the Scripture, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>Photius</hi> has falsly affirm'd.

He proves by many Examples, that there has been two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in the same City; and he does not only believe that <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> continued a long time in <hi>Arabia,</hi> but also that we ought to attribute to him the Conversion of Thirty Thousand <hi>Saracens,</hi> which Work others assign to <hi>Nonnus.</hi> He shews that he has been confounded with this <hi>Nonnus,</hi> and others of his own Name; and that he never was a Monk, nor long enough Deacon to bear that Title, from whence he takes occasion to censure a Council held at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year 324, which gave him the Name of <hi>Hyppolitus,</hi> Deacon. He confirms the <hi>Observations</hi> of some Learned Men, that this Council was never held under <hi>Sylvester.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He afterwards makes many <hi>Remarks</hi> upon the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Hyppolitus,</hi> that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved upon a Marble Chair at <hi>Rome,</hi> and which is one of the finest Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Antiquity. It was found in the Year 1551. in the Diocese of <hi>Tivoli</hi>; from whence the Author infers, that <hi>Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus</hi> was not Bishop of <hi>Porto,</hi> at the Mouth of the <hi>Tyber</hi>; for if it had been so, it is very probable this Monument would have been found there, and not in the Diocese of <hi>Tivoli:</hi> It cannot be doubted, but that the Marble Image of the Man that is sitting in this Chair, in <hi>Hyppolitus,</hi> because, altho' his Name is not there, yet there appears all the Titles of almost all his <hi>Works</hi> that the <hi>Antients</hi> have attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. M. <hi>Le Moyne</hi> tells us, 'twas the Custom of placing these sort of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents in the <hi>Temples,</hi> and that it was practised both amongst the <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Iews.</hi> They had in the middle of their <hi>Temples</hi> upon <hi>Walls</hi> and <hi>Pillars,</hi> a great many <hi>Inscriptions,</hi> and <hi>Historical Relations,</hi> that by the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the place, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of past things might be the better preserved.

                  <p>My Reader perhaps may wonder (says our Abridger) that I have so long neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to tell him. That the <hi>Famous Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> to <hi>Cesarius,</hi> is one of the <hi>Pieces</hi> that M. <hi>Le Moyne</hi> has published. He so religiously <hi>observes</hi> to Print it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly according to the <hi>Manuscript,</hi> that he has given it without <hi>Points,</hi> and without any <hi>Distinctions</hi>; but he designs in his Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of <hi>Notes,</hi> which is to follow to give it in a better form, and make it the most intelligible he can. He proves 'tis a Work of St. <hi>Chrysostom's,</hi> and he says, he will discover from whence, when, and by whom this Rare Piece is fallen into his <hi>hands.</hi> This Work is considerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it <hi>appears</hi> contrary to the Opinion of Transubstantiation, and I believe it wou'd not have made so much noise as it has done, if something that feel out at <hi>Paris</hi> some few <hi>Years</hi> agoe had not given the occasion of making <hi>Reflections</hi> upon it.

The Affair happen'd when the Learned <hi>M.

                  <p>This Second Volume wholly fill'd with his <hi>Remarks,</hi> is as I have told you, very large, yet its only upon the three first <hi>Pieces</hi> of the Collection, which are the Epistle of St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> that of St. <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> and a Discourse on <hi>Hyppolitus.</hi> There is above 15 or 16 to comment upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, little or great.

It wou'd be impossible here to give a particular Accont of all the <hi>fine things</hi> in this second Volume, wherefore we shall be content to give the World leave to judge of the whole, by some of its parts.</p>
                  <p>The Title of St. <hi>Polycarp's</hi> Letter, by which it appears, that he and his <hi>Priests,</hi> writ to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> gives M. <hi>Le Moyne</hi> a good opportunity to speak of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi>; for after having rejected the Opinion of those that alledge that as a Proof of the equality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> he shews there was a difference in that time, but not so great as is between the <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> at this Day, since the <hi>Priests</hi> Consecrated <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,</hi> even conferred <hi>Orders,</hi> performed the <hi>Chrism,</hi> gave their <hi>Opinions</hi> in <hi>Synods,</hi> and had <hi>Seats</hi> like to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> which were call'd <hi>Thrones</hi> as well as theirs. Here he takes occasion to reprehend <hi>Salmasius,</hi> who thought these words of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, signified <hi>Bishops</hi> that were <hi>Suffragans</hi> to a Metropolitan, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ought to be understood by't, (says our Author) <hi>Simple Priests,</hi> which he proves also to have been call'd <hi>Antistites,</hi> which a Learned Man being ignorant of fell into this over-sight, and understood by it <hi>Antistitem secundae sedis,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> He proves by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that the <hi>Bishops</hi> writ conjoyntly with the <hi>Priests,</hi> to other <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> both together, and some time even with the <hi>Deacons.</hi> He Relates a Letter of <hi>Constantine's</hi> the Emperour, wherein he speaks much upon it, because it is directed to <hi>Miltiades</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to <hi>Mark</hi>; which is not conformable to the Idea they have of the <hi>Pope's</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence; for its a little too familiar, not only to write to him by himself, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to associate him with another that was only a simple Priest. The Author justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies its being read <hi>Mark,</hi> contrary to the reading of a great many Learned Men; and he wonders, that in the same Book where the great <hi>Salmasius,</hi> who hath ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Letter of <hi>Constantine's</hi> against the Pretensions of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> shou'd believe it as false. This defect of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is more supportable than the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of this Translator, who to disguise <hi>Constantine's</hi> directing to the Pope and to another in the same Letter, has thus changed these words of the Original, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Author makes this Remark upon the word <hi>Sacerdos,</hi> a Sacrificing Priest; that it was never given to the <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> in the first or second Age, the reason of which, he says, was because the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> conforming themselves to the practice of the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and not that of the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> established <hi>Priests, Deacons, Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. But not <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> or <hi>Sacrificing Priests,</hi> by which he Convicts him of Imposture, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised himself under the Name of <hi>Denis</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> and who affected to be call'd <hi>Sacerdos.</hi> He concludes this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark with Criticising upon some Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities that seem to be contrary to this point.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Le Moyne</hi> as occasion offers it self, explains all obscure places, and corrects the Errors; but he has a very handsome Quality, that is not very common, for he treats those very civilly that are guilty of <hi>Mistakes,</hi> and very often censures the faults, without naming the person. As he was very well acquainted with <hi>Iudaick Antiquities,</hi> and the <hi>Eastern Tongues.</hi> So he has taken a great many <hi>Etymologies</hi> from them, which has been unusefully sought for, both in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is not satisfied only with clearing a great many Critical Points, but has also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd himself to defend our <hi>Mysteries,</hi> &amp; the Divinity of the word against a <hi>Heretick,</hi> which was so much the more dangerous, as beside his Heresie he had Wit and Learning; he was not so uncivil and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent as some others who have boldly published, it did not concern them, if what they affirm'd was never before known to the World. His Name was <hi>Sandius,</hi> he was wise enough to see 'twas the greatest Absurdity in the World to
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:103507:249"/>
pretend that an Opinion was true, that took birth only in these last Ages, or in case that it was true, it was not worth the while to trouble the Church; for common sense evidently tells us, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Opinion that Christianity has past by for these Sixteen <hi>Ages</hi> is unuseful for Salvation, and of none, or at most of very little importance. So that when an Heretick is cunning, he puts off no opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion but under pretence of its being founded upon some very antient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin; this was the craft of <hi>Sandius,</hi> he apply'd himself very much to Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical History, that he might prove the Fathers of the three first Ages did not believe the Trinity, as it is now taught, from whence he pretends to draw one of these Advantages, either that Error pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that so things ought to be reduced to their Primitive State, or that the Fathers of this Council made that an Article of Faith, without which, their Predecessors burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Zeal and Holiness, had obtain'd the Glory of Paradice, and therefore by consequence persons were not obliged to undergo the new Yoke that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> wou'd have impos'd upon the Conscience. Every one must be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that its the Duty of the Orthodox to dissipate these <hi>Illusions,</hi> and the Author deserves praise for undertaking the proof of the Divinity of the <hi>Son,</hi> by Passages of the <hi>Antients,</hi> whilst M. <hi>Wittichius,</hi> his Collegue, maintain'd the Divinity of the Holy Ghost against the same <hi>Sandius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I believe, that after having considered the proofs that M. <hi>Le Moyne</hi> brings, there's few Men will be so Opinionative as to maintain, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the three first Ages were of <hi>Acius's</hi> Opinion; for he relates many express and formal Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, wherein they maintained the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Divinity of the Son of God. He doubts not but what was said of <hi>Tiberius</hi> is true, <hi>viz.</hi> That he proposed to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the <hi>Apothesis</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him into the number of the <hi>Gods.

                  <p>I shou'd be too tedious to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the fine remarks he has made upon the Measure of the Encrease of <hi>Nile,</hi> that was kept as a relick in the Temple of <hi>Serapis,</hi> and which the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> carryed to the Church of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi> Mr. <hi>de Valois</hi> has happily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the Passage of <hi>Socrates</hi> where this Translation is Copi'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for whereas <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stophorson</hi> and <hi>Musculus</hi> had translated it thus, Constantine <hi>caused this measure to be removed to the Church of Alexandria,</hi> his Translation says, that this Emperor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Alexander</hi> who was then Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to place it in the Church. But in remarking so exactly the Errors of others, he did not observe he committed on himself, when he said, that <hi>Constantine</hi> at the same time, caused the Images of the False Gods to be placed in the Church. Which is the sense he gives to the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which <hi>Sozomon</hi> makes use of. The Author shews how improb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it was that Christians shou'd put such abominable objects in so! Sacred a place, so that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> must signify, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the the <hi>Standard</hi> or <hi>Ancient Titles</hi> of the Town. The Idolaters murmuring against this Translation, Reported that <hi>Nile</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased more, but that they were deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For the People always imagin'd that upon the change of Religion wou'd fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low strange marks of the wrath of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; they wish'd it out of spite, and yet were afraid of it, because of the unhappy effects it might produce; and these two Passions made men very credulous; we ought not however to think it strange that Providence very often makes use thereof. The Christians had their part in the surprise if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that <hi>Nile</hi> was sensible of it when <hi>Iulian</hi> carryed back to the Temple of <hi>Serapis,</hi> what <hi>Constantine</hi> had taken from thence. The Conjectures of the Author are very fine upon the Reason, which made <hi>Iosephus</hi> cite a Second Book of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and upon the sense of a difficult passage of the First Book of the <hi>Maccabee</hi>'s Chap. 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 48. where according to some Versions it is, <hi>That the Heathens sought Copies of the Law to Paint their Idols by in.</hi> These conjectures are very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as all that he says upon the Instruments of punishments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> used amongst the <hi>Romans</hi>; from whence he takes occasion to explain many obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Ancient Authors.</p>
                  <p>He says, that the Wild-Hony which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> eat of in the Wilderness, was not a kind of <hi>Manna,</hi> or <hi>Concrete</hi> Dew, but a true Hony made by Bees in the hollow places of some Trees, as there are <hi>Ants</hi> in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Tunquin</hi> which fly in great Companies upon the Trees, and there make a kind of Wax or Gum, whereof the <hi>Lacca,</hi> so well known to the <hi>Dyers,</hi> is made; it is also the chief Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Wax; he confirms his Opinion by the History of <hi>Ionathan,</hi>

                  <p>Upon which Mr. <hi>Le Moyne</hi> examines, whether Sugar was in use amongst the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and says, That although they knew how to draw from certain Reeds a Juice very agreeable to the Taste, yet they had not the Art of Taking, Conden<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sing, Whitening, and making it dry as we do now. <hi>Lucan</hi> speaks of this Reed when he says,
<q>
                        <l>Quique bibunt tenerâ dulces ab arundine Succos.</l>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> speaks thereof also in the 15th. Book of <hi>Strabo,</hi> and plainly insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, that they sometimes baked this Juice, but 'twas a preparation very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from ours. Those that alledge this Verse of <hi>Stace, Et quas praecoquit E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bufita Cannas,</hi> to prove that the <hi>Antients</hi> made Sugar, did not observe that it was corrupted, and that instead of <hi>Cannas,</hi> it must be read <hi>Caunus,</hi> which was a kind of Figs that the Inhabitants of the Isle of <hi>Ebusus,</hi> made very excellent by their manner of preparing them. As for the Sugar <hi>Mambu</hi> and <hi>Tabaxir,</hi> which the <hi>Antients</hi> had the knowledge of.</p>
                  <p>The Author shews 'twas a kind of Gum, which they made use of to sweeten their Medicines, and that this Gum ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in the joints of certain Trees, or else that 'twas the dew which Coagulated upon the boughs: He brings a passage of <hi>Pliny</hi> which Favours this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, since in it one sees, <hi>that Sugar is a Hony gathered upon Reeds white like Gum, which may be reduced to Powder by the Teeth, larger than a Hazle-Nut, and which is used only in Medicins. Arrian, Seneca, Galen,</hi> and <hi>Theophrastus</hi> have spoken of Sugar, either under its proper name, or under that of the Hony of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but the Idea they give us of it only resembles a thick juice either running from the Plant it self, or taken from the Reed. We must therefore conclude with the Author that the Ancients knew not the Sugar that we now have. He very Learnedly examins the Reasons how the <hi>Rabbi</hi> come to commit that mistake; and mentions amongst other things the Scripture ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, <hi>That as soon as Ioanathan had taken of this Hony his Eyes were enlightned,</hi> which had probably Contributed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; for the Ancient Physicians ascribed to their Sugar, a particular vertue of curing Eyes, as may be seen in the second Book of <hi>Diosc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He afterwards speaks upon the Goat <hi>Azazel,</hi> upon the dependences of this Mysterious Sacrifice, upon Hysop, Circumsicion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from which subjects all that Merits observation, wou'd take up too great a part of this Volume; I shall therefore content my self with relating these rich Treasures of Learning, and with the Thoughts of St. <hi>Barnabas, That the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the</hi> 318 <hi>Persons that</hi> Abraham <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised in his House</hi>; was very Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                  <p>They were so accustomed in that time to expect the finding a Mystery in Numbers, (according to the <hi>Platonists, Pythagorians,</hi> and <hi>Iews</hi>) that they were perswaded from one to another that the Three Hundred and Eighteen Domesticks of <hi>Abraham</hi> were a Mystical Figure of the Crucifixion of the Son of God, because that to make this Number they must use these three Letters of the Alphabet <hi>TIH.</hi> The first whereof represents the Cross, and the other Two are the First Syllable of <hi>Iesus</hi>'s Name in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue. Our Age is so much reduced from playing with words, and these Mystical Allusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they never use 'em; for if we except a few contemplative Monks, there are none to be found who have lost themselves in these sorts of Refinements. In the First Ages of the Church, there was no such Custom, altho' there were few in this respect wiser than the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Doctors</hi>: 'Tis here that one may see the Mysteries of Numbers in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est extent.</p>
                  <p>There were also some Fathers which pretended that the 318 Domesticks of <hi>Abraham</hi> with whom he overcame the Kings that had spoil'd <hi>Sodom</hi> were a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the 318 Bishops of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> The Author shews in brief the Illusion of the whole, and afterwards tells us in what time they began to count by Figures that are called <hi>Cyphers.</hi> He believes with the Generality of Learned Men that we are obliged to the <hi>Sarazens</hi> for the Communication of these Notes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they come originally from the <hi>Arabians,</hi> in which he dissents from the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Vossius,</hi> and from his old Friend Mr. <hi>Huet,</hi> for whom with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he Professes a very particular Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>

                     <hi>Scaliger</hi> was so perswaded of the Novelty of Cyphers, that he believed the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Silver Medal of <hi>Marguard Speher</hi> was lately cast, as soon as he had learnt there was seen on it these Numeral Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures 234, 235. There is four different Explanations of this Medal in the 3d. Volume of <hi>Camerarius,</hi> Book 4. It's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that <hi>Planudes</hi> who lived at the end of the 13th.

                  <p>I shall omit what he says upon the Fast of the Sabbath, the shadow of <hi>Samuel,</hi> upon the time that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> had the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and a great many other Prophane and Holy things, which wou'd oblige me to give him great Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, did I not know him to be as Modest as Learned, which is to possess two Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities almost incompatible, and to which we may almost apply what a great Wit once said concerning certain words ill, put together, <hi>viz.

                     <p>The Printed Copies of this Thesis are so very scarce (says our Abridger) I cou'd not get any of 'em, so that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make use of some Manuscript Copies, two of which he confesses were very defective, and as ill Decyphered, but happily one supplyed what the other wanted, so that with the help of a Book that he sometimes consulted, he says, he thinks he has avoided any considerable faults that might have slipt into this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, either in respect to proper Names, or any thing else. He says, that the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melite</hi> Fathers cannot complain that he has falsified there Positions, for if it is not exactly conformable to the Original, it is only in respect to a word or so, which signifies nothing to the Affair it self. The Book that assisted him was Intituled <hi>Elias Thesbites, sive de rebus Eliae Prophetae Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarius,</hi> in Quarto, Printed at <hi>Paris</hi> 1631. It is full of Learning, Reading and Curious Enquiries; but there are many Fancies and Chimera's in it as well as in the Thesis of <hi>Beziers.</hi> They ought not to permit that such things be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly maintained as constant Truths, for the least Advantage that the Protestants wou'd draw from thence is, that it plainly appears that under the Benefit of Tradition, they maintain and deny what they please: The Incredulous take a great advantage from thence to insult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Faith, and it is certainly Pernicious to Religion to introduce so many Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Stories. Permit me (says our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridger) to cite here a Thought of Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hault's,</hi> that Celebrated Philosopher, whose Posthumous Works were Printed by the care of his Father in Law, who lived but a little after this Edition. He says, in the Preface to his Treatise of Phisicks that nothing has prodoced more unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Dispositions in Scholars, than to see <hi>Those who publickly maintain any Doctrin whatsoever, always Triumphing over those that endeavour to prove the contrary, so that upon their Accounts all things pass only for probabilities. They look not on Study as a means to discover new Truths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as a Sport for them to Exercise their Wits up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>n, the end of all which is only so to confound Truth with Falshood by some subtility, that they may equally maintain both without ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be convinced by any Argument, how unreasonable soever the Opinion may be that they maintain. And it is in effect the general Success of all Publick Actions, where often in the same Pulpit, Opinions are Alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively deliver'd perfectly contrary, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly triumphing, without any Tenet being the better clear'd, or Truth the more Establish'd.</hi> I don't think (continues he) that such Persons as wou'd defend all the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions maintain'd by the <hi>Carmelite Friers</hi> as true, are very proper to Convert <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians.</hi>

Our Author in taking them into the Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, found that the whole contain'd 72 thousand Paces, in so much that its Area or Content was greater by 3/11 than that of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was a square City of sixty thousand Paces about. <hi>Rome</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us already of an excessive great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but what wou'd it be if we added to it that part beyond the <hi>Tyber,</hi> which has not yet been counted? Because they did not formerly look upon it as a part of the City. The Palace of <hi>Nero</hi> encompassed <hi>Rome</hi> on that side; and it was of so prodigious an extent, that Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> did not believe that there was then any City in <hi>Europe</hi> so large. He durst not say positively that the Quarter on that side the River extended even to the <hi>Ocriculum</hi> for the space of 36 thousand Paces; but he shews, that it took up much Land upon the <hi>Ianicule,</hi> the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Mountains, and along the way of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> which being that whereby Men entred in Triumph into the City, 'twas necessarily full of Houses.</p>
                  <p>He proposes some considerable Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and answers them very learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He says, amongst other things, that the Walls of <hi>Rome</hi> must be distinguished from the <hi>Pomaerium,</hi> which being at first without the City, was afterwards one part of it within the Walls, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without; because that those that enlarged the Walls, was also obliged at the same time to enlarge the <hi>Pomaerium,</hi> the <hi>Augures</hi> so managed the matter, that all which had this quality before preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it self. He also says, That when they made their City bigger, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably removed certain places, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking from them their Ancient Names. For Example, the Grove of the Muses, and the Cave of <hi>Egeria,</hi> or <hi>Numa,</hi> was often removed, being once but a little distance from the Gate of <hi>Capena,</hi> which in the time of this King was not very far from the middle of <hi>Rome.</hi> But after a while this Grove and this Cave were found at <hi>Aricia,</hi> near the outmost parts of the City, fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Paces from the place where the Gate of <hi>Capena</hi> anciently stood. This Observation may serve for an Answer to a Passage in <hi>Pliny,</hi> where it is said, That <hi>Rome</hi> was limited at the <hi>East</hi> by the Caprice of <hi>Tarquin the Proud</hi>; for if any wou'd infer from thence, That the Limits of the Town were only distant from the Center about two thousand Paces, he may be answer'd, That this distance which was effectively so once, is so encreased in proportion to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of <hi>Rome</hi>; because the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which bears the Name of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> was always extended to the utmost bounds of the City. Our Author adds, That 'tis vainly alledg'd, that there's no Trace left at this Day of the prodigious Bulk of <hi>Rome,</hi> for (says he) if one wou'd find any Marks of it, he must dig sixty foot deep, and to find any of the Ruins of <hi>Nineveh</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> which were built upon soft Foundations, he must dig two hundred foot deep.</p>
                  <p>What he says afterwards, is not less common, <hi>viz.</hi> He brings a long List of the numberings of the <hi>Roman</hi> People from the time of <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> to the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> 667. The first Account gives 130000 Citizens, that of the Year 667 affords above 46000. In respect of the Inhabitants, 'tis hard to give a positive determination, because they were never reckoned; but our Author affirms they were of a far greater number than <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> believed; for if the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Slaves and Citizens, was the same as betwixt those of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> where for 20000 Burgesses there were 400000 Slaves, it wou'd follow, that <hi>Rome</hi> contain'd 8000000 of Slaves, a greater number than any Kingdom of <hi>Europe</hi> whatsoever has in it. He assures us in another place, That before the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of <hi>Sylla,</hi> the City of <hi>Rome</hi> by it self had as many Inhabitants in it, as the Moiety of <hi>Europe</hi> has at this day.</p>
                  <p>But to the Computation he brings, he supposes, that the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that of <hi>London,</hi> joyn'd together would fill an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea of six thousand Paces Square. And that the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> with its Suburbs, and that Quarter beyond <hi>Tyber,</hi> wou'd take up twenty times a greater Square than those six thousand Paces. He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses also, that <hi>Rome</hi> was at least as well Peopled as <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> and grounds his Opinion upon the Prodigious height of the Houses, as appears by <hi>Augustus</hi> taxing them at 70 foot apiece; Now we may well suppose here with those who are not carry'd away with the Multitude in their Computation, that there are not more than six hundred thousand Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in each of those Cities that I have named. In another place he is not so liberal, he allows only that number to two Cities joyn'd together, he concludes this following Proposition, That there was in <hi>Rome</hi> fourteen Millions of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:103507:252"/>
a Number (says he) that the three most Populous Cities of <hi>Europe</hi> will not supply us with.</p>
                  <p>For after having related many fine things upon the manner how <hi>Rome</hi> fell to decay, upon the greatness of <hi>Babylon, Nineveh, Thebes</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Alexandria, Carthage, Cairo,</hi> and some Cities of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> thus he divides the different Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Europe</hi>; he gives to <hi>Spain,</hi> two Millions of Inhabitants, to <hi>France</hi> five <hi>Millions,</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> to the three Isles of <hi>Sicily, Corsica,</hi> and to <hi>Sardinia</hi> two Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> two Millions, to the <hi>Low Countries</hi> two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, to <hi>Germany, Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> five Millions; to the <hi>Estates</hi> of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> excepting <hi>Norway,</hi> four hundred thousand, to the <hi>Estates</hi> of <hi>Sweedland</hi> and <hi>Norway</hi> 600000, to the <hi>Estates</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> a Million and an half, to <hi>Turkey,</hi> &amp;c. five Millions and an half, adding as he goes along all <hi>Muscovia</hi> to <hi>Europe,</hi> and supposing 3000000 of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in <hi>Muscovia,</hi> from whence it follows, That all <hi>Europe</hi> has not above thirty thousand persons Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
                  <p>He does not believe that if we shou'd joyn the Inhabitants of <hi>Africa</hi> to <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> they wou'd amount to an hundred Millions, but that <hi>Asia</hi> is more populous; for altho' the War with the <hi>Tartars</hi> hath destroyed at least an hundred Millions of the <hi>Chinese,</hi> yet there remains above three hundred Millions of Inhabitants, tho principal part whereof are in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Regions, and in the Isles. He cannot determine of the <hi>Southern</hi> parts, but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses that all the persons in the World do not exceed 500000000. He adds that one might place 'em all standing on a Superficies, which contain'd a <hi>German</hi> League in length, and as much in breadth, giving to each person a Foot square, from whence he concludes, that <hi>Lucan</hi> had great reason to say, that <hi>Rome</hi> wou'd contain all Mankind.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Urbem Populis victisque frequentem</l>
                     <l>Gentibus &amp; generis, si coeat turba, capacem</l>
                     <l>Humani. —</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>For according to his Calculation, the Ground of this City contain'd at least twenty <hi>German</hi> Leagues square, which divided between five hundred Millions of Men, wou'd allow to each person twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Foot square. Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> is of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the World is much diminished, and has lost a great part of her Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; he believes there were formerly more Men in <hi>Sicily,</hi> than there are now in <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> too; and that the number of Persons was greater in <hi>Athens</hi> only, than now it is in all <hi>Greece,</hi> which is probable enough, and therefore we cannot dispute it: But when he allows <hi>Paris</hi> but Three hundred thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and to <hi>Holland</hi> but Five hundred and fifty thousand, Four hundred and fifty to the Cities, and an Hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand to the Country, he is very far from multiplying upon the matter: And when he speaks of <hi>China,</hi> he thinks he cannot number too many. He believes that in the last breaking in of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> there were in <hi>China</hi> an Hundred and seventy Millions of Inhabitants. He supposes the Town of <hi>Hancheu</hi> (for so it ought to be call'd, and not <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zai,</hi> as in some corrupted Copies) was inhabited with near twenty Millions of people, without reckoning the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs; and with taking them in, with more than all <hi>Europe</hi> besides, and that it was larger without the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> than <hi>Rome</hi> was with them. When he speaks of that Country, the Men cost him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but he is afraid that all the <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> will complain of his division, without excepting even the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> altho' he has been pretty bountiful to them.</p>
                  <p>What he says of the Manners and Wit of the <hi>Chinese,</hi> is admirable; they keep no Memoirs of their Warlike Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and reserve their Elogies for the Peace Makers and Righteous. They never delighted in Conquests, unless the desire of living under so wise a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, invited by their Neighbours to submit; but they constrained none, <hi>being only concerned, if men who wanted this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, refused to participate with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They acknowledge none as Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but Men of Learning; tis derogatory amongst them, and reduces them into a <hi>Plebean</hi> state, to forsake this profession. The Counsellors and Favorites of the Prince, are all Philosophers, and when he commits a fault, they reprehend him with so much Liberty and Freedom, that the Prophets took not more in respect to the Kings of <hi>Iudah.</hi> If they don't make use of this Priviledge, the People cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them, and look upon 'em as weak Men, and degenerate from the Courage of <hi>Confutius,</hi> and other Philosophers, who have retired from the Court in a time of Tyranny. They reproach them to their face with Cowardise, and say that they are neither Philosophers, nor Men of honour, since for their own private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, they abandon the good of the Publick. As for their Wit, Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> believes they surpass all the World, and that after having learnt from 'em the Compass, Printing, and many other admirable things, he doubts not but there remains much finer Inventions amongst 'em, than we have borrowed of 'em: He tells us wonderful things of their skill in Physick; and above all their Art, in knowing the Diseases by the differences of the Pulse. They are so admirable in that respect, that they look not upon a Man to be a good Physitian, if after having felt divers places of the sick persons Arm, he does not without asking Questions, discover from what
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:103507:253"/>
part of the Body the Distemper proceeds, as well as the nature of it. 'Tis very pleasant to read all the curious things that Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> has related upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and upon the Ability of this Nation in all the noble Arts. He pretends that they made use of Powder and Cannons many Ages before the <hi>Europeans</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them; and adds to it, the Original and Progress of Powder amongst the people of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other Pieces which compose Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi>'s Works, are not less worthy of particular observation; but having been long upon this, there's a necessity of being brief upon what follows:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He treats upon the Constructions of Galleys very learnedly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. On the Reformation of Longitudes. The Author maintains that the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Eclipses have more confounded this matter than any thing whatsoever, because they have not sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded either Refractions or Shadows.</p>
                  <p>He corrects many errors that concern the extent of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, which has been render'd much less than really it is; he shews also, that the like faults have been committed upon many <hi>Eastern</hi> parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> and says, that the dispute betwixt the <hi>Portuguese</hi> and <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> touching the Division of the New World, has produced strange Alterations both in Longitudes and Geography.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He speaks of Navigation into the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Iapan,</hi> by the <hi>North</hi>: this Treatise contains many curious and useful observations.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He examines the cause of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which appear sometimes about the Moon: Upon which he has some thoughts perfectly new; for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves these Circles proceed from the Mountains in the Moon, because they produce their Images reverst in the Air, that is under them, which he maintains by some experiments. Amongst others he relates this, that some <hi>English</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, being on the Pick of <hi>Tenariff,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that as soon as the Sun arose, the shadow of this high Mountain convered not only all the Isle of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> but also the great <hi>Canarie,</hi> and all the Sea, even unto the Horizon, where the top of the Pick seem'd to appear reverst, which sent back its shadow into the Air. He tells us a very surprizing thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that the shadow of this Mountain extended as far as the <hi>Levant,</hi> to the place even from whence the Light came, since the great <hi>Canarie,</hi> which is at the <hi>East</hi> of this Pick, is covered with the shadow. What he adds concerning the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Mountain, and the grand <hi>Canaries,</hi> is very remarkable; for he says, it appears not larger than the <hi>Thames,</hi> although there is fourteen Leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two Isles.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He treats of the fall of heavy Bodies, and explains it according to the <hi>Cartesians,</hi> by the Diurnal Motion of the Earth upon its Center; but establishes a Principle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to Mr. <hi>Des Cartes, viz. That a Body which is moved Circularly, approaches nearer to the Center than is possible when its Axis is perpendicular to the Horizon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if its Axis is parallel to the Horizon, then it is removed from the Center as far as 'tis possible.</hi> He relates an Experiment that he says, was made some times agoe, and which is quite contrary to Mr. <hi>Hugens</hi>'s, given us by Mr. <hi>Rohault</hi>; for whereas Mr. <hi>Hugens</hi> says, that the Particles of <hi>Spanish</hi> Wax dipp'd in a Vessel full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is turn'd upon a Pirot, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved farther from the Center and soon arrive to the extremities of the Vessel, Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> has found out that Balls of Leed and Iron thrown into a Vessel of Water which is moved circularly, tend towards the Center of the Vessel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Bowls of Wood which float upon the Surface of the Water make towards the sides of it.</p>
                  <p>The rest of the Book is a Treatise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Oracles of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> published in the Year 1672. There's also the Answer that he made sometime after to the Objections of Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> scatter'd throughout his Critical History of the Old Testament, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to that part of the Discourse which concerns him in Father <hi>Simons</hi>'s <hi>Disquisitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Criticae de var<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Historia Plantarum, &amp;c.</hi> Or, <hi>Ray</hi>'s <hi>History of Plants,</hi> Tom. 1st. London 1686.</head>
                  <p>SInce <hi>Baubin</hi> published his <hi>History of Plants,</hi> and <hi>Parkinson</hi> his <hi>Botanick Theater,</hi> a great Number of Plants have been discoved, that appeared not in their Collection. Several Authors have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed many that were unknown to the <hi>Botanists</hi> that liv'd before them: But no one yet has ever gathered them together in one Piece like our present Author. who has also used much more Method than has yet been observed on the same Subject.</p>
                  <p>He divides Plants into Genders and Kinds, and gives an account of those that resemble them in their principal parts, as in their Flower, Seed, and Films, which cover them.</p>
                  <p>He thinks this Method is the most Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and easie to attain in a little time to the knowledg of <hi>Botanicks</hi>; and doubts not but any one that will apply himself to this study, may without the help of a Master by following these Rules to accomplish it, and be well acquainted with Plants. If any Plant shou'd be found which comes not under these
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:103507:253"/>
Rules which are ordinarly known, there's no more to be done than to compare it with these General Distinctions which are given to priecipal Genders, which it is necessary to learn by heart. He imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately tells us to what Gender it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and descending to the Species not contained in this Gender, he examins to what other it does belong, by these Essential marks whereby these Species are distinguisht, and thus, in fine, the Species of Plants which they contain may be discovered by this particular descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if it's plain that none of these descriptions agree, that then this was left out of the Collections which former <hi>Botanists</hi> have hitherto made.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not that our Author believes that he hath found out a Method so very just and exact that there ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not Plants which are not reducible to the Kinds and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies observed in this Work; the prodigious variety of Nature and the inexhaustible Riches which it prostrates to our Eyes, can't be comprehended in certain Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits. There are almost infinite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations betwixt the divers proprieties of Plants which necessarily constitute <hi>Anomolies</hi> and Exceptions from those Rules which are given to distinguish the different sorts; the Form of the Seed and the Film which covers it is not so certain an Index as is believed, to distinguish Plants, since some which are centainly of the same Species are different enough in that, as appears by many Examples which Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> produces; there's a kind of Cummin whose Seed is hairy, altho' in other things 'tis like other Cummin Seeds.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of the Book there's a General Table, where our Author has briefly observed the differences by which he has distinguished the Plants into divers kinds and Species, which its necessary to know, in order to discover the Plants whose description one wou'd learn. This Volume contains XVIII Books, whereof the last treats <hi>de herbis flore papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionaceo, sive leg uminosis.</hi> In comparing this Title with the Table which we have spoke of, we may conjecture the first Tomb contains above half of the Work.</p>
                  <p>As to what regards the matter, one may Judge by the Title, which we have no need to repeat here; we shall only remark that there are several very exact Descriptions of Plants which are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to the <hi>Britanick</hi> Islands which foraign <hi>Botanists</hi> have not discover'd: What is chiefly wanting, is the Figures of Plants, which 'tis not always easie to remember by a bare description of 'em. <hi>Figures in Wood</hi> are commonly too gross, altho' there are some pretty good in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Botanists,</hi> as <hi>Mathiolus</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi>; and these in <hi>Copper Cuts</hi> cost too much; this is the cause that there were no Figures in this Edition. But the Booksellers, who are at the Expences of what is done, promise to add 'em very quickly, and to publish every Classis of Plants in their Order, provided they can do it by way of Subscription.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not amiss to Advertise you, that the Method according to which Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> has disposed Plants is in 80 Intituled <hi>Methodus Plantarum nova brevitatis &amp; perspicuitatis causa Synopticè in Tabulis exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bita, cum Notis Generum tum Summorum tum Subalternorum Characteristicis Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationibus nonnullis de seminibus Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; Indice copioso.</hi> Authore <hi>I-Raio, &amp;c.</hi> Amst. <hi>apud</hi> Waesbergios, 1681.</p>
                  <p>There's also a Second Edition of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Book of the same Author touching this matter. The Title of it is, <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logus Plantarum Angliae, &amp; Insularum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacentium, tum indigenas tum in Agris passim cultas complectens. In quo praeter Synonyma necessaria, facultates quoque sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matim traduntur, una cum observationibus &amp; experimentis novis medicis &amp; Physicis. Editio secunda, Plantis circiter quadraginta sex &amp; observationibus aliquam multis auctior,</hi> Oper. J. Raij Londoni.</p>
                  <p>Besides that this Edition is more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect than the former, there are added Three Hundred Plants and Sixteen sorts of <hi>Fungus</hi> which were omitted thro' mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake or oversight. He has put the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks which were at the end, every one in his own place, and has added some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new in many places. Besides, there are two Figures in this Edition where were not in the other, one is, <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus Phaloides,</hi> and the other <hi>Pentaphylloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Fructicosum.</hi> Such as wou'd know what Plants are added may find 'em in the Leaf following the Title Page, where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is another Index at the end, of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Plants, and of the Distempers which they remedy.</p>
