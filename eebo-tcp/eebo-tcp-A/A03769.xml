            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The worde of the Lorde, the worde of the Lord, is euer in their mouthe. Of this they ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle. This they ringe allwaies in our eares. But the Catholike church, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhoulde ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne what in dede the word of God is, of whoſe mouthe only we muſt harken for this worde, and by whom only we knowe, which is the true written worde of God, and what the true ſence of that worde is, this Catholyke Churche they ſpeake not of.

            <p>But is not the trade and manner of the prophets of our age euen leeke to this?

[Let my councell (ſayth he) (O king) pleaſe the: Redeme thy ſinnes

with almes, and thy iniquitees with mercy toward the poore.] VVith theſe wordes he brought ſome comforte to the kinge, being before ſtryken with a wonderfull feare. Yett would hee not ſett him in a careleſnes or ſurety. He ſaid not, be ſure thy ſinnes ſhal be forgeeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, but thus.

For ſo did Peter<note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> ſpeake vnto Simon Magus, who thought the gift of God might be poſſeſſed for moony: [Doo penaunce (ſaith he) for this thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,<note place="margin">No man ought to ſtand aſſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red of his ſaluacion</note> and pray to God, to ſee yf happely this nawghty thought of thy hart may be forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.] If happely (ſaith he:) he dooth not bid him to be certayne and ſure therof.</p>
            <p>This doctryne of the prophettes and Apoſtles, dooth the Catholyke Churche yett howlde, geeuing Terrour to ſinners,

For albeit of the mercy of God, of his promyſes, of the merytt of Chriſt his death, of the vertue and efficacye of the ſacramentes no good man ought to doubte, yet when anny man reſpectyth hymſelf, and his owne infirmitee, hee may well feare and ſtand yn doubt of Gods grace in his owne par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te. This is the preaching of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke Churche, well and rightly agreyng with the doctryne of Eſay, Hieremie, Ezechiell, Daniel, Ioël, Ionas, yea and of S.

            <p>He taught only fayth to ſuffiſe both to our ſaluation, and iustification.

            <p>Nowe thoſe ſcriptures which he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue and allowe, did he not by his additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and detractions peruert them to his owne priuat purpoſes, making of good Latyne, lewd high Dutche?

            <p>VVhich his mynde eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Luther him ſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to allowe when he hath to do with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries and Anabaptiſtes. But you ſhal heare his owne wordes. he ſayeth:</p>

Moyſes allſo in his lawe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded<note place="margin">Leuit. 24.</note> that ſuche falſe teachers ſhould be ſtoned to death. Euen ſo in this caſe ther is no diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vſed, but ſuche manifeſt blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers
<pb facs="tcp:17065:33"/>
are to be condemned withowt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their cauſe.</p>
            <p>As Pawle allſo commaundeth, in the third<note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> chapiter of his Epiſtle to Titus that an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike ſhould be auoyded after one or two war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nings. He allſo forbiddeth to Timothee all<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note> contentions and diſputations, as things which do nothing ells but trouble the hearers. For ſuche common articles of all Chriſtendom be now ſufficiently heard, declared, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by the writings and generall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſsion of all Chriſtendom. They are confirmed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miracles ſealed vp with myche bloud of many martyres, defended by the bookes of al lerned men, and not now needing any mans conning or deuiſe to enlarge them.</p>
            <p>Yet is it not in all pointes trewe that this hyperbolicall doctour reporteth, the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to haue done in that Councell of Nice, as though they had condemned Arrius vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, or his cauſe vnexamined. For albeit there be extant in Socrates and Nicephorus an epistle of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of Nice to the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Alexandria, and to them which were in Egipt, Libia, and Pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tapolis, in which they wryte: that they would not indure ſo muche<note place="margin">li. 1. ca. 9. li. 8. cap. 14.</note> as to heare the wicked opinion of Arrius,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17065:33"/>
the madnes of his mynd, or his blaſphemous wordes: yet is it manifeſt ynough by the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyne the Emperour, which euen there followeth fast after, that his doctrine was dilligently viewed and conſidered. For<note place="margin">The vvor des of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtantin the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Arrian he<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reſie.</note> the Emperour vſeth theſe wordes: <q>All his ſayings and writinges were diligently exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined which by their dowbtfulnes or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement ſeemed to brede any pretence or colour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If all thinges were ſo diligently exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, how was it then, that Arrius was not heard? VVherfore that the fathers write, they would not voucheſafe ſo myche as to heare his blaſphemous wordes, may be more rightly wnderſtanded in this ſence, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his doctrine was once thoroughly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and yet he proceded in redoubling his blaſphemous talke, the fathers would not then voucheſafe to heare him any more, but ſtrake him with the ſentence of curſe and condemnation.</p>
            <p>For, that he was heard, Socrates plainly ſhewyth when in the ſame place he writeth that the Emperour ſignified to the people of<note place="margin">Socrates lib. 1. aap.</note> Alexandria, the determination of the faith
<pb facs="tcp:17065:34"/>
not to haue been ſimply or raſhly made, but with great examination and deliberation to haue been ſet foorth. Not that ſome thinges only were ſpoken, and ſome thinges past in ſilence, but that what ſo euer was needfull to be ſet foorth for the confirmation of the doctryne, were layde open: and that it was not barely determined, but firſt exactly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of, and what ſo euer might geue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of diſſencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or debate were ſo reiected, that nothing cowld be ſayd against them. Therfore (ſayth he) the Emperour calleth<note place="margin">The agrei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Biſſhops in general covvncel is the ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence of Godd.</note> this concord and agreing ſentence of the Biſshopps in that Synode, the ſentence of God: and yeldeth thankes to the holy Ghoſt for ſo great concord and vnite of mynde among ſo many fathers.</p>

And if you came hither, with that minde, as we did, then let vs all agree, let vs with curſe conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne theſe hereſies, and hold fast that we haue receiued of our fathers, to the end we may cut of <note n="*" place="margin">Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande of this Arria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereſy.</note> all occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hereafter of ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping councels, ſince the fathers once already aſſembled in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of Nice haue by ſure eſtabliſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ſound determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentyd all farder queſtions,</q>

            <p>VVherfore of right Luther muſt ſuffer by the lawe which him ſelf gaue to others, that there be no diſputation allowed to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of his doctrine, but that ſo ſone as it apperith they be of that ſort, they bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned vnheard.

            <p>This admonition of Origen is ſo depely to be layd vp in our mynd that at no tyme it go owt therof, that when wee heare one bring foorth the ſcriptures, or glory of the expreſſe word of God, wee do not by and by beleaue euery ſuche kynd of ſprite.

            <p>Certainly I can not herin be deceiued.

            <p>Doth not this honeſt man thinke him ſelfe as ſure that his doctrine is the expreſſe woord of God as Luther or Caluin? and yett for all that, both his, Luthers, and Caluines, are in deed the expreſſe worde of the diuell. But whereto in the end cometh this geare? Strawnge and wonderfull it is. For lo: whyle in this ſort, euery ſect ſeeketh to vſurpe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelf alone the word of God, and the true vnderſtanding therof, there is ſprong

Now therfore this is apparant that neuer almost was ther any heretike, which did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by the ſcripture, and which affirmed not his opinion to be the very word of God. The thing it ſelf ſo ſhe wyth this, that far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demonſtration needith not: but yet the chief of all heretikes of this our age doth alſo testifie the ſame: who writeth: <hi>That the holy ſcripture hath now at the laſt obteynid this name to be caullyd the heretikes booke: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all hereſies deryue their courſe and origi nal ſpring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence.</hi> But to what end is this will ſome man ſaye?

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17065:43"/>
foorth ſo many thinges to the end to ſhewe that who ſo euer vſeth the teſtimony of the ſcripture is an heretike? No: God forbid that wee ſhould ſo myche as thinke a thing ſo ſtraunge and vnſitting for any Chriſtian man: <q>No wee rather ſaye as S.

            </p>
            <p>Nothing is more holy then the ſcripture nothing of more auctorite, nothing (next God) more worthy of all honour. But what thing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſo holy, which the enemie of man kind abuſeth not to the deſtruction of man? VVee muſt not thinke that God alwayes ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their mowthes who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee heare talke of the word of God, and alleage the words of the ſcripture.

of truth, and from whom floweth all truthe? Short and redy is the aunſwer hereunto: In the ſcriptures themſelues which we knowe to haue ben inſpired from God aboue, ther can in deed be no lye. But in the ſence which man bringeth (of whom it is written: [eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is a lyar] hee that will ſaye there can<note place="margin">Pſal. 115.</note> not be a lye, what doth he ells but denye the ſaying of God, and as it were charge the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt of Vntruth?</p>
            <p>VVhat then, will ſoome man ſaye? yf eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man bee a lyar, dooth it therfore followe that what ſo euer a man ſpeaketh, what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hee bryngeth owt of the holy ſcripture ſhould therfore be a lye? God forbidd: I ſaye not ſo.</p>
            <p>How ſhall I then knowe when hee vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryth a lye? This will the very Truth teache vs, which can not lye.

            <p>But thow wilt ſaye agayne: Speakyth he

Yow haue heard now not only once, but often opened vnto yow by me, that the diuel alſo alleageth teſtimonies of the ſcriptures, and yet doth he not therfore ſpeake the truth, becauſe he ſpeaketh of his owne. VVhat is this ſpeaking of his owne? It is when he bryngeth his owne ſence of the ſcripture, and not the ſence and meaning of God. <q>For this is, to bean heretike (as before we taught out of S.

            </p>
            <p>But how ſhall I diſcerne when a man bryngeth his owne ſence, and when the true ſence and meaning of God?

For truth is not any wher ells but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<note place="margin">Throuth is only in the Catho like Chur che.</note> all: that is to ſaye in the Catholike or vniuerſall Churche.</p>
            <p>Therfore whoo ſo euer ſeekith owt any ſingular vnderſtanding or inuenteth any ſtrange and vnknowen expoſitions, or brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the world any newe and ſinguler o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, though hee ſhewe ſix hundreth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonyes of the ſcriptures, becauſe hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth them not with that ſence wich

is receiued of the Catholike Churche, but ioyneth therunto his owne proper and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat expoſition, he ſpeaketh of him ſelf, and therfore ſpeaketh an vntrouth, for the truth is not with any one, but with all, that is to ſaye in the Catholike Churche, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the light of ſownd and true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the ſcriptures is promyſed of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</p>
            <p>So as there can be no ſurer argument, that a man ſpeaketh his owne, that is, a lye, then when he departeth from the ſence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and conſent, of the Churche: For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> althowgh he bring neuer ſo many texts of the ſcripture, hee may vtter in dede the expreſse word of the diuell: but neuer can he in that ſorte bring foorth the expreſſe and pure worde of God. For it is as certayn that the diuel openeth the mowth of them, which teache Gods word, being owt of the Churche, as that God him ſelf openeth the mowthes of them, which beyng of and with in the churche, doo vtter the ſame. And this is the cauſe that when ſo euer ther is in the Church memory made of an Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelist, or any other notable doctour, that both in the
<pb facs="tcp:17065:46"/>
entry of the Maſſe, and in the Canonicall howres, this text of Eccleſiasticus is read:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 15.</note> [In the midle of the Churche he opened his mowth:] VVherby is ſignifyed that God openeth the mowth to no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnleſſe he be with in the Churche. From the true ſence and vnderſtanding wherof who ſo euer dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth, his mowth, not God, but the diuell doth open.</p>
            <p>How famous ſo euer any doctour of the Churche bee, yet yf he be not with in the Churche, if he conſent not with the ſence of the Churche, it is certayn that God opened not his mowth. But yf any man ſpeake co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ſence and conſent therof, wee need not doubt to ſaye that the diuell opened his mowth. VVho ſo euer therfore vttereth his owne, vttereth a lye, and he that ſpeaketh of God, ſpeaketh the truth: but he ſpeaketh of God which vttereth the ſcriptures not at aduenture, or by his owne priuat ſence, but with the ſence that is common to all, that is, with the ſence of the catholyke Churche.</p>
            <p>And that is it which is truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly<note place="margin">VVhat is the true vvord of God.</note> caullyd the word of God, when to the wordes of the ſcripture, not our owr owne

            <p>Then brake owt in an other corner not<note place="margin">Pacimon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus.</note> long after one Balthaſar Pacimontanus: He in interpreting certayne places of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures diſſenteth both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Luther and Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius, and will nedes haue the ſcriptures to meane as he doth interpret the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not as they will haue it.</p>

            <p>Yow ſee that here wee differ not abowt

            <p>But let vs yet a little more diligently wayghe the very text it ſelf. They ſaye the<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> expreſſe word of God is: [Drynke yee all of this.] Ergo it is neceſſary that all perſons<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gument</note> ſhould drinke of the cup: and yf any do other wyſe they are giltye (ſay they) of breaking

            <p>I pray thee, what caliest thow the word of God? <hi>The ſcripture.</hi> And what meanest<note place="margin">VVhat the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe vvorde of God is.</note> thow by this worde, liuely and expreſſe? <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, playne, and that which is ſo layde ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all mens eyes, that no man is ſo dull of ſight, which may not plainly ſee it.</hi> But yf it be ſo playne and cleere, how cometh it to paſſe that there is now ſuch a doe about it? Of thin ges which are clere and manifest is there any man that will moue argument? As for example. VVhether it be daye or no, when wee ſee the ſonne vp and ſhinyng vpon the earth? Of neceſsite therfore it muſt nedes followe that this is not ſo expreſſe and playne a worde, as to thee it ſeemeth, ſince there ryſeth ſo muche queſtion vpon it.

            <p>But let vs yet wayghe and examine far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe words of Chriſt: which yf wee will rightly vnderſtand, it behoueth vs to haue regard to thoſe which went before, to the end we may therby knowe to whom theſe<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> wordes were ſpoken. S. Mathew deſcrybing the ſupper of our lorde, ſpeaketh thus: [But when euening was come he ſate downe with his twelue diſciples.] S.

VVould there be any matter of ſtryfe yf you would as ſharply behould this word, as you doo that which went before? Is not either of them the word of one and the ſame God? both (All) and (twelue)?</p>

            <p>VVhy doeſt thow therfore complayne O Sathan, why doeſt thow ſo often dull our ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, with thy vayne boaſting of the expreſſe worde of God?

            <p>But there is no cauſe why a Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man ſhould thinke that Sathan paſſeth ſo muche for the cuppe. For he knoweth wel inowgh, it is no whyt materiall to ſaluation, whether a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe the cuppe or no: ſynce by his lymmes, Luther, Bucer, and Philipp Melancthon he doth manifeſtly confeſſe, nothing touching the vſe of the cuppe, to be commaunded by Chriſt as neceſſary to ſaluation.

whether a man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate in one or bothe kyndes, ſo it be done by the ordinaunce and obſeruaunce of the Churche, it profiteth the worthy receyuer to ſaluation.

            <p>VVell: Sathan will be Sathan: for in the Hebrew Sathan is as myche to ſaye as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17065:62"/>But ſuppoſe the ordinaunce and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce of the Churche (which is the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body of Chriſt) were ſo, that we ſhoulde communicatt vnder bothe formes? Then wil you haue it done either vnder one alone, or vnder neither of bothe. But wil you heare the beaſt vtter his owne wordes? VVe recited them before, but it ſhall not be a myſſe to heare him agayne: Thus he ſpeaketh by his choſen veſſell Luther.</p>

he knoweth the ſame to be right and agreable with the worde of God, yet dooth he all wayes with toothe and nayle earneſtly withſtand it. And looke what ſong he being the head of his body and lymmes, did once ſynge to our head and maiſter Chriſt, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me by his members, doth he now recorde to vs being the members of Chriſt: [Throwe<note place="margin">VVhat is ment by thiſe vvor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des, Thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vve thy ſelf doune</note> thy ſelf downe.] That is to ſaye (as wee haue before heard Vincentius Lirinenſis inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prett it,) Lett thy ſelffawll downe from the doctrine and traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this high churche, which is reputed the church of God.

               <q>The faulte is not in the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, but in the ſeparation.

            <p>Then what a kynde of religion is this of ſome men, that ſaye they are moued with the feare of God and loue of his lyuely word (for that is their maner of ſpeache) to thinke it

For they perſuaded them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues that they fulfilled the commaundement of God in deliuering the ſonne of God to the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tills to be done to death. [VVe haue a lawe<note place="margin">Ioan. 19</note>

Of that very thing which Chriſt would haue to be a ſacrament of pietye, a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vnitee, a bond of charite, he ſeeketh to make a cauſe of diſſencion, a matter of deuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and a fyreſtone of hatred.

<pb facs="tcp:17065:66"/>
ſhould followe this wicked and ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious counſell of ſeparation.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Our lord (ſayth S.

            </p>
            <p>But will you knowe how great a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he committeth? then harken to S. Pawll,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11</note> who telleth the, [that he is giltye of the body and bloud of our lord:] that is to ſay he hath committed no leſſe wickednes, and ſhall be gilty of no leſſe crime, then euen they who with their owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, whipped Chriſt, ſhed his bloud, crucified his body, and put him to greuous death. And this is the thing which Sathan ſeeketh, that diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be wrought in this ſacrament of Vnitee, ſo as therby Chriſt may be crucifyed agayne, and as it were ſcornyd and mockyd at. But ſhall it be thus euen with him which calleth it the ſauing word? Deſerueth this to be called the ſauing worde which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth to euer laſting
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17065:66"/>
death? Verely, this is no ſauing word: Drinke of the cuppe: for Iudas dranke of the cuppe and was condemned: many heretikes, many falſe bretherne, many confeſsing Chriſt, and yet denying his power haue dronke of the cuppe. But how? To death, and euerlaſting damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: not to lyfe and eternall ſaluation.</p>
            <p>But wilt thow knowe what is this ſauing<note place="margin">Nore. Charitee is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry liuely, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing vvor de,</note> word? It is a ſhort worde and an eaſy: Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue. Charite is this ſauing word, which who ſo hath not, lett him drynke of the cuppe ſo myche as he will, yett ſhall he gayne euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting death: eternall ſaluation he ſhall neuer atteyn therby. For it is trewe that is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, [he that loueth not, dwelleth in death, but<note place="margin">1.

            <p>And can he poſsibly ſeeme to loue his neighbour which doth ſo iudge of them that haue auctoritee ouer him, and whom he is commaunded to obey, that they neither haue nor euer had, any feare of God, or loue to his ſauing word? but allwayes endeuoured them ſelues to oppugne and withſtand the ſame? Surely theſe are not ſignes of loue, but<note place="margin">Heretikes voyde of charitee</note> of hatred. Seemeth he to loue his neighbour
<pb facs="tcp:17065:67"/>
which doth not only ſeparat him ſelf from one perſon, but from all which truly profeſſe Chriſt, and from the vniuerſall catholyke churche, condemning his fathers and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of impiety as men that had reſisted the holy Ghoſt, and would not embrace a knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truth?</p>
            <p>The property of charitee and (Loue) is to vnyte and knytte together, and not to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratt and deuyde. This word therfore, <hi>Drinke ye of the cuppe,</hi> is not that ſauing or liuely worde. But the ſauing word is Loue: That is to ſaye.

            <p>Yet are there ſome which labour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade<note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telt ie of Sathan.</note> vnto the people, that this is the waye and only meane to ſtay the diſſenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion, and that herby only, it might come to paſſe that in your highnes kingdom, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent and vnitee of doctrine and fayth myght be retayned, yf the cuppe, might be permitted to the laye people.

learned to knowe the ſleightes of Sathan.

            <p>And ſuerly to me this waye ſeemeth contrary to reaſon and common ſenſe. The fathers haue been of farre co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary opinion: They thought not the meane to que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,<note place="margin">Note, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vve here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies haue bene que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the olde Fathers</note> to be permiſsion, but by making of contrary decrees, and conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>VVhat iniquitee ſeemed to be in that matter that Neſtorius would haue our lady to be called the mother of Chriſt? Did not ſhee in deed beare Chriſt? Doo we not fynde her in the ſcriptures commonly called the mother of Ieſu, and neuer termed directly the mother of God?</p>
            <p>Yet ſeemed it good to the holy fathers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in the councell holden at Epheſus to<note place="margin">Concil. Epheſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Can. 2.</note> make this decree, that yf any man ſhould call her the mother of Christ, and not the

            <p>And litle did it moue them that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius ſtill cryed out, he leaned to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe word of God, or that in all the canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſcriptures it could not be founde that euer ſhe were termed the mother of God, and that they owght to receiue nothing which were not expreſly contayned therin: for they ſawe well ynough that the hereſie of Neſtorius (wherby he laboured to proue that our lady when ſhee bare Chriſt was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but of a bare man only) could not any other waye be ſooner quenched then by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and generall conſtitution to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Neither was their opinion fruſtrat therin. For ſoo deepe a roote in the myndes of men, did this decree of the holy fathers take, that euen to this daye (<note n="*" place="margin">In the yere of our lorde 435.</note> as long as it is ſince that councell) ther is no natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> found (wher the Goſpell of Chriſt is receyued) in whoſe vulgar tong the virgin Mary is not more commonly called the mother of God, then the mother of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Agayne wee knowe there is a Canon of<note place="margin">Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt. 50.</note> the Apoſtles that ſuche as be Chriſtened ſhould be thryſe dypped. Yet for auoiding the

            <p>Neither are wee ignorant that Chriſt made the ſacrament of his body and bloud in vnleauened bread, which cuſtome was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a whyle obſerued in the churche, and is agayne at this daye.

But after the hereſie of the Hebionites ceaſed, the Latyn churche
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17065:70"/>
thought good to returne agayne to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted manner of conſecrating in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened bread. Thus wee ſee our holy fathers thought not good by permiſsion to nooriſhe hereſies, but by meere contrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to ſuppreſſe them.</p>
            <p>But ſomwhat they ſaye is to be graunted to the multitude which require this. VVhat yf the multitude ſhould propound this pointe of doctrine: that only God the father<note place="margin">A truthe receyued by the churche is not to be aboliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed for ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisfie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the fond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of a multitud.</note> were to be adored, and called vppon, but Chriſt to be holden only for an aduocate? Shall we ſay that this is ſtraight wayes to be graunted, becauſe the multitude required it? The matter goeth yll, when we ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſe to followe the vnlearned multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, then the iudgement of thoſe, who are properly called to this office: <q>Namely ſynce it is truly ſayd: that the multitude is the<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. ho. 1. oper. imperfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Matt.</note> mother of ſedition and contumacye, and the ſmall nomber the miſtreſe of diſcipline.</q> The multitude ought to be gouerned, and not to gouerne: ought to obey, but not to preſcribe lawes: That kingdom is in an hard and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull caſe, where the Rule and gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtandeth in the multitude. As in all other
<pb facs="tcp:17065:71"/>
thinges, ſo chieffly in matters of religion it is diligently to be conſidered, not who, or how many, doo requyre, but what the thing is, that is required.</p>
            <p>The multitude requyred of the Apostles and their followers that they ſhould denye Chriſt, and offer incenſe to idolls: The power and auctoritee did alſo earneſtly aduyſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therunto. But what did they to this? [VVee<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> muſt (ſayd they) obey God rather then men.] And ſo they were ready to indure al kynd of puniſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yea &amp; to laye downe their nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they would do that they required: yea and by their martyr dome they ꝑformed in deed that they had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>VVhat your part is to doo (most vertuous kyng) in the ſuppreſsing of hereſies you are not ignorant: You are taught this alſo by the lawes of your contrey, to the keeping wherof you bound your ſelf by an othe, when you<note place="margin">Note<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> were inueſted in this your kingdom. Verely all men which will be accompted Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, eſpecially wee that be biſshops and guides of religion, muſt rather deſire a thowſand dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, then once to denye Christ.</p>
            <p>But he denyeth Christ, not only which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17065:71"/>
confeſſeth him not to be God, and acknowle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him only for an aduocat, or he which dooth not beleue euery poynt and article, which the infallible auctoritee of the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall ſcriptures preſcribeth vnto vs, either of his diuinite or of his humanite: but allſo he, which dooth not in all pointes communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catt with the vnitee of his churche. For Chriſt is both the head and the body: The head is the only begotten ſonne of God, and his body is the Churche: they be as huſband<note place="margin">VVhat is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye Chriſt.</note> and wyfe two in one fleſhe. VVherfore he dooth as myche denye Chriſt which dooth ſo diſſent from his body the Churche, that he thinketh the communion therof not to be ſpred ouer all, but to be found ſeparat in<note place="margin">De vnita te eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae ca. 4. in 1.

            <p>There is extant in Euſebius an epiſtle of Dionyſius Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drinus to Nouatus, wherin he writeth that martyrdome indured for not deuyding the Churche, is as glorious, as that which is indured for refuſing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte idolatry: <q>Yea and ſurely in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:17065:72"/>
(ſaieth Dionyſius) it is ſo myche more glory. For there he ſuffreth martirdome, but for his owne ſoule: but here for the whole churche.</q> VVherby wee may ſee it is no leſſe greuous offence to deuide the Churche, or<note place="margin">Note.</note> by aſſent to allowe a ſchiſme, then to offer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to idolls.</p>
            <p>Let it therfore be farre from a chriſtian man, and namely from a Biſshopp, by and by to geue his aſſent whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a multitude or power requireth a ſeparation from the Churche of God. It is to be wiſhed that it may pleaſe<note place="margin">The dev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of a good Biſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop.</note> God to geue vs this mynd, rather to ſuffer our bodyes to be deuyded from our ſoules, then by our aſſent to allowe any ſacrilegious deuiſe of ſeparation from Christ or his body the churche. Of this mynd as it becometh all Chriſtians to be, ſo chieffly vs that be biſshopps, yf wee will duely execute the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of good paſtors.</p>
            <p>It is well reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred (moſt vertuous kyng) how when your highnes came first to the gouuernement of this Realme, and that ſome thing was then requyred of you, which partly tended to ſeparation: your highnes curteouſly (as your manner is) and yet well
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17065:72"/>
and flatly denyed their requeſt, ſaying you could not without offence of your conſcience graunt the ſame: vſing farther in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of your councell, and a very notable aſſembly of the people, this ſaying of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> [VVhat auayleth it a man yf he gayne the whole word, and ſuffer his ſoule to periſhe? or what exchaunge may a man make for his ſoule?]</p>

            <p>I reaſon not as though it were true which they ſeke to perſuade, that it ſhould myche perteyne to the preſeruation of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillite of your Realme, yf the vſe of the cuppe were graunted to thoſe which require it: to whom it may well be ſayd, [you wotc not what ye aſke.] But it is in deed moſt<note place="margin">Matth. 10</note> certayne, and vndoubted, that yf the thing they require be graunted, that ſhall bryng

            <p>Here Sathan by this his champion goeth to his matter more ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, then by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which contend ſo earneſtly for the cuppe, and ſyche other things as ſeeme of leſſe waight: VVhoſe wily deceytes alſo herein he diſcloſeth, and thinkyng it ſuperfluous to vſe any more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, he fleeth euen ſtraight to the throte: to the end that withowt any more delaye God may be brought in order and<note place="margin">The here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes goe about to bring God i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to order.</note> equallite of degree, with mortall men, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing left vnto him neither any priesthood, nor externe ſacrifice, wherby he ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>knowledged to be God. This is the thing which Sathan by his lymme and truſty ſeruaunt Vergerius thought good eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the firſt brunt to attempt: And ſuerly it hath been truly ſayd: In vayne is that doone by many, which<note place="margin">Ariſt. in Phyſ. li. 1.</note> may be doone by fewe. For what ſhould a man go about the buſ he yf he may eaſely get thorowgh?</p>
            <p>But heare what after a fewe wordes he addeth farther: For after that this man (being ouer curious of the ſtate of forreyn common welthes, wherunto he is a ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17065:80"/>
and euen borne (as it ſeemeth) to ſtirre vp ſeditions) had exhorted the Polonians, that yf theſe iij. thinges were graunted them, they ſhould conſtantly refuſe them, he hath theſe wordes.</p>
            <p>VVote thow well Polonia, this matter<note place="margin">Beholde here an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and plaine pro teſting proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> which now lyeth in controuerſy touching religion may indure no moderation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Marke well what I ſaye and laye it in thy remembraunce. For there be ſome that ſay, were it not trowe we poſsible that ſome meane migt be found to appeaſe this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy? I anſwer (ſayth he) that none can poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be fownd. For yf the papacy remayne in force, the doctrine of Ieſu Chriſt can not be free. And againe yf the doctrine of Ieſu Chriſt which wee profeſſe doo preuayle, then of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitee muſt the whole papacy be rooted vp, ſo as ther is none other meane of concord or eſtabliſshing of the true churche of Chriſt, but that the whole papacy with all the tiranny and wicked doctryne therof, be cleerly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
            <p>And ſure as for that Vergerius writeth that the ſtate of religion may indure no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, or concord, I can not well denye, but he writeth truly. For either a man muſt be a whole Chriſtian or a whole Lutheran.
<pb facs="tcp:17065:81"/>
There is no haltyng on either ſyde. As well ſhalt thou be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned yf thou be a half Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian or a half Lutheran as yf thou were a whole Lutheran.</p>
            <p>I call him an half Chriſtian, which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<note place="margin">VVho is a demye Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> all thinges as he ought to doo of Chriſt the head, dooth yet by his owne priuat fancye in certayne rytes deuyde him ſelf from the body.

Therfore he will be halfe a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and half a Lutheran: that is to ſay a Sathanist: For Chriſt him ſelf ſayth, [No man can ſerue ij.<note place="margin">Matt. 6.

Therfore they

are in dede very muche deceyued which thinke to contriue a concord by mediocrite<note place="margin">Eſai. 28.</note> in matters of religion. [The bed is ſtraight (ſayth the prophet) ſo as the one muſt nedes fall out, and a ſcant cloke ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not couer both.] They can not be together in one bed, that is to ſay Chriſt and Luther may not ioyne in one mans hart, the one of them muſt nedes faull out: they can not be both couered with one cloke. VVherfore in ſome part of rytes and ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces to profeſſe Chriſt, and in an other part Luther, is nothing ells, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye whole Chriſt. That is therfore ſo true as may be, that matters of religion admyt no concord by that meane.</p>

All this is but fooliſhnes. For Chriſt allſo found in the Iuiſhe nation abuſe emong the Scribes and Phariſees, yet did he not therfore reiect al things which they held and tawght. But wee confeſſe that vnder the papacy is<note place="margin">See vvhat Luther graunteth to Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes.</note> myche good Chriſtianitee, yea and all good Chriſtianitee. And that from thence it hath come vnto vs. Yea truly wee graunt that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the papacy is the true ſcripture, the true baptiſme, the true ſacrament of the aultar, the true keyes of remiſsion of ſynnes, the true office of preaching, the true Cathechiſme which is the lords prayer, the x.

            <p>See you now (moſt vertuous kyng) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the deuyſes of Sathan tend, when by his ſowldyar Vergerius and by others of that kynd he ſeeketh to haue the vniuerſall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy taken away? For he ſeeketh therin (by the verdit of Luther) to haue taken away the true ſcripture, true Baptiſme, the true Sacrament of the Aultar, the true keyes of remiſsion of ſynnes, the true office of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, the true Catechiſme, true Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitee, yea and the very true kernell of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitee. And haue not theſe his deuiſes ſucceded as he would haue them?</p>
            <p>Firſt Luther ſowght to take away the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,<note place="margin">The foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> layd by Luther</note> and therunto he layd certayne founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as we haue before ſhewed. For firſt in deſpight of the Pope and the councell, he graunted the cuppe to the laye people. Then he abrogated auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t rytes and ceremonies, and inſtituted newe. Not long after of the<note place="margin">Luthers procedin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> number of the vy. ſacramentes he tooke away v.

ſprang Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taryes, and Anaptiſtes, who tooke from vs thoſe ij. ſacramentes allſo, of the aultar, and baptiſme, which ij.

For<note place="margin">The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof.</note> they ſeing Luther thus to play the Pope, yea and more then a Pope, could not broke this intollerable tyranny of the man.</p>

            <p>I vſe ſomtyme (moſt vertuous kyng) to reade the triffles of thoſe heretikes which are of no great name, that I may knowe the better how things goe amongeſt them. My happe was (emong others) to hyt vpon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Germayne Luther an named Eraſmus,

And of an other at Francfort that would in no wyſe kepe the feast of Chriſtmas daye. And why I pray you? Forſooth in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight of the Pope: leſt they ſhould ſeeme in any thing to impart with the papacy, that is to ſay with Chriſtianitee: they had rather all the memory of Chriſt his benefits, were extinguiſshed, then they would celebrat the ſame with thoſe Chriſtians that acknowledge the Pope.</p>

            <p>First the moſt ſeuere commaundements<note place="margin">The cauſe vvhy the catholikes may not conſent to the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes. Galat. 1. Matt. 12. Ezeeh. 14. 1.

theſe ſcriptures to our owne proper ſence, we will in fewe, ſhewe, how the auncient ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke fathers haue expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them, to the end euery man may plainly perceiue, that wee doo very truly vſe them against theſe enemyes of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>And first who is ther to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of Athanaſius is not knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and wel thowght of? <q>VVho (as S.

            </p>
            <p>Behould this good Father (whoſe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the churche is holy and immortal) ſayth, he is accurſed of the catholyke chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, who ſo euer ſhould go about to teache (yea though it were owt of the holy ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res) any of theſe poyntes. But (o holy father) by what auctoritee thinkeſt thou that may be done, yf he teache the ſame owt of the ſcriptures? For ſooth (ſayth he) by the aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritee of S.

            <p>A marueilous matter: The ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which the heretikes of our age haue allwayes in their mowthe, wherby they thinke as with a ramme of Iron to aſſault, and ouerthrow the whole auctoritee of the fathers and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cells, thou bringeſt foorth on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary ſyde.

eſpecially generall, and by them deliuered to vs, from hand, to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, thou thinkeſt him not only, not to be harkened vnto, but allſo to be accurſed: and that wee muſt firmly remayne in that, which wee haue receiued: though a man bring neuer ſo many textes of ſcripture in apparence to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Athanaſius will not that the children<note place="margin">Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius.</note> ſhould iudge of the decrees of the fathers. He will not that ſyche thinges as hath once been tryed by the rule of the ſcriptures, ſhould agayne be caulled back to the ſame, vnleſſe they will ſhewe them ſelues not to<note place="margin">Eſai. 57.

            <p>But did holy Athanaſius when he wrote thus, teache vs to contemne and holde for nawght, the expreſſe word of God? No: God forbid: It was neuer any part of his thought, but he would haue taken for the pure and

expreſſe word of God that, which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, and not which the heretikes browght foorth: that ſenſe (I ſaye) which the Catholikes, not which the heretikes drewe foorth of the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>VVe fynd notably written by S. Hierome<note place="margin">Hier. in c. 1. ad Gala.</note> 
               <q>that the Goſpell ſtandeth not in the wordes of the ſcripture, but in the ſenſe, not in the ſuperficiall face or ſhewe, but in the marye: not in the leaues full of wordes, but in the roote of reaſon.

            <p>But yet agayne (though perhapps wee maye herein doe otherwyſe then becometh vs) to the end the truth may the more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appere, wee thinke it not amyſſe to bringe foorth euen an heretikes expoſition of theſe wordes of S.

            <p>And ſurely this his ſentence (though he were an heretike) we can not but in this poynt very well allowe.

            <p>Heerby, it may eaſely appere what the auncient fathers thowght to be ſignified in the ſcriptures, by the name of idolls: to wyt heretikes and their faulſe doctrine. For to imbrace as the very word of God, the ſaying of any one man, teaching in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges contrary to the receyued doctrine of the whole Churche, and to adore and inclyne vnto what ſo euer he hath ſayed, or writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what can be a kindly idolatry, yf this be not?

            <p>Luther ſayth: that which I teache is the word of God, and the pure Goſpell. By and by they adore and inclyne vnto it, as before an idoll.

            <p>Doo you now marke (moſt vertuous kyng) to what end Sathan dooth by ſo many his diuers members, make ſo great vaunt and bragging of the expreſſe word of God? There is no one heretike of this our age, which hath not allwayes that in his mouth, which dooth not glory therof, and ſo particularly challenge the ſame vnto himſelf alone, as that he will exclude all others from the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion therof.

well witneſſe this. Bucer allſo wrote that Luther was accuſed of all men to be a man to full of wordes, very imperious, and ouer bitter, not hauing the pacyence to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed by any man: which fault the Tigurins allſo charge him with. <hi>If he looke</hi> (ſayth Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer ſpeaking of Luther) <hi>that no man ſhould in any one thing diſſent from him, then let him proue him ſelf to be a God:</hi> Couertly meaning therby, that he ſought to be reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced as a God, and to haue his word ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all men as the word of God: brefly that it were no more laufull for any man to diſſent from his mynd then from the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god. Thus you ſee his very fellowes thought intollerable this his exceding pryde, wherby he preſumed to ſytte in the temple of God, euen as he were god himſelf.</p>

            <p>And yf (ſayth he) the name of Helias were to be graunted to Luther, yet was it a poynt of ſacrilegious temeritee to affirme him to be the laſt Helias: as though the hand of God were ſhortnyd, that he could not hereafter, ſend a better, or at the leſt an other as good as he. For by what oracle was it oppened vnto them that the treaſures of the mighty power of God were ſo myche diminiſshed and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, in the perſon of one man, that out of ſo great, and incomprehenſible a number, the lyke of him might not be found?</p>
            <p>Here Caluin could not diſſemble the grudge he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyued, in that Luther was thus caulled the last Helias: wherby no place was now left for him, who thought himſelf in no poynt inferiour, but rather ſuperiour to Luther.</p>

            <p>You ſee how the ſacramentaryes themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves can not beare, that the contentes of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bookes, or of the Augustan confeſsion ſhould be receyued as the word of God: though with ſome for all that, it be of more pryſe then the word of God.

            <p>But doo theſe men (which now a dayes haue nothing more in their mowth then the ſcriptures, and the expreſſe word of God) apply their vnderſtanding to this end, that they labour to worke and buyld vp nothing, but Charitee?

            <p>Notable is that ſaying of Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen:<note place="margin">Li. 1. Theo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>logiae.</note> 
               <q>that it is not for all men to talke of diuine matters, no nor lauful at all tymes, and in all companyes to diſpute of all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But good regard is to be had, when, to whom, and to what end, that is to be doone: which matter he purſueth at large.</q>

            <p>Nothing is better, then the reading of the ſcriptures: nothing more proffitable. But there is a certayn tree caullyd Rhodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daphne<note place="margin">Dioſcori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des li. 4.

            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:17065:108"/>But as for wemen how myche better ſhould they be occuped in ſpinning on their distaff, at ſyche tyme as they take on them to diſpute of the word of God?

            <p>If a man ſo vnderstand the ſcripture as he doo therby, edifye and buyld vp Charite, then is it the word of God.

as it were to be handled with our handes, yet is it not acknowledged or receyued. But wretched men they ſuffer the ſame lightly to paſſe away, from their eyes, eares, handes, and hartes, while they falſely perſuade them ſelues, that their ſaluation conſisteth in knowing and reaſoning, and not rather in louing and beleuing.

            <p>VVhich thinges being ſo, why doo we not rather ſpend our whole ſtudy and labour in this poynt, which only and alone we knowe to be neceſſary to our ſaluation, to reteyne among our ſelues mutuall loue and brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charitee, which is the very proper marke of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God? <q>In ſo myche as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the ſcriptures is not to all men a leeke neceſſary.

            <p>Now contrarely all men will ſearch the ſcriptures and diſpute of the ſence and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding therof.

eyes, eares, and myndes of men: that Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee (I ſaie) which only bringeth ſaluation, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>careth to reteyne. And verely looke how myche the oftener and more feruent diſputation is made of the ſcriptures, and of the expreſſe word of God, ſo myche the more dooth Charitee (which all the ſcriptures doo with one voyce ſounde out vnto vs) wexe could in the mindes of men.</p>
            <p>And is it leekly that the ſound vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the ſcriptures, and the expreſſe word of God is there, wher Charite is wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en<note place="margin">Heretikes can not poſsibly haue the expreſſe vvoorde of Godd.</note> ſo could, and hatred ſo hot?

And where they them ſelues, which are departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs (who had rather be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Goſpellers, then Chriſtians) doo not only fight against vs, but allſo one against an other, with ſyche infest, ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ckorous, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian myndes, that no cruell Barbarians or enemyes of Christ his Croſſe, could deale more leeke enemyes?</p>
            <p>Truly before this Goſpell ſprang vp (which is proceded from none leſſe then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ) wee neuer ſawe any ſyche bitternes of myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17065:111"/>
or cruell contentions. Namely emong thoſe, whoſe office was to teache, and open the Goſpel of Chriſt. And ſhall wee cal this the Goſpell? ſhall we call this the expreſſe word of God, from the which all Charitee, the thing most expreſſly commaunded in the Goſpell is ſo vaniſhed, that euen they (which glory to haue been the <note n="*" place="margin">Note this vvell</note> firſt, which (as them ſelues ſay) haue of late brought to light the buryed Goſpell) doo ſo hatefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend emong them ſelues, burne with ſyche mutuall enuy, and ſo byte one an other that<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> it can not be long, but wee must nedes ſee them conſumed one of an other?</p>
            <p>This is ſure the expreſſe word of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, not the expreſſe word of God, ſeing as I haue allredy ſo often ſayd, the expreſſe word of God is only Loue and Charitee. <q>That is it that imbraceth Vnitee, that ioyneth vs all<note place="margin">Ambroſ. in Ca. 3. ad Coloſſ.</note> in one body, that geueth peace, and with pure hart keepeth the ſame.</q> And Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charitee can not be kept, but in the Vnitee of the churche: ſo that in vayne doth he vaunt him ſelfe to haue charite, which doth not imbrace Vnitee. But yf this expreſſe word of God, Charitee, be not kept any where
<pb facs="tcp:17065:112"/>
but in the vnitee of the church, who is there that can thinke that the expreſſe word of God can be found any where out of this vnitee?</p>
            <p>And this is it that in this treatyce I ſhewed before, that ſomtyme when two men bringe foorth one ſelf text of ſcripture, yet God openeth the mouth of one, and the diuel of the other.

            <p>But allthough following S.

            <p>But here theſe fellowes will denye that to be the churche of God which we profeſſe, and wherof we glory and reioyce to be the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble children, and wil go about to challenge that name to their congregation. But I would fayne haue them ſhewe vs their churche. I ſpeake not now of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes, heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly prophetes, nor of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panians, or Seruetians (all which ſectes they haue allredy throwen out of their congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:) but let the Confeſsionistes or Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans ſhewe vs their Churche.</p>
            <p>Melancthon and his followers, Brentius alſo with his bande, are throwen foorth of that Churche, which would be counted of the Auguſtan (not Chriſtian) confeſsion: as
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17065:113"/>
wee may plainly ſee by the writinges of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias Flaccus, and Ioachimus Merlinus, who glory themſelues to be vpright perfect Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans. But yf any man will geue more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyt to the iudgement of Melancthon, or of his diſciple Iustus Menius, then ſhal he fynd that they geue the like iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nt of Flaccus, as Flaccus doth of them.</p>
            <p>VVhere then ſhall wee now fynde this<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g heretikes about their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</note> churche of Luther? Melancthon will not graunt it to be emong the Illiricans: The Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liricans on the other ſyde, ſay it is not emong the Melancthoniſtes or Brentia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whom they haue allredy throwen out from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their Churche. And haue not thus the very followers of Luther by helliſ he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord deuided allſo their owne vnitee, euen as their maiſter before did by most impious ſacrilege diuide and ſeparat him ſelf fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the catholyke vnitee, as from our lordes barne flower? VVhere then ſhall wee ſeeke this church of theirs, which neither of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues wyll graunt to the other? VVho is there ſo deſtitute of all reaſon, that will not rather choſe to remayne in that Churche wherin he was borne, and allſo regenerat in Christ
<pb facs="tcp:17065:114"/>
(which was the greater benefyt) then forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this, to betake him ſelf vnto that, which to them ſelues is ſo vncertayne, and vnknowen?</p>
            <p>But God forbid that a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> catholyke<note place="margin">The true churche of Godd.</note> and right beleuing man, ſhould haue any doubt, whether that churche, wherin not only him ſelf, but his parentes, his graundfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and great grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfathers, haue been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the faith of Chriſt be the true church of God or no. For what were this ells, but to doubt whether he be a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man, or borne of christian parentes, and (as it is written by the Prophet) [to ſtumble at none<note place="margin">Eſai. 59. Pſal. 18. Matt. 8.</note> daye: as in the darke?] God hath placed his tabernacle in the ſunne. He hath planted his churche as a citye vpon an hill, which can not be hidden.</p>
            <p>But of that matter our purpoſe is not to taulke any more in this place, for that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteyneth not properly to this treatyſe, and for that as well in our chriſtian confeſsion, as in our writing which we haue late pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſshed againſt the prolegomena of Bre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius, we haue at large treated of that matter: wher we haue taught you which be the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes

of the true churche: To wytte, that it be one, holy, catholyke and Apoſtolyke churche, wherof except one haue the chiefrule whoſe auctoritee all do acknowledge, it can not be caulled the churche of God.</p>
            <p>Now therfore we wyll not tary any len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vpon this matter: For that I trust wee haue ſufficiently ſhewed that the expreſſe word of God, wherof thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brag ſo myche, is not the word of God, but the expreſſe word of the diuel. For the cleer and expreſſe word of God is Charite. VVhich that it may pleaſe God by his holy ſpirite to power into our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and once to geue ende to thies ſchiſmes and hereſies, and to reſtore to his churche the deſired tranquillite, wee humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeche his infinite mercy. VVhich no doubt he will do, not for our merites (wherunto moſt greuous puniſhementes are dewe) but of his owne exceding great goodnes, ſo that we amend our lyues, and with confidence adreſsing our ſelues to the throne of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, inceſſantly contine we in feruent prayer.</p>
