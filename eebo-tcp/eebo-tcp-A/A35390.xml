            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is a proverb not more vulgar than true, That he that looks on in a game may see as much into it as he that playes. It cannot but be confessed, that this Nation hath been playing a sad game a long time; yet no other than God hath determined by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence, for all the Nations in <hi>Europe</hi> to be partakers of. God gave Tyrants in his Wrath, and will take them away in his Displeasure. The Prize which We now, and They within a few years shall play for, is, THE LIBERTY OF THE SUBJECT: This is the part which some think is so sluggishly acted. But I am of opinion will spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be ended with a joyful <hi>Plaudite</hi> upon the English Stage. So far as I can see by the help of my<note n="*" place="margin">Indeed the discerning of these things belongs to the Internal, not the External sences.</note> Optick Nerves, (whether it be <hi>Intromittendo Species,</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramitendo Radios,</hi> it matters not much) the Liberty of our <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> (if I may call it so without a Solecisme) is most infringed by three sorts of men, <hi>Priests, Physitians, Lawyers;</hi> (yet I accuse not all of those Faculties, Trades, or (if I may be so bold without offence) Monopolies, for that were a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villish trade that had never an honest man in it) <hi>The

               </hi> Bodies, <hi>the third in matters belonging to their</hi> Estates. Amongst these, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitianswalk in the Clouds, their waies being not so discernable to a vulgar view as the waies of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two are; and that's the reason men are led by the noses (worse than beasts, as though oppression had already made them mad) by a company of proud, insulting, domineering Doctors, whose wits were born above five hundred years before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Would it not pity a man to see whol estates wasted in Physick, (<hi>all a man hath spent upon Physitians</hi>) both body and purse consumed upon outlandish rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish? Would it not make both a mans ears glow to hear a man affirm, that God hath created no remedy for such a disease nearer than the <hi>East-Indies?</hi> Is it handsom and wel-beseeming a Common-wealth to see a Doctor ride in State, in Plush with a footcloath, and not a grain of Wit but what was in print before he was born? Send for them into a Visited House, they will answer, They dare not come. How many honest poor souls have been so cast away, will be known when the Lord shall come to make Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Blood. Send for them to a poor mans house, who is not able to give them their Fee, then they will not come, and the poor Creature for whom Christ died must forfet his life for want of money.</p>

            <p>I am informed that Physitians in <hi>Italy</hi> may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to go to any patient (if at leisure) that sends for them, provided they have their fee, which (if they go alone) is but eighteen pence, and yet by visiting many patients they get as much money if not more than ours do, and by visiting so many patients can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but better their judgments abundantly, besides they carry their Scholers with them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them by the symptomes what the disease is, in what part of the body it lies, how strong it is &amp;c. for which they have a shilling more, which is but half a crown in all, and out of question viewing the patient is a better way to find the disease than view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the piss, though a man should view as much as the <hi>Thames</hi> will hold. I cannot conceive (if the State saw it fitting) that such a course could be prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to our Common-wealth; But some self seekers (of whom I expect to be traduced, for the Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this book) will be objecting against me for quoting the vertues of the recepts, of which I meet with one in the Epistle of the <hi>Colledg</hi> to the Reader, <hi>viz.</hi> It tends to the destruction of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, because thereby ignorat fellows will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the practice of Physick, and therefore they say they wrote it only to the nurslings of <hi>Apollo.</hi> But 1. If <hi>Apollo</hi> had served the <hi>nine Muses</hi> so as they serve the <hi>Apothecaries, viz.</hi> hid all his art from them, they would have had no more wit than <hi>nine Geese.</hi> 2. All the Nation are already Physitians, If you ayl any thing, every one you meet, whether man or woman will prescribe you a medicine for it. Now whether this book thus translated will make them more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or more knowing, any one that hath but a

What reason can be given why <hi>England</hi> should be deprived of the benefit of other Nations? Worthy country men the Colledg doth in effect say, that you are the greatest fools under the Sun: Are you not much engaged to them think you? As for Apothecaries they have least reason of all to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, because it tends to the advancement of their trade, If they have not wit enough to know, that private men cannot make up most of these composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions themselves, but knowing the vertues of the vertues of them, will resort the more to them for physick, they deserve the name of a company of Dunces. I am confident there be those in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that have wit enough to know that the <hi>Papists</hi> and the <hi>Colledg of Physitians</hi> wil not suffer <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> to be printed in our mother tongue, both upon one and the same grounds, and both colour it over with the same excuses.</p>
            <p>For my own part I am now in the prime of my age, therefore not affected with the lightness and vanity of youth, nor the dotage of old age, I cal the Heavens to witness and all the powers therein, that I aim not at any private interest in doing this Work, but purely the good of my country, I never received (that I know of) the least prejudice by any of the <hi>Colledg</hi> which might procure desire of revenge in a melancholly breast.

            <p>PHYSICK which gives thee health wisheth good health to thee. And that it may the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for thy health, it bath built up this new A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries shop, which it hath not only stored with a rich Magazine of wholsom medicines, but hath also taken so much care for thy safety, that they should be compounded faithfully without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, safely without error: But thou wilt say, What need is there of this, seeing there is scarce a forrein City or University of any fame, but have abundantly performed this, both antient and modern. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is true: But if so many Antients as <hi>Mesue, Myrepsus, Alexandrinus</hi> and others rested not satisfied in this, but every one of them would have his own Dispensatory, the <hi>Romans</hi> theirs, the <hi>Venetians theirs,</hi> the <hi>Florentine</hi> theirs, the <hi>Bergomenses</hi> theirs, the <hi>Augustan</hi> theirs, and others which we pass by in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Why should not the <hi>Londoners</hi> have theirs? as their own proper gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the praise of which consists not in that it is Gorgeous, but in that it is their Own; not in that it is made of Purple or Pall, but in that it is<note n="*" place="margin">some wise men question that extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> fitted to English bodies. Besides, it happens that we are rather distracted than furnished with such varieties, this plenty hath set us to seek, and that disease we meet withal here ariseth alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of fulness. The vaster the wood is and the more paths is hath, the sooner may the passenger lose his way. The more spacious the Sea is, the more need of a Pilot. And this our Apothecaries having been a long time distitute of, are tossed up and down with diverse waves, and suffer a thousand distractions, one in making up his Medicines running in one path another in another; one followes <hi>Cordus,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fernelius,</hi> a third the <hi>Augustane Physitians,</hi> and a fourth his own Fancy, so that a medicine comes to have so many several <hi>Ideas</hi> as there are shops, which mischief that it may not turn Epidemical,
<pb facs="tcp:54720:7"/>
to the great hazard both of Physitians and sick people, Wee intend by this work, like as by an anchor cast, to settle the floating course of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding medicines, and to restrain it within its proper bounds and Channels, whilst we do not only teach one and the same rule and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of compounding, but also impose and command it, from which men ought not to err a hairs bredth (as they say) that so both Physitians and Apothecaries being guided by one and the same threed, they may unanimusly proceed these in prescribing, those in compounding medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
            <p>There is another grievous plague also which cals aloud for a Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satory, to wit, The deceit and impostures of men, who to get a little gain, sell filthy dregs instead of good drugs, nay even those which are of most value, Treacle, Mitbridate, and Alkermes, are adulterated, so that they are no longer Antidotes but Poysons, not a help but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to the sick, such abominable man-slayers though they deserve the whip or gallows rather than our Censure, yet all may happily be salved (for English men) by benefit of this <hi>Book</hi> and poor sick peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples health provided for, The happy and salubrious Counsel, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and praise of which we do not ascribe to our selves, but (that we may confess the very truth) its original came higher, and its rise was more divine, <hi>the beginning came from Jupiter,</hi> we mean from our most soveraign, and (which is more rare) most learned, and (which is more grateful) most vigilant for the publick safety, <hi>KING JAMES;</hi> who as he hath alwaies studied and happily setled, peace in the Christian Orb, unity in the Brittan Orb, conformity in the Eclesiastical Orb, So he hath vouchsased to illustrate our Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Orb and physical Sphear with his light, and to appoint wholsom laws to us, for a physical concord and certain harmony of making me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, so that as before he had respect to the salvation of souls, so here to the health of bodies; before to the dignity of the subject, here to their life and health, so that it may be truly spoken of him which the divine Prophet spake of the Sun, <hi>Nothing is hid from his heat,</hi> nothing secluded from his care, and the same motto seems to be engraven by a divine hand upon his breast which is upon his coyn, <hi>the safety of the people is the supream Law.</hi> For when he had granted new Liberties, new Priviledges to the Apothecaries of London, by his Letters patents, he inculcales upon this above all, that when this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensatory comes out to publick view, they should religiously bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

The like we have done in the composition of pils, which if they were made into a mass after the ancient manner with juyces or waters, they would soon be too dry, therefore we have appointed it to be done with syrups, also whereas in most Authors, some things are totally left to the judgment of the Artificer, especially in the quantity of Honey and Sugar, under these two letters, <hi>q. s.</hi> or words, <hi>[so much as is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent]</hi> whence it comes to pass that the same medicine hath neither the same consistence nor the same vertue, we have for the future<note n="*" place="margin">in a hopsack</note> taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this power from the Artificer, and for this cause have taken some of the most skilful Apothecaries into counsel with us, by whose help and pains we have agreed upon a certain manner of composition, and have designed a certain quantity and dose, which they may not ad to nor take from. And lastly seeing in most Dispensatories both ancient and modern, the use and vertue of every medicine is described whence ignorant fellows and Mountebanks may arm themselves for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of physick, and so put a sword into a madmans hand for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Common-wealth, we have added nothing at all of the vertues, for we write this to the learned only, and to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

A <hi>Sextary</hi> contains eighteen ounces. A <hi>Congy</hi> six Sextaries</p>
               <p>These measures amongst the Romans contained not just the same quantities, for their <hi>Cyathus</hi> contained an onnce and an half, a drachm and a scruple, Their <hi>Sextary,</hi> contained but 14. ounces 3. quarters and half a quarter, and amongst the Grecians not so much, it is called a Sextary because it is the six part of a <hi>Congy.</hi> Neither did the Roman <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina</hi> contain altogether 7. ounces and an half, Their <hi>Libra</hi> I suppose to that which <hi>Galen</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>The PREFACE.</head>
               <p>BEfore I begin the Catalogue I thought good to premise a few words to the Reader:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let him have a care he mistake not one thing for another, <hi>viz.</hi> Herbs for Roots, or either of them for Flowers: If he cast but his eye up to the top of the Page, he shall there see which it is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let a due time be observed (cases of necessity excepted) in gathering all Simples; for which take these few Rules: All Roots are of most vertue when the sap is down in them, <hi>viz.</hi> toward the latter end of summer, or beginning of the spring, for happily in winter many of them cannot be found; you may hang up many of them a drying, by drawing a string through them and so keep them a whol year.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54720:11"/>
               <p>Herbs are to be gathered when they are fullest of juyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they run up to seed; and if you gather them in a hot sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine day, they will not be so subject to putrifie; the best way to dry them, is in the sun, according to Dr. REASON, though not according to Dr. TRADITION: Such Herbs as remain green all the year, or are very full of juyce, it were a folly to dry at all, but gather them only for present ufe, as Houseleek, Scurvy-grasse, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Let Flowers be gathered when they are in their prime, in a sunshine day, and dryed in the sun. Let the seeds be perfectly ripe before they be gathered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let them be kept in a dry place, for any moisture, though it be but a moist air, corrupts them, which if perceived in time, the beams of the sun will refresh them again.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Take notice, that only the Latin names, were quoted by the Colledge and are to be seen at the beginniug of each Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a different letter, the English name together with the Temperature and Vertues were added by the Translator, he hopes for the publick good.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All the Lattin names to one Herb are not set down, that would have done no other good in the world than took up more paper, and by consequence made the Book the dearer.</p>

concerning the powerful operation of which I shall only qnote you one story of many, out of <hi>Monardus,</hi> a Physitian of note. A certain noble man (quoth he) very well known to me, by only bearing this stone tyed to his arm, voided such a deal of gravel, that he feared the quantity would do him hurt, by avoiding so much of it, wherefore he laied it from him, and then he avoided no more gravel; but afterwards being again troubled with the stone, he ware it as before, and presently the pain eased, and he avoided gravel as before, and was never troubled with the pain of the stone so long as he ware it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jasper,</hi> being worn stops bleeding, easeth the labour of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">Mathiolus.</note> stops lust, resists feavers and dropsies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AEtites,</hi> or the stone with child, because being hollow in<note place="margin">Pliny.</note> the middle, it contains another little stone within it, it is<note place="margin">Dioscorides.</note> found in an Eagles nest, and in many other places, this stone being bound to the left arm of women with child, staies their miscarriage or abortio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but when the time of their labor comes, remove it from their arm, and bind it to the inside of their thigh, and it brings forth the child, and that (almost) without any pain at all.</p>
               <p>Young swallows of the first brood if you cut them up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the time they were hatched, and the next full moon, you shall find two stones in their ventricle, one reddish, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blackish, these being hung about the neck in a piece of<note place="margin">Albersus.</note> stags leather, help the falling-sickensse, and feavers. The truth is, I have found the reddish one my self without any regard to the lunation, but never tried the vertues of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> purgeth melancholly being taken inwardly,<note place="margin">the Florentine Physitians.</note> outward worn as a Jewel, it makes men cheerful fortunate and<note place="margin">Dioscorides.</note> rich.</p>
               <p>And thus I end the stones, the vertues of which if any think<note place="margin">Cardanus.</note> incredible, I answer, 1. I quoted the Authors where I had them, 2. I know nothing to the contrary but why it may be as possible as the sound of a trumpet is to incite a man to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or of a fidle to dauncing, and if I have added a few Simples which the Colledg left out, I hope my fault is not much, or at least wise, venial.</p>

               <p>THVS Courteous Reader have I led thee by the band through the <hi>Catalogue of Simples</hi> contained in this <hi>Dispensatory:</hi> For what intent the Colledge quoted them, I cannot tell; considering they quoted neither English names nor Vertues; and the Lattin names (most part of them) may be found here and there throughout the Dispensatory: It is true, I willingly omitted the vertues of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, partly because I would not have the Book too big, partly because they are not easily gotten, and many of the operations I bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in silence for fear knaves should put them in practice to do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: Remembring a speech once in a Sermon of Bishop <hi>Latimers, I could (saith he) reprove other sins from this text, but I wil not; for fear you knowing what they be, should practise them.</hi> Thus I send this Treatise of <hi>Simples</hi> into the merciless world, being not careful of the Slanders, or Envy of traducing tongues, or brains of ill Common-wealths men; my own Conscience bearing me witness that I sincerely aimed at the Publick good of my Country in it; and to all ingenious people shall never cease to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main theirs whilst my own,</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That I left out all the Simple distilled waters, quoted by the Colledge; many of which were ridiculous, the simples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to be obtained green in this Land: And sure none in</hi> Bedlam <hi>are so mad as to go about to distil simple water out of dry things.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The best way (that I know) to distil Simple Waters, is, To bruise the Herbs or Flowers, of what you would distil, and having pressed out the juyce, distil it in a Glass-stil in sand; and so will the Water be better by odds than if distilled in a Peuter-stil as usually they do.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Only and barely the Receipts themselves were quoted by the Colledge; the Vertues of them, as also the Marginal Notes, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever sentences are marked with a capital A. are Additions.

                  <p>A. If admiration were not the daughter of ignorance I should most assuredly have admired at two things in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. 1. At the time of gathering this same Squil, It seems the whol Colledg laid al their learned heads together to hammer out the time when this Squil must be taken out of the earth, &amp; the result of their consultations was, That it must be gathered [<hi>circiter Canis ortum</hi>] about the rising of the Dog-star, but which of the two Dog-stars they mean, whether <hi>Syrius</hi> or <hi>Procyon,</hi> or what rising of either, whether <hi>Cosmical, Acronyct,</hi> or <hi>Heliacal,</hi> I know not, nor I think themselves neither, a child in Astronomy cannot chuse but smile at their learned ignorance, It seems they well observe that excellent maxime of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in his <hi>Praefat ad Astron nemo debet &amp;c. No man ought to commit his life into the hands of that Physitian who is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Astrology because he is a Physitian of no value.</hi> Indeed the truth is, the roots are brought to us from beyond sea, and we must be content with such as we can get.</p>
                  <p>A. 2. It seems somthing strang to me why this Squill must
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54720:58"/>
be dried in the shaddow, In truth I cannot but wonder at the folly not only of the Physitians of our times, but also of the ancient, who build their faith upon tradition, though as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the truth as the East is to the West, viz. that all herbs must or ought to be dried in the shaddow, because they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Sun draws away their vertue, were it not (I pray) a notable peice of pollicy for a Farmer to dry his hay in the shaddow, for fear the Sun should draw away the vertue of it? doth noth not Experience (a master worth ten 'of Tradition) teach that the hotter Sun the Hay is dryed in, the more vertue is in it? and is Hay any thing else but a confusion of herbs, he who drieth his herbs in the Sun shall find them, 1. of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter colour, 2. of a better tast, 3. to yeild more salt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must needs be best.</p>
                  <p>A. Now a word or two to the vertues, according to <hi>Gallen,</hi> from whom this recept was taken.</p>
                  <p>A. It conduceth wonderfully to health, for it attenuateth the humours, chiefly flegm, neither doth it suffer it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the stomach, head, belly, liver, spleen, nerves, or bones, it suffers no obstruction to be in the body, it purgeth the head, loosens the belly, and provokes urine, it is given with good successe to such as have the gout, or the falling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicknesse, thus <hi>Gallen.</hi>

               <p>THus Courteous Reader have I gone through the whol Work, I am not conscious to my self that I have just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given offence to any by translating this Work, If any take offence, it is to be shrewdly suspected it ariseth from self inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests. Once more let me advise the ignorant not to be too busie with what they have no skill in, for as Physick (as the never dying Hippocrates truly saith) was never ordained for disorderly and disobedient persons, so was the administration of it never ordained for dunces, therefore let every one that administers physick, seriously consider the great account must be made another day before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the holy Angels, and do nothing rashly but upon serious consideration, as he desires it should fare well with him when the Lord comes to make inquisition for blood.</p>
               <p>Pure pitty to the Commonalty of England (I assure you)
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:54720:167"/>
was the motive, the prevailing argument that set my brain and pen a work about this subject, many of whom to my knowledg have perished either for want of money to fee a Physitian, or want of knowledg of a remedy happily gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing in their garden, and if any be angry, because I have stript the Daw out of his borrowed feathers, I am not careful, all ingenuous people that love their country will judg like themselves, of whom I rather be deservedly reproved, then of others ignorantly commended.</p>
