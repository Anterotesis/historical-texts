         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MEeting with a new Impreſſion of the Advertiſement, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Lockyers</hi> Bauble, (Titled by the name of <hi>Pillula Radiis Solis extracta</hi>) in praiſe of which he hath ſtitcht up the names of as many Diſeaſes, all curable by that trifle, (or elſe the Knave and Fool lies) as ever he made uſe of patches for the Botching up a Beggars Coat, (to which ſort of people, as my undeniable Information aſſures me, he was at the beſt of his former Condition, a denominated <hi>Taylor.</hi>) I find a Letter of yours (like the cloſe of ſyrup after a Fart,) concluding that Tractate,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51316:2"/>
uſher'd in with the Licenſed Phyſicians Encomium, that you are a Perſon of <hi>Quality;</hi> which although it might have been verifyed, (had you been indeed but the common Hangman,) yet my Charity binds me to an higher eſteem of you; that you are the true Father of the whole Scribble in praiſe of that ſilly Cheat, which he (who hath been accuſtomed to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther other mens Brats, as well as to endeavour to impoſe ſome of his upon them) lets paſs under his own name, both in City and Country.</p>
            <p>Knowing therefore Sir, beforehand, that you are a man of <hi>Quality,</hi> as ſuch a Perſon I ſhall addreſs my ſelf unto you, and endeavour (being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured what Predicament you ſtand in, ſo far as the Pen of a <hi>Botcher</hi> can aſcertain me) to find out, if I can, your eſpecial <hi>Qualities.</hi> And truly, Sir, profeſſing my ſelf a Scholar, (which honor the worſt of mine Enemies dare not deny me.) I take notice firſt of your falſe Latine, (a very bad <hi>Quality</hi>) for which, ſhould I take you to task as a rigid Paedagogue, and make you untruſs for the firſt fault, your Breech would be bloudy, and too ſore to ſit on, if for all the lapſes commited in that very ſhort Epiſtle, you had (as you deſerve) a ſeveral laſh.</p>
            <p>Next your Tautology, fie for ſhame! A Perſon of <hi>Quality,</hi> and yet in ſo ſhort an Epiſtle, (that I am confident you would at your Execution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a longer <hi>Ex tempore</hi> Prayer) four times to torture a Dyſſyllable (in which an Emphaſis lies) and could find no Synonymous word, nor Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſis for <hi>Adage.</hi> Certainly Sir, when you ſhall have confidence ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to pluck your Woodcocks head out of the Thicket, and (with ſhame enough) own your name, I ſhall ſend you a <hi>Sylva Synonymorum,</hi> that you may not ſo oft Re-ſeeth your poor Coleworts in your next E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, (And truly Sir, I have now traced you as far as the Oyſter Wenches at <hi>Billingſgate</hi>) I find you an uncivil, lying, rayling fellow; yet though I call you Fellow, do not think that I account you my Fellow, though Mounſieur <hi>Le Quack</hi> have ranked you in the Predicament of <hi>Quale,</hi> yet I ſhall not reckon you for <hi>Aliquid</hi>

But let my Book ſpeak for it ſelf. 'Tis not your barking (had you as many heads as <hi>Cerberus</hi>) can blemiſh my Reputation, nor will your ſlanders ſo cunningly caſt (as not to make you anſwerable for your unmannerly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes to the Law) at all enervate the undeniable force of my Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made concerning the danger of <hi>Lockyers</hi> Pills, which accuſation it were fit you ſhould have anſwered, and wip'd off the imputations, with much (both) truth and juſtice laid on them: If I have had Misfortunes, and by them troubles, though they have grieved me, yet do they not ſhame me; and I do, and ſhall challenge any <hi>Stygian</hi> Cur of the blackeſt mouth, to diſcant upon my life and manners, but let him do it with truth, or let him own his name; and avow what he ſpeaks or writes, and I ſhall effectually convince him of his Falſhood and Folly. 'Tis enough to me that where I am known your Abuſes will ſignifie ſo little, that it would be hard for me to prove (with truth and candour) my ſelf damnified to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of one farthing, by either the <hi>Quondam</hi> Botcher himſelf, or you his <hi>Zany</hi> by himſelf alone (in which I dare ſwear he is ſingular) Dub'd, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Perſon of <hi>Quality,</hi> unleſs it be of Rank <hi>Quality.</hi> Had you been a Voucher for him within this four years to have ſold a Horſe on his own ſcore you might have been hang'd for your pains; and yet to have given him but twelve pence a head for all the Cattel he fed, might have made you hang your ſelf for want of a Dinner: But the world is well amended. O bleſſed <hi>Abſaloms</hi> Pillar! The man of Judgment wonders, and reports it of himſelf as a ſtrange thing, that within this year or little more, he hath mended not only in his activity (<hi>Taylors</hi> and <hi>Botchers</hi> are nimble to the Laſt) but alſo in his fleſh, being waxed in his waſte he doth not know how; I'le do him the favour (in requital of his Poſt-ſcript) to tell him: Since this new fangled Juggle hath bleſſed his Purſe with Crowns (of which he boaſts largely enough) he hath eat more good Meat, and drunk more good Drink, then in half his life before; and ſince his change of Linen, he hath queſtionleſs ſhook off, and caſt aſide ſome ſcores, if not hundreds, of his ancient hangers on and retainers; and can his wiſdom be ſo at a <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus</hi> to find out a reaſon of his growing fat and thriving? Certainly it is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51316:3"/>
a ſign of a weak judgment; Howbeit he is bleſſed with a happy invention, and that followed with a ſtrange fortune; But oh the miſery of anſwering Letters, after ſo great charge in paying for writing, and Printing ſo many books of reiteratedly altered Copies. What a plague this is that ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a Chemiſt and Licenſed Phyſician, ſhould have the ill luck to learn no more writing, then to be able to ſcratch or ſcore up in Chalk, and after to Copy out in Letters; a Dog could not read, the particulars of a <hi>Botchers</hi> Bill, and to caſt up the ſumme total in ſomething like to Figures: Take notice therefore you that deal with him, that he can find ſome better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to buſie himſelf in, then anſwering Letters; Therefore that no occaſion of troubling him may be pretended for the future, take notice what his Pill will do; By it all Diſeaſes in general, the compiling of a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue whereof in particular, with ſome other appurtenances to make up his Scribble or Pamphlet, coſt him thirty ſeven pound in earneſt, Printing and all accounted together, (or elſe the Knave told a ſtrapping Lie to an acquaintance and friend of mine in jeſt) will be cured he knows not, nor is it any great matter how; nor dare any Malady, Sickneſs, Diſeaſe, or Grief, by what name ſoever, or title diſtinguiſhed, ſtand in the body and look his Pill in the face, but muſt (<hi>Preſto Jack</hi>) be gone and vaniſh, with this one and only <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That if God have a mind, intention, or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to kill a man, there this Bauble muſt fail ('tis well he was ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt) otherwiſe, Have among you blind hapers at all adventures, let Death muſter up his whole Army of Diſeaſes, and appear in the Field his forces ſhall be all routed and himſelf taken Priſoner; and he compelled (though unwillingly) to an honourabled truee.

Sold by Mr. <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Chapman</hi> in <hi>Exchange Alley,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Joſeph Leigh</hi> in <hi>Baſing-Hall-ſtreet,</hi> in which at the importunity of at the leaſt forty and more perſons of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, I gave an account of its vertue, value, and danger, having been for a long time by Letters ſolicited even to wearineſs, to give my opinion concerning them, which I did, with that unanſwerable Demonſtration of truth, appealing to Fact and Occular proof for Confirmation of my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; that I am ſure, it is out of the reach of him, or his Epiſtling thing of <hi>Quality,</hi> to Anſwer me, or Vindicate that moſt juſtly Cenſured and condemned Venome; I was alarm'd with threat of an Anſwer of ten Sheets of Paper, which after above a fortnights expectation, in vain I found at laſt dwindled to a pitiful ſorry Epiſtle, remarkable for nothing but falſe and ſcandalous aſperſions of my Perſon; falſe Latine, incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſenſe and impertinencies; but not a word in Vindication of the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Excellency of the Pills; a Work not to be done, till he can get Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence enough, and mannage it with Impudence, to deny matter of fact; and ſay the Powder is not to be reduced to <hi>Antimonial Regulus,</hi> which experience will convince in as little time as a man may eat a ſoft Egge: On which Demonſtration publickly to be made, I will take him up, if he dare, for as much money as he pleaſeth, from five to five hundred pounds, which ſhall be depoſited on each ſide, and let the tryal determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Philoſopher by the Fire</hi> be miſtaken; or <hi>Lionell Lockyer,</hi> have impoſed on, abuſed, and wronged the too credulous Nation, to his great gain, and their, at beſt, great hazard; yea, in many ſcores of inſtances that I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce inexcuſable, undeniable, and I am ſure unjuſtifiable detriment; fatal Tragedies having been the effects of thoſe Pills, on the ſcore of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Venom; but eſpecially by his indiſcreet commending them in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Caſes (eſpecially Fits of the Mother, indifferently and indefinitely) in which many of his own <hi>quondam</hi> profeſſion, that is <hi>Botchers,</hi> and ſome <hi>Coblers,</hi> poor Nurſes, and Midwives are ſo well skill'd, that they would receive the advice of a Vomit with trembling and horrour, eſpecially ſo Churliſh a Vomit as <hi>Antimonial,</hi> and its vitrifyed <hi>Crocus</hi> is equal to, if not worſe then any of that kind in Venome, and Vomitive virulency, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with violence to Convulſions oft times and Swoonings; ſometimes to dying out-right, a bad Remedy for <hi>Uterine</hi> fits, which can ſtop the breath and choak without any ſuch provocation. But I repute it beneath me to inlarge upon ſo pitiful a ſubject being born and bred Generouſly, Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from my Youth in Learning; and as for my Chemical Studies, this

is the one and Twentieth year therein, during which time few have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded me in pains, and unwearied Induſtry: Of my publick profeſſion of the Art of <hi>Medicine,</hi> this is the Seventeenth year, as an Encouragement in which art in particular, as of Learning in General, I have had as much A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademical honour, as by the Conferring of degrees, Students and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners in Phyſick are capable of: This I write not that I take delight to hear or relate it, God is my Judge, but to let the world know I am not ſo Contemptible as <hi>Lockyers</hi> pitiful Epiſtling thing would repreſent me; And particularly I am in good deed aſhamed of this Conteſt with him, who ſpent his Youth, and found his Old age before he attained greater honour then that of a <hi>Botcher,</hi> from whoſe Stall he leapt into the row of Phyſicians Licenſed, and ſo with the Gravity of an <hi>Owl</hi> promiſing the Brains of a <hi>Woodcock,</hi> he ſalutes his cuſtomers in his book in his Effigies or Pourtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, promiſing a Pill that will do as much (<hi>in re medicâ</hi>) as Nature will afford and allow off; It being the beſt preparation, and higheſt graduated and advanced; made of the beſt Minerals and Metals, the beſt of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubjects for yielding Medicines; Take this on his Experience and Word, and yet he hath a Medicine in preparation (of which he gives a hint) that will out-cure the other two Bars length and a half, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which the former will appear but a trifle, and ſo upon my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are both, if you dare take my word.</p>
            <p>How he grew to be a <hi>Chemiſt,</hi> and by whom, and when initiated, I can acquaint the world; <hi>Molton</hi> of <hi>Hogg-lane,</hi> being his firſt and beſt Tutor; of whom he learned his chief skill; which how far it reacheth, and how he hath made it his continual ſtudy ſince he firſt learned any thing, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the world, by diſguiſing common and trivial Preparations; and how fatal I have ſtill been to him, in diſcovering his abuſes, former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convincingly demonſtrating his <hi>Fucu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
