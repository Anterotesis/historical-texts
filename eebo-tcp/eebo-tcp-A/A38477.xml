            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

able to endure the hardſhip and duties of a VVar, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
experience hath otherwiſe proved it.</p>
            <p>VII. That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> gallantry and their courage unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the conditions of a warfare, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
requiſite to a Souldier, might make them upon
every diſcontent as apt to Mutiny and Reſiſt as
fight.</p>
            <p>VIII. The Parliament could not but be ſenſible withal of
their fellow ſubjects, that the apprehenſion of <hi>Engaging</hi>
would carry with it a ſad aſpect, all men unwilling to and
wary how they did <hi>Engage,</hi> that if they did <hi>Engage</hi> the
<hi>Engaging</hi> parties on either ſide when they ſee the face of
a VVar inevitably approaching, would and muſt for
their better ſtrength and union betake themſelves to
what Policy, Pacts and Leagues they could, <hi>Defenſive</hi>
and <hi>Offenſive,</hi> as to bind themſelves and friends by Vow
and Covenant, which being to conſiſt of ſeverall Heads
and Parts to be without much ſtudy or delay framed,
for fear of their Enemies gaining time on them could
not be ſo exactly and entirely deviſed, but might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of a doubtfull ſenſe, how to be underſtood, in part
or in the whole, ſo conſequently divide the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
within themſelves.</p>
            <p>IX. That when they ſhould have gained a power, they
muſt to maintain the ſame, Engage and Enforce all
men to acknowledge and conform unto their Power,
thence hazarding the repute and cenſure of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>Uſurpers</hi> over their fellow-ſubjects, of exerciſing
an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Tyrannicall</hi> power over the Peoples
eſtates and conſciences.</p>
            <p>X. They could not but withall know that which ſide ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36095:11"/>
ſhould prevail <hi>both ſides would be loſers, the King
and Kingdome vaſt ſufferers in the loſſe,</hi> as they in an
humble and dutifull<note n="x" place="margin">See it cited in the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Printed at <hi>Oxford</hi> 1643. pag. 13.</note> Meſſage, although contrariwiſe
interpreted, did in the ſadneſſe of their hearts foretel the
King.</p>
            <p>XI. That in this War the prevailing Power would be to
ſeeke (to carry an even &amp; well tempered hand) how to
deal with the vanquiſhed their own Countreymen,
and miſtaken fellow-ſubjects, for 'twas a Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which firſt made the rent between them,
ſcorn to acknowledge and retract their Errour wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and continued it; amongſt which doubtings if they
did inflict too heavy a puniſhment, either pecuniary
by Mulct, or corporall by Impriſonment, 'twould ſeem
unjuſt and harſh from the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> being of their
own Nation, and keep off the hopes of reconcilement
and re-union; if too gentle and remiſſe, 'twould leave
and allow the <hi>Conquered</hi> a power and means of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
their power again.</p>
            <p>XII. That if the Parliament ſhould in any degree pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
there would want no <hi>Policy</hi> or <hi>Stratagems</hi> to
diſturb and interrupt their further prevailing, all
<hi>Falſhoods, Impoſtures, Counterſeitings, Semblances of
friendſhip, of buſines &amp; Commerce</hi> to be practiſed againſt
them and their ſucceſſe, as by <hi>Forrein Tenders</hi> from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
<hi>Private Addreſſes</hi> here at home, all from the
ſame diſ-affected and troubled Fountain, moved and
ſtirred by the Enemy on purpoſe to divert their
thoughts and counſels, to retard and hinder their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
and ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p>XIII. That above all in the doubtful events of War as it
was likely to fall out betwixt <hi>Perſons offending</hi> on the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36095:11"/>
part <hi>hating to be reformed,</hi> and a <hi>Court of Parliament</hi> on

in a Commonwealth,</hi> Offendors would apply themſelves
for refuge to the King a ſupreme Power, whom if he
did protect,<note n="y" place="margin">Mr. <hi>John Heywood</hi> on the life of <hi>Hen</hi> the 4th.</note> (making thereby the Offendors faults

betwixt him and his People; and if the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould take ill his protecting them, there would
iſſue a Conteſt kindling and preparatory to a War,
thence if the King engaged, and the Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
or fought, they could not hope if they were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
to avoyd the Charge of <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> nor
think it an eaſie thing in the firſt beginning of their
ſtrength to prove Conquerours over a King ſeated a
long time in an ancient Monarchy, inveſted with
many advantages of power, and guarded with Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
Friends of all ſorts, Servants, and Favourites, all
of which had their retinue alſo and traine of Freinds
to aſsiſt in caſe of needing ſuch: Beſides, the King if
reſiſted and oppoſed, and thence a War fall out betwixt
him and his ſubjects, They could not hope ſoon, or ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
to overcome him, but the War muſt be of ſome
continuance, the ſeat thereof in the bowels and beſt
parts of the Kingdome, nor to be onely an inteſtine
War at home, but forreign Forces to be expected from
abroad, for that the King to maintain his cauſe would
endeavour to engage other Kings in his Quarrell to take
part with him upon this ſuggeſtion, That <hi>their Subjects
by the example of his may doe the like, how treaſonable and
dangerous a Preſident it is for Subiects to riſe in Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their King:</hi> when as unto them who have known
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36095:12"/>
the ſtate and government of other Kingdoms, the caſe
between other Kings and their Subjects is far different
from This both in the manner and frequency of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendings
(as the Charges and Remonſtrances of both
Houſes of Parliament publiſhed to the world have
declared) touching his actions and demeanour during
or neer the time of his whole reign as alſo, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and quality of the Government of this Kingdom
different by many Notes of diſtinction limited from

having their peculiar Laws, Conſtitutions,

Us and Them, betwixt the King of that Realm
commanding on his part whatſoever he pleaſeth, and
the Subjects obeying on theirs, in that it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid, howbeit with too acute and bold a cenſure,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36095:12"/>
that <hi>their King is Aſinorum Rex,</hi> the <hi>King of England
Hominum;</hi> for no other reaſon than that the People
of the one are ſubject and obedient to the Will and
Arbitrary Government of theirs, the People of
<hi>England</hi> pay a known and limited obedience by the
Lawes, which the King is alike ſworn to keep by his
practice in his own Perſon, and by his power to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it towards others, as the People to obey. The

Monarchies, having Power, and as
they think alſo Right to inforce and conform
all under them to ſlavery and vaſſallage.</p>
            <p>XIIII. That if the Parliament notwithſtanding theſe
attempts and practices againſt Their Power ſhould
prevail, They would and muſt to keep up Their Power,
lay Taxes and Payments on the People, who when the
War did ſeem or was neer an end, their complaint
would be, and that with repining and murmuring
[<hi>The War is ended, the Taxes and Payments yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued</hi>]
not conſidering that it is of as great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to keep as to gaine a Victory, nor ſenſible of
the quiet and ſafety which through the counſel and
vigilancy of the higher Powers they doe enjoy, and
other Countries infeſted with the like Civil Wars doe
want, when as the Parliament in caſe of Their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
were to weigh withall the doubts and dangers
attending Them, the care, jealouſie and fears which
no men but would avoid the troubles of, and ſuch as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36095:13"/>
They muſt be ſubject to untill the Conqueſt be
fully made, the cares againſt the ſurprizall of their
Enemy, the Jealouſie of friends proving falſe, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
off, the feares of loſing what They ſhould
gaine; all theſe being paſſive more ſerious and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than the hopes of the adverſe part, Feares more
deeply ſeizing and diſquieting the Conquerours ſpirits
eſpecially whileſt their Victory is accompanied with
ſtudy and thoughts of mercy towards the Conquered,
hopes in the vanquiſhed being more bold and active,
raiſing thoughts working ſtill how to recover what
they have loſt.</p>
            <p>XV. Again, They could not but conſider that in a
War with Them, the King Their Enemy would have
ſome of his Party fit and able to inveigh and declaim
againſt Them as being <hi>Rebels</hi> for contending with
him, wherefore in caſe of the Parliaments prevailing
untill a full Conqueſt made, They being ſubject to the
charge of Rebellion, Treaſon, and accuſed thereof, as
by ſeveral Edicts and Declarations publiſhed it hath
fallen out; and that the King with the help of his

               <hi>Chronicler</hi> hath in a continued tone named Them
<hi>the Rebells at Weſtminſter, Perjured,</hi> and nothing ſince
of pardon to aſſoil them from ſuch guilt to repeale
ſuch cenſure, could not but expect to be dealt with by
their Enemies thirſting after Revenge and Conqueſt
with Vices of as ſharp an edge to revenge and wound
as with <hi>Diſſembling, Treachery, Falſhood, Perjury,</hi>
whilſt the Parliament and their friends are in the ſtate
of Traytors, as the Kings party counteth Them, and
nothing done by him to clear Them from ſuch guilt,
tis held but juſt to recompence <hi>Treaſon</hi> with <hi>Treachery,

Forſwearing</hi> with <hi>Forſwearing,</hi> and all held honeſt

caſting and ſcattering the ſeeds of thoſe Vices even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Parliaments own Friends, to divide Them

as his means of recovering his loſs, may teach the
Winner as his means to keep what he hath got,</p>
            <p>XVI. That all diſaſters and evils, whether <hi>Sickneſſe,
Dearth,</hi> or what Calamities ſoever happening through
and by reaſon of ſuch numerous bodies as an Army
conſiſts of, what Enormities and Errors committed
or ſuffered either in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> an Army can by

            <p>Neither doth the peoples Regreet and Iealouſie

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:36095:14"/>
XVII. That in a Battle fought which ſide ſoever
ſhould prevaile, there would fall ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe
and divide the thoughts of either ſide (the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
and Conquerour) fears and doubtings in the
Conquered, whether they ſhould wholly yeeld unto
the Conquerour, or entertaine hopes of recovering
their loſſe againe, Pride and Inſolence in the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
dividing them likewiſe into variety of opinions
what courſe were fitteſt to be taken for their next at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement,
the diſtractions thereof have ſometimes
overthrown an Army, the Commander in chief being

               </note> victory ſhall be
gained, which naturally is proud, and by Pride comes
contentions, emulations, and variances in actions as
well as in opinions, the Conquerors ſtrength would
be thereby weakned, and thence in danger to be loſt.</p>
            <p>XVIII. That untill a compleat and full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
made, which could not be without much preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and heavy ſufferings on the vanquiſhed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
charge and payments layd on all, Enemies, Friends
(Enemies in being fined for their Delinquency,
Friends burthened by reaſon of their expence and
charge in the publique ſervice, of providing for the
common peace, for the maintenance of the Souldiery
and the like) an Army was to be continued and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to prevent Inſurrections here at home, inroads
and invaſions from abroad, that the Army was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of multitudes of Souldiers, thoſe multitudes would
have their ſeverall humours and opinions tending to
diviſions, conſequently to the deſtruction and ruine of
the whole, that without an extraordinary care to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36095:14"/>
pleaſe and ſatisfie them in their demands, there would
be mutinying, revolting, and inconſtancy in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Souldiery for want of judgment to diſcern for
what they fought.</p>
            <p>XIX. That if the Conquerours power ſhould at any
time abate, before a full and totall conqueſt made, he
would be put to it what courſe to take to encreaſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
Forcing and Impreſſing men to fight in a
cauſe ſo intricate, as unto ſome it ſeemed then, and
for a long time controverted as this hath been would
prove harſh and irkſom and would meet with reſiſtance
in a people made and born free, unleſſe their pay and
reward be anſwerable to, yea beyond their meritings.</p>
            <p>XX. That in the confuſion of a civill Warre, many
diſſentions and emulations upon true or miſapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
grounds, would fall out amongſt the orders and
ranks of men, to diſturb and overthrow the degrees
and dependencies each on other, according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and reſpective Qualities, all begetting and Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an univerſall diſtraction throughout the Kingdom,
not eaſily to be allayed in the heat and preparations to
a Warre, untill a deliberate and true examining the
miſunderſtandings which the fury of a War begun
would ſcarce endure, ſhould ſet it aright.</p>
            <p>XXI that if <hi>new</hi> and <hi>ſub-diviſions</hi> ſhould fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves in matters of judgement or opinion,
and thence contentions grow, the prevailing party
would be to ſeek how to deale with thoſe who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had been their friends, and heretofore aſſiſted
them in their greateſt wants, but ſince by reaſon of
new diſſentions have diſcontinued their affections acting
and labouring againſt their proceedings, whether
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36095:15"/>
in point of <hi>Gratitude</hi> they ſhould forbear to puniſh

a courſe as may beſt defend and ſecure them, and
themſelves alſo, from the common enemy.</p>
            <p>XXII. That a VVarre, the longer it continues, the
more cruel and deſperate it would grow; for that,
when as one party hath prevailed, and afterwards
the victory comes againe to be diſputed, the ſucceſſe
grow doubtfull, the prevailing power muſt, and with
good reaſon would, puniſh their adverſaries with a
ſeverer hand, the adverſaries out of foreſight thereof
would be the more ſedulous to prevent, the more active
to provide againſt ſuch ſeverity, ſo the contention
between them would become the more extream.</p>
            <p>XXIII. That, in the ſumme of all, a VVarre
although of a ſhort continuance would produce more
miſchiefs, more Sects and Schiſms, more diſorder
and diſturbances in a commonwealth, than a Peace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
againe, although of many years growth would
recover to its former temper.</p>
            <p>So many anxieties, ſo much evill incident to a civill
war, could not but keep wiſe men from harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the leaſt thoughts of Leavying one, yea to ſay
more on the Parliaments behalfe, and Their deſires
of peace, after the war was waged, and to prevent
the effuſion of more blood, Their offering and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Treaties, have manifeſted the ſame; that when in

               </gap> Battails fought, They were at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Tyde of ſucceſſe, They did not refuſe to

            <p>Theſe prudentiall Reaſons incident to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent

on a Warre, and to wiſe men obvious to
have been foreſeen could not but induce Them to
decline a Warre, yea deter Them from levying one,
Theſe might withall together with many more which
might be added hereunto, and put into the Ballance
with the Objections offered by the Kings Party [<hi>to</hi>
prove <hi>the Parliaments deſigne of overthrowing Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
which they could not doe but by a Warre,] will
outweigh the objections, and imprint in all men
who ſhall impartially look into the beginnings and
progreſs of this War an undoubted knowledge of the
Parliaments juſt actings, and theſe Reaſons of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
together with what hath paſt, might ſatisfie all
knowing and diſcerning men that if the Parliament
did intend to levy a War againſt the <hi>Kings evill
Councellours,</hi> the Kingdomes<note n="e" place="margin">King <hi>James</hi> his Speech in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, 1609</note> 
               <hi>Peſts and Vipers,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then They ſhould be borne down in Their juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
They did not intend to levy one againſt the
King who had as many friends to adhere unto as the
Parliament had enemies of many ſorts <hi>Offendors Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
and Obnoxious Perſons</hi> to confront and oppoſe
Them in their proceedings.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons being now ſet forth which might give
aſſured ſatisfaction to the Reader of the Parliaments
averſeneſſe from a War, of their deſires for Peace, it
is to be equally conſidered what may be brought in
by way of oppoſition againſt the applying them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Parliaments Intereſt than to the Kings.
If it be retorted as an Objection againſt the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
and Their Friends, that the Kings Party being
diſcerning and prudent men, might have made uſe of
the ſelf ſame Reaſons for their declining a Warre alſo
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36095:16"/>
being of the like prudence and foreſight: 'Tis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
they being inveſted with a ful and ample power
of the King and his adherents it might breed in them
a greater confidence of prevailing, and ſo were not
to be conceived to apprehend ſo many doubts and
fears in their undertaking a War as the Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
did.</p>
            <p>The chief matter of Objection which their enemies
give out whether publiſhed in Print or diſcourſed
onely is that <hi>three or four Gentlemen of quality of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
note</hi> as they render them <hi>before the beginning of
this Warre,</hi> choſen Members of the Houſe of
Commons together with a Baron of the Realme, a
Peer of the Houſe of Lords, dwelling in neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Counties each to other, and ſojourning before
the beginning of theſe troubles with a<note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thamptonſhire.</note> Gentleman a
Neighbour and Friend of theirs did there conſpire or
contrive the overthrow of Monarchy, to alter the
frame of Government with intent to act againſt the
Power and Perſon of the King: If neither of theſe
contrivances or intents appeared by any Diſcourſe,
Letters or other Acts of theirs, the Objectors ſhew
more ſpleen againſt thoſe Gentlemen then reaſon
in drawing a prejudicial concluſion againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from their owne feigned or miſ-conceived pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
            <p>Many the like objection may be deviſed and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
on purpoſe to traduce the Cauſe and Perſons
now oppoſed, but unleſs the Truth were proved, and
the Inference better framed, the Objections are of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
uſe.</p>
            <p>Did not the Parliament ſuffer more through Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36095:16"/>
within Themſelves, then by ſuch Arguments
and Inferences uſed by Their adverſaries, ſuch like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
could not hurt Them; for that They have now
got the upper hand They ſeem notwithſtanding to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
anew, with apparance and approach of danger to
both the divided Parties, the one leaning on a <hi>Covenant</hi>
which party ſuppoſeth it to enjoyn and hold a <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Form of Government, the other contending for a
kinde of <hi>Independency,</hi> as 'tis called, yet it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
that neither the <hi>Independent</hi> which ſeems a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative,
nor the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> a poſitive Forme, can as yet
during theſe Diſtractions be firmly and throughly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed,
ſuch Contentions may unhappily beget a
Quarrel to the overthrow of both upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering,
which will be held rather an event of the
Conquerours good ſucceſſe than from any ſelf-wilfull
humour, many on either ſide being ſober and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Gentlemen, which diviſion if it ſhould continue,
what may be gueſſed to be the event thereof, that for

was confirmed by a Statute Law in a Princes time who
at the beginning of her Reigne having redeemed the

ſuperſtition did by her piety and proweſſe keep her
people in peace and plenty, and therefore might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

jeſtingly declines the particular preſumptions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was charged of his privily countenancing

ſince the War began and limit it to whom of that his

Anſwer full of good Language, courage and

ſent the 23 of <hi>March</hi> 1644. unto both Houſes of
Parliament, he urges the Kings granting <hi>Graecious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi>
and proves it, <hi>in that he would Disband his

Anſwer recites not all the Kings Propoſalls, as that he
would have withall <hi>his Friends pardoned, the Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
taken from off their Eſtates</hi> and the like: either he
ſaw not the Kings whole Letter, being he recites but
one part only, or elſe he ſmiles in his ſleeve, thinking
by his reſerved Comment on the Letter to ſatisfie the
Committee there and the whole Kingdom beſides of
the Kings <hi>gracious inclination</hi> in that Letter, whereof
the Anſwerer reciteth but one part: the offering thoſe
promiſes which he mentions and commends the King
for, ſeems like Sathans contracting with our Saviour
in the Goſpell who tells him of large gifts <hi>to
give him all the Kingdomes of the Earth and the
glory of them,</hi> but on what condition? On ſuch as
Chriſt his purity and immunity from all ſin could
not accept <hi>viz. to fall downe and worſhip him.</hi>
The Kings Letter was eaſily to be underſtood by any
who ſhall read it collectively and all together but not
a part only, as of <hi>disbanding his Forces diſmantling his
Garriſons</hi> with other the like <hi>gracious proffers</hi> made;

Such manner of collective ſpeaking being conditionall
the one is not expected to be done on the one ſide, if
the reſt be not performed on the other. The Anſwerer's
mentioning ſo much of the Letter as may ſerve the turn
in reciting the Kings <hi>gracious promiſe</hi> leaves out on
what condition the promiſe is made: the condition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the promiſe fruſtrates the vertue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
for that which the anſwerer calls <hi>gracious</hi> in the
Kings Letter of <hi>Disbanding his forces,</hi> if nothing elſe
were to be expected are in every mans Iudgement as in
the Anſwerers <hi>gracious</hi> indeed, but that the Kings expects
to have <hi>his Friends pardoned the Sequeſtrations wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off from their Eſtates,</hi> were by the Parliaments
<hi>giving way to the revoking their own Iudgments to accuſe
themſelves of Injuſtice-doing</hi> to put them whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Offenders and their enemies into as good or
better condition then their own friends, the Anſwerer if
knowing the Kings whole letter and would contract it
into parts reciting only that which ſerves his turne, the
Committee being preſumed ſolid and underſtanding
Gentlemen would queſtionleſſe follow the dictates
of their own Iudgment without replying to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer.</p>

            <p>But to the Reaſons of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
deſerting their firſt judgment if ſo they have,
it may be rather judged to be a fencing and tryall of
wits in an argumentative way of diſcourſing only, then
any ſetled revolting from their firſt opinion. They
are well read in the good mans Character <hi>who will not be

not ſhrink untill</hi> &amp;c. which ſuiteth well with the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Really</hi> that is with all truth and faithfulneſſe, <hi>Conſtantly</hi>
which is without defection or falling off on triviall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentings

they have lately taken up againſt the reſiding part of

are none of the more eminent ſort of the Presbyterian

as in the beginning of this diſcourſe is ſet forth at large,
which the Parliament revolving and from their owne

an anſwer to the Objection as when they were promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
(<hi>viz.</hi>) when he ſaw his Prerogative Acts ſcanned
and enquired into ſwelling above the bounds of Law

queſtioned and even convicted of high and Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

then their fellow Subjects did or could have diſcovered
any darke or ſecret contrivances of ſuch intendment or
conſpiracy againſt his perſon deeming all others <hi>of a
narrow capacity ignorant and dull ſpirited,</hi> they were too
blame to conceale the plot, the manner and means of
effecting it; they had opportunity encouragement &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
enough, when his Party were with him at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
and then and there accuſed the Parliament ſitting
at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> of many Treaſonable deſigns, when (the
quality of the perſons accuſing being conſidered the
heinouſneſſe of the crimes wherewith the accuſed were
charged) the accuſers would leave no means unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to enhance their power, to make good their
accuſation for the Iuſtice ſake of their owne procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings:
which heavy charges deviſed by them could
not be the Iudgment of them all, to cenſure thoſe of
<hi>Weſtminſter Trayteurs</hi> &amp;c. It was moſt likely to be the
pride of ſome few thirſting to overcome, and taking
upon them to be dictatours of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Treaſon,</hi> who tis
probable forced and drew on the reſt (preſent then and
unawares of what ſad conſequences might follow) to
partake of their own Crimes and Errors: So then the
caſe is briefly thus, The Kings party have in their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations</hi>
charged the Parliament and their party of
<hi>High Treaſon,</hi> which party of the Kings to make good
their charge have ſtriven and done their utmoſt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their own to conſume the Parliaments ſtrength,
as by inviting both <hi>Forreigners</hi> and <hi>Natives</hi> to come to

               <hi>Neutrals</hi> too, under paine
of Allegiance forfeiting and breach of Oath: The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

cenſure of Allegiance forfeiting as much contended to
abate and take away the Kings parties ſtrength: ſo both
partie comming as it were to joyne iſſue in the tryall,
there is likely to be no further diſpute concerning it
then what the ſword ſhall determine.</p>
            <p>The next Treaſon wherewith the Parliament ſtands
charged is the making a new <hi>Great Seale</hi> counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Kings; the Reader may obſerve the juſtneſſe of

ſurreptitiouſly and vafrouſly taken away from the

is a cloſe &amp; cover act againſt the knowledg and
privity of a ſuperiour and lawfull power damnified by
ſuch counterfeiting; nor is every thing which is made
to the mould by which tis made a ſimply counterfeiting.
The quality of the offence is diſcerned in the manner

makes clear the matter, for Authority is
a Right and Lawfulneſſe to command Obedience,
ſuch as all Governours and Magiſtrates have more
or leſſe; But <hi>Power</hi> is a lawfull ability to force Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
where upon command it is denyed: One
may have a juſt and lawfull right to command that
wants a compulſive power to reſtrain from commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

have ſtrength to force (commonly called <hi>Power</hi>) that

               <p>Now there is no doubt but the King hath full pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

he cannot have it from himſele being but one

come his Authority: If any other ſhould give him
Authority which were not able to make it good

this, That howbeit there have been heretofore Civill

Soule be ſubject to the higher Powers,</hi> againe, <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto every Ordinance of Man for the Lords ſake:</hi> he
holds withall Gratitude to be a morall act of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and therefore thinks he may, nay, that he is
bound to promiſe fidelity to the Power from whence
be receives protection and enjoyes his ſafety: ſo it
ſeems ſtrange that amongſt men of the ſame uprightnes
and integrity many of either party being conſcientious
and honeſt men, one Party ſhould Take, another ſhould
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:36095:61"/>
Refuſe, and that the ſame guide of Conſcience
converſing about the ſelfe ſame object ſhould
tend and lead to contrary Ends and Actions:
Conſcience is a certain and uniform habit of the mind
of man, and therefore cannot erre in a contrary
Diameter; as at the firſt entrance into this Warre the
Kings Party did purſue their Cauſe as the Parliament
did theirs, each of them <hi>imploring Gods bleſſing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Iuſtneſſe and Righteouſneſſe thereof,</hi> which
could not be Iuſt on ether part when their undertakings
were contrary and croſſe each to other: It ſeems as
ſtrange that divers of either party acknowledging <hi>Gods
Goodneſſe</hi> truſting on his help ſhould from contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of judgments and Courſes each to other hope to
ſucceed in that they expect from him, <hi>a bleſſing upon
their endeavourings; he is the ſame, knowes no change,
nor faileth them who truſt in him: none ſo wicked but will
confeſſe that he is good and gracious,</hi> but for any to
expect that through his bleſſing through his goodneſſe
which they take not the proper courſe for in Prudence
Sobriety and obedience, or faile in that which he hath
ordeyned for conveying unto us what we look for at
his hands, it is rather a tempting then a truſting on him:
Conſcience elſe may be defined a perſwaſion of the
mind that ſuch or ſuch a thing is ſinne, that therefore
we are unwilling and afraid to commit the ſame for
feare of diſpleaſing a great and all-ſeeing Majeſty:
ſinne is a tranſgreſsion of the morall Law, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
is no breach of it, the act of Subſcribing or
not ſubſcribing may proceed from a diſpoſition or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
to do or refuſe what our will doth prompt
us unto: Neither is it ſo much Conſcience in the <hi>Taker</hi>
and <hi>Refuſer</hi> both, in reſpect of ſome tis to be feared a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:36095:61"/>
Paſsion or ſelfe wilfull humour governed and directed
by a carnall and ſelfeſeeking policy, neither is it a
matter of ſmall difficulty to diſtinguiſh betweene
the <hi>Naturall</hi> and <hi>Spirituall</hi> inclinations of a man:
It is not betweene <hi>Taking and not Taking the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement</hi>
amongſt us as betweene <hi>Eating and not
Eating</hi> meats amongſt the <hi>Chriſtian Romans,</hi> where
as to the <hi>Eating and not Eating</hi> the Apoſte judgeth
