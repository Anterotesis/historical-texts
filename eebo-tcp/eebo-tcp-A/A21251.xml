            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>He that weepes in meaſure, is like a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> he that weepes without meaſure, is like an <hi>Heathen;</hi> he that cannot weepe at all, is like a <hi>Stone;</hi> the very heauens are ſaid to weepe when men cannot: and if the godly weepe for the miſeries of this life, the wicked had neede to weepe for the miſeries to come, <hi>Iam. 5. 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To weepe for com-miſeration, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, to behold the miſeries of others, <hi>Iob 30. 25.</hi> is fraternall. To weepe of contrition, as <hi>Peter</hi> did for his owne ſins, is penitentiall. To weepe for loue, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did for the loſſe of <hi>Ionathan:</hi> or for griefe, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did for the death of her children, <hi>Math. 2. 18.</hi> or for ioy, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did at the ſight of <hi>Iacob, Gen. 46. 29.</hi> is naturall: but to weepe for oſtentation, as many Mourners did, <hi>Ier. 9. 18.</hi> or for diſſimulation, as <hi>Delilah</hi> did, <hi>Iudg. 16.</hi> or for deſperation, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, is hypocriticall.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Who can call to minde the life of our late ſoueraigne Lady Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that cannot lament the loſſe of ſo vertuous a Prince; the Vine bleedeth when the Branch is cut, the Turtle mourneth when ſhe is left alone: then what ſhall the body do when the head is gone? Such as did loue and honour her life, cannot but weepe and deplore her death; her Actions being ſo glorious when ſhe liued, her diſſolution muſt needes be grieuous when ſhe died.</p>
               <p>This moſt gratious Prince, which liued a <hi>Woman, Virgine,</hi> and <hi>Queene,</hi> to the wonder of all the world, which was a preſident of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and humilitie to all Princes, which was a patterne of lenitie and mercie to all her people, which was an Example of loue and patience to all her enemies: who can not but lament the loſſe of ſo loyall a Lady?</p>
               <p>This moſt royall and godly Prince, which ſucceeded the Crowne after Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did after <hi>Ahaz, 2. Kings 16.</hi> did not onely ſuppreſſe all ſuperſtition, but planted true religion in her Land, ſhewing her ſelfe more mercifull to malefactors to reclaime them to the word of God, then her predeceſſor did to the Martires that ſuffered for profeſſing the word: and therefore who cannot weepe for the loſſe of ſo religious a Lady?</p>
               <p>This moſt loyall and proſperous Prince, which poſſeſſed peace in <hi>England</hi> longer then <hi>Salomon</hi> did in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> had her Land fenced, not onely with walls of wood, as <hi>Gretia</hi> was againſt <hi>Zerxes, Herodotus</hi> in <hi>Polymnia,</hi> but with walls of braſſe and yron againſt all outward hoſtilitie, that it might be ſaid of Engliſhmen as of the Iſraelites, Euery one dwelt without feare vnder his owne vine, <hi>1. Kings 4. 25.</hi> For our Nation, vnder her Regiment, did floriſh in peace and plentie, as the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> flowed with milke and hony: and therefore who cannot weepe for the loſſe of ſo peaceable a Prince?</p>
               <p>When the people wept for Chriſt, he willed them to weepe for themſelues, <hi>Luke 23.</hi> And ſo, though we mourne for her Maieſtie, let vs weepe for our ſelues, conſidering the cauſe of alteration of Princes is imputed to the ſinnes of the ſubiects, according to that ſaying of <hi>Salomon,</hi> For the tranſgreſſion of the people there are many Princes, <hi>Prouerbs 28. 2.</hi> For what hath this precious word and peace effected in vs, ſeeing for the moſt part, we are content to be but Chriſtians in our tongues, though we be Atheiſts in our hearts, and farre worſe then Heathens in our liues?</p>

The departure of our godly Prince, though it be dolorous, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of her ſubiects, it ought to be ioyfull, in regard of her ſelfe: for ſhe hath left an earthly Kingdome, to poſſeſſe an heauenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and inſteede of a crowne of Gold ſhe hath put on a crowne of Glory: then what cauſe haue we to weepe, ſeeing ſhe is partaker of ſo vnſpeakeable Ioy, but rather, as the ſcripture teacheth vs, to reioyce with thoſe that reioyce, <hi>Rom. 12. 15.</hi> Let this ſuffice for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Though death hath ſeized of her Highneſſe Body, the Angels receiued her bleſſed Soule, and the world poſſeſſeth her glorious Name.</p>
               <p>If we reade the ſcriptures, we ſhall find, that amongſt all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> King <hi>Salomon</hi> raigned longeſt; and if you reade the <hi>Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> you ſhall find, that amongſt all the Kings and Princes of <hi>England,</hi> Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> raigned longeſt, ſauing one: yet was there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Prince more malitiouſly beſet with treaſon then her Maieſtie, nor any Prince more miraculouſly protected by Gods mercie: for he did, not onely protect her from vntimely dangers and deaths, but he did protract her dayes to the naturall courſe of declining, for ſhee died (as it was ſaid of <hi>Dauid, 1. Chro. 29. 28.)</hi> in a good age, ful of dayes, riches, and honor; for which we haue great cauſe to ioy.</p>
               <p>God for our ſinnes might iuſtly haue made the heauens braſſe ouer our heads, and the earth yron vnder our feete, and ſo haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained vs, as the people of <hi>Samaria</hi> did in extreamitie, not onely to eate dung, but their children, <hi>2. Kings 6.</hi> But ſee how mercifully God hath dealt by vs; he hath taken away our Prince in a time of plentie, to take away all occaſions of murmuring and mutinies amongſt vs, whereunto many are ſubiect, if they be but preſſed with alittle ſcarſitie: and though the Iſraelites liued diſorderly when their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours were gone, <hi>Iudg. 17. 6.</hi> yet, contrary to the expectation of many, our people haue liued very orderly and ciuilly ſince the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of our Queene, for which we haue great cauſe to ioy.</p>
               <p>To conclude, when God tooke away <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> from the Throne, and <hi>Iehoram</hi> came to the Crowne, there was great cauſe of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, becauſe he maintained Idolatry, <hi>2. Chro. 21.</hi> but when <hi>Dauid</hi> died and <hi>Salomon</hi> was inſtalled, there was continuance of ioy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he continued true religion as his fathers did before. And ſo, though God hath taken away Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> our late and louing Nurce-mother, yet the ſucceeding of that mightie and godly Prince, King <hi>Iames,</hi> our new and renowned Nurce-father, doeth giue vs exceeding cauſe of ioy: inſomuch, as the ſucceſſion of the latter, is a mittigation of ſorrow for the former. And as the Proclamation was read and receiued with great applauſe of the people, ſo his Coronation will be as ioyfull as euer was <hi>Salomons,</hi> when the earth rang with the ſound of the ſubiects, in ſigne of exultation and exceeding Ioy, <hi>1.
