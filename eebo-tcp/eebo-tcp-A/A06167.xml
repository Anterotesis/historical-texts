            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>There must be some contempt, before a plague succeede:</l>
               <l>I see great stormes at hand, and sigh to see them clime,</l>

               <l>

But let all reasons passe, of enuie, and disgrace,</l>
               <l>Sufficient to with-draw, a man from common weale,</l>
               <l>Not these alone procure, me leaue mine honored place</l>

               <l>The houre prefixt is come, the reuolution fixt,</l>
               <l>Wherein I must, and will, giue ouer gouernement;</l>
               <l>Taught by those happie men, whose weale, with sorrow mixt,</l>
               <l>Did make them leaue the world, which danger doth present:</l>
               <l>Oh when I sadlie thinke of olde <hi>Lucullus</hi> wit,</l>
               <l>Who hauing fortune thrall, and fame attending him,</l>
               <l>Thought good to leaue the world, when he had conquer'd it,</l>
               <l>And rather cease in time, then sincke, in hope to swim:</l>
               <l>I cannot chuse but smile, because by like aduise</l>
               <l>I flie from froward hate, (as olde <hi>Metellus</hi> did)</l>
               <l>And leaue vngratefull men, (as erst did <hi>Scipio</hi> wise)</l>
               <l>Deeming it happines in priuate to be hid:</l>
               <l>Had <hi>Cicero</hi> forethought, how sweet this course had beene</l>
               <l>When he had master'd fame, and conquer'd <hi>Cateline,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>His <hi>Tusculanum</hi> then, he had more often seene,</l>
               <l>And left vngratfull <hi>Rome,</hi> before he did decline:</l>
               <l>But hope of further fame, so fondlie him besotted,</l>
               <l>That wrastling with lewd chance, at last he caught the fall,</l>
               <l>And where he presuppos'd, true fame was him allotted,</l>
               <l>There lost he his desire, his fortunes, life, and all:</l>
               <l>His lessons make me wise; these warnings are mine armes;</l>
               <l>Wherewith I conquer chance, and false <hi>Rhamnusias</hi> traines,</l>
               <l>And now deere <hi>Philides,</hi> my mind no trouble farmes,</l>
               <l>And great content is bought, with little thrift of gaines.</l>

                  <hi>Bolton,</hi> amidst thy many other theames</l>
               <l>Thou dost desire me to discourse of dreames:</l>
               <l>Of which, what I could gather, reade, or find,</l>
               <l>I here set downe to satisfie thy mind:</l>
               <l>Dreames then (in sleep our spirits true retreate)</l>
               <l>Do chalenge their predominance, and seate:</l>
               <l>And in their natures, are but fantasies</l>
               <l>Made by the motion of Imageries,</l>
               <l>According to the sleepers habitude</l>
               <l>Of euery sensible similitude.</l>
               <l>So then, all dreames from diuers causes grow,</l>
               <l>And from th'interior, or th'exterior flow:</l>
               <l>Thinterior likewise hath a double right,</l>
               <l>The one is mentall, clayming by the spright,</l>
               <l>Where through in sleep (the fantasie and thought</l>
               <l>Encountring) strange and rare effects are wrought;</l>
               <l>Resembling those, which our affections kept,</l>
               <l>And thoughts did trauel on before we slept:</l>
               <l>The other cause takes his fruition,</l>
               <l>And being from the bodies disposition:</l>
               <l>For by th'interior habitude and state</l>

The bodie houlds, (corrupt or ordinate)</l>

               <l>Men seeme in snow, or water, to be drown'd:</l>
               <l>This makes the sage Phisitian to coniect</l>
               <l>By dreames, what griefes the inward parts infect;</l>
               <l>Th'exterior cause likewise, we double call,</l>
               <l>The first diuine, pure, and spirituall,</l>
               <l>Whereby things hidden, sacred, and concealed,</l>
               <l>By God, or by his Angels, ere reuealed:</l>
               <l>The next is meerely corporall; whereby</l>
               <l>Not onely mind and working fantasie</l>
               <l>Is chang'd, (according as the sleepers thought</l>

               <l>But by th'impression of celestiall raies,</l>
               <l>Which doe conforme affection to their waies.</l>
               <l>For so the staid star-gazers doe areede,</l>
               <l>That from celestiall bodies doe proceede,</l>
               <l>The cause, &amp; workings of our dreames in sleepe:</l>

               <l>To which mine answer is affirmatiue,</l>

               <l>The bellie therefore fatnes doth pertake,</l>

               <l>With fat, or flesh, or by such like enlarg'd,</l>
               <l>Because the heauenly workman did prouide,</l>
               <l>That such a part, which is the bodies guide,</l>
