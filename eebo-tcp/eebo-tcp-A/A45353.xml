            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

glorious aſcenſion into Heaven, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed and impowered his choſen Apoſtles to gather it from all parts and quarters of the world, and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to men the Word of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and the Doctrin of eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But the Devil who looked with an evil eye upon the Happineſs of our firſt Parents in Paradiſe, now envied mankind ſo great a Good, and ſtirred up Perſecutions againſt the Church of God round about. And when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the watchful Providence of God to give Peace to his Church by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Emperors and Kings to the Faith of Chriſt; the Devil then quickly ſhifted the Scene, and what he could not do by open violence he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to effect by Subtilty, and ſought to undermine the Church by Schiſms and Hereſies; and to deſtroy her by thoſe who pretended to be her own children. And this Courſe he holds on ſtill; and to come nearer to my preſent deſign, it is the envy and hate the Devil bears againſt true Chriſtianity, that hath ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up here in <hi>England</hi> an Heretical ſort of People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> to draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and ſeduce men from the true

Profeſſion of Religion into damnable and pernicious Errors. And becauſe they borrow ſomething of many Hereſies, which have been already in the world; it will not be amiſs, to ſhew briefly in ſome particulars, the Agreement that is between them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simon Magus</hi> of old gave out, <hi>That he was God the Father:</hi> And how much I pray did <hi>George Fox</hi> come behind that great Magician, when before the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Peace at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That he was equal with God?</hi> And <hi>James Nailor</hi> was no bad Proficient in that curſed School, when he ſaid, <hi>That he did witneſs, that he himſelf was as holy, juſt and good as God.</hi>

                  <hi>Menander</hi> affirmed himſelf to be ſent from the inviſible Regions to be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Mankind: And it is well known to the world, that <hi>James Nailor</hi> aſſerted himſelf to be Chriſt; For though his followers would mince the matter, as being aſhamed of his Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy; yet it is certain, that he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Hoſanna</hi> and Divine Worſhip in the Streets of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> and when he was charged with it, would return no other anſwer, but in the words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

Chriſt, <hi>Thou ſayeſt it,</hi> which is as much as, <hi>I aſſent to it or acknowledge it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Photinus</hi> denied the Trinity, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging only the Father, and excluding the Son and the Holy Ghoſt: And <hi>George Fox</hi> in the Book called, <hi>Saul's Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to Damaſcus,</hi> affirms that <hi>there is no diſtinction of Perſons in the Godhead.</hi> And if at any time they are forced to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it, they deliver it ſo ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly that it amounts to no more than what <hi>Arius</hi> himſelf affirmed as his Faith, who when he was commanded by the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to give a Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, delivered a Creed in words ours, but in ſenſe his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socinus</hi> denied the ſatisfaction of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and looked upon his Death and Paſſion only as an Example: And this is expreſly found in their Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Saul's Errand to Damaſcus:</hi> And <hi>James Nailor</hi> in his <hi>Love to the Loſt,</hi> p. 56. ſays, <hi>That the end for which Chriſt did ſuffer was to be a living Example to all Generations.</hi>

away the written Word of God, and, by a falſe application of the Spirit of God to themſelves, blind and delude the eaſie and credulous Vulgar with new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled Revelations? <hi>Thomas Holbrow</hi> a Quaker, to one that urged Scripture anſwered, <hi>What doſt thou tell me of the Scriptures, which are no better to me than an old Almanack. Fox</hi> and <hi>Hubber thorn</hi> in a Book called <hi>Truth's Defence,</hi> ſay, <hi>The Scriptures are no ſtanding Rule, and 'tis dangerous for ignorant people to read them.</hi> Are not theſe as impudent Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics when they ſhall ſlight and contemn the Diſpenſation of Jeſus upon Earth as an empty, inſignificant thing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Ordinances of Chriſt as childiſh, being themſelves under an higher Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, even the Rule of the Spirit? And no queſtion but they are under the Rule and Power of the Spirit, but 'tis of that Spirit which works in the children of Diſobedience, even the Prince of the Power of the Air.</p>
               <p>The fore-mention'd Heretics the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians,</hi> boaſted of themſelves as the only Spiritual Perſons, calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Perfect;</hi> and all others who in the humility of their ſouls profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

ſinners, and ſtudy to ſerve God with fear, <hi>Idiots and Ignorant People.</hi> And does not the ſame Spirit ſtill poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Quakers, who in an extravagant and proud humour affect the Title and Appellation of Perfection? When God knows the very boaſting of a thing they have ſo little of, argues their weakneſs and folly; and thoſe that talk and vaunt higheſt of this Perfection among them, are as perfect ſlaves to their Pride, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, Malice, Covetouſneſs and Luſt as any people in the World. One of theſe perfect Creatures was accuſed lately for getting his Maid with Child: And when <hi>R.

B.</hi> deſiſted in his Suit, but <hi>Lacock</hi> takes the woman and marries her. Was not this a perfect Cheat?</p>
               <p>The Quakers pretend very much to Inſpiration and Propheſie, and ſo did <hi>Marcus</hi> an old Heretic, who abuſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſilly women under colour of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on them the gift of Prophecying.</p>

               <p>It were eaſie to draw out the Parallel between them into a greater length, but that I think it would be too burdenſom and tedious to the Reader; foraſmuch as it is true of them what <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaid of the Heretics of his time, <note place="margin">

For his Perſon, he was corpulent, of a good Preſence and Sanguine Temper, ſhrewdly ſuſpected of Incontinence with ſome Women in his houſe; and 'tis no wonder if he ſhould not bathe his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godded Humanity (as he phraſes it of himſelf) in carnal and ſenſual Pleaſures; when the great <hi>Arcanum</hi> and Myſtery of his Doctrin was mere <hi>Sadduciſm,</hi> that is, <hi>A Denial of the Immortality of the Soul and a Life to come.</hi> From <hi>Amſterdam</hi> he ſails over into <hi>England,</hi> and here divulges and communicates his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Errors among a company of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and ſilly Women, who being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and not well principled in the Rudiments of Chriſtian Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an eaſie Prey to this white Wolf.

His Errors were

afterwards diſcovered and refuted by <hi>J. Knewſtub</hi> in a Book dedicated to <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> and printed at <hi>London</hi> by Order from the Queen, 1579. He pretended a Revelation from the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi> He affirmed, that Chriſt was neither God nor Man, but the State of his Doctrin, and that every one of his illuminate Elders was Chriſt. He held a Perfection without ſin; and that the whole Hiſtory of Jeſus Chriſt was not to be underſtood in a literal, but Myſtical and Allegorical ſenſe; that there is no Heaven, Hell nor Judgment but what is in this Life; and that all outward Ordinances in Religion are fooliſh and trifling things But I ſhall trouble my ſelf no further to collect the Heads of his Doctrin, ſince I ſhall take a general view of it by comparing the Doctrin of the Quakers and that of <hi>H.

full and perfect Reige of the Spirit, and as Children, when they arrive to a good competency of underſtanding and can read well, they throw away their Horn-books and Primers; ſo the Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogy of the Law and Goſpel are to be caſt aſide when men come to the Spirit, and this Diſpenſation of the Spirit is only in the Familiſts and in their doctrin.</p>
                  <p>And that this is the full ſenſe of the Quakers, appears from their own Books which they cunningly ſpread abroad to infect and poiſon the minds of weak and ignorant People.

And by this Spirit were the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures given forth, and the Holy men of God did ſpeak, propheſie, preach and pray</hi>

                     <hi>as they were moved; and for want of it the Letter did and doth kill. And for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appearance and pouring out of this Spirit, anſwerable unto the work and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that God had for them to do, they were to wait, as Chriſt commanded his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to do at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to receive the promiſe of the Father, for by this Spirit he that ſpeaks, ſpeaks as the Oracles of God. And therefore as it was the practice of the People of God in old time to wait for the moving and ſtirring of this Spirit, that they might ſpeak as it gave them utterance, in the evidence and demonſtration thereof; ſo do this People (called</hi> Quakers) <hi>now: and according to its moving in their hearts they miniſter, according to the ſignification of the Spirit, whereby they underſtand both what and when to ſpeak, and when to be ſilent.</hi>

                  <p>Although this ſweet ſugared ſpeech ſeem to be without deceit, yet there is gall and wormwood mixed with it, and in this new wine drawn from their own Cellar which lies deep in the loweſt Region of the Body, there is a great deal of poiſon. I ſhall therefore for the ſake of the Ignorant and ſuch as lie moſt obnoxious to their ſnares diſcover

the Cheat. To omit that this Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>[Several Miniſtrations before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Law by Moſes, and after by John Baptiſt and Chriſt and his Apoſtles]</hi> can ſcarce be made tolerable ſenſe, a fault pardonable enough in Mechanics and the Brethren of the Family; but a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inſtance of their Hypocriſie in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending immediate Inſpiration from the Spirit when they write nonſenſe. In the Diſcourſe, ſuch as it is, we learn theſe three things. (1.) That the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Chriſt was but a temporary Miniſtration to continue only till the Diſpenſation of the Spirit came, and therefore was diſliked and rejected of God, as wanting that full Meaſure, Rule and Power of the Spirit, which ſhould afterwards come into the world. Whereas the Miniſtration of Chriſt was indeed the Miniſtration of the Spirit, and therefore to ſet up a Diſpenſation of the Spirit above and in oppoſition to that of the Lord Jeſus in the Goſpel, is a blaſphemous derogation from the honour of our bleſſed Saviour, who ſaid to his Apoſtles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 14. <hi>He ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi> (2.) It follows from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42075:11"/>
paſſage, that the Spirit of God equally moves and acts in them as it did in the Apoſtles; therefore ſay they, <hi>As the Apoſtles were commanded to wait at Jeruſalem for the gracious illapſe and deſcent of the Holy Spirit; ſo they—and this ſignifies to them both what and when to ſpeak.</hi> But will any ſober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon believe, that a Quaking Speaker is divinely inſpired, when he commits endleſs Tautologies and vain repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and makes inconſequent illations, and eſpecially when the greateſt part of his Harangue ſhall be downright rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Shall the eternal Spirit of Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Reaſon be guilty of nonſenſe and abſurdities? (3.) It will follow, that what they ſpeak or write muſt be as good Canonical Scripture as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and we are as much bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>George Fox</hi> and <hi>James Nailor</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall inſtance but in one Quaker more to prove this firſt part of their Doctrin all one with Familiſm, and that ſhall be out of <hi>Humphrey Smith</hi>'s Diſcourſe of the three Miniſtrations of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Chriſt, and the Spirit. <hi>If</hi> Moſes (ſays he) <hi>with all his Prieſts, Tythes and</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42075:11"/>
                     <hi>long Prayers were now upon earth, and Chriſt in his own body with his Miracles, Baptiſm and Supper: then whether thoſe obey not</hi> Moſes <hi>who leave the Prieſts and come to Chriſt? And whether ſuch when they are come to Chriſt, ſhould always be looking and following after his Body, Miracles, Baptiſm or Supper without them, or tarry and wait to receive the Spirit within them. And then which of theſe now ſhould all people that profeſs Chriſt be led by in theſe days, either Moſes or the Perſon of Chriſt or the Spirit of Truth?</hi> There is no ſober Chriſtian that can read this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage without anger and diſdain, to ſee ſuch wicked wretches ſcoff and flearing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſult upon the ſacred Perſon of our Lord Jeſus, the whole Hiſtory of whoſe bleſſed Life and Death in the Letter of it they eſteem no better than one of <hi>Eſop</hi>'s Fables.</p>
                  <p>Again, the ſame Perſon hath this, <hi>Whether they be not compaſſed about with a cloud of error, who are upholding that Miniſtry of the Law which Chriſt is the end of; and likewiſe ſuch as are upholding and keeping up that which Chriſt ſaid, he had finiſhed? And being that</hi> Moſes, <hi>nor indeed his true Miniſters of the Law</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:42075:12"/>
                     <hi>are upon Earth, neither the body of Chriſt (which by the Profeſſors was murdered at</hi> Jeruſalem) <hi>viſibly to be ſeen upon earth, then what was it theſe have to follow who have not received the Spirit to be led by?</hi> Here again the Perſonal Offices of the bleſſed Jeſus are laid aſide.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond thing wherein the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliſts and Quakers are all one, is the Pretence of immediate Revelation. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid George</hi> and <hi>H. N.</hi> both pretended to receive their Doctrin from the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi> And <hi>Wil. Gibſon</hi> the Quaker, ſays, that the Goſpel which they preach, they have not received it from men, nor from books, nor from writings, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt in them, and then he goes on and denies the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of the old and new Teſtament to be the revealed Will of God.</p>
                  <p>There are two things eſpecially by which our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles demonſtrated the Truth of their Doctrin. (1.) The Miracles which they did: And theſe were ſo many infallible Seals and Marks of the Divinity of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42075:12"/>
Doctrin they communicated to the World, that God was the Author of it. For there can be no ſurer evidence of any thing being delivered from heaven, than when a man in favour of it is enabled to work Miracles. And this was the ſign which <hi>Moſes</hi> gave the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they asked how they ſhould know the word which God has not ſpoken, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 22. <hi>When a Prophet ſpeaks in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not nor come to paſs</hi> [that is, if he do no Miracle,] <hi>that is the thing which the Lord hath not ſpoken.—</hi>(2.) The Reaſonableneſs of the Doctrin which they delivered: To this S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to appeal, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. when he bids us be ready [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] always to give an anſwer to every man that asks us a reaſon of the hope that is in us.</p>
                  <p>Now let us examin a little the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of theſe Modern Familiſts or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers by theſe two foregoing Rules: they pretend Divine Revelation, and would fain have the World believe that they are divinely inſpired; but is any man ſo ſimple as to believe they are ſo, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they ſay it? ſo a man may believe all the Cheats and Impoſtors in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42075:13"/>
the World. What ſign do they ſhew or what evidence do they bring that they have received their Doctrin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God? If they can work any Miracles to confirm it, we will believe them, otherwiſe we have no more faith to believe them, than we have to believe, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> diſcourſed with the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> and received his <hi>Alchoran</hi> from him.</p>
                  <p>As for the Reaſonableneſs of their Doctrin, a very eaſie and mean capacity can find none in it; for how ſhould there be any Reaſon in what they teach, when they themſelves deny the uſe of Reaſon, and tell the world they are guided by a Light within them that is neither Reaſon nor Conſcience, which yet is but like a dark Lanthorn, that gives light to none but themſelves. And beſides, by this Principle it is impoſſible they ſhould ever convince any man that is not merely beſotted: As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Quakers Light ſays, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; but the Light within me tells me, it is not. And is not my Light as good as his? nay, much better, for I have the warrant of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42075:13"/>
he has only his own bare, blind Fanſie. And the man looked for better ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for his money, when the Quaker upon demand of it replied, <hi>That the Light within him told him, that he owed him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. III.</head>
                  <p>A third Manifeſtation of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts and Quakers being one and the ſame Sect, is their abrogating and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulling all outward Ordinances and Inſtitutions of Religion: That this was the Opinion of <hi>David George</hi> and <hi>H. N.</hi> cannot be unknown to any who have but heard or read any thing of them and their Perſuaſions. See <hi>H. N.</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the two Daughters of <hi>Warwick, Sect.</hi> 5. 7. 10. And that thoſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown Spiritualiſts the Quakers are of the ſame mind needs no proof, but is evident from their Practice in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and cenſuring men for uſing a Form of Prayer, for baptizing their children, for receiving the Sacrament, for paying their Tithes and honouring God with their Subſtance, ſetting apart a place and time for the Worſhip of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42075:14"/>
God, and indeed the whole Duty of Religion, if there be any thing outward and of the body in it.</p>
                  <p>But that God who has commanded us to worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth, has likewiſe commanded us to do it with our bodies as well as with our ſouls, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20.) and that bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſions by Geſtures and Poſtures are to be uſed in Chriſtian Religion, as kneeling, bowing and the like, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent from the examples of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. The Holy Jeſus himſelf lift up his ſacred Eyes to Heaven when he prayed for <hi>Lazarus;</hi> fell on his face when he prayed in his Agony. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> (as himſelf ſays, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 14.) bowed his knees to the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. He and St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the believers do the like more than once in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, confeſſing, praiſing and glorifying God by the Voice is as much an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and bodily Worſhip as any other, and therefore if God be not to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and worſhipped with bodily Worſhip, we muſt not pray nor praiſe him with the Voice.</p>
                  <p>Again, the very Frame of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42075:14"/>
an Religion preſuppoſes a bodily and outward Worſhip of God: for the Chriſtian Religion is given to men who conſiſt of Body as well as Soul, and not to Angels: and while we are in theſe bodies, it is impoſſible but that they muſt partake in our worſhip of God, yea when it is performed in the moſt ſpiritual manner of all.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if bodily Worſhip be not a part of Gods Service, there can be no ſuch thing as Idolatry when a man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips an Image. As for Example, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry is the giving of that Worſhip to a Creature which is incommunicably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God: now when a man bows his body to an Image as to an Object of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip, he gives that honour to the Image which is proper to God; therefore bowing the body is proper to God and a part of his Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>By this 'tis evident what a loſs theſe fooliſh people are at when they ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently cry down bodily Worſhip; they run hand over head and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Concluſions that muſt be drawn from ſuch dangerous Premiſſes; for their very praying together is bodily Worſhip.</p>

                     </note>With a like ſilly and weak confidence they exclame againſt Forms of Prayer,  whenas our Bleſſed Saviour taught his Diſciples a Form, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray ye:</hi> and leſt we ſhould think that this was only a Pattern, as if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Pray after this pattern</hi> or <hi>to this ſenſe;</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> Chap. 11. expreſſes it, <hi>When ye pray, ſay, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. that is, do it <hi>in haec verba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, that this is a Form of Prayer to be uſed in the very words it was delivered, appears ſufficiently from the Occaſion of it. <hi>It came to paſs</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Luke) as Jeſus was praying in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, that when he ceaſed, one of his Diſciples ſaid unto him, Lord teach us to pray as</hi> John <hi>alſo taught his Diſciples:</hi> where we are told firſt, that <hi>John</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a certain Form of Prayer to his Diſciples. Secondly, that the Diſciples of our Saviour beſought him, that he alſo would give them in like manner ſome Form of his making, that they might alſo pray with their Maſters Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples did with theirs.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42075:15"/>
For 'tis ridiculous to think that either <hi>John</hi>'s or our Saviours Diſciples knew not how to pray before, whenas they were Jews, and had their conſtant hours of Prayer, as the third, ſixth and nineth.</p>
                  <p>But beſides all this, I ſhall come nearer to themſelves, when an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic Quaker at a meeting ſtarts up and begins to pray, I would fain know whether the reſt of the Company join with him and go along with him in this Prayer or not: If they do not, to what purpoſe doth he pray in a vocal and audible manner? for he might as well have prayed to himſelf as to ſpeak aloud, if it be not for Edification that others may join with him. If they do join with him in that his Prayer, is it not then a Form to all them that hear it? and are not they bound to pray in thoſe very words and expreſſions which he utters? And though he be never ſo much over-flowed with the Spirit of the Lord (as they talk) yet the hearers are limited and confined to thoſe very expreſſions which the inſpired Prophet utters. With what confidence then can men ſeparate from the Church of God
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42075:16"/>
and run after theſe Whifflers, when the caſe is ſo plain againſt them? certainly any man that has but half an eye may ſee that they are mere cheats in theſe things. Let it not be ſaid then that men who can uſe their Reaſons well enough in other things, ſhould be ſo far to ſeek in theſe, as to be carried away againſt Scripture, Senſe and Reaſon and the Experience of every man, only by the prate and talk of an ignorant ſottiſh fellow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But here they object, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. ſaith, <hi>That the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itſelf maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> Therefore we ought not to put up our petitions to God in a Form of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here we may ſee thoſe very perſons who deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, yet, like the Devil, make uſe of them for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But if it ſhall be manifeſted that the Text alledged has not one ſyllable in it that proves an immediate Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God both for the words and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42075:16"/>
matter of Prayer, their boaſting will be found to be ridiculous and vain. May not this then be St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning who all along before was diſcourſing of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Croſs, that the Holy Spirit helps the weakneſs of our natures, lifting and bearing up as it were a part of the burden of the Croſs for us; for that we know not which part to chuſe or to pray for, either a perfect deliverance from it, or that we ſhould continue longer under the burden of it.

And being a Ceremony neither burdenſom nor offenſive, he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it to be uſed by every one that profeſſes Chriſtianity, whereby we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and are admitted into the Church of Chriſt, and we know of no other door ſet open under the Goſpel for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation but this. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> Chap. 16. 15, 16. <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature; he that believes and is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that believes not ſhall be damned.</hi> And Chriſt ſays
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42075:17"/>
expreſly <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 5. That <hi>Except a man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When therefore the Apoſtles had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Commiſſion from the Lord Jeſus, they baptized every one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to enter into Chriſts Religion; and leſt theſe Deceivers ſhould apply this Baptiſm to a myſtical ſenſe, the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> will furniſh us with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples enough, that the Apoſtles bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the outward element of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Acts 2. 41. <hi>They that gladly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his word were baptized.—</hi>Acts 10. 47. 48. <hi>Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> Mark here, they were baptized with the Spirit, and yet needed the Baptiſm of Water; <hi>And he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord.</hi> Acts 8. 36. <hi>See here is Water</hi> (ſays the Eunuch to <hi>Philip) what hinders me to be baptized?</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 38. <hi>They went down both into the water, both</hi> Philip <hi>and the Eunuch, and he baptized him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Cuſtom of admitting men into Chriſts Family and Religion by Baptiſm, hath been uſed ſucceſſively
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42075:18"/>
in the Church of Chriſt, in obedience to his Command and conformity to the Apoſtles Practice, without any Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their time to this very day. And becauſe 'tis likewiſe neceſſary, that every good Chriſtian be furniſhed with knowledge to defend his Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Adverſary, I ſhall anſwer what they bring to ſeduce the ignorant People from this Inſtitution of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt. And though what the Quaker urges for himſelf be nothing to this purpoſe, yet becauſe it will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the world, that there is nothing in Quakery but Folly and Cavils, I will produce it. He ſays therefore that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm is a Figure or Type, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now not to be uſed; and for this he brings 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>The like figure whereunto, even Baptiſm, alſo doth now ſave us.—</hi>Which place does very much confirm the uſe and practice of Baptiſm; for the Apoſtle ſpeaking of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family being ſaved in the Ark from periſhing by Water, anſwerable to which, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> (ſays he) <hi>now ſaves us;</hi> not only the external ſign or waſhing with water, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience, the being baptized into the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42075:18"/>
Death of Chriſt, and riſing with him to newneſs of life. Now if the waſhing with water together with the anſwer of a good Conſcience ſave us, then it ought ſtill to be uſed. For if the Apoſtle had here denied the baptizing with water, there had been no Analogy or correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his ſpeech; but he expreſly ſays, that as <hi>Noah</hi> was ſaved by Water, ſo anſwerable to that are Chriſtians by Baptiſm. But theſe Heretics would fain ſeparate the ſign and the thing ſignified, which the Apoſtle does not.</p>

and caſt off a Duty to the practice o which not only Chriſt Jeſus the great Law-giver, but their own particular needs and neceſſities bind and oblige them.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 26. 27. we have Chriſts Inſtitution of this holy Sacrament, how that <hi>He took bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it to the Diſciples, and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my Body: Then he took the Cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of it.</hi> St. <hi>Mark</hi> Chap. 14. repeats the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame, and ſays, <hi>They all drank of it.</hi> But St. <hi>Luke</hi> Chap. 22. 19. and St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 24. add theſe words <hi>[Do this in remembrance of me;]</hi> the full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of which words is; Firſt, a Commiſſion given by our Lord Jeſus to his Apoſtles to continue this Ceremony (now uſed by him) as an holy Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or Sacrament in the Church for ever. Secondly, a Direction, that (for the manner of obſerving it) they ſhould do to other Chriſtians as he had now done to them, <hi>i. e.</hi> Take, bleſs, break this Bread; take and bleſs this Cup, and then diſtribute it to others; (ſettling this on them as a part of their Office, a branch of that Power left them by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42075:19"/>
him, and by them communicable to whom they ſhould think fit after them.) Thirdly, a ſpecifying the end to which this was deſigned, a commemoration of the Death of Chriſt, a repreſenting his Paſſion to God, and a coming before him in his Name, firſt, to offer our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of Supplications and Praiſes in the name of the crucified Jeſus (as of old both among Jews and Heathens, all their Sacrifices were rites in and by which they ſupplicated God.) And ſecondly, to commemorate that his daily continual Sacrifice or Interceſſion for us at the right hand of his Father now in heaven.</p>
                  <p>It is not my purpoſe to make here a Diſcourſe of the Sacrament, but to ſhew that Chriſt by his Inſtitution of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it to continue in his Church, till his coming again to Judgment, and that this Office of Adminiſtring it was by our Lord Jeſus beſtowed and ſettled upon his Apoſtles, and that they (plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Church which ſhould continue after their Death) ſhould appoint and ordain Succeſſors to themſelves to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and officiate in that Church, and particularly to adminiſter this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the People, by way of Office,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42075:20"/>
to do as here Chriſt did. And this not in a Myſtical and Allegorical, but Literal Senſe; ſo that though it be true, that he that eateth not Chriſts Fleſh, and drinketh not his Bloud has no Life in him, yet is this to be done by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the outward Bread and Wine, and by our communicating of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts Inſtitution, we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his Body and Bloud in a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner and all other benefits of his Death and Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>So that theſe Apoſtates and Heretical Perſons by their Allegories and Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal meanings would bereave the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World of the choiceſt Myſtery of Religion, in which we are confirmed and aſſured of the Pardon of our Sins, and by Gods free remiſſion the burdned and diſtreſſed Soul is refreſhed; and we receive further ſupplies and increaſe of Grace and the Spirit of God, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to do that which he will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly in Chriſt accept at our hands, <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſerve him in holineſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Righteouſneſs; and to impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er us (if we be not wanting to our ſelves and to our own beſt hopes and Intereſts) to continue and perſevere
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42075:20"/>
thus to our lives end. And now let all men conſider ſeriouſly how heinous a thing it is Schiſmatically to ſeparate from the Church; and how groſly they are cheated and abuſed by theſe deceitful Quakers, and impoſed upon againſt the plain Senſe and Current of the Holy Scripture; and how they hope to look that Jeſus with comfort in the Face, at the dreadful Day of Judgment, whoſe ſacred Inſtitutions they now vilifie and contemn. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Eat this bread, and drink this wine in remembrance of me;</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that <hi>as oft as we ſhall eat this bread, and drink this cup, we do one to another annuntiate or proclaim the death of the Lord, till he come again to judge us.</hi> But theſe Fanatic Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts would perſuade us, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is Heatheniſh and Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now judge whom we are to follow in this matter, whether Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or theſe deceitful Whifflers. For Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did corporally eat and drink the material Bread and Wine, and left command to his Church, that it ſhould ſo be done; and that this Order was

               <p>BEcauſe the Church of God hath ever ſet apart ſome Times, Things and Perſons in a more immediate rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God and his Service; and that theſe ſeducing Familiſts perſuade the People, that all theſe are equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with others, and ſo no difference to be put between one day and another, one thing and another, or one perſon and another, though in the neareſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God and his Service; but that the Chriſtian Sabbath is no more than another day, the Church no more than a Stable or Barn, nor a Miniſter or Euangelical Prieſt than another man; as appears by their following many
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42075:21"/>
times their uſual Imployments and Trades on a <hi>Sunday;</hi> their deſpight and ſcorn caſt upon the material Edifices or Churches wherein Divine Service is celebrated, calling them Steeple-houſes in deriſion, and the reviling Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters by the names of Baals Prieſts, Hirelings, Serpents, and whatever their black and impure Hearts and Mouths can think and utter: I ſhall therefore for the ſake of thoſe ignorant People who are not yet drawn away, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with their Sorceries and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, ſhew plainly and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Reaſonableneſs of theſe things.</p>
               <p>When God created Man, he wrote this Truth on his heart, that he was a Creature, and therefore acknowledging Gods Sovereignty and Dominion over all the Works of his hands; he muſt likewiſe confeſs, that God has a Right and Propriety in every thing from his Sovereign Majeſty and Dominion which can never be alienated from him, or he ever diſpoſſeſſed of. Since then God by Royal Bounty has not only given Man his Being, but likewiſe draws out this Exiſtence, which is the Time and Duration of it, and enriched him
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42075:22"/>
with various Gifts and Benefits, ſuch as the free Uſe and Enjoyment of all earthly Creatures, he is obliged and bound to pay ſome Service, Duty and Fealty to this great Lord of the World, and muſt return him back ſomething of all that he hath given him.</p>
               <p>But leſt this ſhould be left to the frail and mutable will of Man, who being poſſeſſed of theſe Benefits might forget the Lord, therefore God has expreſly declared how and in what ſort he ſhall hold and enjoy all theſe Bleſſings, that is, So that God the great Lord have a Rent or Portion reſerved out of them to himſelf, that thereby Man might ſtill acknowledge Gods Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty and his own Dependency upon him.</p>
               <p>Now the Benefits God has conferred upon Man, they are 1. The Time or Duration of his Life. 2. The Place of his Habitation. 3. The Means of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteining his bodily Life upon Earth. Out of all theſe God muſt have his Honorary Part: That is, ſince God has given us our Beings, and draws them out in length and continues our
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42075:22"/>
Life to us, we owe in Juſtice ſome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this time to God: So likewiſe ſince God has given Man ſo wide a place for his dwelling as the whole Earth, he muſt allot ſome place, ſome part of this great ſpace for God. And laſtly ſince all Creatures are given Man for his own Uſe and Benefit, 'tis fit that God likewiſe have his Rent out of what we poſſeſs and enjoy.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of the <hi>Time</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God.</note>In the fourth Commandment, God  deſigned the ſeventh day for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Worſhip. For the Worſhip of Almighty God being once ſetled in all the Parts and Duties of it, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows, that ſome time ſhould be ſet apart for the more ſpecial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it. <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 8.</note>And this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment  being Moral, as all the reſt of the Decalogue are (a Symbol of which was their being written by the finger of God in Tables of Stone, to denote their eternal Permanency and Morality) we are as much bound to the Obſervation of it, as to its main Importance, as to the ſixth or ſeventh. I ſay, we are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42075:23"/>
bound to the Obſervation of it, as to the Equity and Morality of it. And from this we conclude</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is reaſonable there ſhould be a time ſet apart for Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: For we being commanded to worſhip, honour and ſerve God, it is impoſſible to do it but within the Comprehenſion of ſome time or other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. One day in ſeven is time little enough to be allotted for the more ſpecial Service of God. Had God commanded every day of our Lives to be wholly devoted to him, it had been but Reaſon and Equity; and ſince that out of regard to our Weakneſs, and that condition of Mortality wherein he has placed us, he requires but one day in a week to be more eſpecially ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for his Service, it were moſt irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional not to give him that. Beſides, our merciful Lord has a regard in this Commandment even to the Beaſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as a part of his Creation, which ſurely are not to be worſe uſed now under the Goſpel than under the Law, but have as much reaſon to be reſted on the Sabbath day now as they had then.</p>

                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:42075:23"/>
3. Since that this is reaſonable, what fitter day can we pitch upon, than the firſt day of the week, on which our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus aroſe from the dead? For if the Jews, together with the Commemoration of the Creation of the World, wherein God having perfected all his works, reſted on the ſeventh day, did likewiſe keep holy that day with reſpect to their deliverance from the Tyranny of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> How much greater reaſon have we to ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the Chriſtian Sabbath (with them indeed to celebrate the Goodneſs, Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power of God in making of all things,) in remembring the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reſurrection of the Son of God, wherein he roſe as a triumphant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour from his bed of Darkneſs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had diſ-mantled the Priſons of Hell and the Grave, and wrought a mighty Salvation for Mankind?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That as God did then, ſo (Chriſt having tranſmitted his Power to them) the Apoſtles and ſucceeding Church of God now may very reaſonably diſpoſe of us in matters of this nature, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all its Members into ſome uniform way, at ſuch ſet times of the Worſhip
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42075:24"/>
of God: And that they have done ſo, appears both by ſome mentions of the Lords day in the Holy Scriptures, and by the conſtant ſuffrage of the Fathers of the Church ſince that time; which is a ſufficient Obligation on all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to a due, conſtant and diligent Obſervation of the Chriſtian Sabbath. <hi>Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And leſt any man ſhall ſay, that this Command was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> and ſo at an end, and therefore that Chriſtians are not bound by it: Let him take this for an Anſwer and conſider it well, and then he will ſee there is no weight in the Objection, and ſo will not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when by impertinent cavilling Fellows 'tis urged upon him: I ſay therefore, firſt, That every one of the ten Commandments is moral, and for that very reaſon binds all Chriſtians ſtill, and therefore the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (though theſe rebellious Quakers diſown their Mother,) hath made them a part of her Liturgy, and all good people teach them to their Children in their Catechiſms, as knowing that all Chriſtians are to give obedience to them under the Goſpel. Secondly, our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42075:24"/>
Saviour ſays, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17. that he came not to diſſolve the Law and the Prophets, but to fulfil. <hi>Think not</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that I am come to diſſolve the Law and the Prophets</hi> [that is to take away the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of that Rule of the Duty of Man to God and his Neighbour, given firſt by <hi>Moſes</hi> and afterwards repeated and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the Prophets,] <hi>but to fulfil them,</hi> that is, to ſupply, accompliſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thoſe Rules and Doctrins of juſt and unjuſt conteined in them, by a more ample Interpretation and other Improvement befitting the ſtate of the Goſpel. And if (as theſe Familiſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade their unwary Proſelytes) to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil were to put an end to a thing; the ſenſe muſt be thus, that Chriſt came not to deſtroy, that is, to put an end to the Law, but to put an end to it. But who can imagine without Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, our bleſſed Saviour would be guilty of ſuch an abſurd ſpeech?</p>
                  <p>Now if it ſhall be asked, why then Chriſt did not improve the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment touching the keeping holy of the Sabbath? it is anſwered, That this was already ſtrictly obſerved among the Jews, even unto Superſtition; and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42075:25"/>
therefore there needed rather a Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than an Addition to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. For whereas the Jews on that day would not ſo much as kindle a Fire, or dreſs the Meat they ſhould eat, or carry any Burden, or take a Journey; and hence accuſe our Saviour for healing on the Sabbath, and his Diſciples for plucking the ears of Corn, Jeſus tells them, that <hi>The Sabbath was made for Man, and not Man for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:</hi> intimating, that Works of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and Mercy may lawfully be done on the Sabbath, though not the Works of a mans ordinary Trade and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>

and worſhip the ſupreme Deity. Among the Jews God had his Temple whither all the Tribes went up to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: And in Prophane Hiſtories we read of Temples dedicated to the Uſe and Service of ſome Supreme Deity. From whence it appears that the very Law of Nature commands to fix and ſet apart a place for the Service of God. And God will have this of us too, that as he hath reſerved a portion of the Time of our Life for the celebration of his Honour, ſo hath he alſo reſerved a Portion out of the Place of our Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Therefore in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45. God commands the children of Iſrael, and in them all the Nations of the World, that when they come to inhabit the Land he gives them, they muſt divide it into three Parts, one for the People, another for the King, but the firſt for God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But and if it ſhall be ſaid, that this was a Command under the Levitical Law, and ſo not obligatory to us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who live not under that Law. It muſt be remembred, that though God commanded a Houſe and Place for his Service to be built and ſet apart;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42075:26"/>
yet all Mankind were tied to the ſame Duty by a Law more Antient than that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> even by the very Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which lays a perpetual and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Injunction upon all men, that God have his Place of Worſhip and, as it were, Reſidence among them; that they might live in a continual Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon him, and remember that that they receive the very Places of their Abode and Habitation from his Gift and Benevolence. And it was ſome hundreds of years before the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was given, that <hi>Jacob</hi> when he was poor and had not wherewithal to build God an Houſe, yet conſecrated a Portion of Ground by erecting a Stone and pouring oil on the head thereof, calling the Place <hi>Bethel,</hi> that is, The Houſe of God, and vowed to build it, when God ſhould bleſs and make him able to do it. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 22.</p>
                  <p>So that the very ſecret inſtinct and working of Nature leads men to the Practice of this Duty, and hence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it was that the Jews (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commanded of God) had two ſorts of Places for Religious Duties beſides their Tabernacle or Temple: the one
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42075:26"/>
called <hi>Proſeuchae,</hi> Oratories, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Synagogues. The Oratory or Place of Prayer was a Plot of Ground encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with a Wall or ſome other like Mound or Incloſure, and open above, and the uſe was properly for Prayer, and this ſtood without the City. But the Synagogue was a covered Edifice, as our Houſes and Churches are, where the Law and the Prophets were read and expounded, and the People inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Divine Matters, according to that, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 21. <hi>Moſes of old time hath in every City them that preach him being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day;</hi> and this ſtood within the City.</p>
                  <p>The Oratory or Place of Prayer is ſometimes mentioned in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 12. where it is ſaid, that our Saviour <hi>went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>From what has been ſaid it follows, that to ſet apart a Place for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Almighty God is the common Voice and Dictate of Reaſon and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, inaſmuch as the Jews had ſet Places in and about every City and Town, where the Word of God was preached, and to which they aſſembled to pray unto him; which Places God never commanded them to erect and build, and yet both theſe ſorts of Places were ſanctified with Chriſts own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in them. And what they did, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations equally thought themſelves obliged to do, as I have above inſtanced in the Heathens, yea the very Turcs have their Moſchs or Places to pray in and to worſhip God.

That it is ſo called and uſed in the Holy Scripture. 2. That there were ſuch Places in the Apoſtles times.</p>
                  <p>That the word Church <hi>[Eccleſia]</hi> is uſed for the Material Building, as well as to ſignifie the People or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let any man that doubts conſult 1 Cor. 11. 22. <hi>Have ye not houſes to eat and drink in? or deſpiſe ye the Church of God?</hi>

                  <p>That by <hi>Church</hi> here is not meant the Aſſembly or Congregation but the <hi>Place,</hi> appears (1.) By comparing the 18. and 20. verſes before-going, <note place="margin">

                     <hi>When ye come together in the Church;</hi> and the Apoſtle in the 20. verſe, continuing his ſpeech upon the ſame ſubject, goes on thus, <hi>When ye come together therefore into one place:</hi> ſo that now it is determined what the word <hi>Church</hi> ſignifies, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Place</hi> whither they came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

(2.) The Apoſtle oppoſes the Church to their own Houſes, <hi>Have ye not Houſes to eat and drink in?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Your houſes are the places to eat and drink in, but the Church is the Place of Prayer, and to commit ſuch a Diſorder there is to vilifie and contemn the Place which is ſet apart for Gods Worſhip. And therefore in the laſt verſe, the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>If any man hunger, let him eat at home;</hi> by which 'tis plain, the Church and their Houſes were different Places. (3.) The very Etymology of our Engliſh word <hi>Church</hi> denotes the Place, for that comes from the German word <hi>Burken,</hi> and that of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. ſpeaks thus, <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi>

                        </gap>.</note> i. e. of thoſe things  which in the Goſpel are conſecrated to God, and due for the meſſage of the glad tidings of ſalvation; and it is as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, As the Prieſts and Levites had their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance out of that which was offered and dedicated to God in the Law; ſo God had ordained that the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould be mainteined of that which is conſecrate to him in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. Very good, Now have not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings, Emperors, Princes and other Noble Perſons given and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to God, and ſeveral Chriſtian Councils pronounced an <hi>Anathema</hi> or Curſe to him that ſhould alienate them, Houſes, Lands and Tithes for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Miniſters of the Goſpel? ought they not then to live of them? and does not the Apoſtle ſay it?</p>
                  <p>Again in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Let him that is taught the Word, communicate unto him that teacheth, in</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:42075:31"/>
                     <hi>all good things.</hi> What can be plainer than this? God hath transferred his Right over to his Miniſters, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined all men to be liberal to them, and to give them a ſhare of all the good things they poſſeſs. The bad ones God asks not (though men are too ready to give him the blind, the halt and the lame,) but he requires a part for his Miniſters out of all the good things we enjoy.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain then, that there is a Maintenance due to thoſe that preach the Goſpel; and this none can deny, but ſuch as neither acknowledge Gods Dominion over them, nor the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Holy Scriptures. For, ſhew where and when God has releaſed and given back his right to a portion of all mens Eſtates to them again? Or can any man ſay, that he holds his Eſtate by ſuch a Tenure <hi>in Capite,</hi> as that God hath not a Rent due out of it? The Queſtion therefore is, What manner of Maintenance this muſt be? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſays in general, that it muſt be a part out of all good things, and to this all men are bound, by which it appears, that the Maintenance of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42075:32"/>
is not to be looked upon as a free Gift from the People or in nature of an Alms, but as a Rent which God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and claims out of all mens Eſtates, and which he has given to his Servants the Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>For the better Illuſtration of this, I ſhall add theſe two Conſiderations. 1. That the Maintenance of the Miniſters under the Goſpel ought to exceed that of the Prieſts and Levites under the Law. For the Diſpenſation of the Law was much inferior to that of the Goſpel, and if a tenth of all manner of increaſe was due to God under the Miniſtration of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Death; ſurely a more ample portion belongs to the moſt ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven and Earth under the Goſpel, which is the Miniſtration of Life and Immortality. For as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle reaſons, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11. <hi>If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great matter if we ſhall reap your carnal things?</hi> Intimating that there is no compariſon between them, and that the beſt carnal things can never bear any proportion to thoſe rich Treaſures that are communicated to men by the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of the Goſpel. And this was the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42075:32"/>
Practice of the Apoſtolic Church, they brought not the Tenth, but their whole Eſtates, and laid them down at the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles feet; and the reaſon is given by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (who converſed with them that had ſeen the Apoſtles,) they gave chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and largely, <hi>utpote majorem ſpem habentes,</hi> foraſmuch as the Promiſes and their Hopes were bigger under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel than under the Law. It remains then an undoubted Truth, that if the Prieſthood of Jeſus be more excellent than that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Miniſtry of the Goſpel a more honourable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Function, than that of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites under the Law, then ought the Maintenance of the Euangelical Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to be more large and honourable than theirs under the Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. commands that the Miniſters of the Goſpel be [<gap reason="foreign">

For if themſelves be fed at the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Benevolence, what aſſurance have they of a diſh of meat for their poor Brethren? The Heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42075:33"/>
are unſtable; now it rains and we have abundance, then cometh drought and all is in ſcarcity. The humour of Man is as variable; the People of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> that made a God of St. <hi>Paul</hi> on the one day, ſtoned him on the other, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. And in the fiery time itſelf, when Zeal was moſt inflamed, our Saviour as it ſeemeth found even then a cooling blaſt, when for want of ordinary ſupply, he was fain to fetch Twenty pence by a Miracle out of a Fiſhes mouth to ſerve his need withal. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 27.</p>
                  <p>Unleſs therefore the Zeal and Piety of men towards God did now burn as bright as in the Apoſtles time, when they thought nothing too much or too good for their Spiritual Fathers; it were the moſt wicked and unſeemly thing in the World, to put the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Jeſus either to labour like Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics with their hands for their bread, or to live upon the uncertain benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the People.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore when the great Love of the firſt Ages to Chriſt and his Miniſters by degrees cooled and was abated, and men grew to be lovers of themſelves more than lovers of God; it pleaſed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42075:33"/>
that All-wiſe Providence which always watches over the Church, ſo to inſpire the hearts of Chriſtian Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſecure his proviſions, that though men ſhould ſo far forget and deny God, from whom they receive all that they have, as to detain ſacrilegiouſly his right; yet they might be compelled by Laws and external Diſcipline to pay him this his Rent or Tribute, which they would not do of their own accord. For all the Tythes are the Lords, and the Miniſters claim them not as a duty of the people unto them, but as the Lords por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he gives to his Miniſters: and ſo the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Will a man rob God? yet ye have robbed me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Mark well, God does not ſay they had robbed his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, though he gave the Tythe to them, but they had robbed him. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſacrilegiouſly detains and keeps back his Tythe, robbeth God, and muſt expect to be curſed with a curſe.</p>
                  <p>Almighty God therefore reſerving a portion out of every mans Eſtate as his Rent or Tribute, to the end that every one may acknowledge his Sovereignty and Dominion over all that he poſſeſſes,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42075:34"/>
queſtionleſs the Civil Magiſtrate may and ought to make Laws whereby men may be forced to give God his due, when they ſhall grow ſo wicked and Atheiſtical as to rob him of it. And if it be lawful for a man to appeal to the ſecular Powers to ſecure his own Eſtate, it is much more lawful to uſe them to preſerve Gods Revenue. And if it were not ſome more miſchievous deſign theſe abominable wretches drive at, they may as well quarrel at the Laws that are made for the maintenance of the Poor, as at thoſe that are made to conſtrain them to pay their Tythes, ſince the Poor are likewiſe Chriſts charge as well as the Miniſters; and yet none but ſome cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Worlding would ſay that it were better they ſhould be left to the free be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of every one: if they were, it is doubtful whether a great many would not ſtarve. But would you know what deſign it is the Devil drives at by ſetting theſe people to cry out againſt the maintenance of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? It is briefly this, to bring men back from the true knowledge of Chriſt, and the liberty of the Goſpel, into their ancient bondage of Pagan Superſtition
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42075:34"/>
and Idolatry: and to compaſs this, he makes theſe wild people his Inſtruments. For he well knows, that it is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that lay open his plots, and warn men to take heed of falling into his ſnares and traps, and they daily incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage men in vertue, and inſtruct them in the knowledge of God: Now if he could take theſe enemies of his Kingdom away, he is then ſure the people will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh through ignorance, and become his own eaſie prey. And there is no better way to make ſure work with the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, than to incourage the flock to withdraw, and detain (though it be with the greateſt injury to God and their own ſouls) that portion and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance God has commanded to give him, and aſſigned over to his Miniſters. For <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> and how ſhould people believe except the Word of God be preached to them?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now take away, as briefly as I can, thoſe Objections which theſe bold Enthuſiaſts make againſt the preſent maintenance of the Miniſters. <note place="margin">Object.

But 'tis apparent that Tythes were no Types of any thing, nor did they ſhadow out any thing to come, that when that ſubſtance was come, they ſhould be taken away: and we may as well ſay that Prayer to God was taken away by the coming of Chriſt, as that the Revenue due to God was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: for we are as much bound to honour God with our ſubſtance, as with our lips.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Tythes were due to God, and paid before ever the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> began, and therefore cannot be ſaid to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and natural to that. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. it is ſaid, that whilſt <hi>Abraham</hi> dwelt at <hi>Hebron</hi> in the Plain of <hi>Mamre,</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42075:35"/>
                     <hi>Lot</hi> was carried away Priſoner by the four <hi>(Aſſyrian</hi> or <hi>Babylonian)</hi> Kings, with all that he had, and that <hi>Abraham,</hi> confederate with <hi>Mamre</hi> the <hi>Amorite,</hi> and his brethren <hi>Eſcol</hi> and <hi>Aner,</hi> armed his houſhold, three hundred and eighteen in all, and purſued them unto <hi>Dan,</hi> where he ſmote them in the night, and recovered <hi>Lot</hi> and the prey; and that as he returned, <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> King of <hi>Salem</hi> Prieſt of the moſt high God, met him, and gave him Bread and Wine, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and prayed and praiſed God for him, and that <hi>Abraham</hi> did thereupon give him the tythe of all. Now look in the ſeventh of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where this ſtory is repeated, you ſhall find that <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedek</hi> was a Type of Chriſt, and hence Chriſts Prieſthood is ſaid to be <hi>after the order of Melchiſedek:</hi> and it is ſaid that <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> in the Perſon of Chriſt, <hi>received Tythes of Abraham:</hi> therefore Tythes are now due to Chriſt, for as much as he is ſtill a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> and conſequently they are the right and portion of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                  <p>The next place of Scripture mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tythes before the Law, is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the payment of Tythes under the Goſpel were meerly Judaical, then ſhould the Miniſters of the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much more than a tenth part, which they do not; nor is there hardly a Pariſh in <hi>England</hi> where the Miniſter is paid the full tenth, without purloining and ſnipping by ſome ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious hand or other. Now though Chriſts Miniſters ought to have a more honourable maintenance than the Prieſts and Levites, yet ſuch is the iniquity of men, that they have not the tenth, whereas the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> paid out of their increaſe of Corn almoſt a fifth part for ſeveral Tythes and Duties commanded to them. And by what is ſaid, I have manifeſted the frivolouſneſs of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, That Tythes are Levitical; and if there were not ſome ſweetneſs which the covetous and ſacrilegious man reaped
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42075:36"/>

They ſay that Chriſt told his Diſciples, <hi>Freely they had received, therefore they ſhould freely give,</hi> Mat. 10. 8. and the Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> preached freely, working with their own hands that they might not be chargeable to any: therefore Miniſters ſhould not grieve the people by taking Tythes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That of our Saviour to his Diſciples, <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give,</hi> belongs not to the caſe of Tythes, as any one that reads the foregoing words may ſee: the gifts which Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles, were to <hi>heal the ſick, cleanſe the Lepers, raiſe the dead, and to caſt out Devils;</hi> which miraculous gifts (if it had been lawful) would have been a way to bring in gain enough: for what would not a Parent give to have his dead Child raiſed to life? or a man to have his dear and ſick Friend recovered, or diſpoſſeſſed of an evil ſpirit? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our bleſſed Lord, that he might declare his own Miſſion, that he was ſent for the good and common benefit of all
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42075:37"/>
men, charges his Diſciples, that they ſhould not think of appropriating theſe extraordinary gifts to their private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and advantage, but that as God, without any merit of theirs, had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly conferred theſe Powers upon them, ſo they ſhould as freely make uſe of them for the benefit of others: Neither do the Miniſters ſell the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt or the Goſpel for money, but preach it freely, being maintained at Gods charges: for there is a Rent or Portion of every mans Eſtate due to God, as an acknowledgment they hold all they have of him; and God being ſelf-ſufficient, and ſtanding in need of nothing of ours, has aſſigned and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this Portion of his for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his Miniſters: And as the Apoſtles were never charged with this ſin of ſelling their gifts, when they lived at the coſts of thoſe to whom they preached the Goſpel; ſo neither are the Miniſters now guilty of this ſin, when for their Preaching they are maintained at Gods charges, and live upon his Revenue; for the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaid, <hi>Dignus eſt operarius Mercede ſuâ.</hi>

                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:42075:37"/>
Then for the Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> preaching the Goſpel freely, it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes againſt than for them that object it: for this was no binding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to them, nor had Chriſt any where ſaid to them, Ye ſhall not take Tithes; but it was a Charter of Liberty and Power granted to them, they might both uſe and exact Maintenance if they would, or they might <hi>diſcedere de jure,</hi> leave it if they liſted. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>I only and Barnabas, have not we power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear working? Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? Who plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Vine-yard and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?</hi> As if he had ſaid, May the other Apoſtles eat and drink upon the expence of the Church, and keep their Wives alſo and Family by the Revenue dedicated to God by their Children whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in the Goſpel; and muſt I only and <hi>Barnabas</hi> not live but by the works of our hands? And that he may not in the leaſt reprove the Apoſtles who were mainteined by the Church, he ſhews that it was juſt and lawful for them to live as they did of the Churches Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42075:38"/>
by an Argument of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, ſeeing Soldiers live by their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Husband-men by the Fruit of their Labours, and Shepherds of that which comes of the Flock. It is plain then, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> might have lawfully demanded and received Tithes if he would, but he did not uſe that Power which he might have done, becauſe he would not have them think he was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom to them. But if a man will recede from his right and not take what he lawfully may, does that prove that he has no right nor due to it?</p>
                  <p>I have now made it manifeſt and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Tithes as they are now the ſtated and ſet Maintenance of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are due by Divine Right, which alſo the very Text and Body of the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> holds them to be as Judge <hi>Coke</hi> ſays in the ſecond Part of his Reports, <hi>Diſmes ſont choſes ſpirituels, &amp; due, de jure Divino.</hi> But ſuppoſe they were not, what advantage can a hungry Familiſt reap by it? ſurely very little. It is ſaid, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 10. 32. that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and the Jews made Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes for themſelves to give every year the third part of a Shekel for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42075:38"/>
of the Houſe of God. It was in their power before to give what they pleaſed, but they by a joint conſent fix upon the third part of a Shekel every year, and by this Ordinance and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute they were bound to make good their Grant. The Caſe is the ſame with us; our Forefathers made Laws among themſelves to give a portion of their Land, and the tenth part of their Subſtance, that is, theſe Parſonages for the Service of the Houſe of God. Now ſuppoſe that Tithes were not due before, yet now being voluntarily given, and this Grant confirmed by ſo many Acts of Parliament, they are now become due, and the Miniſters have as juſt a claim to them, as any man has to his own Free-hold Eſtate. I am ſure their title to Tithes is much more antient than any mans title to his Temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; and no one thing hath been oftner confirmed and ratified by the Acts and Statutes of this Kingdom, than the Poſſeſſions, Tithes and Rights of the Clergy.</p>

This being certain then, that no man ought to execute that ſacred Function of a Miniſter of the Goſpel but he that is called thereto, I ſhall now ſhew the manner of the Deſignation or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing of any man to execute this holy Employment; and that was by Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands, according as it was uſed by the Apoſtles, and commanded by them to their Succeſſors, and continued from thence in the Church unto this very day. Inſomuch that the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the Gentiles St. <hi>Paul,</hi> though he were honoured by a ſingular Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative and Call from Heaven by Chriſt himſelf, yet was to ſtay till he had the ordinary Call of the Church too, and was conſecrated by the Impoſition of hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2, 3. <hi>As they miniſtred to the Lord and faſted, the Holy Ghoſt ſaid, Separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>for the work whereunto I have <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>them Elders in every Church.</hi> Acts 14. 23.

And becauſe the Apoſtles could not live always, they tranſmitted their Power to others, and thoſe likewiſe to their Succeſſors: As the Scripture informs us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in</hi> Crete,<hi>—that thou ſhouldeſt ordain Elders [i. e.</hi> Paſtors and Miniſters of the Goſpel,] <hi>in every City as I had given thee order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things being ſo, it follows, Firſt, that the preſent Miniſters of the Goſpel in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore have right to Tithes, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they have both an inward and outward call: The inward call is the Teſtimony of their own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in that they believe themſelves fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in a good meaſure with gifts for the diſcharge of their Office, and deſire to employ them for the advantage of mens ſouls: And then they have the outward call of the Church, being

conſecrated and ſet apart for that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by Impoſition of hands and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

               <p>IT is well known, that the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul by the Doctrin of <hi>H.

               <p>Again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35 he ſpeaks thus, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, in this preſent day is this Scripture fulfilled, and according to the teſtimony of the Scripture, the raiſing up and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Lords dead cometh alſo to paſs preſently in this ſame day, through the appearing of the coming of Chriſt in his Majeſty.

               <p>And becauſe the Reader ſhall be ſully ſatisfied, and ſee that it is not without cauſe that I lay this charge upon this beaſtly Generation of Quakers, I ſhall produce ſome Teſtimonies from their Writings, wherein they deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after the ſame manner with <hi>H.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Forſter,</hi> in a certain Pamphlet which he calls <hi>A Guide to the Blind,</hi> (when the blind lead the blind the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is apparent) ſpeaks thus: <hi>Chriſts firſt appearance to the world was in fleſh, and the fleſhly eye ſaw him: but his ſecond appearance is in ſpirit, which</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:42075:43"/>
                  <hi>no fleſhly eye can behold and live: for as the Lightning cometh from one part of Heaven to lighten another part under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo ſhall the coming of the Son of man be; and bleſſed are all they who wait for his ſecond coming, to wit, without ſin unto ſalvation: for his ſecond coming is to put an end to ſin, to finiſh tranſgreſſion, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs. He that hath an ear to hear let him hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence it appears, that Chriſts ſecond coming is made only his ſpiritual coming into mens hearts, to make them without ſin, and to bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs; and that when he thus comes, no fleſhly eye can ſee him: all which make Chriſts coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be nothing but his appearing in the Generation of Quakers. But the Scripture is expreſs, that Chriſt ſhall at the end of the world deſcend from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as he went thither, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 11. that is, viſibly and bodily, for ſo he aſcended. And in <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 7. it is ſaid, <hi>Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo which pierced him.—</hi>Therefore his ſecond coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not his coming into mens hearts by his Spirit, but his coming with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42075:43"/>
of Angels to give ſentence upon all men, and this by a viſible deſcent from Heaven, to be ſeen by the wicked as well as the righteous.</p>
               <p>The ſame perſon in another place ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly denies the ſecond coming of our Lord and Saviour to Judgment in the plain and literal ſenſe: <hi>The Children of the Light</hi> (ſays he, that is, the Quakers) <hi>can tell you, that as Chriſts firſt appearance to the world was in the fleſh, and the fleſhly eye ſaw him, ſo his ſecond appearance is in ſpirit, and no fleſhly eye can behold him, he being a ſpirit.</hi> Is not this a denial of Chriſts coming to Judgment, beſides a manifeſt falſhood? For Chriſt is no more a Spirit now, than he was in the days of his fleſh, but ſits in his Body at the right hand of God; and in the ſame Body that now he hath in Heaven ſhall he come to Judgment, and be ſeen of all by their natural ſight as we behold one another.</p>
               <p>Now for the glorious Immortality and bleſſed Reſt that every holy Soul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects in the life to come, it is perfectly allegorized away, and made nothing but a certain condition and ſtate of mind in this life: So that Sadducee <hi>Forſter</hi> in the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42075:44"/>
Book before-named, <hi>pag.</hi> 45. declares, <hi>Our Captain</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is able to make War with the Enemy, and not only give us Victory, but alſo an entrance into the Holy of Holies within the Veil here.</hi> By which it appears, that if we enter into the Holy of Holies here, (that is, into Heaven in this life) then there is no Heaven nor happineſs to be expected in the life to come.</p>
               <p>But to make all ſure and compleat, the Quaker, a perfect Sadducee, <hi>George Fox,</hi> in his <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> affirms, That <hi>the Soul is a part of the Eſſence and Being of God.</hi> This was the very thing which cauſed ſuch an irreconcileable hatred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Phariſees and Sadducees in our Saviour Chriſts time. But the Fox was not ſo cunning here as he might have been, nor did he well weigh the monſtrous and wicked conſequences of this his Aſſertion: For if the Soul be a part of the Eſſence of God, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Eſſence and Being of God is diſcerpible, and may be ſhred and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into millions of pieces, which is a notorious Blaſphemy againſt the ſacred Majeſty and Perfection of God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:42075:44"/>
2. It will follow, That God muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and puniſh himſelf, becauſe every mans Soul after death returns (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this opinion) and is joined to, and loſt in the Eſſence of God; and there being nothing but God, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and puniſh any thing, it muſt be himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will follow, that a part of God muſt be ſinful: for every mans Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen into ſin, and yet is a part of Gods Eſſence, it follows of neceſſity that a part of God muſt be ſinful. A prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Blaſphemy!</p>
               <p>I forbear any further Citations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the thing it ſelf is ſo obvious to every man that underſtands but the drift and purpoſe of Familiſm, wherein the chiefeſt Articles of a Chriſtians Faith are made but a Fable, whoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Moral, is the myſtical meaning which they put upon it. And are not theſe brave Guides (think you) of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, when they fruſtrate and make void the greateſt Arguments that Chriſt Jeſus has thought fit to excite and ſtir men up to holineſs withal? that is, the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Judgment to come, and a bleſſed Immortality in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:42075:45"/>
I grant that there is to be a Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from ſin, and all men are to be conformable to the Reſurrection of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus by their riſing to a new and holy life, and placing their affections upon heavenly and divine Objects, according as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>If ye then be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things that are above.</hi> But beſides this, there is likewiſe a Reſurrection of the natural body to be expected at the end of the world, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> charges thoſe Hereticks <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> with the denial of, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth have erred, ſaying that the Reſurrection is paſt already, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Faith of ſome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We therefore who are taught and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the written Word of God, and make that the Rule of our Faith and Manners, do own and profeſs a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our mortal bodies at the laſt day, when Jeſus Chriſt, the eternal Son of God, whom the Heavens ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain till in his own good time he ſhall think fit to put an end to the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, and the frame of this viſible World, ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42075:45"/>
and with the Trump of God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving called the dead from their graves, ſhall viſibly diſtinguiſh the righteous from the wicked, taking them up with him into Heaven, to join with his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Hoſt of Light, and ſentencing theſe into everlaſting fire; which heavy doom and vengeance ſhall preſently be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon them: for through the ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Operation of the Son of God, the Earth that now is, with all the works therein, ſhall be on fire, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, and all wicked men and devils ſhall be plunged into that Lake that burns for ever. Knowing therefore theſe terrours of the Lord, the Miniſters of the Goſpel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men by a ſpeedy repentance to turn unto God, to mortifie and ſubdue all their carnal luſts and corruptions, and to be regenerated and born again in the ſpirit of their minds, to caſt off the old man with his deeds, and to put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and holineſs, becauſe God will bring every man into judgment, and they muſt look to give an account after they are dead of all that they have done in the body, whether good or bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:42075:46"/>
But it is a very great argument to me that theſe Familiſtical Quakers believe none of theſe things in good earneſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find theſe arguments of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and future ſubſiſtence of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans Soul, of the ſatisfaction and death of Jeſus for the ſins of men upon the Croſs, and his interceſſion for us now in Heaven, of the Reſurrection of the Body, and the general day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the end of the World, either not at all made uſe of by them, or but lightly touched, and that in a myſtical and allegorical way. Whereas the holy Apoſtles did in their Sermons moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make uſe of ſome or more of theſe general heads, according to the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or needs and neceſſities of their Auditors. As for example, what can be more effectual for the begetting ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere holineſs in men, than to preſs upon them the conſideration of the Death and Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt? who out of meer good will gave his life a ranſom for the ſins of all the world, and that he is now an Advocate and Interceſſor in Heaven for thoſe that believe on his Name. And if they will not be moved by love and kindneſs, then to adviſe them to look to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42075:46"/>
their Intereſt and Advantage, foraſmuch as all men muſt give an Account to God at the general Day of Judgment for all their Actions, and ſhall receive either Reward or Puniſhment as they have been either good or evil; and therefore ſince their Souls are immortal and live after their Bodies are dead, it behooves them to provide for them in time and ſecure them a happy Entrance and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the other world. Would not this be much better than to make a long Harangue and nonſenſical Story of the Light within, and coming to the Witneſs within, which their Auditors underſtand nothing of in the way they propound it, and at laſt concluding like mad People with downright rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt every man that is not of their mind: which way of Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is very much different from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Apoſtles, and ſuch as the true Miniſters of God in <hi>England</hi> deſire never to be guilty of Learning.</p>
               <p>I have now made it more than a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Conjecture, that although theſe modern Familiſts, the Quakers, make a great noiſe about Chriſt within them and the Light of God; yet they are
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42075:47"/>
mere Sadduces, really denying the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and Life of the Soul after the death of the Body, and therefore ſo much more carefully to be avoided by every man that tenders his Happineſs in the other world; for though they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile the ſimple and unwary, yet the more prudent and underſtanding perſon who is able to dive into the bottom of their Errors and Hereſies will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly confeſs it to be a piece of beaſtly ſottiſhneſs, undermining the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Religion in the World.</p>

               <p>WE have ſeen their Oppoſition to the Church, and their Diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, let us now ſee if they are any better-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to the Civil Magiſtrate: And here you ſhall find them diſſembling their Opinions, and becauſe ſomething muſt be ſaid, as well to ſatisfie the minds
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42075:47"/>
of the common People whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, as to keep themſelves out of the reach and cognizance of the Laws of the Land; they pretend a kind of a partial ſubjection and obedience, which when ſtrictly examined is indeed no obedience at all. And herein they ſhew themſelves (as in all other things) excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Proficients in the School of <hi>H. N.</hi> who in his <hi>Exhortat.</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>That his Inſtructions of the upright, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Baptiſm, his crying voice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe may be confeſſed among the adulterous and ſinful Generation, and the falſe hearts of the Scripture-learned</hi> (for ſo he calls all that are not of his way,) <hi>but</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ye ſhall not talk of your ſecrets or utter your Myſteries openly or nakedly in the hearing of your young Children or Diſciples, but ſpare them not in the ears of your Elders which can underſtand the ſame, or are able to bear or away with the ſound thereof.</hi> In like manner, the Quakers conceal the Depth and Myſtery of their way from their new-made Proſelytes, and when they muſt ſay ſomething for ſatisfaction of the world, they ſpeak ſo doubtfully that their Expreſſions ſeem not to mean what they carry in them. But to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42075:48"/>
to ſome Particulars: They are dangerous Enemies to the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe their Principles tend to the exciting of Sedition and Rebellion. In the Book called, <hi>The Principles of Truth,</hi> p. 58. they ſay thus, <hi>Such Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates who be proud and lofty, who rule not for God, but for themſelves, who love the praiſe of men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſuch Magiſtrates they deny and teſtifie againſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This at the firſt looks very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and harmleſly, but let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beware how he ſwallows it, for there is Death in the Pot. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14. commands thus, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as ſupreme, or unto Governours as unto them that are ſent by him, for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well.</hi> By which we are taught Obedience and Submiſſion to all lawful Powers, as the Chriſtians to whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote, were to yield Obedience to the then <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor though a Heathen. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from God enjoins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher Powers,</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:42075:48"/>
                  <hi>for there is no Power but of God.</hi> But theſe men diſown and deny every Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate that is not according to their own Deſcription, which is all one as if the Chriſtians ſhould have rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> becauſe he was an Heathen. So that if a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſhall ſpeak or act any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Humor, he is ſo far from having Obedience, that he is denied and diſowned, and after this, (if it lie in their power) 'tis eaſie to imagin what will become of him. If a Magiſtrate be wicked, there is ſtill an Obedience due to him, not out of Conſtraint but out of Conſcience; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſaid the Tragedian <hi>Sophocles,</hi> but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> with an Apoſtolical Gravity, <hi>They are Gods Miniſters.</hi> But when men ſhall profeſs they will own none but ſuch as are holy and righteous in their eſteem, how is any Magiſtrate ſecure in his place, but when they ſhall get an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity into their hands, he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be accounted wicked, and fit for nothing, but to be diſowned and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt? Is not this now a Doctrin fitted to ſtir up Sedition and Rebellion? If the Parent be never ſo harſh or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42075:49"/>
there is ſtill a duty of Honour and Obedience to be uſed to him by the child: how much more to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates who are Gods Vicegerents and his Miniſters?</p>
               <p n="2">2. They exauctorate and diſclame the Civil Magiſtrates Right and Power in ordering the affairs of Religion, and confine his Authority only to matters of right and wrong in Temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. For ſuch they declare their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be in the fore named Book, p. 52. <hi>We believe that the outward Laws and Powers of the Earth are only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve mens Perſons and Eſtates, and not to preſerve men in Opinions: neither ought the Laws of the Nation to be laid upon mens Conſciences to bind them to, or from ſuch a Judgment or Practice in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot tell what can be ſpoken more plainly to take away from the King all Power and Authority in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion and the Service of God; and if any of his Majeſties Subjects will turn <hi>Turcs</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> it ſeems he has nothing to do to meddle with them, or puniſh them, or to make Laws to the contrary. A very fine Prerogative! that the King ſhall
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42075:49"/>
have power to ſecure mens Eſtates from ſpoil and rapin, but none to make Laws to ſecure their Souls from the Devil. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of old taught this, as <hi>Petilian</hi> in St. <hi>Auſtin, Quid vobis, &amp;c.</hi> What have you to do with worldly Emperors? And as that other in <hi>Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Quid Imperatori cum Eccleſia?</hi> What has the Emperor to do with the Church? And our <hi>Browniſts</hi> learned the ſame dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the <hi>Quaker</hi> he comes on with the third Part to the ſame Tune. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like they cannot think themſelves good Chriſtians except they be Rebels. But certainly his Majeſty as a Chriſtian Prince may and ought to have the ſame Power that the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> enjoyed, who were commended by the Spirit of God or condemned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as either they eſtabliſhed or neglected Religion and the Service of God among their People. So that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he muſt by his Authority preſerve and ſecure Religion as well as mens Eſtates. And, God be thanked, the Church and its Rights are the Care of his Majeſty, and his thoughts are daily for the promoting the Intereſt and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:42075:50"/>
3. P. 50. of the fore-named <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Truth,</hi> (miſ-called for Hereſie) they ſay, <hi>We believe that all Governours and Rulers ought to be accountable to the People, and to the next ſucceeding Rulers, for all their actions, which may be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into upon Occaſion, and that the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Rulers be ſubject under the Law and puniſhable by it, if they be tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, as well as the pooreſt of the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We know, that his Majeſty, the King, is the chiefeſt of the Rulers or chief Ruler in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and all other his Majeſties Dominions; but by this wicked Principle of Quakers, he is to be accountable to the People, and puniſhable by them. How near this borders upon Treaſon I leave the Civil Magiſtrate to judge. And if it were poſſible to make a more favourable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of their words, yet when they expreſs their Loyalty in ſuch doubtful terms, and their obedience grounded upon ſuch a tickliſh hold, it is eaſie to imagin what ſenſe they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves own; and conſidering withal how obſtinate and deaf they are to all good Principles and Inſtructions, and how numerous in many Counties of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42075:50"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> it muſt needs be an Act wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the ſupreme Power to ſuppreſs the growing Evil, that thoſe who are yet good Chriſtians and Subjects may not be ſeduced and corrupted by ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Doctrins.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of taking an Oath.</note>4. They affirm, that the taking of an Oath in any caſe whatever (though  before a lawful Magiſtrate) is unlawful and contrary to the Word of God. Which whether it were at firſt inſtilled into them by the Jeſuite to avoid the Oath of Supremacy, or taken up to give themſelves a greater Latitude and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the commiſſion of all that Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany and Wickedneſs which in many caſes the Impoſition of an Oath may and does frequently obſtruct and hinder, I know not: But this I know, that to deny the Lawfulneſs of taking an Oath is to throw away the greateſt Tie and Security that any King hath upon his public Officers, Miniſters and Subjects, and by which all mens Titles are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Civil Cauſes, and Juſtice executed in Cauſes Criminal, and indeed that by which all human Society is preſerved. And in all theſe caſes the taking of an Oath hath been and is ſtill uſed by all
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42075:51"/>
nations under the heavens. In the Old Teſtament it is commanded as a thing that is lawful and neceſſary in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Inſtances. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, and ſerve him and ſwear by his Name.</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear, the Lord liveth in Truth, in Judgment and in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And to ſuch as ſwear in ſuch a holy and religious manner, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes a bleſſing: <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 16. <hi>If they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to ſwear by my Name, then ſhall they be built in the midſt of my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the Quaking Generation ſhall object and ſay, that this was under the Law, therefore now not to be uſed; they may remember that the exacting and taking of an Oath was uſed long before the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> thus <hi>Abraham</hi> ſware to <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 21. and he requires an Oath of his Servant. <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. And <hi>Jacob</hi> requires an Oath of his Son <hi>Joſeph. Gen.</hi> 47. 31. But what, if a Duty be commanded under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is it therefore preſently to be thrown by and neglected? So a man may excuſe himſelf from all Religion, and be a worſe heathen than any that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42075:51"/>
ever yet lived in the World. And if this be good reaſoning, a man may upon the ſame ſcore deny to fear God under the Goſpel, as refuſe to ſwear by him, ſince ſerving him and ſwearing by him are both joyned together in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13.</p>
               <p>But the taking of an Oath either to be true to a Truſt committed, or for the deciſion of ſuch things where nothing but an Oath can be available, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought unlawful or ſinful amongſt Chriſtians, nor are they any where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to ſwear in ſuch a ſort in the New Teſtament, but the uſe of it is rather declared and confirmed. St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the Sovereignty of Jeſus Chriſt, and Subjection of all things to him, brings a place out of the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah, </hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſs to God:</hi> But in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 23. it is ſaid <hi>Every tongue ſhall ſwear,</hi> that is, ſhall confeſs and acknowledge Gods Omniſcience and his ſure avenging Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; which is the true meaning of, and is done in every lawful Oath. So that if the taking an Oath were a part of Gods worſhip under the Law, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:42075:52"/>
makes it to be ſo likewiſe under the Goſpel. Again <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>For men ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſwear by the greater, and an Oath for confirmation is to them an end of all ſtrife.</hi> For if an Oath had been ſimply unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the Apoſtle would never have made uſe of a ſinful Practice to aſſure us of the Immutability of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but that as an Oath is a final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of all buſineſſes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and puts things beyond all further doubts and exceptions, God, willing to manifeſt to us the Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his Promiſe, confirmed it by an Oath that there might be no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility left of doubting the Truth of it.</p>
               <p>There remains only an Objection to be diſpatcht wherewith the Heretics en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to fight againſt the Lawfulneſs of taking an Oath: And here two Texts are alleged: <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 34. <hi>But I ſay unto you, ſwear not at all.</hi> And <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>But above all things, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſwear not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That neither our Saviour nor his Apoſtle do condemn or diſallow the taking of an Oath adminiſtred by thoſe who are in Authority, is evident from
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42075:52"/>
                  <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>But let your communication,—</hi>whereby we are given to underſtand, that to ſwear in ordinary Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Diſcourſe or Converſation is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unlawful, and a diſparagement and diſhonour to the ſacred Majeſty of God to bring his Name in queſtion for every petty trifle. To which we may add, that Chriſt likewiſe condemns all ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Creatures, as the manner of the Jews was, to ſwear by Heaven, or Earth, by <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or by their Head, as the Heathens uſed to ſwear by the Fortunes of their Emperors: So he in <hi>Lucan,</hi> lib. 1.

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the Light within.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe firſt Principle that the Quakers ſo earneſtly inculcate and ſtrive to impreſs upon thoſe whom they ſeduce is, <hi>To come to the Light</hi> and <hi>to the witneſs</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:42075:53"/>
                  <hi>within;</hi> therefore it will be neceſſary to know and enquire what this <hi>Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> is, and what they mean by it, which muſt (if any where) be had out of their own Writings. For ſurely no man can think that they will ſo conſtantly call upon men to hearken to, and come to the <hi>Light within them,</hi> but they will at the ſame time tell them what it is, and how they ſhall know it. But ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily it falls out, that though this Light be within every one of them, yet they are not agreed among themſelves what it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Forſter</hi> in his <hi>Guide to the Blind,</hi> printed 1659. pag. 1. ſays, That <hi>God is the Light:</hi> but then, pag. 7. as if he had forgotten himſelf, he tells us, That <hi>Chriſt within is mans true Light to walk by.</hi> But yet doubting whether this will hold water or not, in pag. 9. he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, That <hi>the Spirit of Chriſt in man is the true Light and Guide, and this Light enlightens every man that comes into the World.</hi> And ſince this is ſo, a man would wonder who thoſe blind people are to whom this <hi>Blind Guide</hi> writes. But if <hi>James Naylor</hi> may be Judge, our friend <hi>Thomas</hi> is very much miſtaken, for in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42075:54"/>
his Book called, <hi>A Door opened to the impriſoned Seed,</hi> printed 1659. pag. 2, 3. he ſays, That <hi>the Light of the World is Gods Love to the World, and this Light is not given to any till they come out of the World. George Whitehead</hi> in the <hi>Seed of Iſraels Redemption,</hi> pag. 20. ſays, That <hi>the Light within is a meaſure of the Lords Life and Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, ſomething it muſt be, though this is certain, that if their Writings were given forth by immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Spirit of God, they would not have contradicted one another in their Teſtimony. But ſince they differ ſo much in their Opinions, I will take that which is moſt common amongſt them, that <hi>the Light within them is Chriſt:</hi> and here I ſhall help them out a little from their Maſter <hi>H. N.</hi> whoſe Scholars they have hitherto proved themſelves to be. <hi>H. N.</hi> therefore affirms thus: <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very godly man partaker of the Being of God and Spirit of Love, is God incarnate, and Chriſt incarnate, and Chriſt is not any one man the Son of the Virgin</hi> Mary: but every man is Godded with God, and Chriſted with Chriſt that comes to the Perfection of the Doctrine of <hi>H. N.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:42075:54"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt therefore within, is that ſtate in man which leaves the written Word or Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hearkens wholly to the Revelation of the Spirit; and this is the true Light, and the Regeneration or Birth, into this ſtate is Jeſus Chriſt, and he is no where elſe. H. N.</hi> firſt Exhort. Sect. 13.</p>
               <p>And that this is the very Doctrine of the Quakers, I prove, 1. Becauſe <hi>Tho. Forſter</hi> in the above-mentioned Treatiſe, p. 13. ſaith, That <hi>the Light which is Chriſt within is not natural, but it is ſufficient to Salvation.</hi> But we know that Reaſon and Conſcience are natural and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in themſelves to Salvation, by which it is plain they are excluded from having any thing to do in this Light. 2. <hi>G. Fox</hi> in his <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> pag. 207. 210. ſaith, That <hi>Chriſt is not diſtinct from the Saints, and he that eats the fleſh of Chriſt hath it within him.</hi> And in pag. 206. he declares, That <hi>if there be any Chriſt but he that was crucified within, he is a falſe Chriſt; and he that hath not this Chriſt that was crucified within, is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.</hi> To this purpoſe is that of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Stubbs</hi> a Quaker, who asking <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Whetherly,</hi> How ſhe expected to be ſaved? ſhe anſwered, <hi>By that Jeſus</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:42075:55"/>
                  <hi>who was born of a Virgin, and died at</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>Stubbs</hi> told her, <hi>that was the falſe Chriſt, and an Antichriſt.</hi> Whereby it is plain, that the Quakers lay aſide the Perſon of Chriſt as he is God and Man without us. What then can this Light within, which they ſay is Chriſt, be, but the coming into the way or diſpenſation of Quakers? which is ſuch a ſtate wherein a man leaves the written Word of God, and hearkens wholly to inward Revelations.</p>
               <p>And if any man ſhall object and ſay, That the Quakers ſpeak of Chriſt, and ſay that he was born of the Virgin, and crucified upon the Croſs, and therefore ſhall think that they acknowledge a Chriſt without them: Let him not be gulled and cheated into a good opinion of them for this, for <hi>H. N.</hi> ſays as much, and repeats the very words of moſt of the Articles of the Apoſtles Creed as the Chriſtian Church hath them, and yet turns them all into a myſtical and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical ſenſe. And I have above cited the Teſtimony of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> a prime Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, that <hi>if there be any Chriſt but he that was crucified within, he is a falſe Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>James Naylor</hi> wrote a Letter to one
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42075:55"/>
in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> that <hi>he that expected to be ſaved by him that died at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſhould be deceived.</hi> Therefore it is undoubted that they account the Conception, Birth, Life, Death, Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Lord Jeſus, as they were in the Hiſtory and Letter tranſacted in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> to be a mere Fable. So that this may ſerve as a Caution once for all to every one that reads their Writings, that when they meet with any thing about our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, or Heaven or Hell or the day of Judgment, they may know the Quakers underſtand it in a Myſtical ſenſe.</p>
               <p>There is no Rational Perſon but will at firſt ſight diſcover the horrid and wicked Blaſphemy of the Quakers in aſſerting their Light within, and that whoever follows them muſt deny the Lord Jeſus as a Perſon without them, beſide whom there is no name given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven whereby any man can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And is not this a very ſad Light that ſhall lead a man down to Hell and the Devil? that ſhall carry a man like an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> from his right way into Bogs and Ditches, and cauſe him at laſt to fall into the pit of everlaſting Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEcauſe the true Religion juſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles God to be its Author who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inſpired the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; therefore the Devil (who was always Gods Ape) countenances the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures and Deceits he ſets abroad by his ſervants, with the falſe Pretence of Divine Inſpiration. And herein theſe Seducers have a double advantage, firſt, by amuſing the common People and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, that what they ſpeak comes from God: And then, ſecondly, they hope to ſecure themſelves from any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and Examination of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin; for none are ſo bold as to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion any thing that truly comes from God.</p>
               <p>Now all ſuch People as theſe are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> that is, ſuch as falſly conceit themſelves to be inſpired; now to be inſpired is to be moved in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42075:56"/>
manner by the Power or Spirit of God to act, ſpeak or think what is holy, juſt, and true; from whence it follows, that Enthuſiaſm is a full but falſe Perſuaſion in a man that he is inſpired.</p>
               <p>And this falſe Perſuaſion in the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of being immediately inſpired, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the Melancholineſs of their Temper; for the Dejectedneſs of their Countenances and the alteration of their Viſages from that chearfulneſs that is in other men, ſhew them to be the moſt Melancholic Sect that ever came into the World.</p>
               <p>When therefore the Melancholic and Hypochondriacal Humor (which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily predominant in them) mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Blood and Spirits is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what refined in the Heart, and being warmed there, aſcends copiouſly into the Brain, it affects the mind with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of Imaginations, and intoxicates and makes the man as it were drunk for the preſent, till by ſtretching his Voice, and the Earneſtneſs and Motion of his body, it becomes in ſome degree evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. And all that time that his brains are turgid and full of this Humor, he

is wonderful eloquent and bewitchingly taking, and the poor ignorant People loook upon him as a Prophet ſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God, and admire the <hi>Overflowings of the Lord</hi> (as the Quakers phraſe it) in the man, who is ſo ſweet and affectionate, as if he would pour his whole Soul into the good womens Mouths. Whereas all this is only an effect of his Melancholic Temper, the <hi>Hypochondria</hi> riſing into the Region of the Brain: which is ordinary in Poets and Orators, according to that</p>

That it is their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Opinion I prove from their Writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Gibſon</hi> in a Pamphlet of his, ſays expreſly thus, <hi>The Goſpel which we preach, we have not received it from Man, nor from Books, nor from Writings, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt in us.</hi>

               <p>I ſhall add to theſe that famous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>Edward Burroughs,</hi> whom the Quakers ſtile, <hi>A worthy and true Prophet, and a Martyr for the Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> becauſe he died ſottiſhly in the Goal at <hi>London</hi> for his Rebellion againſt, and contempt of the known Laws of the Land, and over whom <hi>Francis Howgil</hi> laments with the lamentation of <hi>David</hi> over <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan, I am greatly diſtreſſed for thee, my brother</hi> Edward, &amp;c. then that of <hi>David</hi> over <hi>Abner, Died</hi> Ed.

               <p>Then follows, <hi>O Earth, Earth, Earth, hear the Word of the Lord.</hi> After this he lays about him on all ſides as if he were mad, and like a ravening Wolf worries every thing that comes in his way, threatning Plagues and Vengeance to all that are not Quakers. But I muſt not forget his Prophetical Epiſtle to the Pope, in the concluſion of which he tells him, That he has many more things to write to him, when he receives his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and if the Pope will give him ground to accuſe him, he will threſh him, and lay it to his charge by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Spirit of the Lord.</p>

(I ſuppoſe) how he liked of it. The man it ſeems had a ſtrong faith; and if he did believe that his Prophetical Letter ſhould come to the Popes hands, yet he was but a fool if he thought either that would convert him, or that the Pope would trouble himſelf to anſwer it.</p>
               <p>Having diſcovered from their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that they conceit themſelves to be divinely inſpired, which is a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Enthuſiaſtical Hereticks, I ſhall give two or three Examples of the folly and ridiculouſneſs of their Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> affirmed that ſome <hi>Quakers</hi> came to <hi>Kendale</hi> Church, and ſaid, <hi>They had a Commiſſion from the Lord to pull down the Steeple.</hi>

ſtript her ſelf of her Cloths by the River ſide, and went ſtark naked through the midſt of the Town; and being asked the reaſon of ſuch a ſhameful action, ſhe anſwered, That ſhe was commanded in that manner to go to the Houſe of the Mayor of the Town, and deliver a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from God unto him. But ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily it fell out, that the Mayor was gone a Journey, and came not home till ſome days after. Either ſuch Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe muſt be meer Cheats, or elſe it muſt be ſaid, that the Spirit of God took no notice whether the Mayor were at home or not.</p>

               <p>At <hi>Weighton,</hi> a little Town in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> a woman of this Goatiſh Herd

came naked from her own Bed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther womans husband, a companion of hers it ſeems of the ſame Sect, and bid him, <hi>Open his Bed to her, for the Father had ſent her to him:</hi> the man had at that time another man lying in Bed with him, who roſe to give place to this woman, and left this honeſt couple to lie together, according to the womans Revelation.</p>
               <p>By this taſte which I have here given, there is no rational perſon but will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Quakers to be a ſimple deluded people, taking their own Dreams and Melancholick Fancies for Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; and having caſt off the uſe of Reaſon and the written Word of God, are made obnoxious to all the Impoſtures and Injections of the Devil; and till they return to that Guide (I mean the voice of Reaſon and Scripture) which they have ſo wilfully abandoned and forſaken, muſt inevitably lie under everlaſting Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Deceits.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of the Quakers Perfection.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Quakers talk much of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Freedom from ſin in this life, and that they have already attained to it: but he that ſhall look into the Manners and Converſations of the moſt of them, ſhall find their Pretenſions to this high ſtate no greater than for a common Strumpet to brag of her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty: for the very boaſting of a thing they have ſo little of, does evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their enormous and monſtrous pride; and thoſe to whom they upbraid the want of it, do better deſerve the name than they, in that their lives are indeed not worſe, but their ſpirits in not pretending to it, far more humble and modeſt. For if the Phariſees Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>God I thank thee that I am not as other men are,</hi> ſtand upon record as a mark of the Phariſaical arrogance and pride, I know not how theſe high-flown Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts can juſtifie themſelves. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42075:60"/>
for them to arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a freedom from ſin, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on above all other men, when yet the vulgar and common people diſcern and take them tripping in daily faults and miſcarriages, even in their ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the world, it muſt needs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that either they do the moſt unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenge this ſtate of perfection, or elſe by an <hi>Antinomian</hi> liberty they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves to have a freedom to act any thing; and that after they are arrived to ſuch a way and diſpenſation, they are no longer obliged by any Law, nor can any thing they do be called a ſin. And as hitherto I have proved by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Inſtances, that the Familiſts and Quakers are one and the ſame in their Opinions and Judgments, ſo in this boaſt of their perfection and freedom from ſin, they both walk in the ſame Path. And in them is that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle St. <hi>Peter</hi> verified, 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 18, 9. <hi>When they ſpeak great ſwelling words of vanity,</hi> (ſuch as perfection and freedom from ſin) <hi>they allure through the luſts of the fleſh, through much wantonneſs, thoſe that were clean eſcaped from them who live in errour. While they promiſe them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:42075:61"/>
                  <hi>they themſelves are the ſervants of corruption: for of whom a man is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, of the ſame is he brought in bondage.</hi> I do not find that any of the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ever claimed ſuch a perfection in this life as not to ſin at all; and if there be any that are arrived to ſuch a vaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Holineſs, Almighty God keeps them hid as his own Jewels from the eyes of the world: And if we could ſpeak with any of them, I dare be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident they would own no ſuch thing in themſelves. And I muſt needs ſay from the Teſtimony of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that the Publican who prayed, <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner,</hi> was of a more Chriſtian-like temper than theſe proud cenſorious Quakers, who are indeed the Devils Slaves, when yet they pretend a freedom from ſin. It is evident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to me by what Spirit they are guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and from whence it is they aſſert themſelves to be free from ſin, namely, becauſe they are above all Law, and have no other Rule for their Actions but their own wills and fancies, and to them nothing is a ſin if they pleaſe not to call it ſo. This was of old the perfection of <hi>H. N.</hi> and his illuminate Elders; and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42075:61"/>
this was the Doctrin of <hi>Dell, Saltmarſh, Town,</hi> and all Antinomians and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and this is the ground likewiſe of the Quakers Pretence of Perfection. For can any man think, that takes the Word of God for his Rule, that bitter Envy and Malice, Railing and Cenſoriouſneſs, which make up perpetually the greateſt part of their Speakings to the People, ſhould be no ſins? And if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be ſins, it muſt needs follow, that theſe Illuminado's releaſe and ſet themſelves at liberty from the Rule of Gods Word, and that what are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſins by us and all Chriſtians, are not ſo to them; but that let them wallow and tumble in ſenſual Delights and Pleaſures, and indulge their earthly and Animal Faculties to the full, yet they have no Sin, but are as bright and pure as the Sun beams, and their Souls as white and clear as in the day of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. But let every man take heed of giving himſelf up to ſuch a dangerous Principle; for when once his <hi>Criterion</hi> and Diſcriminative Faculty ſhall be ſo vitiated, as to put bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter; and ſo dull, as not to diſtinguiſh between Darkneſs and Light;

he is then in the moſt deplorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and worſt ſtate that can befal a man in this Life. For he ſins and eſteems it not, but makes all Actions, good and evil alike; from which deſperate courſe God of his mercy reclame theſe deluded People.</p>

               <p>THere is ſcarce any Error but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to maintein and ſupport its Credit in the world by ſome Truth or other, and Error being ſo odious and ugly a thing in itſelf, it hath always been and is ſtill the Practice and Cuſtom of Heretics to diſguiſe and ſhape their Errors into the appearance and viſage of Truth; and therefore the firſt thing that they take care of in their making Proſelytes, and gaining upon the rude and unlearned Vulgar, is</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:42075:62"/>
1. To utter and promote ſome known Truths, that they may more eaſily inſtil their Poyſon.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour foretold, that there ſhould come ſome <hi>in ſheeps cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who inwardly were ravening wolves. Matth.</hi> 7. 15. Now what is that ſheeps clothing, but only the Innocence and Purity of the Chriſtian Doctrin; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending nothing leſs than the Peace and eternal Welfare of mens Souls, and that by the true Religion derived from Jeſus and his Apoſtles, whenas their main purpoſe is to enſnare and devour cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Souls, making a Prey of them by their dangerous Errors, and leading them out of the known way into by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths to their utter Ruine and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Thus becauſe the firſt Principle of Chriſtianity is Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and thoſe who are baptized and bred up in the Chriſtian Religion from their Infancy, being not eaſily ſeduced from a thing ſo known and common to them, therefore the Quaking Heretics will not at firſt plainly and bluntly tell them, that there is no ſuch Perſon in being as Jeſus Chriſt, but craftily inſinuate their dangerous Doctrin by ſaying, that it is
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42075:63"/>
true, they expect to be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, but that it is a Chriſt within them, a Chriſt which is not diſtinct from the Saints, and a Chriſt which dwells not in heaven, but in every one that believes as they do. So that they build their Errors upon ſomething, though but a bare Notion of the old Foundation of Truth. In like manner they deal with men concerning a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come and the Reſurrection of the Body, by perſuading their Proſelytes, that indeed there is a Day of Judgment, but that it is in this Life, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are judged by their Doctrin, and declaring and teſtifying againſt them, and that the Reſurrection is only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed within them by a Myſtical Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from ſin. And their Auditors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not aware of this, but believing that all that theſe Inſpirado's ſpeak is Goſpel, they are eaſily captivated from the Apoſtolical Faith once delivered to the Saints. Which way and manner of diſguiſing and transforming the Truths of the Goſpel from their genuine nature and ſimplicity is far more apt to take with the inconſiderate and unwary, than a plain and downright Denial of them.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:42075:63"/>
2. The ſecond way by which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics proceed in ſeducing People is to bring them out of love with the Paſtors and Miniſters who have the Care and Overfight of them.</p>
               <p>And in this buſineſs they uſe all the Arts and Invectives that Malice and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred can furniſh them withal, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vilifying their Perſons by odious Compariſons, aſſimilating and likening them to Baals Prieſts, to dumb Dogs, to Serpents, to Hirelings and what not; ſometimes declaming againſt them for their Maintenance, and perſuading the People that to pay Tithe is Popiſh and Antichriſtian, and that both he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and he that gives are yet in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and darkneſs and not come to the Light; that is, (as I ſuppoſe) thoſe who pay their due, are not yet come to the Art and Perfection of cheating and defrauding. At another time you ſhall have them taxing the Miniſters with Lies and falſe Doctrin, as if they taught not their Charge the true and ſaving Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, but poyſoned them with Errors and Deluſions. And in this Diſgrace and Defamation of their Adverſaries, they craftily inſinuate their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42075:64"/>
own Praiſe and Commendation, that they prate freely, and good reaſon they have to ſay it, for a Quakers ſpeech, though of three hours long was never worth a farthing: That they never ſtudy for what they ſpeak, and I dare believe them; for if they did, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be aſhamed to vent ſo much non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe and ridiculous ſtuff as they do: That they are induced to declare out of pure Love and Compaſſion, I ſuppoſe to themſelves and their hungry ſtomachs; for oft-times the leathern Speakers guts pick a quarrel with his throat for a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſupply. However it be, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are the ſubject of half an hours railing diſcourſe, and their Auditors are ſuch fools as to believe them in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſay.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third way which they make uſe of is, to decry all Human Learning and the uſe of Reaſon. And hence it comes to paſs, that the Atheiſt and Enthuſiaſt mutually confirm one another in their Errors; the Atheiſt laughs at the Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt for denying his Reaſon, and the Enthuſiaſt thinks the Atheiſt a fool for relying wholly upon it. But though it be common to all Enthuſiaſts to deſpiſe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42075:64"/>
Human Learning and reject the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Reaſon, yet the Quaker makes the loudeſt outery againſt it, and thinks it his intereſt to exclame againſt Learning, becauſe he himſelf hath none, being the moſt ignorant and ſottiſh Sect that hath yet appeared in the world. Whereas ſince the extraordinary gifts of Propheſie and Languages have ceaſed in the Church, Secular Learning hath been of the greateſt uſe and benefit to Religion of any thing in the World. And although theſe impudent Heretics be the open enemies of Learning and learned men, yet when they hope to make an advantage by it, they will be nibling at it; witneſs <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> who would prove the breach of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath lawful from a moth-eaten Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript cited by <hi>Beza</hi> in his <hi>Annotat.</hi> on <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. And the cauſe of this their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt Learning is apparent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, foraſmuch as by it men diſcover their Cheats and Impoſtures, and their Viſions and Inſpirations are found but Dreams and Melancholic Fanſies, and their Folly and Ignorance laid open to the World. But if we conſider it well, we ſhall find, that it is ſet in Scripture
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42075:65"/>
as the Commendation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he was learned in all the Wiſdom of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> cites <hi>Aratus, Menander</hi> and <hi>Epimenides</hi> three heathen Poets; but I need not ſtand long on this, for if learned men had not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Bible, I very much queſtion whether Quakers would have had any knowledge of it, notwithſtanding their pretended Revelations. And if God did once open the mouth of an Aſs to forbid the madneſs of the Prophet, yet the Quakers cannot prove from that one inſtance, that he now ſpeaks to the World by them. And therefore for men to throw aſide their Reaſon, and the Knowledge of Arts and Sciences, which are now the Supporters of Religion, is all one as if they ſhould put out their eyes, and call to the blind to lead them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their way is to deceive and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate themſelves firſt with the Women. And herein they imitate the Devil, who firſt tamper'd with the weaker Veſſel and ſeduced <hi>Eve;</hi> as well knowing that the Maſculine Temper of <hi>Adam</hi> would contemn and ſlight the Bait, till pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the fair hands of his Virgin Bride. And this is no new thing, for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42075:65"/>
many Heretics have diffuſed and ſpread their deſperate Errors by inſinuating them firſt into the Women; yea, ſo far had <hi>Mareus</hi> the <hi>Valentinian</hi> proceeded in this Art, that he not only vitiated the Souls, but abuſed the Bodies of many of that yielding Sex: And ſuch was the Temper of the Quakers great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>H. N.</hi> when he came over into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> drawing after him a great number of thoſe eaſie Captives, whom he quickly found kind and coming, when allured by the ſpecious Title of <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Love.</hi> And this has been a very great help in the Propagation of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery, by making the Woman firſt in the Tranſgreſſion, who by her continual Solicitation and Importunity (as <hi>Delilab</hi> did <hi>Samſon)</hi> wins the good man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray himſelf into the hands of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed Philiſtines.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT will now be queſtioned ſince Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm is ſo monſtrous and ſottiſh a Perſuaſion, as tends to the overthrow of all true Religion, by raſing the very Foundations of it, by denying the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt as God and Man now living in Heaven, and taking away the future Subſiſtence and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of Human Souls; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it ſhould take ſo much with the ordinary ſort of People, and gain ground upon ſo many of them.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this, I may ſuggeſt, that thoſe who are caught and drawn into this abominable Hereſie of Quakeriſm, are but the Refuſe of the World, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the meaneſt Quality and loweſt Parts and Education; and for ſuch as theſe to be enticed by Quakers is no ſtrange thing, they being indifferent to any Religion, and that they obſerve any
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42075:66"/>
at all, is more out of Cuſtom and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, than Choice and Underſtanding. Or I may ſay, that it is to be feared, 'tis a juſt Judgment of God for their former unfaithfulneſs not only to the Light of their own Conſciences but of the holy Word of God, that ſince <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 10, 11.</note>
                  <hi>they would not receive the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved, God ſhould ſend them ſtrong Deluſion, that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lie.</hi> And although this may give ſome Account of the diffuſion &amp; growth of Quakery, yet I ſhall mention ſome particular Advantages it hath over other Sects and Hereſies; and the Firſt is this,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that it pretends to a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Holineſs above all other, and to be raiſed above the reſt of the world lying in ſin. That all the Earth is in Bondage and Slavery, overſpred with Luſts and Sins; and therefore are in a dark and blind Condition, not knowing how or by what means they ſhall eſcape out of that lamentable and confuſed ſtate they are in: But the Quaker, he is mounted up ſo high, that it is broad day with him, when yet 'tis perfect night with all men beſide; he is in the Light, and this Light leads
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42075:67"/>
and guides him into all Truth, ſo that henceforth he ſins no more, but is pure and clean in his own eyes. Chriſt is within him, and he has atteined to a Perfection and Freedom from Sin, and whoever comes not to this ſtate, is not of God. Theſe are fine things and high Conceits, and the giddy Multitude that always affect Novelties, are very much pleaſed with ſo much holineſs as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and it works mightily upon their Fanſies, that if they be once Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, they ſhall be without ſin, and by the cunning management of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Holineſs, the People are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly catcht in their nets.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Quakery cracks and boaſts much of immediate Inſpirations, which every one in their meaſure are capable of. And this is a ſtrong and potent temptation to inveigle the multitude withal, to tell them, that when they are once Quakers, they ſhall be immediately acted and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Spirit of God, as the Prophets and Apoſtles of old were, and that what they now ſpeak and write is as good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scripture as the Bible; that they need no external teaching, being all taught by the inſpiration of God, which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42075:67"/>
is ſo pleaſing and eaſie a Doctrine, that it is very ſtrange if the vulgar (who would fain go to Heaven by the eaſieſt and leaſt troubleſom way) ſhould not be ſeduced by it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The luſcious and ſweet bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Language which they uſe, as if Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-Plumbs lay under their Tongues, when a deadly poiſon lodges in their Hearts: which being nothing but a canting in Scripture-phraſe and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and fitted to feminine fancies, yet has a very great influence upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, eſpecially when their minds are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and prejudicated with an opinion of their being inſpired. In theſe reſpects now it appears that Quakery hath a very great advantage above all other Hereſies, and hath ſtrong and powerful tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to allure unſtable and wavering minds from the knowledge of the truth. But their Impoſtures and Cheats being ſo plainly detected and diſcovered in this foregoing Treatiſe, if any man, knowing and warned of them, yet wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and preſumptuouſly ſhall fall into them, his deſtruction is of himſelf, and his ruine inexcuſable; he hath now no cloak for his ſin.</p>

            <div type="conclusion">
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:42075:68"/>
               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>I have now run through the chiefeſt of the Quakers Opinions, and plainly and evidently proved them in every thing to be exactly Familiſtical: I ſhall now for a Concluſion of this Treatiſe, only add this ſerious Admonition to thoſe who approve of, and are hankering after Quakery: And to this end I would have them conſider, that the Quakers do deny the Books of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be the Word of God, and ſay that they are no Rule of our Faith and Manners, which muſt needs be of the moſt dangerous conſequence to the ſouls of men: for men being reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in that Princely Prerogative Superiour to the Beaſts of the Field, muſt of neceſſity guide and determine their Actions by ſome Rule and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and if neither Reaſon nor Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be that Rule, they are liable to be impoſed upon by every Cheat, and led into any errour whatever, and ſo at laſt eternally deſtroyed: for by this means having caſt away Reaſon and Scripture
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42075:68"/>
from having any thing to do with their Actions, good and evil, Truth and Falſhood will be all alike, and there will be no difference between Virtue and Vice; and to kill a mans Neighbour, and ſeize upon his Eſtate, may be no ſin, if the voice of Reaſon and Scripture be not to judge of it. Theſe things will be of a very ſad conſequence to every one that expects and looks for another life when this is ended.</p>
               <p>But it may further be conſidered, that the rejecting of the Scriptures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them to be the Word of God, is likewiſe a piece of Familiſm, and was a part of the Doctrine of <hi>Caſpar Swenck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> a <hi>Sileſian,</hi> and that upon this ground (which the Quakers likewiſe urge) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt is called the Word. But ſo are the Scriptures too called the Word of God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>For this cauſe alſo thank we God without ceaſing, becauſe when ye received the Word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is indeed) the Word of God.</hi> So Heb. 13. 7. <hi>Remember them which have the rule over you, and have ſpoken to you the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, they would do well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42075:69"/>
and conſider how they hope to be ſaved: If they profeſs Quakery, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be by the Death and Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, becauſe the Quakers own no ſuch Perſon living without them, nor do they believe the Hiſtory of his Death and Paſſion at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> in the letter of it: ſo that every man who turns to be a Quaker, puts himſelf out of a capacity of being ſaved: for there being no Name by which any man ſhall be ſaved but by the Name of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> and he being denied by them as a Perſon living in Heaven, they are by the Tenour of the Goſpel excluded from having any Salvation by him. By which it appears, that every man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing and embracing Quakery, hazards and ſets at ſtake the everlaſting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Immortal Soul.</p>
               <p>But it is no wonder they take ſo little notice of their Souls, when they believe they have none; and he that follows their ways and opinions, muſt caſt away all care for another life, nor think of any thing but for the preſent: for Heaven, Hell, and the Day of Judgment are (as they ſay) in this Life.</p>
               <p>And though the Quaker will impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42075:69"/>
deny all this, and boldly affirm that he holds no ſuch things, yet I have produced nothing as their Judgment but what I find publiſhed by ſome of them in their printed Papers, or has been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by them at their own Conventicles and Meetings, and therefore is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to be their own opinion. But it need not ſtartle any man to hear a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker out-face his own Errours when challenged with them; for he that takes away all diſtinction between good and evil, will not ſtick to lye when it is for his advantage.</p>
               <p>Wherefore theſe Hereticks being ſo dangerous, and their Doctrine ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the Salvation of mens Souls, they ought carefully to be avoided, and their ſociety deteſted and abhorred: for he that aſſociates himſelf with them, cannot be free from Sin, but as he is guilty of Sin in the ſight of God by joyning himſelf to them, ſo unleſs he ſpeedily return and repent, he will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their Puniſhments. For ſo ſaid the Spirit of God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 26. <hi>Come out from the Congregation of theſe men, leſt ye be conſumed in their ſins.</hi> And the Apoſtle St. <hi>John, Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. 11. ſays,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42075:70"/>
that <hi>If there come any to you, and bring not the Doctrin of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (which is conteined in the Books of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament) <hi>he is not to be received into your houſe, nor to be bid, God ſpeed; for he that biddeth him, God ſpeed, is partaker of his evil deeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, if any man would keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from being drawn into their Errors, he muſt be ſure to obſerve the written Word of God as the Rule of his Belief and Actions, nor muſt he forſake the Dictates and Notices of right Reaſon: For by theſe two things he may judge of any Doctrin propounded to him, and whatever any man tells him, if it be contrary to Scripture and Reaſon, he may be certain that it is falſe. As for inſtance, the Quaker comes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that what he delivers, it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired to him by the Spirit, and that he hath immediate Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from God. In this Caſe now, I am to try what he brings by the Word of God and right Reaſon. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. 9. That if any man or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from Heaven ſhould preach any other Doctrin than what they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready preached, and the believers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42075:70"/>
he ſhould be accurſed. Now therefore, if theſe Quaking Inſpirations contein any other Doctrin than what is delivered in the Bible, that Doctrin is falſe, and thoſe that broached it are accurſed. And if the Revelation be of ſomething which the Word of God meddles not with, as concerning the going or not going to ſuch a Place, the doing or not doing of ſuch an Action; Common Reaſon will help a man to judge very much in it, and will afford ſo much light as to diſcover the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to be fooliſh and ridiculous, and nothing elſe but a Fanſie ariſing from a deep Melancholy, and miſtaken for the Inſpiration of the Spirit of God. And by theſe two helps, ſuppoſing a man to be faithful to God and his own ſoul, he may eaſily diſcover and avoid ſuch pernicious Errors. For it is the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe wicked People to deny the Scriptures and the uſe of Reaſon, becauſe they know they are ſo diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to their Doctrins and Opinions.</p>
