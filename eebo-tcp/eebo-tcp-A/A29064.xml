            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Malicious Slanders, and Scandalous Reproaches thrown upon me for my good Intentions to Serve my King, and Country, being the Contrivances of that Never-ſleeping Party, who have left no ſtone unturn'd to aboliſh the Belief of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey</hi>'s Murther, at leaſt as any way Reflecting upon <hi>Romiſh</hi> Deſign, have occaſioned me to Publiſh theſe few ſheets, not only for the Vindication of my own Innocence, but alſo for the General Satisfaction of the Nation, and for its farther Confirmation by ſeveral particulars never yet made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to the world.</p>
            <p>That I was a faithful Inſtrument to procure the Diſcovery of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human and deeply Meditated Murther, is a thing well known to many, as having been particularly employed by His Majeſty and the Council, to perſuade Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> to Diſcharge the Conſcience of a Chriſtian, by making a true Confeſſion, becauſe of my great Acquaintance and dayly Familiarity with him. Which they, who felt the fatal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of my ſincere Endeavours, ſo deeply laid to heart, that they ſought ſeveral ways to Enſnare my Life, and Undermine my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, accuſing me of being a Party concern'd, and one that ſpoke by the Dictates of Fear or Impoſture; and therefore not to be Credited, whereby they aim'd to kill two Birds with one Stone, that is to ſay, to ſtop the Progreſs of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> belief, and Satisfie their Revenge upon me. Therefore for the Satisfaction of the world, and my own Vindication, I thought it but neceſſary to give this Real and Faithful Account of my Proceedings and Tranſactings in reference to my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I was Bred up in a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Family from my Infancy, as being the Son of Mr. <hi>Rowland Boys,</hi> a Clothier in the City of <hi>Worceſter</hi>; and I have all along Profeſs'd the ſame Religion. True it is, that Neighborhood and a Sociable Temper brought me into the Acquaintance of ſeveral <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> with whom I had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Converſe, but with none ſo ſtrictly obliged in Friendſhip as with Mr. <hi>Miles Prance,</hi> between whom and my ſelf there was a more than ordinary Intimacy, which gave cauſe of Suſpicion to many, that I was of the ſame Perſuaſion; though indeed the true ground of ſuch Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was only upon the frequent occaſions of mutual Commerce. A
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56408:3"/>
reaſon for intimate Converſe ſo fair, that a more probable cannot be given, nor more frequently in practice, there being nothing that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliariſes even Familiarity it ſelf, ſo much as the League of Friendſhip and Profit, and the dependency of Trades one upon another, I being an Artiſt in <hi>Lampwork,</hi> for the making all manner of Curious Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations in Glaſs.</p>
            <p>Upon the 29<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> was Twelve-Month, at my Return out of the Country, I was by my Neighbour Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> invited to Dinner, in Token of a courteous Welcome-Home. While we were merry at Table one <hi>Thomas Haddon,</hi> a Lodger at that time in Mr. <hi>Prance</hi>'s Houſe, came in very haſtily full of private Intelligence, which Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> having underſtood in a Corner of the Room, return'd to his Gueſts with a Sorrowful and Penſive Countenance. Which ſudden alteration occaſion'd me out of Friendſhip, to be more than ordinarily inquiſitive into the Cauſes of ſo Diſconſolate a Change. At firſt he ſeem'd very ſhie and reſerv'd, but when I preſs'd him more cloſely, he told me, That ſeveral of his Friends had been taken out of their Beds the night before, and carryed to Priſon. I ask'd him whether he knew the cauſe of their Apprehenſion? He anſwer'd, No. Perhaps ſaid I they may prove to be Highway-men, and then your Grief will ſoon be over, though they ſhould receive the Reward of their Miſdeeds. To which Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> return'd, That they were perſons falſly accuſed, but that th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Crime was not for Robbing upon the High-way. Whereupon I bid him be of good Comfort and tear nothing, for that Innocency would juſtifie it ſelf. While we were thus Diſcourſing, in came one <hi>Grove,</hi> a School-Maſter, living in <hi>Princes-ſtreet,</hi> in the Company of another Stranger, who both took Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> aſide to the end of the Room, where they Whiſper'd for ſome time together, ſo that I could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any thing of their Diſcourſe; only <hi>Grove</hi> was over-heard to ſay, His Unkle <hi>Grove</hi> (who was ſince Hang'd) was taken.</p>
            <p>After we had ſtaid till toward night, the Company that had Din'd together, that is to ſay, Mr. <hi>Prance, Haddon,</hi> my Self and others, went all to a <hi>Coffee-Houſe</hi> in <hi>Drewry-Lane,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> being known to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> was Greeted with a very Sowre Welcome by one of the Company, in theſe words. <hi>Now all the Bloody Deſigns of you</hi> Papiſts <hi>are Diſcover'd, and ſeveral of your Prieſts and Jeſuits are appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for High-Treaſon, for attempting to Kill the King and Deſtroy the</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Religion.</hi> Theſe words did not a little Nettle Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> who therefore to vindicate the Innocency of his own Party, ſmartly reply'd, That they who were taken were Honeſt men, and that he would prove them ſo to be. Which Diſpute (one word begetting another) grew to that degree of Heat, that I was afraid of an abſolute Quarrel, which would have ended in nothing but Blows. Whereupon I took an opportunity to perſuade Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> to leave the place, and to retire to the <hi>Tavern</hi>; where being in private, I endeavour'd to get out of him the truth and the occaſion of theſe odd Paſſages; but he would give me no ſatisfaction, only continued ſtiff and firm in the Vindication of his Friends, the apprehended <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the firſt of <hi>October,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> was ſent for to the ſame <hi>Coffee-Houſe,</hi> and Threaten'd by ſome perſons, that they would have him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King and Council for his vindication of Traytors, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Expreſſions he had utter'd the laſt time he was there. To which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56408:3"/>
Mr. <hi>P.</hi> more calmly anſwer'd, that he would ſend for me, and hear what I would ſay to it, which he accordingly did. When I came, I told him, he was much to be blam'd for delivering himſelf in ſuch high Terms, but that I hop'd there would be no farther notice taken of his words, in regard he was known, or at leaſt verily believ'd to be an Honeſt man, and no way concern'd in Deſigns of ſo wicked a Nature. To which he reply'd, That he was as Innocent as the Child unborn. After he made this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, we went both of us to the Parties that had Threaten'd him, and I, undertaking to be his Advocate, deſired them that they would not call a man in Queſtion for a few raſh words, eſpecially ſince they knew nothing of ill in his Behaviour, but had rather experienc'd the contrary: who being by that means pacifi'd and oblig'd to a kind promiſe of Civility, I adviſed him to be more careful for the future and go home about his Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>About a 11. or 12. a Clock the ſame Night, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> being a Bed, was put into a moſt terrible Affrightment; for hearing as he lay, the Noiſe of a Conſtable and his Watch paſſing along the Street, he verily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that they had been come to apprehend him. This ſudden Terror caus'd him to call up his Lodger <hi>Haddon</hi>; who having made himſelf ready, and obſerv'd the Coaſt to be clear about his Houſe, away went Mr. <hi>P.</hi> to ſeek a ſafer Harbour: which when I underſtood the next day, I Check'd him for his idle Fears and groundleſs Apprehenſions, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel'd him to ſtay at home. To which he made this ſhort anſwer, That he was afraid, and could not help it. Thereupon, in point of Friendſhip I offer'd him my own houſe, and there entertain'd him for two Nights, <hi>viz.</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> and 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>October</hi>; but withal I advis'd him that if any Officer ſhould come to enquire for him at his own houſe, that he ſhould immediately Surrender himſelf, for that the bare Suggeſtions and Surmiſes of his Neighbours could be no Proof againſt him, and that his own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency would overcome all.</p>
            <p>Upon the coming forth of the Kings Proclamation, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> not being willing to take the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> was reſolv'd to have gone out of Town. But when he Communicated his Intentions to me, and had Diſcover'd the Scruples of his Conſcience, I perſwaded him not to be ſo over nice, but to take the Oaths, and not only uſed all the Arguments my own Capacity had furniſh'd me withal, but alſo for his clearer Information and Inſtruction profer'd to go along with him to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stilling-fleet,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> who, I did not Queſtion, would give him thoſe convincing Arguments that would oblige him to embrace the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion and forſake <hi>Popery.</hi> Which Diſcourſe of mine ſo far prevail'd upon him, that he went and took the Oaths both of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> in obedience to the Kings Command: and after that, went along with me to hear Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> whoſe Sound Divinity confirm'd him in what he had done.</p>
            <p>This Succeſs engag'd me to improve my Induſtry with others, that were his Friends and Viſiters; particularly with one Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> a moſt Severe <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> living in <hi>Browns-Court</hi> in the <hi>Old-Bayley,</hi> whom I met at Mr. <hi>Prance's</hi> Houſe, and there endeavoured to perſwade him to a Conformity with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But his obſtinacy was ſuch, that he utterly refus'd to think of any alteration in his Opinion; not but that he loved the King, as he ſaid, but that he would not Swear <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him. Upon which ſome Diſcourſe ariſing between the ſaid Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56408:4"/>
and my ſelf, wherein Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſeem'd to complain of the hard meaſure which was Dealt to the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> that being Subjects and Freeborn-men, they ſhould be forc'd like Exiles, from their Homes and Habitations, meerly for not acting againſt their Conſciences. But here, I met with ſo angry aRebuke for declaring, in juſtification of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, that no good Subjects would Scruple to take thoſe Oaths which were Commanded by Him, to whom they ow'd their Protection, that I thought my ſelf in ſome danger of my Life. For one Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> a Zealot of the ſame Leaven, taking up the Cudgels againſt me, flatly told me that I was no Honeſt man to ſpeak in defence of his Majeſties publick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, call'd me, in a vehement Paſſion, Great Heretick, and with a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing fury bore up ſo cloſe me, that I expected ſome immediate Act of Violence, which perhaps he had executed, had not my Siſter, in a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſear ſtepp'd between and pull'd me away from the Company. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I accounted my ſelf not a little happy in the good Office I had done my friend Mr. <hi>P.</hi> And I make this ſhort inſtance, not only to ſhew how difficult a thing it is, to cure the Canker'd obſtinacy of men Intoxicated and Stupified with the Deſtructive Principles of <hi>Popery,</hi> but in ſome meaſure to let it appear to the world, that the good Service Mr. <hi>P.</hi> has done, was not an Act, ſo much proceeding from the hopes of future advantage, but by the Inducements of a fair and Candid Reformation.</p>
            <p>Soon after theſe Paſſages had happen'd, there was a ſecret Murmuring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Neighbours, that doubtleſs Mr. <hi>P.</hi> was concern'd in the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey,</hi> for that he was ſo timorous as to lie from his Houſe, and becauſe he was alſo the Queens Servant. But for my part, when I heard theſe dangerous Rumours, I ſtill reprov'd the Reporters for going about to bring a perſon cauſleſly into trouble, not deeming him in the leaſt to have been Guilty.</p>
            <p>At another time, when <hi>Vernatti</hi> was with Mr. <hi>P.</hi> at the <hi>Horſe-ſhooe Tavern,</hi> in the Company alſo of the before-named <hi>Haddon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Parratt's</hi> man, whoſe Office it was to Collect Money from the Friends of Deceas'd <hi>Papiſts</hi> to have <hi>Maſſes</hi> ſaid for their Souls in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> it happen'd that I came in, I knew not what their Diſcourſe was before I enter'd the room; but ſo ſoon as <hi>Haddon</hi> was gone, <hi>Vernatti</hi> fell upon me with all his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive Arguments to Reconcile me to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and would have us'd perhaps many more words, but that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> told him, it was in vain to trouble himſelf. And indeed it was but an ill time for him to think of Converting me, who had the ſame Deſign upon his preſent Friend.</p>
            <p>Upon the 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> when Mr. <hi>P.</hi> was Apprehended and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, his Wife with Tears in her eyes came to me, and requeſted me to go and give my Teſtimony for him, that he lay at my Houſe ſuch and ſuch nights, and therefore could not be Guilty of the Crime that was laid to his Charge; I went accordingly to ſpeak what I knew, but my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony would not then be admitted. Yet in regard I had Diſcovered ſo much kindneſs for him, and ſuch an Intimacy with him, it was Order'd by ſome of the Members of the Houſe of Commons, that my Houſe ſhould be Searched; believing there might there be found ſome Letters perhaps belonging to Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> from whence they might Collect ſome farther Diſcovery of a truth which they were ſo diligently labouring to find out. For the Execution of this Order, the Officers appointed came to one Mr. <hi>Robert Sexton</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Princes-ſtreet,</hi> who underſtanding their buſineſs,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56408:4"/>
and being my very good friend, perſuaded them to deſiſt, or at leaſt to ſtay for ſome time, till I came thither my ſelf, in regard it might bring a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal upon me, and breed an ill Opinion of me among my new Neighbours (for I was but a little before removed to my Houſe near <hi>Ludgate</hi>) Luckily I came into Mr. <hi>Sextons,</hi> while the Officers and he were in this Debate. They ſtrictly examined me what I knew of Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and his Actions, and told me they came to Search my Houſe. I readily deſired them to do it, while I ſtaid where I was; but entreated them to do it with as little noiſe as might be, for the reaſons before-mentioned; aſſuring them withal, that I had no Letters, Books, or Papers that any way in the world concern'd Mr. <hi>P,</hi> which gave them ſufficient Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Much about this time Mr. <hi>P.</hi> was more ſtrictly examined before the King and Council, where he firſt made a Confeſſion, and then denied all again; whereupon he was ſent back to <hi>Newgate.</hi> But the Honourable Board having been informed that I had been intimate with the Priſoner, ſent for me, to trie whether any thing to the purpoſe might be gather'd from me in point of Circumſtance or otherwiſe. I anſwered directly to all Queſtions demanded, to the utmoſt of my knowledge. But not being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to any thing of the Murther, I could not give that Satisfaction which was ſought for, ſo that I was order'd to attend the next day being the 4<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> and to bring along with me my Wife and Servant. We were ſeverally called in, and narrowly examined about many things in relation to Mr. <hi>P.</hi> What he was? When he lay at my houſe? We Anſwered, that we knew no ill of him, but that we thought him to be a very Honeſt man. We alſo told them the time that he lay at my Houſe, and the occaſion, as is before declared. Which gave the Council ſuch ſatisfaction, that we were all Diſcharged.</p>
            <p>The Council being thus ſatisfied that I was a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and a perſon of honeſt repute, ſent for me again upon the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to go to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and to endeavour to draw what I could out of him, concerning the Murther of which he was Accuſed, and to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I could perſuade him to make a full Confeſſion of the truth. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I went, put ſeveral Queſtions to him, and begged of him over and over to Diſcharge his Conſcience, and to tell the Truth. Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſeemed to be very joyful to ſee his old Friend, but would Confeſs nothing, and to all my Queſtions made only this general Anſwer, That he was Innocent of the Horrid Murther; however he entreated me to come again, and not to forſake him in his Diſtreſs. I promiſed to return the next day, and did ſo; but then I found him like a perſon almoſt Diſtracted, and obſerv'd that in his Frantick Paſſions he would often repeat his Innocency, and his ignorance of the Murther, but yet when he was asked any Queſtion about it, he never anſwered to the purpoſe. Seeing therefore that I could by no means engage him to Confeſs the Fact, and that all my Labour had been hitherto in vain, I returned back to the Council and gave them an account of what I had done. Nevertheleſs they ordered me to perſiſt, and to make uſe of all the means and Perſuaſions that I thought might take effect to oblige him to Diſcover the particulars of a Murther, in which they were fully perſuaded he was none of the leaſt Active Conſpirators. And indeed ſuch was the Care and Diligence of thoſe great Perſonages in the Diſcovery of that Deteſtable Murther, that they gave me great encouragement to return again, and ſeemed to intimate ſome hopes of favour to the relenting Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The two ſorrowful Brothers of the Murthered Knight went along
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56408:5"/>
with me, and ſtaid in another Room while I Diſcours'd, entreated and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded the Priſoner, and ſpent many kind and friendly words in vain, for nothing yet could prevail. In the Evening upon the 11<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> D. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> the Dean of <hi>Bangor,</hi> came to him, and calling for me, ſhewed me before Mr. <hi>Prance's</hi> face a Warrant for his Pardon, intreating him withal upon his Majeſties ſo Gracious and Condeſcending Mercy, to Diſcover his knowledge. He would not at firſt believe the Warrant to be real, For, ſaid he, to me, if it were ſo, why had not you brought it as well as the Doctor? After many perſuaſions reiterated in vain, the Doctor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him in a bad Condition of Health, would not urge him any farther that Night; only wiſh'd him a Phyſician to give him ſuch Preſcriptions as he wanted; whereupon I beſought him to take care that ſome one of the Kings Phyſicians might be ſent him; which he procured accordingly. So that about one of the Clock the ſame Night I being left with him all the while, Mr. <hi>Dickyſon</hi> came to him, and gave him ſuch proper Remedies as perfectly recover'd him. The next day, being <hi>Sunday</hi> the 12<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> I return'd to him again, and ſpent the whole Afternoon with him, intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with many perſuaſions as well for his own and his Families ſake, as for the publick good, that he would not conceal from merited Juſtice, thoſe whom now I was fully convinced, that he knew to be ſuch notorious Offenders; but that he would at length declare his knowledge. Urging him withal, not to looſe the fair opportunity that was offer'd to him to have both his Life and his Liberty, which if now neglected, might coſt him a dear and too late Repentance. At that time I preſs'd him ſo effectually, that he began to ſpeak ſomething to the purpoſe, telling me that he had ſeen a Relation of the Murther, but, that never being perſonally concern'd in the Fact, he knew nothing more than what he had learnt from that Narrative. I ask'd him who ſhewed him the Relation? He anſwer'd, <hi>Vernatti,</hi> but this ſeemed not Satisfactory to me. For upon farther Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him, I perceived that he gave me an account, not as from a ſecond Hand, but as one that had been all along concern'd in the Fact. After a long Debate, and many Perſuaſions, at length I told him, that I was aſſur'd of his Pardon, if he would ingeniouſly and in time Confeſs the whole matter, and how far he himſelf had been concerned. That I knew there were others in Priſon for the ſame Crime, who if they ſhould firſt Reveal the Buſineſs, his Confeſſion would only ſerve to Condemn himſelf; and therefore I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him, as he lov'd his life, ſpeedily to prevent his own Misfortune, by giving a free and exact account of the Murther; in regard it was plain, that <hi>Vernatti</hi> would never have truſted him with the Relation of ſuch a Secret, had he not been a Confederate. That night I could get no more out of him, ſo that I left him to ponder upon what I had ſaid to him. Which had that good effect, that by break of day the next Morning being the 13<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> I was ſent for to the Priſon, to ſpeak with Mr. <hi>P.</hi> And that very morning it was, that he Diſcovered to me all that he knew of the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey,</hi> and of ſomething more relating to the Plot it ſelf, and gave me a full account of the manner of the Action, if not in the ſame words yet altogether the ſame in Subſtance, which he himſelf hath already made publick to the world, to which, for avoiding a needleſs Repetition I refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>When I brought the account to the King and Council, they gave me my Oath to Confirm that the Recital of it came immediately from Mr. <hi>Prances</hi> mouth which I readily took, as being a moſt certain Truth. I farther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56408:5"/>
told his Majeſty what Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had revealed to me of the Deſign of <hi>Proſſers Matteſon, Adamſon,</hi> and <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>; to have Murthered the Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> And indeed ſuch was the Indefatigable Care and Induſtry of that Noble Peer in Proſecuting the Diſcovery of the Plot, ſuch his unwearied endeavours to ſecure his Majeſty and the Kingdom, by his Wiſdom and Councils from the Attempts of our Enemies, that they have merited the thankful applauſe of the whole Nation. No wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould be ſo zealous to remove ſo great an Obſtacle of their wicked Conſpiracies out of the way.</p>
            <p>I alſo gave an account of what Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had revealed to me concerning the Plot, or at leaſt of ſo much as he know. All which things Mr. <hi>P.</hi> has ſince himſelf more amply declared either in his own Narrative, or in the Teſtimonies which he gave againſt the ſeveral perſons, ſince Convicted and Executed for the Crimes in ſome part by him proved againſt them.</p>
            <p>When the Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty had received a full Information of all theſe things from me, part in Writing, part by word of Mouth; he cauſed Warrants to be iſſued forth for the apprehenſion of <hi>Proſſer, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, &amp;c.</hi> and by me ſent an Order to Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> to bring Mr. <hi>P.</hi> up to the Council the ſame day. The King was then preſent, and took the pains to examine him himſelf, to every particular of what I had delivered and declared; all which Mr. <hi>P.</hi> confirm'd as he had before Confeſs'd to me in the Priſon; and further declar'd to his Majeſty, That he would ſtand by his ſaid Confeſſion with the hazard or loſs of his Life.</p>
            <p>In conſideration of this Confeſſion, his Majeſty was pleaſed to command that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſhould have his Pardon, and that Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſhould ſuffer him to want for nothing. I was alſo ordered to keep him Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny every day. For the Kings Majeſty and Council were pleaſed to be ſo ſenſible of the pains I had taken, to bring that horrid Murther to light, that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> a moſt Noble and Prudent Counſellour, with the reſt of the Honourable Board, did me the high favour to return me a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thanks. And Sir <hi>Robert Southwell</hi> afterwards declared in the Lobby before ſeveral perſons that I had Diſcharg'd a good Conſcience both toward God and man. And therefore in requital of my good Service upon that occaſion, upon the 29<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> his Majeſty in Council was moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to make the following Order in my behalf.</p>

               <p>After the Tryals of the Murtherers were over, I waited upon the Right Honourable, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to intreat his favorable Aſſiſtance and his kind word to his Majeſty and Council in behalf of Mr. <hi>P.</hi> that he might be releas'd out of Priſon; That as I had been an Aid and Succour to him in the time of his Trouble, I might not be thought to leave the work im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, which I had in Friendſhip begun; having no other end or aim in all my Actions Relating to this Affair, than to approve my ſelf a good and Loyal Subject, a true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and a Cordial Friend. Neither am I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to my ſelf of having fail'd in any one of theſe particulars; for which, my Innocency will at no time refuſe with all humility to make its appeal to thoſe Noble Lords who were the diſcerning Witneſſes of my behaviour, as having frequent occaſion to attend upon them, during Mr. <hi>Prance's</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.</p>
               <p>Therefore for ſeveral reaſons, I thought it but neceſſary to give this ſhort account and Narrative to the world as being, Firſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. An Eye-witneſs of his Majeſties moſt Princely and Tender Care, and unwearied pains, which he took at that time for the publick Security of the Nation, and to bring the Offenders to Condign puniſhment. And that the Lords of the Council were no leſs vigorouſly Active to ſecond his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Reſolutions with their moſt prudent Advice, and continual and laborious Scrutinies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To confirm the Relation of the Murther made by Mr. <hi>P.</hi> as being firſt received by my ſelf from his own Mouth, which I do Atteſt before God and the whole world to agree in all particulars with what he himſelf has Publiſhed, and ſo abſolutely conſent, that I ſhould but have incurr'd the blame of tyring or abuſing the Reader with a Repetition of the ſame words again. Nor was it extorted from him by any other Wrack or Torture, then that of a Diſmaid and Diſtracted Conſcience, which could not Disburthen it ſelf till it had thrown off the Shackles of thoſe fears and jealouſies that uſually perplex the Guilty, eſpecially conſidering the remedileſs <hi>Dilemma</hi> that was put upon him; that Labyrinth of Life or Death, wherein he found himſelf intrigu'd without hopes of ever getting forth, unleſs he made uſe in time of the Silken Clue that was offer'd.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the third place, I thought it was a duty owing to my own Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to diſengage it from the Scandals throw upon me by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who would make the world believe me to be a Phanatick. As alſo to reſcue it from ſome ill thoughts of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who ſuſpected me to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> in regard of my frequent Converſe with thoſe of the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> it was no more than I exſpected from them, who being unwilling to believe ſo horrid a Murther, perpetrated by the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of their dignifi'd Prieſts and Confeſſors, or aſhamed that ſuch an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Blur ſhould contaminate their Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, care not what Blemiſhes and Scandals they throw upon others, to wipe off the Reproach from themſelves. Which in regard it has been their continued practice from the beginning of the firſt Diſcovery of that Villanous Murther, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56408:6"/>
Effects whereof have only redounded to their farther ſhame and Confuſion, I have great reaſon not to queſtion but that the Reports which they have rais'd upon me, will be as little regarded, as thoſe vilifying Imputations, which they vainly caſt upon others. Although, were it true, that I were a <hi>Phanatick,</hi> I ſhould not account my ſelf ſo ignominious, as if I were in the number of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> with that weight of Blood and intended Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre upon their Shoulders. I lightly paſs over that other Reproach of theirs, That I was a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Raſcal, and that if it had not been for ſuch a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Rogue as I, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had never made his Diſcovery, as being of little or no value.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I muſt confeſs that their Suſpicions do not a little trouble me, and I cannot but look upon their unkindneſs as proceeding from ſomewhat of Ingratitude; ſince that Familiarity with which they ſo upbraid me, happened to be ſo Fortunate for their Advantage.</p>
               <p>But for their ſatisfaction, I do declare that I never was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> nor of any other Profeſſion then that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in which I alſo intend to live and die. Nor was I ever concern'd in any of the foul Actions of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> relating to the <hi>Plot,</hi> or the Barbarous Murther of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey,</hi> but as an Inſtrument to Diſcover the Truth: being look'd upon by his Majeſty and his moſt Honourable Privy Council as the fitteſt, and moſt likely perſon to Succeed, by reaſon of my Acquaintance and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with Mr. <hi>Prance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to ſhew how Careful and Faithful I was in the Management of that Secret wherewith I was entruſted by his Majeſty, I muſt farther declare, That when Mr. <hi>Redding,</hi> who had often ſought for me at my houſe, and having at laſt found me out, and by all Perſuaſions and Arguments imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, had endeavoured to get from me a Copy of Mr. <hi>Prance's</hi> Confeſſion and Depoſitions (which was highly preſs'd upon me at the <hi>Dog Tavern</hi> near <hi>Ludgate</hi>) I refus'd him with Indignation of all his promiſed Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and Rewards; telling him withal, that as I had been entruſted by his Majeſty in the Buſineſs, I would by no means or perſuaſions in the world Falſifie ſo great a Truſt, nor Diſcover what Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had revealed before the ſeaſon of due allowance.</p>
               <p>When Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> had given me over, there came two other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to me with the ſame Propoſals; aſſuring me of a great Reward in hand, to let them have Mr. <hi>Prances</hi> Confeſſion, and what he had Diſcover'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Murther, and the <hi>Plot.</hi> But all their Promiſes could not move me in the leaſt to betray a Truſt, ſo Graciouſly repos'd in me by my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; and with the Honour and Satisfaction of having ſo done, I hope to live with a more quiet Conſcience upon the ſmall gains of my Lawful Induſtry, than upon the more abounding ways of Treachery, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.</p>
               <p>Neither may I here omit to tell my Revilers, that while I was in the midſt of that Service which I performed, I was not without ſome diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Apprehenſions of being in danger of my Life. For being one Evening at Mr. <hi>Sexton's</hi> Houſe in <hi>Princes-ſtreet,</hi> three perſons living hard by, and well known to be of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Gang, were obſerved to ſtand waiting at the Corner of the ſame Street, who when they perceived that I was coming forth, withdrew themſelves towards <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi> which was my directeſt way home; of which, Notice being given to Mr. <hi>Sexton,</hi> both he and the reſt of my Friends advis'd me to take another way, in regard it was dark, and fearing thoſe perſons were upon the Watch to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56408:7"/>
do me a Miſchief. The perſons names were, one <hi>Tarleton,</hi> a Guilder, ſince Fled for being concerned in Guilding Mill'd Shillings, and one <hi>Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rige</hi> a Turner, and Neighbour thereby, with one more who was a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; which, with what I have already ſaid, I hope may ſerve to quaſh the Miſtruſts of my Religion, and ſatisfie all good <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the reality and ſincerity of my Intentions.</p>
               <p>Now ſo ſoon as I had obtain'd Mr. <hi>Prance</hi>'s abſolute Enlargement, I brought him to <hi>Princes-ſtreet</hi> to ſee his Wife, whom he had not ſeen all the time of his Confinement, and there alighted at Mr. <hi>Sextons</hi> Houſe. At that time the ſame <hi>Aldrige</hi> above-mentioned, with his Wife and ſome others, began to renew their former Malice, muttering one to another that the <hi>Rogue P.</hi> was come out of Priſon, and that the <hi>Presbyterian Rogue Boys</hi> was with him; which not ſufficing, they alſo began to vent their Spleen in irreverent Language againſt his Majeſty himſelf; for which I had them ſeiz'd by vertue of a Warrant from ſeveral of the Juſtices of the Peace, who Committed them to Cuſtody, where they remained two days, and were then carried before the Lords of the Council, who were pleaſed to Diſcharge them upon their Submiſſion. After this, I took Mr. <hi>P.</hi> together with his Wife, home to my own houſe near <hi>Ludgate,</hi> where he continued for a Month. Thither alſo came ſeveral of the Relations of both to Viſit him, as I thought, out of love, but indeed for nothing but to Teaze and perplex him, by Pealing continually in his Ears, That they were afraid he had wrong'd his Conſcience, and wiſhing that the Blood of thoſe that died might not lie at his door. All which for a while Mr. <hi>P.</hi> took patiently enough, but told them withal, that he had done nothing but what Juſtice oblig'd him to do, and that had it not been for thoſe wicked Prieſts and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> who had deluded him before, he had never come into that Trouble and Diſgrace which he had undergone. Perceiving then, that they came rather to vex him, than Congratulate his Delivery, I made bold to tell 'em, that I believ'd they were ſorry that his Life was Sav'd, and that they had rather he ſhould have Died than have Diſcover'd the Truth, and ſo with Mr. <hi>Prance's</hi> leave, forbade them all my houſe, excepting only his Wife.</p>
               <p>Being thus diſguſted, and meditating new Projects, they endeavour'd all they could, to get Mr. <hi>P.</hi> from a place ſo inconvenient for their purpoſes. Which when they had effected, then they began to form New Deſigns, for the bringing about whereof, they thought they could find no better way, than to create a difference between Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and my ſelf, which they intended to heighten afterwards to an abſolute Quarrel and breach of Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>The Deſign was very ſilly and like the reſt of their vain Imaginations; however they were reſolv'd to put it in execution, hoping that when they had ſet us once at Defiance, that ſome ſtrange Incongruities and Incoheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies would have dropt from us for them to lay hold on, and to make their advantages of. So carefully is that great Maxim of the <hi>Pope, Divide and Reign,</hi> diffus'd from the Hand to every particular Member of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrine.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe the women were the firſt that attempted to make Tryal of their Female Cunning. The firſt that began to lay her Trains to blow up the long Friendſhip between Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and my ſelf was one Mrs. <hi>Billing,</hi> as Mr. <hi>P.</hi> himſelf acknowledg'd, a profeſt <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> ſet on by thoſe of her own Religion.</p>
               <p>But her Plot failing, Mrs. <hi>Prance</hi> her ſelf went to one Mrs. <hi>Dorothy Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi>

her own Siſter, and a zealous <hi>Papiſt</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Cunningly inform'd her, that the time was now come to be reveng'd upon me for being Inſtrumental in the Diſcovery of the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey</hi>; for that her Husband and I were quite fall'n out. Though I have ſo much Charity for Mr. <hi>Prance's</hi> Wife, to believe, that ſhe had no unkindneſs for me, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Score of her Religion.</p>
               <p>This Wheedle encouraging Mrs. <hi>Sherbons</hi> Zeal, away goes ſhe to the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and inform'd her of the difference which themſelves had forg'd between Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and my ſelf, and advis'd her not to let ſlip the Opportunity that offer'd it ſelf of making their Advantage of it. The Lady, believing the overture real, and conſequently a thing probable to take effect, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> a perſon at that time altogether unknown to me, to make his way into my Company, and to uſe his Art to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their Deſign, which was to entrap me, if poſſible, by Prolixity of Diſcourſe, and to gain what ever Diſconcurrencies of former Evidence he could, relating to the Tranſactions between me and Mr. <hi>P.</hi> To which end he came to me by no name, but only as from Mr. <hi>P.</hi> upon a pretence of deſiring me to cut him ſome <hi>Amber.</hi> To which I made him anſwer, that it was a thing quite out of my rode, and wonder'd that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> who knew me better, ſhould ſo far miſtake my calling. The Gentleman perceiving his Errour, deſir'd to be more private with me over a glaſs of Wine. As for Wine I refus'd him, conſidering how he had fail'd in his Addreſs, which had rendered him very ſuſpicious to me; but in regard he came from Mr. <hi>P.</hi> as he ſaid, I yielded to drink a Diſh of Coffee or a Glaſs of Ale with him, yet with this Caution to my ſelf, that I reſolv'd the Maſter of the Houſe, as much as poſſible he could, ſhould be by, all the time of our ſtay. When we were together, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> then as I ſaid before) unknown to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with the Death of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey.</hi> Upon which he applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my Kindneſs to Mr. <hi>P.</hi> by telling me how great a Friend I had been to him in Saving his Life. But then coming to his point, he fell on the other ſide to bemoan my Misfortune that I ſhould be ſo ill requited for my Kindneſs, for that Mr. <hi>P,</hi> ſtrangely ungrateful and forgetful of my ſucceſsful Friendſhip, did nothing but rail at me, and ſpeak ill things of me, behind my Back. To all which I made only this ſhort reply, That I was very ſorry for it, but for the occaſion, left it to God and Mr. <hi>Prances</hi> own Conſcience to be the Judges.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe he went on much further, and left no inſtigations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives uneſſay'd to heighten my Provocation againſt my Friend. However I ſtill perſiſted in my good Opinion of him, believing Mr. <hi>P.</hi> to be the ſame perſon in reference to his honeſt affections toward me; and therefore deſired M. <hi>D.</hi> to deſiſt from any further Attempts, which would be but vain and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Which, though it ſilenc'd his farther Proſecution at that time, yet he again the next morning, ſtill concealing his name, and pretending only came to be an admirer of Art; and therefore, ſeeing certain Counterfeit Necklaces in my Room, ask'd me, whether I made them or no? I told him, I did. Thereupon he bought ſome three or four, with ſome ſlight Queſtions before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, what the true value of them might be? To which I repli'd, That in regard he was Mr. <hi>Prances</hi> Friend, I would have no more of him, than
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56408:8"/>
what I ſold them for to the <hi>Exchange.</hi> But he repli'd, he was ſo much an admirer of Art, that he could not but believe himſelf oblig'd to give me a Price according to his own judgment, and the value, that he himſelf had ſet upon them; which was more than I demanded. After that we parted, and I ſaw him no more till about ten days, or a Fourthnight afterwards, at what time I met him accidentally in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> when he would have preſs'd upon me a Bottle of Wine at the <hi>Caſtle Tavern.</hi> But I refus'd it, and excus'd my ſelf, by telling him, I did not care to Drink with ſtrange Company, as being known to have been Inſtrumental in the Diſcovery of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey's</hi> Murther, and therefore did not know what Deſigns ſome people might have upon me. After which, I only met him Paſſant upon a <hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet</hi> with a Lady in his hand.</p>
               <p>All this while Mrs. <hi>Dorothy Sherborn</hi> kept an Intimate Correſpondence with me and my Wife. But with no other Deſign than to blow the Coals of Diſcord between Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and me, with often Repetitions of my Kindneſs to her Brother-in-law Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and telling me how much he was beholding to me for his Life, for which reaſon, he was a very unworthy perſon to ſpeak ſo ill of me, as he did, in all Companies. On the other ſide I ſtill took his part, and juſtifying, that what he had done was no more than what it behoov'd him to do, told her, her Brother-in-Law could have no reaſon to ſpeak ill of me, and that therefore I ſhould be very cautious of believing what ſhe ſaid to be true.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, Mrs. <hi>Sherborn</hi> continu'd without ceaſing her undermining Projects, ſo that neither my Wife nor I could paſs by her Houſe, but ſhe call'd us in, and was ſtill exclaiming againſt the good Service Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> had done, which ſhe call'd one of the greateſt pieces of Villany that poſſibly could have been Committed. And ſo changing her Note, accus'd me, to have wrought him to make a Confeſſion of Tales and Stories to ſave his Life and hazard his Soul. So that it was no wonder her Brother-in-law was ſo much offended at me as he was. Applauding Providence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that would by means of their differences unfold the Myſteries of both our iniquities.</p>
               <p>Which Inſinuation might perhaps have wrought ſome effect upon my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, well knowing how Indefatigable the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are to Bugbear and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Conſciences of perſons not well reſolv'd, and conſequently that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> might poſſibly be wrought upon to have ſome ill thought of me, but that I knew, that I had only compleated what Mr. <hi>P.</hi> himſelf had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; by fortifying him in his reſolutions to ſtand to that Confeſſion which he had made before the Lords of the Committee, and to confirm him in the ratification of his own Act and Deed.</p>
               <p>Seeing then, that Mrs. <hi>Sherborn</hi> preſt theſe things ſo hard upon me, I reſolv'd to put the Queſtion as ſeverely to her, and deſired her punctually to tell me, whether ſhe thought there was any Plot or no? To which ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, that ſhe believ'd there was a Plot againſt the King and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not that it was carried on by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but that I ſhould find in a ſhort time, that it was a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plot: which made me very much
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56408:8"/>
admire, in regard that neither by my Converſe with my Acquaintance of that Profeſſion, nor by my reading of their Books, I could find them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd or Principl'd to any ſuch Acts of Irregular Violence.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Sherborn</hi> being thus at a loſs, one <hi>James Pemberton,</hi> living near <hi>Ladgate,</hi> Tracing her Steps, undertook to accompliſh what ſhe had begun, though he made his Batteries with the ſame plauſible Inſinuations that ſhe had uſed before; as, that I had been a great Friend to Mr. <hi>P. &amp;c.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that I had over perſuaded him to Confeſs things of which he was no way Guilty, meerly to ſave his Life; arguing from a ſuppoſition, that he was inſufficient to be entruſted with ſo great a ſecret, that he was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innocent. Finding my ſelf thus frequently and ſo ſeverely encounter'd, I retreated to my former Queſtion and ask'd him likewiſe, whether he thought there was any Plot or no? whoſe anſwer was to the ſame Tune that Mrs. <hi>Sherborn</hi> had Sung before, that he believ'd there was a Plot, though not of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Contrivance, but by the Contrivance of the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and that in a ſhort time it would be ſo prov'd: And his Grand Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had died wrongfully, or elſe they would have made a true Confeſſion of themſelves. I repli'd, that was no true proof, and ſhewed him a Book upon the Tryal of <hi>Parry,</hi> wherein it was made out, that he firſt Confeſt the Treaſon againſt the Queen, and at his Execution denied it, againſt the Letters which were produced under his own hand Writing; which Book he deſiring to ſee, I lent it him; but he found it ſo ill for his Turn, that though I often re-demanded it of him, I could hardly get it again (by which I ſhrewdly conjectur'd that he had a mind to have embezel'd it, and diſpoſe of it as a Heretical Story) but at laſt I did.</p>
               <p>All theſe Contrivances ill Succeeding, I receiv'd the following Letter from an unknown perſon at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>

               <p>This Letter I ſhewed to ſeveral Friends, but they all concurr'd that it was only a Trapan, and a Deſign laid to enſnare me, and advis'd me not to go without ſome other perſons to bear me Company. With this Caution I went, and enquired for the Number 2. but there was no ſuch perſon as had ſubſcribed his name to the Letter. I underſtood indeed that there was an honeſt Gentleman of the ſame Name that liv'd at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56408:9"/>
being ſent to by me, he utterly diſowned any knowledge of the Matter, or that he had appointed any Buſineſs at the ſaid Tavern. But it ſeems there was a Gang that Watch'd my coming, and hearing my ſmart enquiry for the Number 2. and my Expoſtulation with the Servant of the Houſe, one of them came to me, and told me, that he and ſome others ſtaid for Mr. <hi>Odriffe,</hi> and that it could not be long ere he come; and thereupon invited me to the reſt of the Company. Then I concluded twas time for me to march off; ſo I thank'd him, for his Kindneſs and took my leave with a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution not to come near him nor his Mr. <hi>Odriffe</hi> neither.</p>
               <p>When all theſe Deſigns prov'd fruitleſs, then they gave it out, that I held a Correſpondence with the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and that he had given me Ten pounds to pay my Rent; which, as they pretended was for ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Service, that I had either done or was to do his Lordſhip. A thing which I utterly diſown; for I cannot remember, that ever I ſo much as ſaw the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> in my life but once, and that was, as I was coming down with Mr. <hi>P.</hi> from his Grace the Duke of <hi>Monmouths</hi> Lodgings in the <hi>Cockpit</hi> at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and the ſaid Earl was paſſing by through the place where the Sentinel ſtands; and then neither did I know who his Lordſhip was, till the Sentinel, of whom I ask'd the Queſtion, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd me, nor did I ſo much as ſpeak to him, as all that were preſent can Teſtifie. And indeed it would have been a ſtrange confident. Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in me to have gone to ſpeak to a perſon of Honour to whom I was utterly unknown, having no buſineſs with him, as I neither had at that, or at any other time. So that how his Lordſhip ſhould come to know my wants, and be ſo bountiful as to give me Ten Pound, I can by no means underſtand. However, if his Lordſhip were ſo Liberal, I had the Misfortune to be baſely Cheated, for I never had it. And I wiſh Mrs. <hi>Sherborn</hi> would do me the Kindneſs to inform me, who the perſon was, to whom his Lordſhip gave order to pay the money, for I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe her, did I know the perſon, I ſhould go and demand it. For if it were true, both his Lordſhip, and my ſelf, are very much abus'd. On the other ſide I ſhould have been extreamly to blame, that I ſhould not ere this have returned his Lordſhip my moſt humble Thanks for ſo great and ſpecial a favour: neither do I know of any perſon from whom I ever received a kindneſs, that can Tax me of ſo much Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. But this is like the reſt of the Actions of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that care not what they ſay, or Swear to, ſo it be to advance the Intereſt of their Holy Mother the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though never ſo much to the Prejudice and Defamation of the Innocent.</p>
               <p>At length Mrs. <hi>Sherborn</hi> declares, that Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> told her this Story, and that he came to have impoſed upon her. A Tale which ſeems very Incoherent with Truth, that he ſhould go about to Amuſe or Trapan her, when they were both at the ſame time in the fame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy together. For Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> hath ſince declar'd, that he never knew me, but by her means, and that they had a real Deſign to have ruin'd me, if they found that they could not win me to ſerve their purpoſes, though with this intimation, that my complyance with them would prove a Thouſand pound in my way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56408:9"/>But now that the Scene is chang'd, Mrs. <hi>Sherborn</hi> rails againſt Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> as much, or more than ever ſhe did againſt me, and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes his Failings with as loud Invectives and Aggravations, as her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger can expreſs. So that it is evident that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do not bear ſo much Malice againſt the perſons, or the Vices of men, as againſt their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and Recantations of their Errours. The wicked ſhall be Saints among them, ſo long as they will be Inſtrumental to carry on their Deſigns; but if once, out of an apprehenſion of their Miſtake, or an abhorrency of the Facts which they put upon them to Execute, they ſeek to retrieve themſelves and their Reputation, by a ſeaſonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Detection of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Treacheries, then the moſt pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Crimes and Scandals are too light to over-whelm their recover'd Reputations.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> himſelf, his own Relations began to be his moſt bitter Enemies, and rais'd a Report, that he was concern'd in making of Fire-balls; and that he was ſeen in <hi>Perpole-Lane,</hi> the Night before the <hi>New-Priſon</hi> was Burnt, and that ſeveral Fire-balls had been found near the place where he had been Drinking, in that Lane, the night before. This Report ſo terrifi'd Mr. <hi>Prance's</hi> Wife, as fearing it might ſwell to the prejudice of her Husband, that with a mind very much troubled and perplexed, ſhe came and found me out, in a place in the City, where I was with her Husband and ſome other Company, and calling me aſide, told me the whole Relation, and deſired my aſſiiſtance to ſearch out the Truth, which I promiſed her. Accordingly I went the next day to ſatifie her. But after I had made all the diligent enquiry I could, I found the whole buſineſs to be grounded only upon the Idle Twattle of an Old-woman that Lodg'd in <hi>Perpole-Lane,</hi> who the next day after the Fire went to a Female Relation of Mr. <hi>Prances</hi> in <hi>Bride-Lane,</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and told her of the Fire that had happen'd the night before, and that Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> was ſuſpected about it: who made her anſwer, that ſhe knew nothing of the Fire, neither did ſhe believe her Kinſman any way concern'd in it. However ſhe went in Friendſhip to her Siſter, that was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and giving her an account of what the Old-woman had told her, deſir'd her to give Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> notice of it, as being more familiar with him. She on the other ſide meditating to make another ſort of uſe of the Information, improves the Surmiſe, intending to have Kindled a more deſtructive flame to Mr. <hi>Prances</hi> diſadvantage, and endeavour'd to have brought not only Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> but her Siſter into trouble about it. But it prov'd ſuch an idle and ſilly invention of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Contrivance as only ſerv'd to ſhew the inveterate Malice of their Dying Revenge, ready to lay hold upon any ſeeming opportunity to have blaſted the Credit of Mr. <hi>Prance's</hi> Evidence, as I made it clearly out.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of <hi>January</hi> Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> came to me, and told me I was to be Examined in reference to a very great and weighty Concern. I asked him whether he knew what it was? To which he made Anſwer, that it was not convenient for him to ſpeak of it: but ſaid withal, that there was a woman to be examined alſo with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:56408:10"/>Upon which I endeavour'd to Recollect my Memory, but could not call to mind any perſon with whom I had had any Diſcourſe about any thing of State Affairs, as not becoming me to meddle with them.</p>
               <p>Thereupon I ask'd him who the perſon was that ſhould cauſe me to be Examin'd? which he refus'd to tell me; a thing that I took ſomewhat unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from him, telling him that I could not have conceal'd any thing from him, which might have fore-arm'd him againſt the Information of any perſon whatſoever; but all I could ſay ſignifi'd nothing at that time.</p>
               <p>Upon the Twenty Second of the ſame Month, he invited me to a Glaſs of Wine at the <hi>Feathers Tavern</hi> in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> whither I went along with him. There we met (as I thought accidentally) with Mr. <hi>Warcupp,</hi> one of his Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and Captain <hi>Creſſet,</hi> in whoſe Company I had not ſate long, but Mr. <hi>Warcupp</hi> ſent for Mr. <hi>Bedlow.</hi> After ſome Salutations that paſs'd betwixt us, in came another perſon, who Saluted me by the Name of Mr. <hi>Boys.</hi> I return'd him his Salute, but could not Divine who he was, till one in the Company taking up the Glaſs, preſented his Service to him by the name of Mr. <hi>Dangerfield.</hi> So ſoon as I hear'd that, I ask'd Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> if that were the ſame perſon who was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to make the <hi>Plot</hi> as Acted by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>? He told me it was. Then ſaid I, this is the perſon that came the laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to have inveigl'd me. Whereupon I ask'd him if this were the perſon who intended to have me Examined? To which he repli'd, it was: whereupon I ſtaid ſomewhat longer than I meant to have done; expecting what Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> or any other perſon in the room might have to ſay to me; but there was nothing ſaid that night.</p>
               <p>Upon the 29<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> came to my Houſe, and told me I muſt appear before the Lord Mayor to be by him Examined, but told me nothing of the occaſion. Thereupon I went that day to my Lords Houſe, but his Lordſhip being that day buſie, I had Orders to attend the next, which accordingly I did. Before I went Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> came to me, and offered to go along with me; but I refuſed his Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, becauſe he had Conceal'd the name of the Perſon from me, when I deſired him to let me know it: Telling him withal, that I did not Queſtion but to be able to anſwer any thing that ſhould be alledg'd againſt me.</p>
               <p>When I came before my Lord I found the occaſion of my being Summoned to be quite contrary to what Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> had intimated, as that, <hi>I had talk'd at a ſtrange Rate of things of high and great Concernment.</hi> For indeed the buſineſs was only this (and I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to my ſelf it could not really be for any other reaſon) that I ſhould declare and juſtifie the Truth of Mr. <hi>Dangerfields</hi> coming to enſnare me, how I came to have a Diſtruſt of him, and the ways and Method which he us'd to engage me to a Diſcovery of the Secrets which the moſt Honorable Privy-Council had entruſted me withal, and what Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> had Confeſſed touching the Murther, and farther to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56408:10"/>
my conſtant refuſal of his Temptations, and Reſiſtance of his plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Batteries. Of all which I made an <hi>Affidavit</hi> before his Lordſhip, ſince Printed in Mr. <hi>Dangerfields</hi> Second Narrative, to which I refer the Reader; which gave his Lordſhip Satisfaction, and ſerves as much as any thing, to confirm Mr. <hi>Dangerfields</hi> Evidence.</p>
               <p>This is that which in Vindication of my ſelf, I thought not only fit, but neceſſary to declare to the world. A Relation altogether plain, and without any Fallacy of Expreſſion, which he that will go about to diſprove, may do it if he can.</p>
