            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are ſo few Tranſlations which deſerve praiſe, that I ſcarce ever ſaw any which deſerv'd pardon; thoſe who travel in that kinde, being for the moſt part ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as to rob others, without enriching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, pulling down the fame of good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, without raiſing their own: Neither hath any Author been more hardly dealt
<pb facs="tcp:94923:3"/>
withal then this our Maſter; and the reaſon is evident, for, what is moſt excellent, is moſt inimitable; And if even the worſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are yet made worſe by their Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, how impoſſible is it not to do great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the beſt? And therefore I have not the vanity to think my Copy equal to the Original, nor (conſequently) my ſelf alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether guiltleſs of what I accuſe others; but if I can do <hi>Virgil</hi> leſs injury then others have done, it will be, in ſome degree to do him right; and indeed, the hope of doing him more right, is the onely ſcope of this Eſſay, by opening this new way of tranſlating this Author, to thoſe whom youth, leiſure, and better fortune makes fitter for ſuch under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</p>
            <p>I conceive it a vulgar error in tranſlating Poets, to affect being <hi>Fidus Interpres;</hi> let that care be with them who deal in matters of Fact, or matters of Faith: but whoſoever aims at it in Poetry, as he attempts what is not required, ſo he ſhall never perform what he attempts; for it is not his buſineſs alone to
<pb facs="tcp:94923:3"/>
tranſlate Language into Language, but Poeſie into Poeſie; and Poeſie is of ſo ſubtle a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that in pouring out of one Language in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, it will all evaporate; and if a new ſpirit be not added in the transfuſion, there will remain nothing but a <hi>Caput mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum,</hi> there being certain Graces and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes peculiar to every Language, which gives life and energy to the words; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever offers at Verbal Tranſlation, ſhall have the misfortune of that young Traveller, who loſt his own language abroad, and brought home no other inſtead of it; for the grace of the Latine will be loſt by being turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Engliſh words; and the grace of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, by being turned into the Latine Phraſe. And as ſpeech is the apparel of our thoughts, ſo are there certain Garbs &amp; Modes of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> vary with the times; the faſhion of our clothes being not more ſubject to alteration, then that of our ſpeech: and this I think <hi>Tacitus</hi> means, by that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he cals <hi>Sermonem temporis iſtius auribus accommodatum;</hi> the delight of change being as due to the curioſity of the ear, as of the eye; and therefore if <hi>Virgil</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94923:4"/>
muſt needs ſpeak Engliſh, it were fit he ſhould ſpeak not onely as a man of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as a man of this age; and if this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe I have put upon him (I wiſh I could give it a better name) ſit not naturally and eaſily on ſo grave a perſon, yet it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him better then that Fools-Coat where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the French and Italian have of late pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him; at leaſt, I hope, it will not make him appear deformed, by making any part enormouſly bigger or leſs then the life, (I having made it my principal care to follow him, as he made it his to follow Nature in all his proportions) Neither have I any where offered ſuch violence to his ſenſe, as to make it ſeem mine, and not his. Where my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are not ſo full as his, either our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, or my Art were defective (but I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuſpect my ſelf;) but where mine are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler then his, they are but the impreſſions which the often reading of him, hath left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my thoughts; ſo that if they are not his own conceptions, they are at leaſt the reſults of them; and if (being conſcious of making him ſpeak worſe then he did almoſt in every
<pb facs="tcp:94923:4"/>
line) I erre in endeavoring ſometimes to make him ſpeak better; I hope it will be judged an error on the right hand, and ſuch an one as may deſerve pardon, if not imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

To Pitty, This Complaint our former Rage,</l>
               <l>Converts, we now enquire his Parentage,</l>
               <l>What of their Councels, or affairs he knew,</l>
               <l>Then fearleſs', he replies, Great King to you</l>
               <l>All truth I ſhall relate: Nor firſt can I</l>
               <l>My ſelf to be of <hi>Grecian</hi> Birth deny,</l>

               <l>You may by chance have heard the famous name</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Palimede,</hi> who from old <hi>Belus</hi> came,</l>
               <l>Whom, but for voting Peace, The Greeks purſue,</l>
               <l>Accus'd unjuſtly, then unjuſtly ſlew,</l>
               <l>Yet mourn'd his death. My Father was his friend,</l>
               <l>And Me to his commands did recommend,</l>
               <l>While Laws and Councels did his Throne ſupport,</l>
               <l>I but a youth, yet ſome Eſteem and Port</l>

               <l>And then the Prophet to his party drew.</l>

               <l>Not for their Fate, but to provoke his owne,</l>
               <l>There ſtood an Altar open to the view</l>
               <l>Of Heaven, neer which an aged Lawrel grew,</l>
               <l>Whoſe ſhady arms the houſhold Gods embrac'd,</l>
               <l>Before whoſe feet the Queen her ſelf had caſt</l>
               <l>With all her daughters, and the Trojan wives,</l>
               <l>As Doves whom an approaching tempeſt drives</l>
               <l>And frights into one flock; But having ſpy'd</l>
               <l>Old <hi>Priam</hi> clad in youthful Arms, ſhe cry'd,</l>
               <l>Alas my wretched husband, what pretence</l>
               <l>To bear thoſe Arms, and in them what defence?</l>
               <l>Such aid ſuch times require not, when again</l>
               <l>If <hi>Hector</hi> were alive, he liv'd in vain;</l>
               <l>Or here We ſhall a Sanctuary find,</l>
               <l>Or as in life, we ſhall in death be joyn'd.</l>

Then weeping, with kinde force held and embrac'd,</l>
               <l>And on the ſacred ſeat the King ſhe plac'd;</l>
               <l>Mean while <hi>Polites</hi> one of <hi>Priams</hi> ſons</l>
               <l>Flying the rage of bloody <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> runs</l>

               <l>The King (though him ſo many deaths incloſe)</l>
               <l>Nor fear nor grief, but Indignation ſhows,</l>
               <l>The Gods requite thee (if within the care</l>

Then <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> go a meſſenger to Hell</l>
