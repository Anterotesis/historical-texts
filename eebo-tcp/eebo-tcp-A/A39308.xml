            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DISSWASIVE FROM Persecution, &amp;c,</head>
            <p>PERSECUTION is a Word of so harsh a sound, and so generally <hi>distasteful</hi> to <hi>English Ears,</hi> that scarce any of those who are most forward and active in that Work, are willing to have their actions called by that Name. That none there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who have set an hand to that Work, or whose minds are any whit inclining thereunto, may, from the dislike they have to the Word <hi>[Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution]</hi> reject this <hi>Diswasive</hi> as a thing wherein they are not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I think it needful here to declare what it is I mean by <hi>Persecution.</hi> By <hi>Persecution,</hi> then I intend <hi>a forcing or compelling any by pains or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, Bodily or Pecuniary, to relinquish or forsake that Exercise of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or way of Worship, which they believe to be the right Way of Worship, and the true and acceptable Exercise of Religion, which God hath required of them: And to receive, embrace, conform to and perform some other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Religion, and way of Worship, which they, who are so compelled, are either firmly perswaded is not the Right, or at least have no belief that it is the Right.</hi> This (in short) is that which I call <hi>Persecution:</hi> And this is that I diswade from, whatever other Name the Actors of it may please themselves in calling it by.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41589:3"/>
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>To begin now with the first of these, <hi>viz. the forcing or compelling any to forsake and leave that exercise of Religion, or way of Worship, which they believe to be the right way of Worship, and the true exercise of Religion, which God requireth of them:</hi> The Reasons by which I shall endeavour to diswade all men from such an undertaking, are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You may, for ought you know, be found <hi>Fighters against God:</hi> You are not, you cannot be, upon your own principles, infallibly sure, that that way of Worship, which you thus endeavour to force us from, is not the <hi>true</hi> Worship of God. We know it is so? you do not know it is not so. If in the end it prove to be so, how sad will your condition be, who have thus bent your force to hinder the true Worship of God, and set your selves to restrain us from performing that, which God hath required of us! I pray consider, <hi>Saul</hi> was as confident, as you can be; and had as good ground for his confidence, as you can have: and thereupon he went smartly on for a while (as some of you have done) making <hi>Havock of the Church, entring into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very House, and haling Men and Women, committed them to Prison,</hi> Acts 8. 3. <hi>I Persecuted,</hi> saies he <hi>this way unto the Death, binding and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into Prisons, both Men and Women,</hi> Chap. 22. 4. <hi>Many of the Saints did</hi> he <hi>shut up in Prison, and when they were put to Death,</hi> he <hi>gave his voice against them,</hi> Chap. 26. 10. He <hi>punisht them oft in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Synagogue, and compelled them to Blaspheme: And being exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mad against them, he Persecuted them even unto strange Cities,</hi> vers. 11. And this he <hi>verily thought with himself that he ought to do,</hi> vers. 9. Yet all this while he was out of his Thoughts; for in all this he was <hi>wrong,</hi> and they were <hi>right</hi> whom he thus Persecuted. And may it not be so with you? why then will you run so great an hazard.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By endeavouring to <hi>force</hi> us from that way of worship, which we believe the Lord hath led us into and requireth of us, you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to force us to <hi>make Shipwrack of Faith.</hi> We have solemnly and sincerly declared unto you, that we firmly believe, and are fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and satisfied in our Consciences, that God hath led us into this way of Worship wherein we serve him, and that he requireth our perseverance therein. This is our Faith in this particular. Now so far as you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by <hi>Threats,</hi> by <hi>Terrors,</hi> by <hi>Penalties</hi> and <hi>Cruelties</hi> to force any of us from this way of Worship: so far you endeavour to force us <hi>to make Shipwrack of Faith, and of good Conscience too:</hi> which if through your means any should do, <hi>the Guilt thereof will lie heavy upon you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41589:3"/>
3. In endeavouring by <hi>force</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> to restrain us from worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, according as (we are fully perswaded) he hath taught us and doth require us, you go out of the Path of the Righteous, and tread in the steps of the Wicked and Ungodly. It was the <hi>Egyptians</hi> that dealt thus with the <hi>Israelites;</hi> not the <hi>Israelites</hi> that dealt so with the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> as you may read from the <hi>7th.</hi> Chap. of <hi>Exodus</hi> to the 15. It was the Heathen (who knew not God) that dealt thus with <hi>Daniel;</hi> not <hi>Daniel</hi> that dealt so with them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. It was the hard hearted, unbelieving Jews and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Gentiles, that dealt thus with the Apostles and Primitive Christians; not the Christians that dealt so with them, <hi>Acts.</hi> 4. 17, 18. &amp; 5. 28. &amp; 14. 2. &amp; 17. 5. It was the <hi>Blood-thirsty Papists</hi> that dealt thus with the <hi>Protestants</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Daies. And can you bring a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Odium</hi> upon your selves, than, by imitating these, to make Folks think you approve what they have done?</p>
               <p n="4">4. That Exercise of Religion which you would force us from, is not simply and of it self condemned or disallowed by that Law, by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of which you would force us from it. It is not simply and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>every</hi> Assembly or Meeting for the exercise of Religion in other manner than according to the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> &amp;c. that is forbidden and made punishable, by that Act of the 22th. of <hi>Charles</hi> the second against Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles; but such only as hath at it above four persons besides the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Any Family then, (how numerous soever) and four persons o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above, may meet, under the favour of that Act, for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Religion, though in other manner than according to the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> &amp;c. which plainly shews that the Law-makers did not look upon such exercise of Religion to be evil simply in it self; (for then they would have utterly condemned and forbidden it to all, even the least numbers) but that they presupposed a danger from the numbers resorting to such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies; and therefore did <hi>not absolutely forbid the exercise,</hi> but laid a <hi>limitation</hi> upon the number of persons that might resort thereunto. Now the permitting this Exercise to any, is an admitting of it to be good: and the offence lies not in the Exercise it self, but in the numbers resorting to it; and that only so far as they may be thought dangerous to the publick Peace. Since therefore the Exercise of Religion which ye would drive us from, is so far from being in it self evil or unlawful, that it receives some kind of Countenance even from that very Law by which ye pretend to act. Since also the experience ye have had of our <hi>peaceable</hi> deportment in our Meetings, and of our quiet, and chearful subjection to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment we have lived under, hath sufficiently secured you from all danger from our Meetings, how numerous soever: Why will you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41589:4"/>
molest, trouble, imprison, impoverish and ruin your <hi>Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> your <hi>Neighbours,</hi> your <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> your <hi>Fellow-citizens</hi> and <hi>Townsmen,</hi> your <hi>Correspondents,</hi> your <hi>Relations,</hi> your <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Fellow-Protestants,</hi> for that which is not <hi>Evil</hi> nor <hi>unlawful</hi> in it self, nor <hi>hurtful</hi> to you nor to any!</p>
               <p n="5">5. In thus eagerly pursuing us, and disturbing our <hi>peaceable</hi> Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, you give your selves, as well as us, a great deal of needless trouble. For, as that learned Doctor in the Jewish Law did well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, in the Apostles Case, <hi>If this Counsel or this work be of Men, it will come to nought. But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it,</hi> Acts 5. 38, 39. So say I to you in our Case (And I wish some one of your own, that were <hi>had,</hi> like him, <hi>in reputation among all the People,</hi> would have done this for me) <hi>If this People and their Meetings be not of God, you need not thus bestir you, you may spare your pains; they'll come to nought; But if they be of God, ye cannot overthrow them.</hi> So that whether we be of God, or be not of God, your labour against us is in vain. Either we shall fall without it, or stand for all it. Be entreated therefore, for your own sakes, as well as for ours, to take <hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s Counsel, <hi>Refrain from these men and let them alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. And lastly, Be pleased to consider what sort of <hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> you are fain to make use of (and not seldom are your selves made use of by) to carry on this work. Are not the <hi>vilest</hi> wretches, the most <hi>profligate</hi> of mankind, for the most part, the first movers in it?

               <head>II.</head>
               <p>Now for the other Branch, which I mentioned, of <hi>Persecution, viz. The Forcing or compelling of any by Pains or Penalties, bodily or pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, to receive, embrace, conform to and perform some Exercise of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and way of worship, which they, who are so compelled, are either firmly perswaded is not the right, or at least have no belief that it is the right.</hi> The Reasons by which I shall endeavour to diswade all men from such an undertaking, are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In thus <hi>imposing</hi> your way of Worship upon others, you act <hi>quite contrary</hi> to Christ and his Apostles. The Author of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, though he had all power in Heaven and in Earth, given unto him, yet did not make use of that power, as you do of your Power, by outward severities and rigour to force People to receive, and profess the Religion which he taught. But his usual saving was, <hi>He that hath Ears to hear let him hear.</hi> And when two of his Disciples, in their young state, and in an overwarm zeal against some that did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, did once ask him leave <hi>to command Fire to come down from Heaven and consume them;</hi> he sharply rebuk'd them with a <hi>[Ye know not that manner of spirit ye are of:]</hi> and instructing them better, told them, <hi>The Son of Man is not come to destroy mens lives, but to save them.</hi> and instead of thrusting himself upon those <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that were not willing to receive him, he passed them by, <hi>and went to another Village,</hi> Luke 9. 53. <hi>to</hi> 57. The Apostles, when the <hi>Iews</hi> rejected their Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, did not attempt to impose it on them; but said, seeing you put from you,â€”lo, <hi>we turn to the Gentiles, Asts</hi> 13. 46. You read that Christ whipt some out of the Temple, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 15. but ye never read that he whipt any in. Why then will you steer a Course so <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary</hi> to Christ and his Apostles?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:41589:5"/>
2. In this imposing your way of Worship upon others, you follow the worst of Patterns. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> a Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, Cruel and Heathenish Prince, whom God in an extraordinary manner did punish; whose Heart was chang'd from Mans, and a <hi>Beasts Heart</hi> given unto him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. The <hi>Beast</hi> which <hi>Iohn</hi> saw coming up out of the Earth, that <hi>spake as a Dragon, Rev.</hi> 13. 11. Both these imposed their Worship upon others, and that under the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Penalties. But can you think it either honourable or safe for you to imitate such Bruitish Examples!</p>
               <p n="3">3. Inforcing People to your way of Worship, who have no beleif that it is the Right you cause them to sin: for <hi>whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin, Rom.</hi> 14 23. And therefore as the Apostles there argues, <hi>He that doubteth, is damned,</hi> (that is condemned) <hi>if he eat.</hi> And is not the Argument as forcible in this Case, as in that of Eating? May it not with like reason be said, he that doubteth that your way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is not right, is damned if he conform to it, because his Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is not of Faith; for whatsoever is not of Faith is sin. And the <hi>Wages of Sin ye know is Death, Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Now if they that conform in such a doubting mind do therein sin, and thereby bring Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (that is Condemnation) upon themselves; what may you expect, who by Threatnings, by Imprisonments, by Fines, or other outward Penalties, do drive them thereunto!</p>
               <p n="4">4. Enforcing People to your way of Worship, who have a firm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion and belief that it is not the right; you make Men <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Timeservers:</hi> For such as have not fortitude enough to bear the storm of Persecution, and to undergo with patience the various Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties inflicted on them; such, through fear, may fall into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and perhaps, for Self-security, may comply with that, which they certainly believe is not right. And herein they sin against their knowledg, and you are the Cause of this Sin of theirs, by dr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them unto it; and at your hands will it be required.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By obtruding and forcing your Religion upon others, you great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disparage and undervalue it, and give Men the more ground to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and dislike it: for Men are naturally apt to question the goodnes of that Commodity, which is put upon them whether they will or not. Those Wares that are true and good need no such waies to put them off. The Christian Religion, in its purest and best Estate, was never thrust upon any; nor need it. To be without it is punishment sufi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; and greater than any you can inflict: They who in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble were invited to the great Supper, <hi>Luke,</hi> 14. and made their Exc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41589:5"/>
and did not come, were not <hi>fetcht in with a Capias,</hi> nor <hi>Fined and Imprisoned till they would come;</hi> but were utterly shut out and debarred from coming: <hi>[I say unto you, that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my, Supper</hi> ver. 24.] That was their punishment, and a grievous one too. The Apostles of our Lord (as one of them declares, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2.) having received the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestry of the Gospel, and <hi>renounced the hidden things of Dishonesty,</hi> did not walk <hi>in Craftiness</hi> (and I am sure I may safely add, They did not walk in <hi>Cruelty) nor handled the Word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the Truth commended themselves to every Man's Conscience in the sight of God.</hi> Now I pray consider; if you are preswaded, that that Exercise of Religion which you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form is the right, That that way of Worship which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess is the true, were it not fairer and more becoming those pretences, for you, as many of you as are Preachers, by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as many as are Hearers by a pious Life and Godly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, to commend your selves (as did the Apostles) by manifestation of the Truth to every Man's Conscience in the sight of God; than to manifest your Indignation and Envy towards those that are not of your Perswasion, by committing them to Goal, rifling their Houses, tearing away their Goods, ruining their Estates, and beggering their Children?</p>
               <p n="6">6. You break that great Command, which Christ saies is the <hi>Law and the Prophets,</hi> viz. <hi>All things whatsoever ye would that Men should do to you, do ye even so to them, Mat.</hi> 7. 12. This Command ye transgress, in endeavouring to force others to your way of Worship: for ye would not be so dealt with your selves. Consider this well I entreat you. If you were to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by <hi>Imprisonment, Banishment, Fines, Confiscations,</hi> or any other extream and rigorous Proceedings, to conform your selves to that way of Worship, and Exercise of Religion which we profess, or any others whom ye now present: Would you not think it extream hard, and very unjust? no doubt ye would, and so ye justly might. But then withal consider, that your imposing thus on others, is <hi>no less hard</hi> to them, <hi>no less unjust</hi> in you.</p>
               <p>Ye have known us long, ye have had large experience of us; ye have tried us many waies, and proved us after divers manners. <hi>And what evil can ye convict us of to this Day?</hi> Have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41589:6"/>
we not alwaies been a <hi>quiet, peaceable, harmless</hi> People? when being reviled did we revile? or when being persecuted did we not patiently suffer it? Ah what do you propose to your selves? Do ye think to root us out and destroy God's Heritage? It is impossible: The <hi>Root of Iesse bears us,</hi> and upon the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable <hi>Rock</hi> are we immoveably built. <hi>O dash not your selves against it!</hi> But if ye could destroy or ruine Persons, yet is it possible that there can lodg in English Breasts such <hi>more-than Barbarous Inhumanity,</hi> to destroy so many thousand Families! The <hi>Rome-Rid French</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> have gone far that way; but English Hands were never so <hi>defiled:</hi> God grant they never may. Do ye think by rigorous and cruel usage to fright us out of our Religion, and force us to desert our Principles? How can ye hope to accomplish such a thing, who have seen our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved Constancy, and stedfast Perseverance therein, under all the Sufferings that have hitherto been inflicted on us? Have not many of us been already stript of all their outward Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance? not a Bed being left them to lie on, not a Stool to sit on, not a Dish to eat in. Is there a Prison in the Nation, or a Dungeon in a Prison, which has not been a Witness of our <hi>Groanings?</hi> Have we not been tried by <hi>Banishment,</hi> and proved by <hi>Death</hi> it self? Death in <hi>New-England,</hi> by the Hand of the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Death in Old <hi>England,</hi> by the rough hands of rude and boisterous Officers and Soldiers, who have given divers of our Friends those Blows, which in few Daies have brought them to their Graves. I might add to these, burning in the Forehead, cutting off Ears, unmerciful Beatings, Whippings, and cruel Scourgings. But did any, or all, of these deter us from the Worship of our God? Nay, hath not our chearful undergoing all these Hardships, sufficiently evidenced to the World, that our Religion and Consciences are dearer to us; than our Estates, our Liberties, our Limbs or our Lives? Why then will you repeat severities upon us, which have so often been tried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in vain? Can you take pleasure in putting others to pain, and delight your selves in afflicting others? O suffer not your Natures so far too degenerate from the Gentleness and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of true and generous English-Men!</p>
               <p>And think not the worse of us for our Faithfulness to our God! <hi>He that is true to God, will be true to Men also;</hi> But he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41589:6"/>
that is false and treacherous to God, how is it likely he should be true to Men? Endeavour not therefore to draw us into Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness to our God: for that, to be sure, would be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us, and no way advantageous to you. Neither be ye exasperated against us, from the difficulty you find in breaking our Meetings, or because that when you have dragg'd us out of our Meetings, and Fined or Imprisoned us for being there, you find us there again: But rather take it for an Argument, that we sincerely love and believe our Religion; and that we find our Meetings worth suffering for. For indeed, in our Meettings we do meet with the Lord our God, <hi>in whose Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is fulness of Ioy,</hi> Psal. 16. 11: <hi>The Law of whose Mouth is better unto us than thousands of Gold and of Silver,</hi> Psal. 119. 72. <hi>Yea, his Loving Kindness is better than Life,</hi> Psal. 63. 3. <hi>The God of Israel, is He that giveth Strength and Power to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Blessed be God,</hi> Psal. 68. 35. Therefore harden not your selves against us, I beseech you, by miscalling our <hi>Constancy, Obstinacy;</hi> our <hi>Stedfastness, Stubbornness;</hi> our <hi>Zeal, Self-will;</hi> our <hi>Faithfulness</hi> to God, <hi>Contempt</hi> of Authority: But look back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apostles of our Lord, and see if they did not just as we do. <hi>They were taken at a Meeting</hi> in Solomon's Porch, <hi>Acts.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>and sent to Prison for Preaching,</hi> Chap. 4. 2. 3. Next Day they were brought forth and Examined before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, ver. 5, 7. And having made their Defence, they were streightly, threatned, and <hi>commanded not to speak at all, nor teach in the Name Iesus,</hi> ver 17. 18. what Answer did they make? <hi>Whether it be right</hi> (said they) <hi>in the sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judg ye,</hi> ver. 19. and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after we read, <hi>They spake the Word of God with Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> ver. 31. Well, they were quickly clapt up again, Chap. 5. 17. 18. But when the Council came together, and sent for them to be brought before them, and they were not to be found in the Prison, ver. 21. 22. (God having by his Angel delivered them in the Night, ver. 19.) one came and told the Council, <hi>Behold, The Men whom ye put in Prison, are standing in the Temple and Teaching the People,</hi> ver 25. And when they had sent Officers, and fetcht them again before the Council, and asked them, saying, <hi>Did we not straitly command you, that you should not teach in this Name? And behold ye</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41589:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>have filled Ierusalem with your Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 28. Their Answer was, <hi>We ought to obey God rather than Men,</hi> ver. 29. Do you think the Council did not take this for a disrespect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and provoking Answer? Do ye think the Jews did not count the Apostles a <hi>stubborn, obstinate, self-willed</hi> People, that did this in despight of Authority? yet you, in words, condemn the Jews and their Council, and justifie the Apostles in their thus acting; and therein you do well. O let not your <hi>Actions</hi> condemn what your <hi>Words</hi> justifie, nor justifie what your <hi>Words</hi> condemn! For if you persecute us for the same things. which the Apostles both did, and were persecuted for doing; ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in at once both condemn the Apostles, and justifie those that persecuted them. And as they brought the <hi>Guilt of Innocent Bloud,</hi> and thereby the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> upon themselves: even so will ye also upon your selves, if ye persist in the same Course. Which that ye may not do, is (for your own sakes as well as for ours) my earnest Desire, and the End of this <hi>Diswasive.</hi>
