         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That in this ſtate of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
he gave great and clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his Divinity; whilſt he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

there were great and glorious Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
given of him that he was the

a manner as no Creature can be ſaid
to be: <hi>And we beheld his glory, the
glory as of the only begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the <hi>Firſt</hi> of
theſe, his Incarnation; as moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for this Solemn Time, which
hath for many Ages been ſet apart
for the commemoration of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103163:4"/>
and Incarnation of our B. <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:
The Word was made fleſh,</hi> that is,
he who is perſonally called the <hi>Word,</hi>
and whom the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> had
ſo fully deſcribed in the beginning of
this <hi>Goſpel,</hi> he became fleſh, that is,
aſſumed our Nature and became
Man; for ſo the word <hi>fleſh</hi> is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
uſed in Scripture for <hi>Man</hi> or
human nature: <hi>O thou that heareſt
prayer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 65. 2.</note> 
               <hi>unto thee ſhall all fleſh come,</hi> that
is, to thee ſhall <hi>all men</hi> addreſs their
Supplications:<note place="margin">Iſa. 40. 5, 6.</note> again, <hi>The glory of the
Lord ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſhall
ſee it together,</hi> that is, <hi>all men</hi> ſhall
behold and acknowledge it; and
then it follows, <hi>all fleſh is graſs,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the frailty and mortality of
<hi>man:</hi> And ſo likewiſe in the <hi>new
Teſtament,</hi> our B. <hi>Saviour</hi> foretelling
the miſery that was coming upon the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation,<note place="margin">Matt. 24. 22.</note> ſays, <hi>Except thoſe days
ſhould be ſhortned no fleſh ſhould be ſaved,</hi>
that is, <hi>no man</hi> ſhould eſcape and
ſurvive that great calamity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
which was coming upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103163:5"/>
them:<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>By the works of the Law,</hi> ſays
the <hi>Apoſtle, ſhall no fleſh,</hi> that is, no
man <hi>be juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that by the <hi>Word</hi>'s being <hi>made</hi>
or becoming <hi>fleſh</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> did
not intend that he aſſumed only a
human Body without a Soul, and
was united only to a human Body,
which was the Hereſie of <hi>Apollinaris</hi>
and his Followers, but that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>Man,</hi> that is, aſſumed the
whole human Nature, Body and
Soul. And it is likewiſe very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> did purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chuſe the word <hi>fleſh,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the frail and mortal part of Man,
to denote to us that the Son of God
did aſſume our Nature with all its
infirmities, and became ſubject to
the common frailty and mortality of
human Nature.</p>
            <p>The words thus explain'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that <hi>great Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> as
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls it, or of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Incarnation of the
Son of God, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103163:5"/>
by the appearance or manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God in the fleſh,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>And without
controverſie great is the myſtery of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
God was manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi>
that is, he appeared in human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he became man; or, as St. <hi>John</hi>
expreſſeth it in the Text, <hi>The Word
was made fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the more clear and full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of theſe words, we will
conſider theſe two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Perſon that is here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, and who is ſaid to be incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
or to be <hi>made fleſh,</hi> namely <hi>the
Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Myſtery it ſelf, or
the nature of this Incarnation, ſo far
as the Scripture hath revealed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
it to us.</p>
            <p>I.<note place="margin">I.</note> We will conſider the Perſon
that is here ſpoken of, and who is
ſaid to be incarnate or to be <hi>made fleſh,</hi>
and who is ſo frequently in this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
called by the Name or Title of <hi>the
Word;</hi> namely the eternal and only
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103163:6"/>
begotten Son of God; for ſo we find
him deſcribed in the Text, <hi>The Word
was made fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us;
and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the
only begotten of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. that is,
ſuch as became ſo great and glorious
a Perſon as deſerves the Title of <hi>the
only begotten Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the explaining of this Name
or Title of the <hi>Word</hi> given by St. <hi>John</hi>
to our B. <hi>Saviour,</hi> we will conſider
theſe two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The reaſon of this Name or
Title of the <hi>Word,</hi> and what proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
might be the Occaſion why this
<hi>Evangeliſt</hi> inſiſts ſo much upon it, and
makes ſo frequent mention of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Deſcription it ſelf,
which is given of him under this
Name or Title of the <hi>Word</hi> by this
<hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> in his entrance into his
Hiſtory of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I. We will enquire into the
reaſon of this Name or Title of
the <hi>Word,</hi> which is here given to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103163:6"/>
our B. <hi>Saviour</hi> by this <hi>Evangeliſt:</hi> And
what might probably be the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
why he inſiſts ſo much upon it and
makes ſo frequent mention of it. I
ſhall conſider theſe two things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
and ſeverally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, The reaſon of this Name or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the</hi> Word, <hi>here given by the</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt
<hi>to our</hi> B. Saviour. And he
ſeems to have done it in compliance
with the common way of ſpeaking
among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who frequently call
the <hi>Meſſias</hi> by the Name of <hi>the Word
of the Lord;</hi> of which I might give
many inſtances: But there is one ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
remarkable, in the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
which renders thoſe words of
the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to be ſpoken of the <hi>Meſſias, viz.
The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou on
my right hand,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay it renders
them thus, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto his</hi> Word,
<hi>ſit thou on my right hand, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo
likewiſe <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> calls him <hi>by
whom God made the World, the Word of
God,</hi> and <hi>the Son of God.</hi> And <hi>Plato</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103163:7"/>
probably had the ſame Notion from
the <hi>Jews,</hi> which made <hi>Amelius</hi> the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſt,</hi>
when he read the beginning of
<hi>St. John</hi>'s Goſpel, to ſay, <hi>this</hi> Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
<hi>agrees with Plato, ranking the</hi> Word
<hi>in the order of Principles;</hi> meaning
that he made the <hi>Word</hi> the <hi>Principle</hi> or
efficient Cauſe of the World, as <hi>Plato</hi>
alſo hath done.</p>
            <p>And this Title of the <hi>Word</hi> was ſo
famouſly known to be given to the
<hi>Meſſias,</hi> that even the Enemies of
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> took notice of it. <hi>Julian</hi>
the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> calls <hi>Chriſt</hi> by this Name:
And <hi>Mahomet</hi> in his <hi>Alchoran</hi> gives this
Name of the <hi>Word</hi> to <hi>Jeſus the Son of
Mary.</hi> But <hi>St. John</hi> had probably no
reference to <hi>Plato</hi> any otherwiſe than
as the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> againſt whom he
wrote, made uſe of ſeveral of <hi>Plato</hi>'s
words and notions. So that in all
probability <hi>St. John</hi> gives our <hi>B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
this Title with regard to the
<hi>Jews</hi> more eſpecially, who anciently
call'd the <hi>Meſſias</hi> by this Name.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103163:7"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We will in the next place
conſider, <hi>What might probably be the
Occaſion why this</hi> Evangeliſt <hi>makes ſo
frequent mention of this Title of the</hi> Word,
<hi>and inſiſts ſo much upon it.</hi> And it
ſeems to be this: Nay, I think that
hardly any doubt can be made of it,
ſince the moſt ancient of the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
who lived neareſt the time of St. <hi>John,</hi>
do confirm it to us.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>John,</hi> who ſurvived all the
Apoſtles, liv'd to ſee thoſe <hi>Hereſies</hi>
which ſprang up in the beginnings of
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> during the lives of the
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> grown up to a great height,
to the great prejudice and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion: I
mean the Hereſies of <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi>
and the ſeveral <hi>Sects</hi> of the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi>
which began from <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
and were continued and carried on
by <hi>Valentinus</hi> and <hi>Baſilides, Carpocrates</hi>
and <hi>Menander:</hi> Some of which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
denied the Divinity of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
aſſerting him to have been a
mere man, and to have had no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103163:8"/>
of exiſtence before he was born
of the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
tells us particularly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Ebion:</hi> Which thoſe who hold
the ſame Opinion now in our days
may do well to conſider from whence
it had its Original.</p>
            <p>Others of them, I ſtill mean the
<hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> had corrupted the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine by
mingling with it the fancies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
of the <hi>Jewiſh Cabbaliſts,</hi> and of
the <hi>Schools</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi>
and of the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Philoſophy more
ancient than either; as may be ſeen
in <hi>Euſebius de Preparat. Evan.;</hi> and by
jumbling all theſe together they had
framed a confuſed <hi>Genealogy</hi> of <hi>Deities,</hi>
which they called by ſeveral glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Names, and all of them by
the general Name of <hi>Eons</hi> or
<hi>Ages:</hi> Among which they reckon'd

               </gap>,
that is, the <hi>Life,</hi> and the <hi>Word,</hi> and
the <hi>only begotten,</hi> and the <hi>Fulneſs,</hi> and
many other Divine <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:103163:8"/>
which they fancied to be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
derived from one another.</p>
            <p>And they alſo diſtinguiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Maker of the World</hi> whom
they called the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>New:</hi> And
between <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Chriſt: Jeſus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Doctrine of <hi>Cerinthus,</hi>
as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us, being the man
that was born of the Virgin, and <hi>Chriſt</hi>
or the <hi>Meſſias</hi> being that <hi>Divine Power</hi>
or <hi>Spirit</hi> which afterwards deſcended
into <hi>Jeſus</hi> and dwelt in him.</p>
            <p>If it were poſſible, yet it would
be to no purpoſe, to go about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
theſe wild conceits with one
another; and to find out for what
reaſon they were invented, unleſs it
were to amuſe the People with theſe
<hi>high ſwelling words of vanity</hi> and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>knowledg falſly ſo called,</hi> as
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks in alluſion to the
Name of <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>the
Men of knowledge,</hi> which they proudly
aſſum'd to themſelves, as if the
knowledge of Myſteries of a more
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103163:9"/>
ſublime nature did peculiarly belong
to them.</p>
            <p>In oppoſition to all theſe vain and
groundleſs conceits, St. <hi>John</hi> in the
beginning of his <hi>Goſpel</hi> chuſes to ſpeak
of our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi> the Hiſtory of
whoſe life and death he was going
to write, by the Name or Title of
the <hi>Word,</hi> a <hi>term</hi> very famous among
thoſe <hi>Sects:</hi> And ſhews that this
<hi>Word of God,</hi> which was alſo the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
the <hi>Jews</hi> anciently gave to the
<hi>Meſſias,</hi> did exiſt before he aſſumed
a human Nature, and even form all
Eternity: And that to this eternal
<hi>Word</hi> did truly belong all thoſe Titles
which they kept ſuch a canting ſtir
about, and which they did with ſo
much ſenſeleſs nicety and ſubtilty
diſtinguiſh from one another, as if
they had been ſo many ſeveral <hi>Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
from the <hi>Deity:</hi> And he ſhews
that this <hi>Word of God,</hi> was really and
truly the <hi>Life,</hi> and the <hi>Light,</hi> and
the <hi>Fulneſs,</hi> and the <hi>only begotten of
the Father;</hi> v. 5. <hi>In him was the</hi> Life,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103163:9"/>
               <hi>and the</hi> Life <hi>was the</hi> Light of men;
and v. 6. <hi>And the</hi> Light <hi>ſhineth in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the darkneſs comprehended it
not:</hi> and v. 7, 8, 9. where the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt</hi>
ſpeaking of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſays
of him, that <hi>he came for a witneſs, to
bear witneſs of the</hi> Light; and that
<hi>he was not that</hi> Light, <hi>but was ſent to
bear witneſs of that</hi> Light: <hi>And that</hi>
Light <hi>was the true</hi> Light <hi>which coming
into the World enlightens every man:</hi> And
v. 14. <hi>And we beheld his glory, the glory
as of the</hi> only begotten of the Father,
full <hi>of grace and truth:</hi> And v. 16.
<hi>And of his</hi> fulneſs <hi>we all receive,</hi> &amp;c.
You ſee here is a perpetual Alluſion
to the glorious Titles which they
gave to their <hi>Aeons</hi> as if they had been
ſo many ſeveral <hi>Deities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſhews that
all this fanciful <hi>Genealogy</hi> of <hi>Divine
Emanations,</hi> with which the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi>
made ſo great a noiſe, was mere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and imagination; and that all
theſe glorious Titles did really meet
in the <hi>Meſſias</hi> who is the <hi>Word,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103163:10"/>
who before his Incarnation was from
all eternity with <hi>God,</hi> partaker of his
Divine Nature and Glory.</p>
            <p>I have declared this the more fully
and particularly, becauſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it ſeems to me to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true Key to the interpretation of
this Diſcourſe of St. <hi>John</hi> concerning
our <hi>Saviour</hi> under the Name and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the <hi>Word.</hi> And ſurely it is a
quite wrong way for any man to go
about by the mere ſtrength and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
of his Reaſon and Wit, though
never ſo great, to interpret an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Book, without underſtanding
and conſidering the Hiſtorical occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of it, which is the only thing
that can give true light to it.</p>
            <p>And this was the great and fatal
miſtake of <hi>Socinus,</hi> to go to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
Scripture merely by Criticiſing
upon words, and ſearching into all
the ſenſes that they are poſſibly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of, till he can find one, though
never ſo forc'd and foreign, that will
ſave harmleſs the Opinion, which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103163:10"/>
he was before-hand reſolved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
even againſt the moſt natural
and obvious ſenſe of the Text which
he undertakes to interpret: Juſt as if
a man ſhould interpret ancient <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi>
and <hi>Records</hi> by mere Critical
skill in words without regard to the
true Occaſion upon which they were
made, and without any manner of
knowledge and inſight into the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of the Age in which they were
written.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now proceed to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

namely,</p>
            <p>II. <hi>The Deſcription here given of the</hi>
Word <hi>by this</hi> Evangeliſt <hi>in his entrance
into his Hiſtory of the Goſpel. In the
beginning,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was the</hi> Word,
<hi>and the</hi> Word <hi>was with God, and the</hi>
Word <hi>was God: The ſame was in the

               </gap> 
               <hi>without time,</hi> that is, before

did exiſt before any thing was made;
and conſequently is without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

and <hi>before the foundation of the World,</hi>
as alſo in ſeveral places of the <hi>New

               </gap> 
               <hi>with God:</hi>
And ſo the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> often called
the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the <hi>Word which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord,</hi> that is, with him, or
in his preſence: In like manner the
<hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſays here that the <hi>Word was
with God,</hi> that is, it was always to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with him, partaking of his
Happineſs and Glory: To which
our <hi>Saviour</hi> refers in his Prayer,<note place="margin">John 17. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Glorify
me with thine own ſelf with the glory

oppoſeth to his <hi>appearing</hi> and <hi>being
manifeſted</hi> to the World, <hi>v. 10. He
was in the World, and the World was made
by him, and the World knew him not,</hi>
that is, he who from all eternity
<hi>was with God,</hi> appeared in the World,
and when he did ſo, though he had
made the World yet the World
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103163:12"/>
would not own him. And this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
between his <hi>being with God</hi>
and his <hi>being manifeſted</hi> in the World,
the ſame St. <hi>John</hi> mentions elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,<note place="margin">1 John 1, 2.</note>

was God before the World,</hi> that is, from
all Eternity: But then the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi>
adds by way of Explication, <hi>the ſame
was in the beginning with God,</hi> that is,
though the <hi>Word</hi> was truly and really
God, yet he was not <hi>God the Father,</hi>
who is the Fountain of the Deity,
but an Emanation from him, the

And to the ſame purpoſe St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

ſpeaking of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> calls him <hi>the Image
of the inviſible God, the firſt-born of every
Creature,</hi> that is, born before any
thing was created, as does evidently
follow from the reaſon given in the
next words why he call'd him <hi>the
firſt-born of every Creature, for by him
were all things created that are in Heaven
and in Earth, viſible and inviſible; all
things were created by him and for him, and
he is before all things, and by him all
things ſubſiſt:</hi> From whence it is plain
that by his being <hi>the firſt-born of every
Creature</hi> thus much at leaſt is to be
underſtood, that he was before all
Creatures, and therefore he himſelf
cannot be a Creature, unleſs he could
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103163:14"/>
be before himſelf: Nay the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
ſays it expreſly in this very Text in
which he is called the <hi>firſt-born of every
Creature,</hi> or <hi>of the whole Creation,</hi> that
<hi>he is before all things,</hi> that is, he had a
Being before there was any created
Being, he was before all Creatures
both in Duration and in Dignity;
for ſo muſt he of neceſſity be, if <hi>all
things were made by him;</hi> for as the
Maker is always before the thing
which is made, ſo is he alſo better
and of greater Dignity.</p>
            <p>And yet I muſt acknowledge that
there ſeems to be no ſmall difficulty
in the Interpretation I have given of
this expreſſion in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid
by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to be <hi>the firſt-born of every
Creature,</hi> or of the whole Creation;
becauſe in ſtrictneſs of ſpeech the
<hi>firſt-born</hi> is of the ſame Nature with
thoſe in reſpect of whom he is ſaid
to be the <hi>firſt-born:</hi> And if ſo, then
he muſt be a Creature as well as thoſe
in reſpect of whom he is ſaid to be
the <hi>firſt-born:</hi> This is the Objection
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103163:14"/>
in its full ſtrength, and I do own it
to have a very plauſible appearance:
And yet I hope before I have done to
ſatisfy any one that will conſider
things impartially and without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
and will duly attend to the
ſcope of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s reaſoning in
this <hi>Text</hi> and compare it with other
parallel places of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi>
that it neither is, nor can be the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>'s
meaning in affirming <hi>Chriſt</hi> to
be the <hi>firſt-born of every Creature</hi> to
inſinuate that the <hi>Son of God</hi> is a
<hi>Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For how can this poſſibly agree
with that which follows and is given
as the reaſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be
the <hi>firſt-born of every Creature?</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe <hi>all things were made by him:</hi>
The <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s words are theſe, <hi>the
firſt-born of every Creature,</hi> or <hi>of the
whole Creation, for by him all things were
created:</hi> But now, according to the
<hi>Socinian</hi> interpretation, this would
be a reaſon juſt the contrary way:
For if <hi>all things were created by him,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:103163:15"/>
then he himſelf is not a <hi>Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s meaning in this
expreſſion muſt either be that the <hi>Son
of God</hi> our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> was before all
Creatures, as it is ſaid preſently after
that <hi>he is before all things;</hi> and then the
reaſon which is added will be very
proper and pertinent, <hi>he is before all
things</hi> becauſe <hi>all things were created by
him:</hi> In which ſenſe it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the <hi>Son</hi> of God elſewhere
calls himself <hi>the beginning of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 14.</note> meaning by it, as the
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> moſt frequently uſe the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Principle</hi> or <hi>Efficient</hi>
Cauſe of the Creation: And ſo we
find the ſame word, which our <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation</hi>
renders <hi>the beginning,</hi> uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the word <hi>firſt-born,</hi> as if
they were of the ſame importance;
<hi>the beginning and firſt-born from the dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 18.</note>
that is, the <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Efficient</hi>
Cauſe of the Reſurrection of the
dead.</p>
            <p>Or elſe, which ſeems to me to be
the moſt probable, and indeed the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103163:15"/>
true meaning of the Expreſſion, by
this Title of <hi>the firſt-born of every
creature</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> means that he was
<hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Heir</hi> of the <hi>Creation:</hi> For
the <hi>firſt-born</hi> is natural <hi>Heir,</hi> and
<hi>Juſtinian</hi> tells us that <hi>Heir</hi> did ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſignify <hi>Lord:</hi> And therefore the
Scripture uſes theſe <hi>terms</hi> promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
and as if they were equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;<note place="margin">Acts 10. 36.</note>
for whereas St. <hi>Peter</hi> faith of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that <hi>he is Lord of all,</hi>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls him <hi>Heir of all things:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 14.</note>
And then the reaſon given by the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> why he calls him <hi>the firſt-born
of every Creature</hi> will be very fit and
proper, becauſe <hi>all things were created
by him:</hi> For well may he be ſaid to be
<hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Heir</hi> of the Creation who
<hi>made all things that were made, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whom was not any thing made that was
made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this will yet appear much
more evident, if we conſider that
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who by
ſeveral of the <hi>Ancients</hi> was thought
to be St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he gives to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103163:16"/>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſome of the very ſame Titles
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the
<hi>Coloſſians</hi> had done, calling him the
<hi>Image of God,</hi> and the <hi>Maker of the
World,</hi> does inſtead of the Title of
the <hi>firſt-born of every Creature</hi> call him
<hi>the Heir of all things;</hi> and then adds
as the reaſon of this Title, that <hi>by</hi>
him God made the Worlds, <hi>God,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us by his Son, whom he hath conſtituted
Heir of all things: Who being the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his glory, and the expreſs Image
of his perſon, and upholding all things by
the Word of his power,</hi> &amp;c. Which is
exactly parallel with that paſſage of
St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi>
is call'd <hi>the Image of the inviſible God,</hi>
and where it is likewiſe ſaid of him
that <hi>he made all things,</hi> and that <hi>by him
all things do ſubſiſt,</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in different words, but
to the very ſame ſenſe, expreſſeth by
his <hi>upholding all things by the Word of his
power,</hi> that is, by the ſame <hi>powerful
Word</hi> by which all things at firſt were
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103163:16"/>
made: But then inſtead of calling
him <hi>the firſt-born of every Creature,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>all things were made by him,</hi> he
calls him the <hi>Heir of all things, by whom
God alſo made the worlds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed that expreſſion of <hi>the
firſt-born of every Creature</hi> cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of any other ſenſe which will
agree ſo well with the reaſon that
follows as the ſenſe which I have
mentioned, namely, that he is
therefore <hi>Heir and Lord of the whole
Creation,</hi> becauſe <hi>all Creatures were made</hi>
by him; which exactly anſwers
thoſe words of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
whom he hath conſtituted Heir of
all things, by whom alſo he made the
Worlds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I apppeal to any ſober
and conſiderate man, whether the
interpretation which I have given of
that expreſſion of the <hi>firſt-born of
every Creature</hi> be not much more
agreeable both to the tenour of
the Scripture, and to the plain
ſcope and deſign of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103163:17"/>
Argument and reaſoning in that
Text.</p>
            <p>I have inſiſted the longer upon
this, becauſe it is the great Text
upon which the <hi>Arians</hi> lay the main
ſtrength and ſtreſs of their Opinion
that the Son of God is a Creature,
becauſe he is ſaid by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to be
<hi>the firſt-born of every Creature;</hi> by
which expreſſion if no more be
meant than that he is <hi>Heir</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi>
of the whole Creation, which I have
ſhew'd to be very agreeable both to
the uſe of the word <hi>firſt born</hi> among
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and likewiſe to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
given of Chriſt in that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
Text which I cited out of the
<hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> then this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of <hi>the firſt born of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
is nothing at all to the purpoſe
either of the <hi>Arians</hi> or the <hi>Socinians,</hi>
to prove the Son of God to be a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Beſides, that the interpretation
which I have given of it makes the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s ſenſe much more current and
eaſy; for then the <hi>Text</hi> will run thus,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103163:17"/>
               <hi>who is the image of the inviſible God,
Heir and Lord of the whole Creation, for
by him all things were made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that in theſe <hi>four</hi> expreſſions of
the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> which I have explain'd
there are theſe <hi>four</hi> things diſtinctly
affirmed of the <hi>Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>he was in the beginning,</hi>
that is, that he already was and did
exiſt when things began to be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
He was before any thing was
made, and conſequently is without
any beginning of Time; for that
which was never made could have no
beginning of its Being.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in that ſtate of his
exiſtence before the Creation of the
World he was partaker of the Divine
Glory and Happineſs: And this I
have ſhew'd to be the meaning of
that expreſſion, <hi>and the Word was with
God:</hi> For thus our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
his being with God before the
World was, <hi>And now, O Father, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
me with thy own ſelf, with the glory
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103163:18"/>which I had with thee before the World
was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>he was God; And the
Word was God.</hi> Not <hi>God the Father,</hi>
who is the Principle and fountain of
the Deity: To prevent that miſtake,
after he had ſaid that <hi>the Word was
God,</hi> he immediately adds in the
next <hi>verſe, the ſame was in the beginning
with God:</hi> He was God by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Divine Nature and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
together with the <hi>Father,</hi> and
by way of derivation from him as
the light is from the Sun: Which is
the common illuſtration which the
ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church
give us of this Myſtery, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the beſt and fitteſt that can be
given of it. For among finite Beings
it is not to be expected, becauſe not
poſſible, to find any exact reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of that which is infinite, and
conſequently is incomprehenſible,
becauſe whatever is infinite is for that
reaſon incomprehenſible by a finite
underſtanding, which is too ſhort
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103163:18"/>
and ſhallow to meaſure that which
is infinite; and whoever attempts
it will ſoon find himſelf out of his
depth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That <hi>all things were made
by him:</hi> Which could not have been
more emphatically expreſs'd than it
is here by the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> after the
manner of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who when
they would ſay a thing with the
greateſt force and certainty are wont
to expreſs it both affirmatively and
negatively, as, <hi>He ſhall live and not
die,</hi> that is, he ſhall moſt aſſuredly
live; ſo here, <hi>All things were made by
him, and without him was not any thing
made that was made,</hi> that is, he made
all Creatures without exception, and
conſequently he himſelf is not a
Creature, becauſe it is evidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that any thing ſhould ever
make it ſelf: But then if he be, and
yet was never made, it is certainly
true that he always was, even from
all Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:103163:19"/>
All theſe Aſſertions are plainly and
expreſly contain'd in this deſcription
which the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> here
makes of the Word; and this accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the interpretation of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
by the unaminous conſent of
the moſt ancient <hi>Writers</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Church: Who, ſome of them,
had the advantage of receiving it
from the immediate Diſciples of
St. <hi>John:</hi> Which ſurely is no ſmall
prejudice againſt any newly invented
and contrary interpretation; as I
ſhall hereafter more fully ſhew,
when I come to conſider the ſtrange
and extravagant interpretation which
the <hi>Socinians</hi> make of this Paſſage of
St. <hi>John;</hi> which is plain enough of it
ſelf, if they under a pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
and making it more clear
had not diſturb'd and darken'd it.</p>
            <p>Now from this deſcription
which the Evangeliſt here gives
of the <hi>Word,</hi> and which I have ſo
largely explain'd in the foregoing
Diſcourſe, theſe <hi>three Corallaries</hi> or
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103163:19"/>
Concluſions do neceſſarily follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Word</hi> here deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by St. <hi>John</hi> is not a Creature.
This Concluſion is directly Againſt
the <hi>Arians,</hi> who affirm'd that the Son
of God was a Creature. They grant
indeed that he is the firſt of all the
Creatures both in <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
for ſo they underſtand that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> wherein he is
called <hi>the firſt-born of every Creature:</hi>
But this I have endeavoured already
to ſhew not to be the meaning of that
expreſſion.</p>
            <p>They grant him indeed to have
been God's <hi>Agent</hi> or <hi>Inſtrument</hi> in the
Creation of the World, and that
all other Creatures beſides himſelf
were made by him: But ſtill they
contend that he is a Creature and was
made: Now this cannot poſſibly
conſiſt with what St. <hi>John</hi> ſays of him,
that <hi>he was in the beginning,</hi> that is, as
hath been already ſhewn, before any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing
was made: And likewiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103163:20"/>
he is ſaid to have <hi>made all
things, and that without him was not any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing
made that was made;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he himſelf who made all things
is neceſſarily excepted out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and rank of a Creature; as
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> reaſons in another Caſe,
<hi>He hath put all things under his feet:
But when he ſaith all things are put under
him, it is manifeſt that he is excepted who
did put all things under him:</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>if by him all things were made, and
without him was not any thing made that
was made,</hi> then either he was not
made, or he muſt make himſelf;
which involves in it a plain contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this <hi>Word</hi> was from
all Eternity: For if <hi>he was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi>
that is, before any thing was
made, he muſt of neceſſity always
have been; becauſe whatever is,
muſt either have been ſometime
made, or muſt always have been;
for that which was not, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
is, muſt be made. And this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103163:20"/>
will likewiſe follow from his being
ſaid to <hi>be God,</hi> and that in the moſt
ſtrict and proper ſenſe, which doth
neceſſarily imply his Eternity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God cannot begin to be, but
muſt of neceſſity always have been.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From both theſe it will
undeniably follow that he had an
exiſtence before his Incarnation and
his being born of the <hi>B. Virgin.</hi> For
<hi>if he was in the beginning,</hi> that is, from
all Eternity, which I have ſhewn to
be the meaning of that expreſſion,
then certainly he was before his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
born of the <hi>B. Virgin.</hi> And this
likewiſe is implied in the Propoſition
in the Text, <hi>And the Word was made
fleſh, viz.</hi> that <hi>Word</hi> which the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt</hi>
had before ſo gloriouſly deſcribed,
that <hi>Word</hi> which <hi>was in the beginning,
and was with God, and was God,</hi> and <hi>by
whom all things were made;</hi> I ſay, <hi>that
Word</hi> was incarnate and aſſumed a
human Nature, and therefore muſt
neceſſarily exiſt and have a Being
before he could aſſume humanity
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103163:21"/>
into an union with his Divinity.</p>
            <p>And this Propoſition is directly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
againſt the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> to be a mere man,
and that he had no exiſtence before
he was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> his
Mother: Which Aſſertion of theirs
doth perfectly contradict all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Concluſions which have been
drawn from the deſcription here
given by St. <hi>John</hi> of the <hi>Word:</hi> And
their interpretation of this paſſage of
St. <hi>John</hi> applying it to <hi>the beginning</hi> of
the publication of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and to
the new <hi>Creation</hi> or Reformation of
the World by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
contradict the interpretation of
this paſſage conſtantly received, not
only by the ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> but even
by the general conſent of all <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
for fifteen hundred years together, as
I ſhall hereafter plainly ſhew: For
to eſtabliſh this their Opinion, that
our B. Saviour was a mere man, and
had no exiſtence before his Birth,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103163:21"/>
they are forc'd to interpret this whole
paſſage in the beginning of St. <hi>John</hi>'s
Goſpel quite to another ſenſe, never
mention'd, nor I believe thought of
by any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writer whatſoever
before <hi>Socinus:</hi> And it is not eaſie to
imagin how any Opinion can be
loaded with a greater and heavier
prejudice than this is.</p>
            <p>And this I ſhould now take into
conſideration, and ſhew, beſides the
novelty of this interpretation and the
great violence and unreaſonableneſs
of it, the utter inconſiſtency of it
with other plain Texts of <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is wholly matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
and will require a large Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
by it ſelf; I ſhall therefore
wave the further proſecution of it at
preſent, and apply my ſelf to that
which is more practical and proper
for the Occaſion of this <hi>Seaſon:</hi> So
that at preſent I have done with the
<hi>firſt</hi> thing contain'd in the <hi>Firſt</hi> part
of the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Perſon</hi> here
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103163:22"/>
ſpoken of who is ſaid to be incarnate,
namely the <hi>Word,</hi> it was <hi>He</hi> that <hi>was
made fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould then have proceeded to
the <hi>Second</hi> thing which I propoſed to
conſider, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Myſtery</hi> it ſelf, or
the nature of this <hi>Incarnation</hi> ſo far as
the Scripture hath revealed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
it to us, namely, by aſſuming
our Nature in ſuch a manner as that
the Divinity became united to a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Soul and Body. But this I have
already endeavoured in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to explain, and ſhall do it more
fully in ſome of the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
upon this Text. I ſhall now
only make a ſhort and uſeful reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon it with relation to the <hi>Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
of this <hi>Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it ſhall be to ſtir us up to a
thankful acknowledgment of the
great love of God to Mankind in
the Myſtery of our Redemption by
the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Word, the only
begotten Son</hi> of God: That he ſhould
deign to have ſuch a regard to us in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103163:22"/>
our low condition, and to take our
Caſe ſo much to heart as to think of
redeeming and ſaving Mankind from
that depth of miſery into which we
had plunged our ſelves; and to do
this in ſo wonderful and aſtoniſhing
a manner: That God ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
his eternal and only begotten
Son, who had been with him from all
Eternity, partaker of his Happineſs
and Glory, and was <hi>God of God,</hi>
to ſave the Sons of men by ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and amazing a condeſcention:
That God ſhould vouchſafe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
man, to reconcile man to
God: That he ſhould come down
from Heaven to Earth, to raiſe us
from Earth to Heaven: That he
ſhould aſſume our vile and frail and
mortal nature, that he might cloath
us with glory and honour and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality:
That he ſhould ſuffer
Death to ſave us from Hell, and
ſhed his blood to purchaſe eternal
Redemption for us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:103163:23"/>
For certainly the greater the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is that was employed in this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Deſign, ſo much the greater is
the condeſcention, and the love and
goodneſs expreſſed in it ſo much the
more admirable: That the Son of
God ſhould ſtoop from the height of
Glory and Happineſs to the loweſt
degree of abaſement and to the very
depth of miſery for our ſakes, who
were ſo mean and inconſiderable, ſo
guilty and obnoxious to the ſeverity
of his Juſtice, ſo altogether unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of his grace and favour, and ſo
very unwilling to receive it when it
was ſo freely offer'd to us; for, as
the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> here tells us, <hi>He came
to his own, and his own received him not:</hi>
To his own Creatures, and they did
not own and acknowledg their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
to his own Nation and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and they deſpiſed him and
eſteemed him not. Lord! what is
man, that God ſhould be ſo mindful
of him; or the Son of man, that the
Son of God ſhould come down from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103163:23"/>
Heaven to viſit him, in ſo much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and condeſcention, and with
ſo much kindneſs and compaſſion?</p>
            <p>Bleſſed God and Saviour of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind!
What ſhall we render to thee
for ſuch mighty love, for ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable
benefits as thou haſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
for us and art ready to confer
upon us? What ſhall we ſay to thee,
O thou preſerver and lover of Souls,
ſo often as we approach thy <hi>H. Table,</hi>
there to commemorate this mighty
love of thine to us, and to partake
of thoſe invaluable bleſſings which
by thy precious bloodſhedding thou
haſt obtained for us? So often as we
there remember, that thou waſt
pleaſed to aſſume our mortal Nature,
on purpoſe to live amongſt us for
our inſtruction, and for our example,
and to lay down thy life for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of our Souls and for the
expiation of our Sins; and to <hi>take
part of fleſh and blood</hi> that thou
mightſt ſhed it for our ſakes: What
affections ſhould theſe thoughts raiſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103163:24"/>
in us? What Vows and reſolutions
ſhould they engage us in, of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
love and gratitude, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to thee the moſt gracious and
moſt glorious Redeemer of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?</p>
            <p>And with what Religious Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
ſhould we, more eſpecially at
this Time, celebrate the <hi>Incarnation</hi>
and Birth of the Son of God by
giving praiſe and <hi>glory to God in the
higheſt,</hi> and by all poſſible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of charity and <hi>good-will to
men?</hi> And as he was pleaſed to
aſſume our Nature ſo ſhould we,
eſpecially at this Seaſon, <hi>put on the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is, ſincerely
embrace and practice his Religion,
<hi>making no proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill
the lUſts thereof:</hi> And now that the
<hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> is riſen upon the
World, we ſhould <hi>walk as Children of
the light,</hi> and <hi>demean our ſelves decently
as in the day, not in rioting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
not in chambering and wantonneſs,
not in ſtrife and envy:</hi> And ſhould be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103163:24"/>
very careful not to abuſe our ſelves
by Sin and Senſuality, upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſideration that the Son hath
put ſuch an honour and dignity upon
us: We ſhould reverence that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which God did not diſdain to
aſſume and to inhabit here on Earth,
and in which he now gloriouſly
reigns in Heaven, at the right hand
of his <hi>Father, to whom be glory for ever

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Proceed now to proſecute the <hi>third
Corollary</hi> or Concluſion which
does neceſſarily follow from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
which St. <hi>John</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his <hi>Goſpel</hi> gives of the <hi>Word,</hi>
and which I have ſo largely explain'd
in the foregoing Diſcourſe: And it
was this,</p>
            <p>That <hi>the Word,</hi> here deſcribed by
the <hi>Evangeliſt, had an exiſtence before his
Incarnation and his being born of the B.
Virgin,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:103163:26"/>
This <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> I told you, is le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
directly againſt the <hi>Socinians,</hi>
who affirm our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> to be a
mere man, and deny that he had any
exiſtence before he was born of the
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother: Which <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of theirs does perfectly contradict
all the former <hi>Concluſions</hi> which have
been ſo evidently drawn from the
Deſcription here given of the <hi>Word:</hi>
And not only ſo, but hath forc'd them
to interpret this whole paſſage in the
beginning of St. <hi>John's Goſpel</hi> in a very
different ſenſe from that which was
conſtantly received, not only by the
ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> but by the general
conſent of all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for 1500 years
together: For to eſtabliſh this their
Opinion of our Saviour's being a
mere man and having no exiſtence
before his Birth, they have found it
neceſſary to expound this whole paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
quite to another ſenſe, and ſuch
as by their own confeſſion was never
mentioned, nor I believe thought of,
by any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writer whatſoever
before <hi>Socinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:103163:26"/>
For this reaſon I ſhall very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
conſider the interpretation
which <hi>Socinus</hi> gives of this Paſſage
of St. <hi>John;</hi> and beſides the novelty
of it, which they themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
I make no doubt very
plainly to manifeſt the great violence
and unreaſonableneſs, and likewiſe
the inconſiſtency of it with other
plain <hi>Texts</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very evident what it was that
forc'd <hi>Socinus</hi> to ſo ſtrain'd and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
an interpretation of this Paſſage
of the Evangeliſt, namely, that he
plainly ſaw how much the obvious,
and natural, and generally received
interpretation of this Paſſage, in all
Ages of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church down
to his time, ſtood in the way of his
<hi>Opinion,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being a mere man,
which he was ſo fond of, and muſt
of neceſſity have quitted, unleſs he
would either have denied the Divine
Authority of St. <hi>John's Goſpel,</hi> or
elſe could ſupplant the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of this Paſſage by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103163:27"/>
a quite different ſenſe upon
it: Which ſenſe he could find no
way to ſupport without ſuch pitiful
and wretched ſhifts, ſuch precarious
and arbitrary Suppoſitions, as a man
of ſo ſharp a Reaſon and judgment
as <hi>Socinus,</hi> could not, I thought, have
ever been driven to. But neceſſity
hath no Laws either of Reaſon or
Modeſty, and he who is reſolved to
maintain an Opinion which he hath
once taken up muſt ſtick at nothing,
but muſt break through all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that ſtand in his way: And ſo
the <hi>Socinians</hi> have here done, as will,
I hope, manifeſtly appear in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>They grant that by the <hi>Word</hi> is
here meant <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by whom God
ſpake and declared his mind and will
to the World; which they make to
be the whole reaſon of that Name
or Title of the <hi>Word</hi> which is here
given him, and not becauſe by Him
God made the World: For the <hi>Word</hi>
by which God made the World, they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103163:27"/>
tell us, was nothing but the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Command of God, and not a
Perſon who was deſign'd to be the
<hi>Meſſias.</hi> And becauſe, as I have
ſhewed before, the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> do
make frequent mention of this Title
of the <hi>Word of God</hi> by whom they ſay
<hi>God made the World,</hi> and do likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
this Title to the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to avoid this, <hi>Schlictingius</hi> ſays
that the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſts, Jonathan</hi>
and <hi>Onkelos,</hi> do ſometimes put the
<hi>Word of God for God,</hi> by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> of
the Effect for the Cauſe; but then
he confidently denies that they do
any where diſtinguiſh the <hi>Word</hi> of
God from the <hi>Perſon</hi> of God, as they
acknowledge that St. <hi>John</hi> here does;
nor do they, ſays he, underſtand by
the <hi>Word of God</hi> the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but on
the contrary do oppoſe the <hi>Word of
God</hi> to the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> All which is moſt
evidently confuted by that paſſage
which I cited before out of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum</hi>
of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> who renders thoſe
words concerning the <hi>Meſſias, The
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103163:28"/>
Lord ſaid unto my Lord,</hi> &amp;c. thus, <hi>The
Lord ſaid unto his</hi> Word, <hi>ſit thou on my
right hand,</hi> &amp;c. where you ſee both
that the <hi>Word of God</hi> is plainly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from <hi>God,</hi> and that it is the
Title given to the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> Which
are the two things which <hi>Schlictingius</hi>
doth ſo confidently deny.</p>
            <p>This then being agreed on all
hands, that by the <hi>Word</hi> St. <hi>John</hi>
means the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> I ſhall in the next
place, ſhew by what ſtrained and
forced arts of interpretation the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
endeavour to avoid the plain
and neceſſary conſequence from this
Paſſage of St. <hi>John, namely</hi> that the
<hi>Word</hi> had an exiſtence before he was
<hi>made fleſh</hi> and born of the <hi>B. Virgin</hi>
his Mother.</p>
            <p>This then in ſhort is the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they give of this Paſſage,
than which I think nothing can be
more unnatural and violent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the beginning,</hi> This they will by
no means have to refer to the <hi>Creation</hi>
of the World, but to the beginning
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103163:28"/>
of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that is, when the <hi>Goſpel</hi>
firſt began to be publiſh'd then was
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not before: <hi>And he was
with God,</hi> that is ſays <hi>Socinus, Chriſt</hi>
as he was the <hi>Word of God,</hi> that is,
the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by him revealed to the World
was firſt only known to God: But
all this being ſomewhat hard, firſt
to underſtand by <hi>the beginning</hi> not the
<hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> but of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;</hi>
and then by the <hi>Word</hi> which
<hi>was with God</hi> to underſtand the <hi>Goſpel</hi>
which before it was revealed was
only known to God; they have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſecond thoughts found out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meaning of thoſe words, <hi>And
the Word was with God,</hi> that is faith
<hi>Schlictingius, Chriſt</hi> was taken up by
God into Heaven, and there inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the mind and will of God,
and from thence ſent down into the
World again to declare it to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Word was God,</hi> that is ſay
they, <hi>Chriſt</hi> had the Honour and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103163:29"/>
of God conferr'd upon him, as
<hi>Magiſtrates</hi> alſo have, who in the
<hi>Scripture</hi> are called Gods: <hi>He was
God,</hi> not by <hi>Nature</hi> but by <hi>Office</hi> and
by Divine conſtitution and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All things were made by him:</hi> This
they will needs have to be meant of
the <hi>Renovation</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> of the
World by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times in <hi>Scripture</hi> call'd a <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This in ſhort is the Sum of their
interpretation of this Paſſage, which
I ſhall now examine, and to which
I ſhall oppoſe <hi>three</hi> things as ſo many
invincible prejudices againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That not only all the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church,
but ſo far as I can find, all <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
whatſoever for <hi>fifteen hundred</hi>
years together did underſtand this
Paſſage of St. <hi>John</hi> in a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſenſe, namely, of the <hi>Creation</hi>
of the <hi>material,</hi> and not of the <hi>Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:103163:29"/>
of the <hi>moral</hi> World: And I
add further, that the generality of
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> did ſo underſtand this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
as to collect from it as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<hi>Point of Chriſtianity,</hi> that the
<hi>Word</hi> had a real exiſtence before he
was born of the <hi>B. Virgin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus not only the Orthodox
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but even the <hi>Arians,</hi> and
<hi>Amelius</hi> the <hi>Platoniſt,</hi> who was a more
indifferent judge then either of them,
did underſtand this Paſſage of St. <hi>John,</hi>
without any thought of this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he ſpake not of the <hi>old,</hi>
but of the <hi>new Creation</hi> of the World
by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Reformation
of Mankind by the preaching of the
<hi>Goſpel:</hi> Which I dare ſay no indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Reader of St. <hi>John,</hi> that had not
been prepoſſeſs'd and byaſs'd by
ſome violent prejudice would ever
have thought of.</p>
            <p>And ſurely it ought to be very
conſiderable in this Caſe, that the
moſt ancient <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writers, <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Juſtin Martyr, Athenagoras, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103163:30"/>
Tertullian,</hi> and even <hi>Origen</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
who is called <hi>the Father of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,</hi>
are moſt expreſs and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in this matter. For <hi>Ignatius</hi> was
the Scholar of <hi>Polycarp,</hi> who was a
Diſciple of St. <hi>John;</hi> and <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
lived in the next Age to that of
the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> was a man of
infinite learning and reading, and in
his <hi>Comments</hi> upon <hi>Scripture</hi> ſeems to
have conſidered all the <hi>Interpretations</hi>
of thoſe that were before him: So
that if this, which <hi>Socinus</hi> is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
is the true ſenſe of St. <hi>John,</hi>
had been any where extant, he
would not probably have omitted it;
nay rather would certainly have
mentioned it, if for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
yet for the ſurpriſing novelty
and ſtrangeneſs of it, with which he
was apt to be over-much delighted.</p>
            <p>So that if this interpretation of
<hi>Socinus</hi> be true, here are two things
very wonderful, and almoſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible:
<hi>Firſt,</hi> that thoſe who lived ſo
very near St. <hi>John</hi>'s Time, and were
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103163:30"/>
moſt likely to know his meaning,
as <hi>Ignatius, Juſtin Martyr, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould
ſo widely miſtake it: And then, that
the whole <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World ſhould for
ſo many Ages together be deceived
in the ground and foundation of ſo
important an <hi>Article</hi> of Faith, if it
were true; or if it were not, ſhould
be led into ſo groſs and dangerous an
Error as this muſt needs be, if <hi>Chriſt</hi>
had no real exiſtence before he was
born into the World: And which
would be neceſſarily conſequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, that no man did underſtand
this <hi>Paſſage</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi> aright before
<hi>Socinus.</hi> This very conſideration
alone, if there were no other, were
ſufficient to ſtagger any prudent
man's belief of this Interpretation.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Novelty</hi> of it, <hi>Socinus</hi>
himſelf makes no difficulty to own
it; nay he ſeems rather to rejoice
and to applaud himſelf in it. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
man! that was ſo wedded to
his own Opinion that no Objection,
no difficulty could divorce him from
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:103163:31"/>
And for this I refer my ſelf to his
<hi>Preface</hi> to his Explication of this firſt
<hi>Chapter</hi> of St. <hi>John's Goſpel;</hi> where
you ſhall find theſe words concerning
the Paſſage now in controverſy,
<hi>quorum verus ſenſus omnium prorſus, qui
quidem extarent, explanatores latuiſſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur,
the true ſenſe of which words,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>ſeems to have been hid from all
the Expoſitors that ever were extant:</hi>
And upon thoſe words, <hi>v. 10. He
was in the World, and the World was made
by him,</hi> he hath this expreſſion, <hi>quid
autem hoc loco ſibi velit</hi> Johannes, <hi>à ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
quod ſciam adhuc rectè expoſitum
fuit, but what St.</hi> John <hi>means in this
place was never yet, that I know of, by
any man rightly explain'd:</hi> And <hi>Schlictin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
after him, with more confidence
but much leſs decency, tells us, that
concerning the meaning of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<hi>in the beginning,</hi> and of thoſe
which follow concerning the <hi>Word,</hi>
the ancient <hi>Interpreters</hi> did <hi>ab Apoſtoli
mente delirare,</hi> went <hi>ſo far from the
Apoſtle's meaning as if they had rav'd and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103163:31"/>
been out of their wits:</hi> Which is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly
ſaid, and with ſo much
contempt of thoſe great and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Names, who were the chief
Propagaters of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in the
World, and to whom all Ages do ſo
juſtly pay a reverence, that nothing
can be ſaid in excuſe of him but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that it is not uſual with him to fall
into ſuch raſh and rude expreſſions.
But the man was really pinch'd by
ſo plain and preſſing a <hi>Text,</hi> and
where Reaſon is weak and blunt
Paſſion muſt be whetted, the only
weapon that is left when Reaſon
fails: And I always take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that no man is ever Angry with
his Adverſary but for want of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Argument to ſupport his Cauſe.</p>
            <p>And yet to do right to the Writers
on that ſide, I muſt own that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
they are a Pattern of the fair
way of diſputing, and of debating
matters of Religion without heat
and unſeemly reflections upon their
Adverſaries, in the number of whom
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103163:32"/>
I did not expect that the Primitive
<hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church would
have been reckoned by them. They
generally argue matters with that
temper and gravity, and with that
freedom from paſſion and tranſport
which becomes a ſerious and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Argument: And for the moſt part
they reaſon cloſely and clearly, with
extraordinary guard and caution,
with great dexterity and decency,
and yet with ſmartneſs and ſubtilty
enough; with a very gentle heat,
and few hard words: Vertues to be
praiſed whereever they are found,
yea even in an Enemy, and very
worthy our imitation: In a word,
they are the ſtrongeſt managers of a
weak Cauſe and which is ill founded
at the bottom, that perhaps ever yet
medled with Controverſy: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that ſome of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and
the generality of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Writers,
and even of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> themſelves
who pretend to all the Reaſon and
ſubtilty in the World, are in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103163:32"/>
of <hi>them</hi> but mere <hi>Scolds</hi> and
<hi>Bunglers:</hi> Upon the whole matter,
they have but this one great defect
that they want a good Cauſe and
Truth on their Side; which if they
had, they have Reaſon, and Wit,
and temper enough to defend it.</p>
            <p>But to return to the buſineſs.
That which I urge them withall, and
that from their own confeſſion, is
this, that this interpretation of theirs
is perfectly new, and unknown to
the whole <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World before <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi>
and for that reaſon, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
not to be bragg'd of: Becauſe
it is in effect to ſay that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Religion, in a <hi>Point</hi> pretended on
both Sides to be of the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was never rightly underſtood
by any ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days, for
<hi>fifteen hundred</hi> years together: And
which makes the matter yet worſe,
that the <hi>Religion</hi> which was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
deſign'd to overthrow <hi>Polytheiſm</hi>
and the belief of more God, hath,
according to <hi>them,</hi> been ſo ill taught
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103163:33"/>
and underſtood by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for ſo
many Ages together, and almoſt
from the very beginning of <hi>Chiſtianity,</hi>
as does neceſſarily infer a Plurality
of Gods: An inconvenience ſo great
as no Cauſe, how plauſible ſoever it
may otherwiſe appear, is able to
ſtand under and to ſuſtain the weight
of it.</p>
            <p>For this the <hi>Socinians</hi> object to us
at every turn, as the unavoidable
conſequence of our interpretation of
this Paſſage of St. <hi>John,</hi> and of all
other <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> produced by
us to the ſame purpoſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that this interpretation hath
obtain'd in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church for ſo
many Ages: Now whoſoever can
believe that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion
hath done the Work for which it was
principally deſign'd ſo ineffectually,
muſt have very little reverence for it,
nay it muſt be a marvellous civility in
him if he believe it at all. All that
can be ſaid in this Caſe is, that it
pleaſes God many times to permit
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103163:33"/>
men to hold very inconſiſtent things,
and which do in truth, though they
themſelves diſcern it not, moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
overthrow one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another mighty preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
againſt this Interpretation is this,
that according to this rate of liberty
in interpreting <hi>Scripture,</hi> it will
ſignify very little or nothing, when
any Perſon or Party is concern'd to
oppoſe any Doctrine contained in it;
and the plaineſt <hi>Texts</hi> for any <hi>Article</hi>
of Faith, how fundamental and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
ſoever, may by the ſame arts
and ways of interpretation be eluded
and render'd utterly ineffectual for
the eſtabliſhing of it: For example,
If any man had a mind to call in
queſtion that <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Creed</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Creation of the World,</hi> why
might he not, according to <hi>Socinus</hi>
his way of interpreting St. <hi>John,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the <hi>firſt</hi> Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi>

               </note> as a very learned <hi>Divine</hi> of
our own hath ingeniouſly ſhewn

            <p>There is no end of Wit and Fancy,
which can turn any thing any way,
and can make whatever they pleaſe
to be the meaning of any <hi>Book,</hi>
though never ſo contrary to the plain
deſign of it, and to that ſenſe which
at the firſt hearing and reading of
it is obvious to every man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe.</p>
            <p>And this, in my opinion, <hi>Socinus</hi>
hath done in the Caſe now before us,
by impoſing a new and odd and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ſenſe upon this Paſſage of
St. <hi>John,</hi> directly contrary to what
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103163:34"/>
any man would imagine to be the
plain and obvious meaning of it,
and contrary likewiſe to the ſenſe of
the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church in all Ages down
to his Time; who yet had as great
or greater advantage of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
St. <hi>John</hi> aright, and as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
as any man can now modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pretend to: And all this only to
ſerve and ſupport an <hi>Opinion</hi> which
he had entertain'd before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was reſolv'd one way or other to
bring the <hi>Scripture</hi> to comply with it:
And if he could not have done it, it
is greatly to be feared that he would
at laſt have called in queſtion the
Divine Authority of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel
rather than have quitted his <hi>Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ſpeak freely, I muſt needs
ſay that it ſeems to me a much fairer
way to reject the Divine Authority
of a <hi>Book,</hi> than to uſe it ſo diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
and to wreſt the plain expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of it with ſo much ſtraining
and violence from their moſt natural
and obvious ſenſe: For no Doctrine
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103163:35"/>
whatſever can have any certain
foundation in any <hi>Book,</hi> if this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be once admitted, without regard
to the plain Scope and Occaſion of
it to play upon the words and phraſes
with all the arts of <hi>Criticiſm</hi> and with
all the variety of <hi>Allegory</hi> which a
brisk and lively Imagination can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe:
which I am ſo far from admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in the expounding of the Holy
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> that I am always jealous
of an over-labour'd and far-fetch'd
interpretation of any <hi>Author</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>I do readily grant that the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Writers have managed the Cauſe
of the <hi>Reformation</hi> againſt the Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Corruptions of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> both in Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
with great acuteneſs and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in many reſpects: But I am
ſorry to have cauſe to ſay that they
have likewiſe put into <hi>their</hi> hands bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and ſharper weapons than ever
they had before for the weakning
and undermining of the Authority
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103163:35"/>
of the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> which <hi>Socinus</hi>
indeed hath in the general ſtrongly
aſſerted, had he not by a dangerous
liberty of impoſing a foreign and
fore'd ſenſe upon <hi>particular</hi> Texts
brought the <hi>whole</hi> into uncertainty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Which is as conſiderable
a prejudice againſt this new interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of this Paſſage of St. <hi>John</hi> as
either of the former, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ſhew that this <hi>Point,</hi> of the
exiſtence of the <hi>Word</hi> before his <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
does not rely only upon this
ſingle <hi>Paſſage</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> but is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
confirmed by many other <hi>Texts</hi>
of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> conſpiring in
the ſame ſenſe and utterly incapable
of the interpretation which <hi>Socinus</hi>
gives of it.</p>
            <p>I find he would be glad to have it
taken for granted that this is the only
<hi>Text</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to this
purpoſe: And therefore he ſays very
cunningly, that this Doctrine of the
exiſtence of the Son of God before
his Incarnation is too great a Doctrine
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103163:36"/>
to be eſtabliſh'd upon one ſingle
<hi>Text:</hi> And this is is ſomething, if it
were true that there is no other <hi>Text</hi>
in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> that does plainly
deliver the ſame ſenſe: And yet this
were not ſufficient to bring in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Doctrine delivered in this
<hi>Paſſage</hi> of St. <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>God is a Spirit</hi> will I hope be
acknowledged to be a very weighty
and fundamental Point of Religion,
and yet I am very much miſtaken if
there be any more than one <hi>Text</hi> in
the whole <hi>Bible</hi> that ſays ſo, and that
<hi>Text</hi> is only in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel. I
know it may be ſaid, that from the
light of natural Reaſon it may be
ſufficiently prov'd that God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
But ſurely <hi>Socinus</hi> of all men,
cannot ſay this with a good grace;
becauſe he denies that the exiſtence
of a God can be known by natural
light without Divine Revelation:
And if it cannot be known by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
light that there is a God, much
leſs can it be known by natural light
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103163:36"/>
what God is, whether a Spirit or a
Body.</p>
            <p>And yet after all it is very far
from being true that there is but one
<hi>Text</hi> to this purpoſe; which yet he
thought fit to inſinuate by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for the novelty and boldneſs of
his interpretation; of which any one
that reads him may ſee that he was
ſufficiently conſcious to himſelf, and
therefore was ſo wiſe as to endeavour
by this ſly inſinuation to provide and
lay in againſt it. I have likewiſe
another reaſon which very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
me to believe that <hi>Socinus</hi> was
the firſt Author of this interpretation,
becauſe it ſeems to me next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that a man, of ſo good an
underſtanding as he was, could ever
have been ſo fond of ſo ill-favour'd
a Child if it had not been his own.
And yet I do not at all wonder that
his Followers came in to it ſo readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſince they had him in ſo great a
veneration, it being natural to all
<hi>Sects</hi> to admire their <hi>Maſter;</hi> beſides
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103163:37"/>
that I doubt not but they were very
glad to have ſo great an Authority as
they thought him to be, to vouch
for an interpretation which was ſo
ſeaſonably devis'd for the relief of
their Cauſe in ſo much danger to be
overthrown by a <hi>Text</hi> that was ſo
plain and full againſt them.</p>
            <p>And how little ground there is for
this Inſinuation, that this is the only
<hi>Text</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to this
purpoſe, I ſhall now ſhew from a
multitude of other <hi>Texts</hi> to the ſame
ſenſe and purpoſe with this <hi>Paſſage</hi> of
St. <hi>John.</hi> And I ſhall rank them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

I am;</hi> the obvious ſenſe of
which words is, that <hi>he</hi> had a real
exiſtence before <hi>Abraham</hi> was actually
in Being.</p>
            <p>Again it is ſaid,<note place="margin">John 13. 3.</note> that <hi>Jeſus knowing
that the Father had given all things into
his hands, and that he was come from God,
and went to God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And again;<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 27,</note> 
               <hi>For the Father himſelf
loveth you, becauſe ye loved me, and have

               <hi>I
came forth from the Father, and am come
into the World; again, I leave the World,
and go to the Father:</hi> This was ſo very
plain, that his <hi>Diſciples</hi> who were
ſlow enough of apprehenſion in
other things, did underſtand this ſo
well that upon this declaration of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103163:38"/>
his they were convinced of his <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience,</hi>
which is an <hi>incommunicable
Property</hi> of the <hi>Divinity:</hi> For ſo it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
follows,<note place="margin">v. 29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>His Diſciples ſaid
unto him, Lord, now ſpeakeſt thou plainly
and ſpeakeſt no Parable: Now are we ſure
that thou knoweſt all things, and needeſt
not that any man ſhould ask thee: By this
we believe that thou cameſt forth from
God.</hi> So that either this which I
have all along declared muſt be the
meaning of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s words, or
elſe his <hi>Diſciples</hi> were groſly miſtaken
and did not underſtand him at all:
And if ſo, then ſurely our <hi>Saviour</hi>
before he had proceeded any further
would have corrected their miſtake
and have ſet them right in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
But ſo far is he from doing that,
that he allows them to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
him aright: For thus it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,<note place="margin">v. 31.</note>
               <hi>Jeſus anſwered them, Do ye now
believe?</hi> as if he had ſaid, I am glad
that you are at laſt convinc'd and do
believe that <hi>I came from God,</hi> and
muſt <hi>return to him;</hi> and that <hi>I know
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103163:39"/>
all things,</hi> which none but God can
do. Is it now poſſible for any man
to read this <hi>Paſſage</hi> and yet not to be
convinced that the <hi>Diſciples</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
our <hi>Saviour</hi> to ſpeak literally?
But if his meaning was as the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
would make us believe, then the
<hi>Diſciples</hi> did perfectly miſtake his
words; the contrary whereof is I
think very plain and evident beyond
all contradiction.</p>
            <p>Again,<note place="margin">John 17. 5.</note> 
               <hi>And now, O Father, glorify
me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which
I had with thee, before the World was:</hi>
This ſurely is not ſpoken of his <hi>being
with God</hi> after his Incarnation, and
before his entrance upon his publick
Miniſtry: They have not I think the
face to underſtand this expreſſion,
<hi>before the World was,</hi> of the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but do endeavour to avoid it
another way, which I ſhall conſider
by and by.</p>
            <p>And a little after,<note place="margin">v. 8.</note> 
               <hi>I have given them
the words which thou gaveſt me, and they
have received them, and known aſſuredly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103163:39"/>
that I came from thee, and that thou didſt
ſend me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>That which was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
which we have heard, which we
have ſeen with our eyes, which we have
looked upon and our hands have handled of
the Word of life: For the life was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted,
and we have ſeen it, and bear
witneſs and ſhew unto you that eternal
Life,</hi> for ſo he calls <hi>the Son of God,
which was with the Father, and was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that he was not only <hi>with God</hi>
before he aſſumed human Nature,
but alſo was really God, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
tells us:<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>Let this mind be in you, which
was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus, who being in the
form of God <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, did
not arrogate to himſelf to be equal with
God,</hi> that is, he made no oſtentation
of his Divinity: For this I take to
be the true meaning of that <hi>Phraſe,</hi>
both becauſe it is ſo uſed by <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
and becauſe it makes the ſenſe much
more eaſie and current, thus, <hi>who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the form of God, did not aſſume
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103163:40"/>
an equality with God,</hi> that is, he did
not appear in the Glory of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which was hid under a Veil of
human fleſh and infirmity; <hi>But he
emptied himſelf, and took upon him the
form of a ſervant, and was made in the
likeneſs of men, and being found in faſhion
as a man,</hi> or in the habit of a man,
<hi>he became obedient to the death,</hi> &amp;c. So
that if <hi>his being made in the likeneſs and
faſhion of a man</hi> does ſignify that he
was really Man by his Incarnation,
then ſurely his <hi>being in the form of God</hi>
when he took upon him <hi>the faſhion
and likeneſs of man</hi> and <hi>the form of a
Servant</hi> or Slave, muſt in all reaſon
ſignify that he was really <hi>God</hi> before
he became <hi>Man:</hi> For which reaſon
the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did not doubt to ſay,
that <hi>God was manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And now I hope that I have made
it fully appear that the beginning of
St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel is not the ſingle and
only <hi>Text</hi> upon which we ground
this <hi>great Doctrine</hi> as <hi>Socinus</hi> calls it,
and as we really eſteem it to be:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103163:40"/>
For you ſee that I have produced
a great many more; to avoid the
dint and force whereof the <hi>Socinians</hi>
do chiefly make uſe of theſe <hi>two</hi>
Anſwers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To thoſe <hi>Texts</hi> which ſay
that <hi>he was in Heaven</hi> and <hi>came down
from Heaven,</hi> they give this anſwer;
That our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſome time before
his entrance upon his publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
they cannot agree preciſely
<hi>when,</hi> was taken up into Heaven,
and then and there had the Will of
God revealed to him, and was ſent
down from Heaven again to make it
known to the World.</p>
            <p>This is ſo very arbitrary and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
a Suppoſition that I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
my ſelf not a little out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
for them, that men of ſo
much Wit and Reaſon ſhould ever be
put to ſo ſorry and pitiful a ſhift.
For can any man imagine that in ſo
exact a Hiſtory of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Life,
written by ſeveral Perſons, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103163:41"/>
of ſo important a matter as
this, and of the circumſtances of it,
ſhould be wholly omitted? That we
ſhould have a particular account of
his being carried into <hi>Egypt</hi> in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
and of the time when he was
brought back from thence: Of his
diſputing in the Temple with the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, and putting them to
ſilence, when he was but twelve
years of Age: A punctual Relation
of his being baptized by <hi>John;</hi> and
how after that <hi>he was led by the Spirit
into the Wilderneſs to be tempted of the
Devil,</hi> and was carried by that <hi>evil
Spirit</hi> from one place to another:
But not one word of his being taken
up by God into Heaven, and of his
coming down again from thence; not
the leaſt intimation given either of
the Time or any other circumſtance
of ſo memorable a thing, upon which,
according to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Miſſion and the Divinity
of his Doctrine did ſo much depend:
When ſo many things of ſo much
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103163:41"/>
leſs moment are ſo minutely and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
reported, what can be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of this deep ſilence in all the
<hi>Evangeliſts</hi> concerning this matter?
But above all, it is to be wondred
that St. <hi>John,</hi> who wrote his <hi>Goſpel</hi>
laſt, and as <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to ſupply the omiſſions of the
other <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> ſhould give no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this thing, and yet, as the
<hi>Socinians</hi> ſuppoſe, ſhould ſo often
take it for granted and refer to it;
as when it is ſaid that <hi>he came forth
from God,</hi> and was <hi>ſent from God,</hi> and
<hi>came down</hi> from Heaven, beſides ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Expreſſions to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Who can believe this? And can
it then be reaſonable to ſuppoſe ſuch
a thing? And this without any
ground from the Hiſtory of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi>
only to ſerve an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> which
they had taken up, and which they
cannot maintain, unleſs they may
have leave to make a Suppoſition for
which they have nothing in truth to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103163:42"/>
ſay, but only that it is neceſſary to
defend an Opinion which they are
reſolved not to part with upon any
terms.</p>
            <p>This is ſo inartificial, not to ſay
abſurd a way of avoiding a difficulty,
to take for granted whatever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to that purpoſe, that no man
of common ingenuity would make
uſe of it: And there is no ſurer ſign
that a Cauſe is greatly diſtreſs'd than
to be driven to ſuch a ſhift. For
do but give a man leave to ſuppoſe
what he pleaſes and he may prove
what he will, and avoid any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
whatever that can be objected to him.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that according to this
device the Son of God did not firſt
come from Heaven into the World,
as the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſeems every where
to ſay, but firſt was in the World,
and then went to Heaven, and from
thence came back into the World
again: And he was not <hi>in the beginning
with God,</hi> but was firſt in the World
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103163:42"/>
and afterwards with God; whereas
St. <hi>John</hi> ſays that the <hi>Word was in the
beginning,</hi> and then <hi>was made fleſh and
dwelt among us:</hi> But they ſay, that he
firſt <hi>was made fleſh,</hi> and then a great
while after was <hi>in the beginning with
God:</hi> A ſuppoſition which is quite
contrary to all the <hi>Texts</hi> which I
have mention'd.</p>
            <p>Nor do the ſeveral parts of this
interpretation of theirs agree very
well together. <hi>In the beginning,</hi> that
is, ſay they, when the <hi>Goſpel</hi> firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be publiſh'd, <hi>was the Word;</hi>
and then, that is, <hi>in the beginning, he
was with God,</hi> that is in Heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from God that Doctrine which
he was to deliver to the World: But
if by <hi>the beginning</hi> be meant the firſt
publication of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> he was
not <hi>then</hi> with God, but had been with
him and was come back from him
before he entred upon his publick
Miniſtry, which they make to be the
meaning of <hi>the beginning:</hi> And <hi>in the
beginning he was God,</hi> that is ſay they,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103163:43"/>
not God by Nature but by Office
and Divine conſtitution: And yet in
this again they fall foul upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
for they ſay he was not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be God till after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and his being advanced to the
right hand of God: So that he was
not God in their ſenſe of <hi>the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
that is when he entred upon
his publick Miniſtry and began to
preach the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to ſome other <hi>Texts</hi>
which ſpeak of his exiſtence before
his Incarnation, as that he was <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with his Father before the World was,</hi>
and <hi>before Abraham was, I am:</hi> Theſe
they interpret thus, that <hi>he was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with his Father before the World was,</hi>
and that he was before <hi>Abraham was,
viz.</hi> in the Divine foreknowledg and
Decree: But then ſurely they do not
conſider that this is nothing but what
might have been ſaid of any other
man and even of <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf,
that <hi>before he was,</hi> that is, before he
had a real and actual exiſtence he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103163:43"/>
was in the purpoſe and Decree of
God, that is, before he was, God
did intend he ſhould be: Which is a
ſenſe ſo very flat, that I can hardly
abſtain from ſaying it is ridiculous.
For certainly our <hi>Saviour</hi> did intend
by ſaying this of himſelf to give
himſelf ſome preference and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
above <hi>Abraham,</hi> which this ſenſe
and interpretation does not in the
leaſt do: Becauſe of any other man,
as well as of our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi> it may
as truly be ſaid that he was in the
foreknowledg and Decree of God
before <hi>Abraham</hi> was born.</p>
            <p>And I cannot but obſerve further,
that our <hi>Saviour</hi> does not ſay before
<hi>Abraham</hi> was, I was; but <hi>before Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
was,</hi> I AM: Which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Name</hi> of God, whereby is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the eternal duration and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
of his Being: In which ſenſe
he is ſaid by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
to be <hi>the ſame yeſterday,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 8.</note> 
               <hi>to day, and for
ever;</hi> And ſo likewiſe he deſcribes
himſelf in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Viſion,<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>I am <gap reason="foreign">

that this is ſpoken of the <hi>Son</hi> you may
ſee in the ſame <hi>Chapter,</hi> where he
ſays of himſelf,<note place="margin">v. 17.</note> 
               <hi>I am the firſt and the

himſelf again,<note place="margin">Rev. 22. 13.</note>

and the end, the firſt and the laſt:</hi>
And that we may not doubt who it
is that thus deſcribes his own <hi>Eternity,</hi>
he continuing ſtill to ſpeak in the
ſame Perſon ſays,<note place="margin">v. 16.</note> 
               <hi>I Jeſus have ſent
mine Angel,</hi> &amp;c. After this I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerve that all theſe expreſſions
are the common Deſcription which
the Scripture gives of the Eternity
of God, whoſe Being is commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
to all the ſeveral reſpects of
<hi>Duration, paſt, preſent,</hi> and <hi>to come:</hi>
Beſides that the Attribute of <hi>Almighty</hi>
is alſo a part of this Deſcription,
which is ſo peculiar a Property of
God, I mean of <hi>Him</hi> who is <hi>God by
Nature,</hi> that the <hi>Scripture</hi> never gives
it to any other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:103163:44"/>
II. I ſhall in the next place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
thoſe <hi>Texts</hi> which do expreſly
affirm <hi>that the World and all Creatures
whatſoever were made by him:</hi> And this
will not only infer his exiſtence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Incarnation, but from all
Eternity.</p>
            <p>And for this, beſides this <hi>Paſſage</hi>
of St. <hi>John,</hi> we have the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> moſt expreſs, who ſays
that <hi>by him God made the Worlds:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> And
St. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe ſays the ſame more
fully and particularly,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 1. 15, 16.</note> calling <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> who was the <hi>Son of God, the
firſt born of every Creature,</hi> that is, as
I have ſhewn in my former Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
the <hi>Heir</hi> and <hi>Lord of the whole
Creation: For by him,</hi> ſays he, <hi>were
all things created, that are in Heaven
and that are in Earth, viſible and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
Whether they be Thrones or Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Principalities or Powers,</hi> for ſo he
calls the ſeveral <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Angels: all
things were created by him and for him, and
he is before all things:</hi> Or, as he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103163:45"/>
in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Viſion, he <hi>is the
beginning of the Creation of God,</hi> that
is, the <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Efficient Cauſe of
the Creation;</hi> or elſe, he was when
all things began to be made, and
therefore muſt be before any thing
was created, and for that reaſon could
not be a Creature himſelf; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
muſt of neceſſity have
been from all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Now theſe <hi>Texts</hi> muſt neceſſarily
be underſtood of the <hi>old Creation</hi> and
of the <hi>natural</hi> World, and not of the
<hi>moral</hi> World, and the <hi>Renovation</hi> and
Reformation of the minds and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of men by the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> For <hi>that</hi>
was only the World here below
which was reform'd by him, and not
<hi>things in Heaven;</hi> not the <hi>inviſible</hi>
World, not the ſeveral Orders of
<hi>good Angels, which kept their firſt ſtation</hi>
and have no need to be reform'd and
made anew: Nor the <hi>Devil</hi> and his
<hi>evil Angels;</hi> for though ſince the
preaching of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> they have
been under greater reſtraint and kept
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103163:45"/>
more within bounds, yet we have
no reaſon to think that they are
at all reform'd, but are <hi>Devils</hi> ſtill,
and have the ſame malice and mind
to do all the miſchief to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
that God will ſuffer them to
do.</p>
            <p>So that theſe <hi>Texts</hi> ſeem at firſt
view to be very plain and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of themſelves, but they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be much more convincing
when we conſider the groundleſs
interpretations whereby they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to evade the dint and
force of them. For can any man
that ſeriouſly attends to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
ſtyle and Phraſe of the <hi>New
Teſtament,</hi> and to the plain ſcope and
drift of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s reaſoning in theſe
<hi>Texts,</hi> be induc'd to believe that
when St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that <hi>all things
were created by him, that are in Heaven
and that are in Earth, viſible and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
whether they be Thrones, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
or Principalities, or Powers:</hi>
I ſay, can any man of good ſenſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103163:46"/>
perſuade himſelf that by all this
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> means no more than
the <hi>moral Renovation</hi> of the <hi>World
here below,</hi> and the Reformation of
Mankind by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his
<hi>Goſpel</hi> which was preach'd unto
them?</p>
            <p>But there is yet one <hi>Text</hi> more
to this purpoſe, which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
to the laſt place; becauſe I
find <hi>Schlictingius</hi> and <hi>Crellius,</hi> in
their joint <hi>Comment</hi> upon it, to
be put to their laſt ſhifts to avoid
the force of it. It is in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi>
to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> at the beginning
of it: Where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
the <hi>Son of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>God,</hi> ſays
he, <hi>hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken to
us by his Son, whom he hath conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
heir of all things, by whom alſo he
made the Worlds:</hi> From whence he
argues the excellency of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>
above the <hi>Law:</hi> For the <hi>Law</hi> was
given by <hi>Angels,</hi> but the <hi>Goſpel</hi> by
the <hi>Son of God;</hi> whoſe prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
above the <hi>Angels</hi> he ſhews
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103163:46"/>
at large in the two <hi>firſt Chapters</hi> of
this <hi>Epiſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this end he proves the
<hi>two</hi> parts of the Deſcription which
had been given of him, namely,
that God had <hi>conſtituted him heir of all
things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 2.</note> and that <hi>by Him he made the
Worlds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God had <hi>conſtituted
him heir of all things,</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
ſaid of the <hi>Angels:</hi> But of
<hi>him</hi> it is ſaid that was <hi>made ſo
much better than the Angels, as he hath
by inheritance obtained a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Name than they:</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 7.</note> The <hi>Angels</hi>
are only called God's <hi>Miniſters,</hi> for
which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> cites the words
of the <hi>Pſalmiſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 104. 4.</note> but to <hi>Chriſt</hi> he
gives the Title of <hi>his Son,</hi> and <hi>his
firſt begotten,</hi> by virtue whereof he is
<hi>heir of all things:</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 6.</note> 
               <hi>For to which of the
Angels ſaid he at any time, thou art my
Son, this day have I begotten thee?</hi>
And this I will agree with them to be
ſpoken of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with reſpect to his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103163:47"/>
Reſurrection, by which, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
tells us,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 4.</note> he was <hi>powerfully declared
to be the Son of God.</hi> This is the <hi>firſt</hi>
Prerogative of <hi>Chriſt</hi> above the <hi>Angels:</hi>
But there is a far greater yet behind;
for he proves,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he had not only the
Title of <hi>God</hi> given him; but that he
was <hi>truly and really God,</hi> becauſe <hi>he
made the World.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 8.</note> That the Title of
<hi>God</hi> was given him he proves by a
citation out of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 45. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>But unto
the Son he ſaith, Thy Throne, O God, is
for ever and ever,</hi> &amp;c. And that he
was <hi>truly and really God</hi> becauſe <hi>he
made the World,</hi> he proves by a cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
out of another <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where
it is ſaid of him,<note place="margin">v. 10, 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>Thou, Lord, in
the beginning haſt laid the foundations

            <p>Let us now ſee how <hi>Schlictin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
and <hi>Crellius</hi> interpret this <hi>Text</hi>
cited out of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> by the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> as ſpoken of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> They
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103163:47"/>

Epiſtle <hi>could not have referr'd

the Creation of Heaven and

for granted that Chriſt is the

neceſſarily be</hi> by thoſe who
take this for granted, <hi>to be

<hi>Chriſt. For ſince all the words
of the Pſalm are manifeſtly
ſpoken of the moſt High God,
but that Chriſt is that God is
not ſignified no not ſo much as
by one word in that Pſalm, it is
neceſſary that if you will have
theſe words to be directed to
Chriſt, you muſt take it for
granted that Chriſt is that moſt
High God of whom the Pſalmiſt
there ſpeaks.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:103163:48"/>
Now we will join iſſue with theſe
<hi>Interpreters</hi> upon this <hi>Conceſſion, viz.</hi>
that <hi>the Author</hi> of this <hi>Epiſtle could not
have referr'd theſe words, which ſpeak of
the Creation of Heaven and Earth, to
Chriſt, without taking it for granted that
Chriſt</hi> is truly <hi>that God</hi> who made the
World. And if the <hi>Author</hi> of this
<hi>Epiſtle</hi> does affirm theſe words of the
<hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to be ſpoken of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then
they muſt acknowledge <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be
the <hi>true God who made Heaven and Earth:</hi>
But the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> does as
evidently affirm theſe words to be
ſpoken <hi>to</hi> or <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> as he does the
words of any other <hi>Text</hi> cited in this
<hi>Chapter:</hi> And for this I appeal to the
common ſenſe of every man that
reads them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Interpreters indeed are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
that the <hi>latter</hi> part of this <hi>Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
ſhould be ſpoken of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but
not the <hi>former:</hi> But why not the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
as well as the latter? when they
have ſo expreſly told us that <hi>all the
words of this Pſalm are manifeſtly ſpoken
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103163:48"/>
of God.</hi> What is the myſtery of this?
Could they not as eaſily have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
the <hi>former part</hi> which ſpeaks of
the <hi>Creation of Heaven and Earth,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>moral World,</hi> and the <hi>new
Creation</hi> or Reformation of Mankind
by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as well
as ſo many other plain <hi>Texts</hi> to the
ſame purpoſe? No doubt they could
as well have done it, and have ſet as
good a face upon it when they had
done it. But why then did they not
do it? It was for a reaſon which they
had no mind to tell, but yet is not
hard to be gueſſed at, <hi>namely,</hi> that if
they had admitted the <hi>former</hi> words
to have been ſpoken of <hi>Chriſt</hi> they
knew not what to do with the <hi>latter</hi>
part of this <hi>Citation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>They ſhall periſh,
but thou remaineſt; they ſhall wax old as
agarment, and as a veſture ſhalt thou fold
them up, and they ſhall be changed.</hi>
What ſhall <hi>periſh,</hi> and <hi>wax old,</hi> and <hi>be
changed?</hi> Why, the <hi>Earth</hi> and the
<hi>Heavens</hi> which the <hi>Son</hi> had made,
that is, the <hi>moral World,</hi> the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103163:49"/>
of Mankind, and the <hi>new
Creation</hi> of things by the Goſpel: All
theſe muſt have undergone the ſame
fate with the <hi>natural World,</hi> and muſt
not only have been defaced, but ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
deſtroy'd and brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
This they would not ſay,
but they did ſee it, tho they would
not ſeem to ſee it: And we may
plainly ſee by this, that they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
a <hi>Text</hi> right when neceſſity
forceth them to it, and they cannot
without great inconvenience to their
Cauſe avoid it: But when men have
once reſolv'd to hold faſt an Opinion
they have taken up, it then becomes
not only convenient but neceſſary
to underſtand nothing that makes
againſt it: And this is truly the
preſent caſe. But in the mean
time where is ingenuity and love of
Truth?</p>
            <p>And thus I have, with all the
clearneſs and brevity I could,
ſearch'd to the very foundations
of this new Interpretation of this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103163:49"/>
               <hi>Paſſage</hi> of the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> upon which
the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Son of God</hi> is ſo
firmly eſtabliſhed; and likewiſe of
the groſs miſinterpretations of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other <hi>Texts</hi> to the ſame purpoſe
in this <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> and in other <hi>Books</hi>
of the <hi>New Teſtament:</hi> All which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
I have endeavoured to
ſhew to be not only contrary to the
ſenſe of all <hi>Antiquity,</hi> of which as
<hi>Socinus</hi> had but little knowledge, ſo
he ſeems to have made but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
but to be alſo evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the perpetual tenour and
ſtyle of the <hi>H. Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I go off from this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I cannot but take notice of
one thing wherein our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> in
this <hi>Cauſe</hi> do perpetually glory as a
mighty advantage which they think
they have over us in this <hi>Point</hi> of the
<hi>Divinity of the Son of God,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in that other <hi>Point of the B.
Trinity: namely,</hi> that they have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
clearly on <hi>their</hi> Side in this <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy,</hi>
and that the Difficulties and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103163:50"/>
are much greater and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
on <hi>our</hi> part than on <hi>theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here they are pleas'd to triumph
without modeſty, and without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
And yet notwithſtanding this,
I am not afraid here likewiſe to join
iſſue with them, and am contented
to have this matter brought to a fair
Trial at the Bar of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as well
as of <hi>Scripture</hi> expounded by the
general <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Church: I ſay by general <hi>Tradition,</hi>
which next to <hi>Scripture</hi> is the beſt and
ſureſt confirmation of this great
<hi>Point</hi> now in queſtion between us,
and that which gives us the greateſt
and trueſt light for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the true ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Scripture</hi> not only in <hi>this,</hi> but
in moſt other important <hi>Doctrines</hi> of
the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>I am not without ſome <hi>good hopes,</hi>
I will not ſay <hi>confidence,</hi> for I never
thought <hi>that</hi> to be ſo great an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to any Cauſe as ſome men
would be glad to make others believe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103163:50"/>
it is, hoping to help and ſupport a
weak Argument by a ſtrong and
mighty confidence: But ſurely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
never hurt any <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and the
<hi>confidence of man</hi> ſeems to me to be
much like <hi>the wrath of man,</hi> which

of God,</hi> that is, it never does
any good, it never ſerves any wiſe
and real purpoſe of Religion:</p>
            <p>I ſay, I am not without ſome
good hopes, that I have in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<hi>Diſcourſes</hi> clearly ſhewn that
the tenour of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>general
Tradition</hi> are on our Side in this <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and therefore I ſhall not need
to give my ſelf the trouble to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
this matter over again.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Point of <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
the great <hi>Difficulty</hi> and <hi>Abſurdity,</hi>
which they object to our <hi>Doctrine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this <hi>Myſtery,</hi> amounts to
thus much, that it is not only above
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> but plainly contrary to it.</p>
            <p>As to its being above <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
which they are loth to admit any
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103163:51"/>
thing to be; this I think will bear
no great Diſpute: Becauſe if they
would be pleaſed to ſpeak out, they
can mean no more by this, but that
our <hi>Reaſon</hi> is not able fully to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it: But what then? Are
there no <hi>Myſteries</hi> in Religion? <hi>That</hi>
I am ſure they will not ſay, becauſe
God whoſe infinite Nature and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are the very Foundation of
all Religion is certainly the greateſt
<hi>Myſtery</hi> of all other, and the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible:
But <hi>we</hi> muſt not,
nay <hi>they</hi> will not for this reaſon deny,
that there is ſuch a Being as God.
And therefore if there be <hi>Myſteries</hi>
in Religion, it is no reaſonable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
againſt them that we cannot
fully comprehend them: Becauſe
all <hi>Myſteries</hi> in what kind ſoever,
whether in <hi>Religion</hi> or in <hi>Nature,</hi> ſo
long, and ſo far as they are <hi>Myſteries,</hi>
are for that very reaſon incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible.</p>
            <p>But they urge the matter much
further, that <hi>this</hi> particular <hi>Myſtery</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:103163:51"/>
now under debate is plainly contrary
to <hi>Reaſon:</hi> And if they can make this
good, I will confeſs that they have
gained a great Point upon us. But
then they are to be put in mind, that
to make this good againſt us they
muſt clearly ſhew ſome plain <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
in this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which I could
never yet ſee done by any. Great
<hi>Difficulty</hi> I acknowledge there is in
the explication of it, in which the
further we go, beyond what God
hath thought fit to reveal to us in
<hi>Scripture</hi> concerning it, the more we
are entangled, and that which men
are pleaſed to call an <hi>explaining</hi> of it,
does in my apprehenſion often make
it more obſcure, that is, leſs plain
than it was before; which does not
ſo very well agree with a pretence of
<hi>Explication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then I fix my foot: That
there are <hi>three</hi> Differences in the <hi>Deity,</hi>
which the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſpeaks of by the
Names of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>H. Ghoſt,</hi>
and every where ſpeaks of them as
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103163:52"/>
we uſe to do of <hi>three</hi> diſtinct <hi>Perſons:</hi>
And therefore I ſee no reaſon why in
this Argument we ſhould nicely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from uſing the word <hi>Perſon;</hi>
though I remember that St. <hi>Jerome</hi>
does ſomewhere deſire to be excuſed
from it.</p>
            <p>Now concerning theſe <hi>Three</hi> I
might in the firſt place urge that plain
and expreſs <hi>Text,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 5. 7.</note> 
               <hi>There are three that
bear record in Heaven, the Father, the
Word, and the H. Ghoſt; and theſe three
are one:</hi> But upon this I will not now
inſiſt, becauſe it is pretended that in
ſome <hi>Copies</hi> of greateſt antiquity this
<hi>Verſe</hi> is omitted; the contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is I think capable of being made
out very clearly: But this matter
would be too long to be debated at
preſent.</p>
            <p>However that be, thus much is
certain and cannot be deni'd, that
our <hi>Saviour</hi> commanded his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to
<hi>baptize all Nations in the name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And
that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in their <hi>Epiſtles</hi> do in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103163:52"/>
their moſt uſual form of <hi>Benediction</hi>
join theſe Three together: And it is
yet further certain, that not only the
Name and Title of <hi>God,</hi> but the
moſt <hi>incommunicable Properties</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
of the <hi>Deity,</hi> are in <hi>Scripture</hi>
frequently aſcribed to the <hi>Son</hi> and
the <hi>H. Ghoſt;</hi> one <hi>Property</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
which is peculiar to the
<hi>Father</hi> as he is the <hi>Principle</hi> and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the <hi>Deity,</hi> that he is of <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>
and of no other; which is not,
nor can be ſaid of the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>H.
Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let any man ſhew any plain
and downright <hi>Contradiction</hi> in all
this; or any other <hi>Difficulty</hi> beſides
this, that the particular manner of
the exiſtence of theſe three <hi>Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
or <hi>Perſons</hi> in the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi>
expreſs'd in <hi>Scripture</hi> by the Names
of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> aud <hi>H. Ghoſt,</hi> is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible</hi>
by our <hi>finite</hi> Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and <hi>inexplicable</hi> by us: In which
I do not ſee what Abſurdity there is,
ſince our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> cannot deny that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103163:53"/>
many things certainly are, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
manner of whoſe exiſtence
we can neither comprehend, nor
explain.</p>
            <p>Let us now ſee, whether the <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
of our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> hath not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Difficulties</hi> in it, and more palpable
<hi>Abſurdities</hi> following from it. They
ſay, that the <hi>Son of God</hi> is <hi>a mere
Creature;</hi> not God <hi>by Nature,</hi> and
yet truly and really God by <hi>Office</hi>
and by Divine appointment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
to whom the very ſame
Honour and Worſhip is to be given
which we give to <hi>Him</hi> who is God
by <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And can they diſcern no <hi>Difficulty,</hi>
no <hi>Abſurdity</hi> in this? What? no <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity</hi>
in bringing <hi>Idolatry</hi> by a <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door</hi>
into the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, one
main Deſign whereof was to baniſh
Idolatry out of the World? And
will they in good earneſt conteſt
this matter with us, that the giving
<hi>Divine Worſhip</hi> to <hi>a mere Creature</hi> is not
<hi>Idolatry?</hi> And can they vindicate
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103163:53"/>
themſelves in this Point any other
way, than what will in a great
meaſure acquit both the <hi>Pagans</hi> and
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> from the charge of <hi>Idolatry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What? no <hi>Abſurdity</hi> in a <hi>God</hi> as it
were <hi>but of yeſterday?</hi> in a <hi>Creature
God,</hi> in a God merely by <hi>poſitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;</hi>
and this in oppoſition to a
plain <hi>moral Precept</hi> of eternal obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to the fix'd and immutable
Nature and Reaſon of things?</p>
            <p>So that to avoid the <hi>ſhadow</hi> and
appearance of a <hi>Plurality</hi> of <hi>Deities</hi>
they run <hi>really</hi> into it, and for any
thing I can ſee into downright Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 25.</note>
by <hi>worſhipping a Creature beſides
the Creator, who is bleſſed for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They</hi> can by no means allow <hi>two</hi>
Gods by <hi>Nature;</hi> no more can <hi>we:</hi>
But they can willingly admit of <hi>two</hi>
Gods; the <hi>one</hi> by <hi>Nature,</hi> and the
<hi>other</hi> by <hi>Office,</hi> to whom they are
content to pay the ſame <hi>Honour</hi>
which is due to <hi>Him</hi> who is God by
<hi>Nature.</hi> Provided <hi>Chriſt</hi> will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be but a <hi>Creature,</hi> they will
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103163:54"/>
deal more liberally with him in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way than in reaſon is fit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And do they ſee no abſurdity in
all this? nothing that is contrary to
<hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>good ſenſe?</hi> nothing that
feels like <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> and Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
Do they conſider how often
God hath declar'd that <hi>he will not give
his glory to another?</hi> And that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
deſcribes <hi>Idolatry</hi> to be, the giving
<hi>ſervice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4 8.</note> or worſhip, to things <hi>which
by Nature are no Gods?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely if <hi>Reaſon</hi> guided by <hi>Divine
Revelation</hi> were to chuſe a God, it
would make choice of one who is
declared in <hi>Scripture</hi> to be <hi>the only
begotten of the Father, the firſt and the
laſt, the beginning and the end, the ſame
yeſterday, to day, and for ever:</hi> much
rather than a <hi>mere Creature,</hi> who did
not begin to be till about <hi>ſeventeen
hundred</hi> years ago.</p>
            <p>I only propoſe theſe things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any artificial aggravation, to
<hi>their</hi> moſt ſerious and impartial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration;
after which I cannot
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103163:54"/>
think that theſe great <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
can think it ſo eaſy a matter to
extricate themſelves out of theſe
<hi>Difficulties.</hi> The <hi>God of Truth</hi> lead
us into all Truth, and enlighten the
minds of thoſe who are in Error,
and <hi>give</hi> them <hi>Repentance to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of the Truth:</hi> For <hi>his</hi> ſake
who is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much may ſuffice to have
ſaid upon this Argument, which I
am ſenſible is mere Controverſy: A
thing which I ſeldom meddle with,
and do not delight to dwell upon.
But my <hi>Text</hi> which is ſo very proper
for this <hi>Seaſon</hi> hath almoſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
engaged me in it: Beſides, that
I think it a <hi>Point</hi> of that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to be
well inſtructed in it. And I have
choſen rather once for all to handle it
fully and to go to the bottom of it,
than in every <hi>Sermon</hi> to be flurting at
it, without ſaying any thing to the
purpoſe againſt it: A way which in
my opinion is neither proper to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103163:55"/>
men in the truth nor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them of their Error.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only at preſent make this
ſhort reflection upon the whole:
That we ought to treat the <hi>Holy
Scriptures</hi> as the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> with
all reverence and ſubmiſſion of mind
to the Doctrine therein revealed:
And to interpret them with that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
and ſimplicity which is due to
the ſincere Declarations of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for the inſtruction and not
for the deception and deluſion of
men: I ſay, we ſhould treat them as
the <hi>Oracles</hi> of God, and not like the
<hi>doubtful Oracles</hi> of the <hi>Heathen Deities,
that is,</hi> in truth of the <hi>Devil;</hi> which
were contrived and calculated on
purpoſe to deceive, containing and
for the moſt part intending a ſenſe
directly contrary to the appearing
and moſt obvious meaning of the
Words: For the <hi>Devil</hi> was the firſt
<hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Equivocation;</hi> though the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> have ſince made it a lawful
way of lying, which <hi>their Father</hi> of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103163:55"/>
whom they learn'd it had not credit
and authority enough to do.</p>
            <p>And it deſerves likewiſe to be very
well conſidered by us, that nothing
hath given a greater force to the
Exceptions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
againſt the <hi>H. Scripture's</hi> being a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
and certain Rule of Faith,
than the uncertainty into which they
have brought the plaineſt <hi>Texts</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
for the eſtabliſhing of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of greateſt moment in the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, by their remote
and wreſted interpretation of them:
Which way of dealing with them
ſeems to be really more contumelious
to thoſe <hi>H. Oracles,</hi> than the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
rejecting of their Authority:
Becauſe this is a fair and open way
of attacquing them, whereas the
other is an inſiduous, and therefore
more dangerous way of undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them.</p>
            <p>But as for us who do in good
earneſt believe the Divine Authority
of the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> let us take all
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103163:56"/>
our Doctrines and Opinions from
thoſe clear Fountains of Truth, not
diſturb'd and darkned by ſearching
anxiouſly into all the poſſible Senſes
that the ſeveral words and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Scripture</hi> can bear, and by
forcing that ſenſe upon them which
is moſt remote and unnatural, and
in the mean time wilfully overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and paſſing by that ſenſe which
is moſt obvious and eaſie to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
apprehenſion of any unbyaſs'd
and impartial Reader. This is to
uſe the <hi>H. Scriptures</hi> as the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> have done many Holy and
good men whom they are pleaſed to
brand with the odious Name of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi>
to torture them till they
ſpeak the mind of their Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
though never ſo contrary to
their own.</p>
            <p>I will now conclude this whole
Diſcourſe with a <hi>Saying</hi> which I heard
from a great and judicious Man,
<hi>Non amo nimis argutam Theologiam, I
love no Doctrines in Divinity which ſtand
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103163:56"/>
ſo very much upon quirk and ſubtilty.</hi>
And I cannot upon this occaſion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to ſay, that thoſe Doctrines of
Religion and thoſe Interpretations
of <hi>Scripture</hi> have ever been to me
the moſt ſuſpected, which need
abundance of Wit and a great
many <hi>Criticiſms</hi> to make them out:
And conſidering the Wiſdom and
Goodneſs of Almighty God, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſibly believe but that all
things neceſſary to be believ'd and
practis'd by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in order to
their eternal Salvation are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contain'd in the <hi>H. Scriptures:</hi>
God ſurely hath not dealt ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with Mankind as to make any
thing neceſſary to be believ'd or
practis'd by us which he hath not
made ſufficiently plain to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of the unlearned as well as
of the learned. God forbid that
it ſhould be impoſſible for any
man to be ſaved and to get to
Heaven without a great deal of
learning to direct and carry him
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103163:57"/>
thither, when the far greateſt part
of Mankind have no learning at
all. It was well ſaid by <hi>Eraſmus,
That it was never well with the Chriſtian
World ſince it began to be a matter of ſo
much Subtilty and Wit for a man to be a
true Chriſtian.</hi>

Occaſion of the Annual Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration
of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity</hi>
of our <hi>B. Lord and Saviour,</hi> I
began to diſcourſe to you upon theſe
Words: In which I told you were

our <hi>Saviour</hi> the Author and
Founder of our <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> His <hi>Life</hi> and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here amongſt us; <hi>and dwelt among
us, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he pitched his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
among us,</hi> he lived here below
in this World, and for ſome time
made his reſidence and abode with
us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That in this ſtate of his
Humiliation he gave great and
clear evidence of his Divinity:
Whilſt he appear'd as a Man and
lived amongſt us, there were great
and glorious Teſtimonies given of
Him that he was the Son of God;
and that in ſo peculiar a manner as
no Creature can be ſaid to be: <hi>And
we beheld his Glory, the Glory as of the
only begotten of the Father, full of grace
and truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I began with the firſt of theſe,
namely his <hi>Incarnation, the Word was
made fleſh:</hi> For the full and clear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of which words I propoſed
to conſider theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:103163:58"/>
I. The <hi>Perſon</hi> here ſpoken of and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
who it is that is here ſaid to be incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
or made <hi>fleſh,</hi> namely <hi>the Word.</hi>
And this I have handled at large in
my two former <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> upon this
<hi>Text.</hi> I ſhall now proceed in the</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Second</hi> place to give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
of the nature and manner of
this <hi>Incarnation,</hi> ſo far as the <hi>Scripture</hi>
hath thought fit to reveal and declare
this Myſtery to us. <hi>The Word was
made fleſh,</hi> that is, He who is perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
called the <hi>Word,</hi> and whom the
<hi>Evangeliſt</hi> hath ſo fully and clearly
deſcribed in the beginning of his
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> he <hi>became fleſh,</hi> that is, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
our Nature and became <hi>man;</hi>
for ſo the word <hi>fleſh</hi> is frequently uſed
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> for <hi>Man</hi> or Human
Nature.</p>
            <p>So that by the <hi>Word's</hi> becoming
<hi>fleſh,</hi> that is, <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> did
not only intend to expreſs to us that
he aſſumed a human <hi>Body</hi> without a
<hi>Soul,</hi> but that he became a <hi>perfect
Man,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Soul</hi> and Body
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103163:59"/>
united. It is very probable indeed
that the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> did purpoſely chuſe
the word <hi>fleſh,</hi> which ſignifies the
frail and mortal part of Humanity,
to denote to us the great condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Son of God</hi> in aſſuming our
Nature with all its infirmities, and
becoming ſubject to frailty and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
for our ſake.</p>
            <p>Having thus explain'd the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this <hi>Propoſition,</hi> the <hi>Word was
made fleſh,</hi> I ſhall in a further proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of this Argument take into
conſideration theſe <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
what may reaſonably be ſuppos'd
to be implied in this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Word's being made fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall conſider the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi>
which are commonly brought
againſt this <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Son of
God</hi> from the ſeeming impoſſibility,
or incongruity of the thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And becauſe, after all
that can be ſaid in anſwer to thoſe <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,</hi>
it may ſtill appear to us very
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103163:59"/>
ſtrange that God who could without
all this circumſtance, and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
even almoſt beneath the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of the Great God, at leaſt as
we are apt to think, have given
Laws to Mankind, and have offer'd
forgiveneſs of Sins and eternal life
upon their Repentance for ſins paſt,
and ſincere tho imperfect obedience
for the future; I ſay, it may ſeem
ſtrange, that notwithſtanding this
God ſhould yet make choice of this
way and method of our Salvation:
I ſhall therefore in the laſt place en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to give ſome probable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this ſtrange and wonderful
Diſpenſation, and ſhew that it was
done in great condeſcenſion to the
weakneſs and common prejudices of
Mankind; and that when it is
throughly conſider'd it will appear
to be much more for our comfort and
advantage than any other way which
the wiſdom of this World would
have been apt to deviſe and pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And in all this I ſhall, all along
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103163:60"/>
take either the plain declarations of
<hi>Scripture,</hi> or the pregnant intimations
of it for my ground and guide.</p>
            <p>I. I ſhall conſider more diſtinctly
<hi>what may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in this expreſſion of the Word's being
made fleſh,</hi> namely, theſe <hi>five</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>truth and reality of the
thing:</hi> That the Son of God did not
only appear in the form of human
fleſh, but did really aſſume it: <hi>the
Word was made fleſh,</hi> as the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi>
expreſly declares: For if this had
been only a <hi>Phantaſme</hi> and <hi>Apparition,</hi>
as ſome <hi>Hereticks</hi> of old did fancy, it
would in all probability have been
like the appearance of <hi>Angels</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> ſudden and
of ſhort continuance, and would
after a little while have vaniſh'd and
diſappear'd. But <hi>he dwelt among us</hi>
and convers'd familiarly with us a
long time, and for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and the <hi>Scripture</hi> uſeth all the
expreſſions which are proper to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
a real <hi>Man,</hi> and a real <hi>Human
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103163:60"/>
Body,</hi> and there were all the ſigns
and evidences of reality that could
be: For the <hi>Word</hi> is ſaid to be made
<hi>fleſh,</hi> and Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>of the
ſeed of David according to the fleſh,</hi> and
to be <hi>made of a Woman;</hi> and all this to
ſhew that he was a real <hi>Man,</hi> and had
a real and ſubſtantial <hi>Body:</hi> For he
was born, and by degrees grew up to
be a <hi>Man,</hi> and did perform all ſuch
actions as are natural and proper to
Men: He continued a great while
in the World, and at laſt ſuffer'd and
dy'd, and was laid in the grave; He
did not vaniſh and diſappear like a
Phantaſme or Spirit, but he dyed
like other Men: And his Body was
raiſed again out of the grave; and
after he was riſen, he converſed forty
days upon Earth, and permitted his
body to be handled, and laſt of all
was viſibly taken up into Heaven.</p>
            <p>So that either we muſt grant Him
to have had a real Body, or we have
cauſe to doubt whether all Mankind
be not mere Phantaſms and Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103163:61"/>
For greater evidence no man
can give that he is really clothed
with and carries about him a true and
ſubſtantial Body, than the <hi>Son of God</hi>
did <hi>in the days of his fleſh.</hi> It is to me
very wonderful upon what ground,
or indeed to what end, the <hi>Hereticks</hi>
of old, <hi>Marcion</hi> and others, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the reality of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s fleſh. Surely
they had a great mind to be <hi>Hereticks</hi>
who took up ſo ſenſleſs an <hi>Opinion</hi> for
no reaſon, and to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another thing implyed
in the <hi>Word's being made fleſh, is, that
this was done peculiarly for the benefit and
advantage of Men: The Word was made
fleſh,</hi> that is, became <hi>Man;</hi> for ſo I
have ſhewn the word <hi>fleſh</hi> to be often
uſed in <hi>Scripture.</hi> And this the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
of the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
takes very ſpecial notice of as a great
grace and favour of God to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that his <hi>Son</hi> appear'd in our
Nature, and conſequently for our
Salvation; as it is ſaid in the <hi>Nicene
Creed, who for us Men and for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103163:61"/>
came down from Heaven, and
was incarnate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For verily,</hi> ſays the
<hi>Apoſtle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>He took not on him the nature
of Angels, but of the ſeed of Abraham,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he did
not aſſume the Angelical Nature,</hi> ſo our
<hi>Translators</hi> underſtood the phraſe;
but the word alſo ſignifies <hi>to take
hold</hi> of a thing which is falling, as
well as to <hi>aſſume</hi> or <hi>take on him: He
did not take hold of the Angels</hi> when
they were falling, but ſuffered them
to lapſe irrecoverably into miſery
and ruine: But <hi>he took hold</hi> of Human
Nature when it was falling, and
particularly <hi>of the Seed of Abraham,</hi>
and by <hi>the Seed of Abraham,</hi> that is,
by <hi>himſelf, in whom all the Nations of the
Earth were bleſſed,</hi> he brought Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
firſt to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and then to
the reſt of Mankind. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
chuſes to derive this <hi>Bleſſing</hi> from
<hi>Abraham,</hi> that ſo he might bring it
nearer to the <hi>Jews</hi> to whom he wrote
this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> and might thereby more
effectually recommend the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103163:62"/>
them, and the <hi>glad tidings</hi> of that
<hi>great Salvation</hi> in which they had ſo
peculiar an intereſt.</p>
            <p>And it is ſome confirmation of the
interpretation I have given of that
expreſſion <hi>he took not on him,</hi> &amp;c. that
the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> uſes the very ſame
word for <hi>taking hold</hi> of one that was
ready to ſink: For ſo it is ſaid of
St. <hi>Peter</hi> when he was <hi>ready to ſink,</hi>
that <hi>Chriſt put forth his hand <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and caught hold of him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 14. 31.</note> and ſaved him
from drowning: And thus the <hi>Son of
God caught hold</hi> of Mankind which
was ready to ſink into eternal perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
He <hi>laid hold</hi> of our Nature, or
as it is expreſs'd in the ſame <hi>Chapter,
he took part of fleſh and blood,</hi> that in
our Nature he might be capable of
effecting our Redemption and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
            <p>But it is no where ſaid in <hi>Scripture,</hi>
not the leaſt intimation given there,
that the <hi>Son of God</hi> ever ſhew'd ſuch
grace and favour to the Angels: But
<hi>the Word became fleſh,</hi> that is, became
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103163:62"/>
               <hi>Man:</hi> He did not aſſume the <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Nature, but was contented to be
cloathed with the <hi>Rags</hi> of <hi>Humanity,</hi>
and <hi>to be made in the likeneſs of ſinful
fleſh,</hi> that is, <hi>of ſinful Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This expreſſion of <hi>the
Word's being made fleſh</hi> may further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his <hi>aſſuming the infirmities, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to the miſeries of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
This I collect from the word
<hi>fleſh,</hi> by which the <hi>Scripture</hi> often
uſeth to expreſs our frail and mortal
Nature. The <hi>Son of God</hi> did not
only condeſcend to be <hi>made Man,</hi> but
alſo to become mortal and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for our ſakes: He ſubmitted to
all thoſe things which are accounted
moſt grievous and calamitous to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nature: To hunger and want,
to ſhame and contempt, to bitter
pains and agonies, and to a moſt
cruel and diſgraceful death: So that
in this ſenſe alſo <hi>he became fleſh,</hi> not
only by being cloathed with human
nature, but by becoming liable to
all the frailties and ſufferings of it;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103163:63"/>
of which he had a greater ſhare than
any of the Sons of men ever had:
for never was ſorrow like to his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
nor ſuffering like to his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the weight and bitterneſs
whereof was ſuch as to wring from
him, the meekeſt and moſt patient
endurer of ſufferings that ever was,
that doleful complaint, <hi>My God, my
God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In this expreſſion, <hi>the
Word was made Fleſh,</hi> is likewiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>the Union of the Divinity with
Human Nature in one Perſon.</hi> And
this the <hi>Text</hi> expreſſeth in ſuch words
as ſeem to ſignifie a moſt perfect,
and intimate, and vital Union of the
<hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>human</hi> Natures of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in
one <hi>Perſon: The Word was made,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came,
<hi>fleſh:</hi> Which what elſe can it
ſignify but one of theſe two things?
Either that the eternal <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>only
begotten Son of God</hi> was changed into
a <hi>Man,</hi> which is not only impoſſible
to be, but impious to imagin: Or
elſe, that the <hi>Son of God</hi> did aſſume
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103163:63"/>
our Nature and became <hi>Man</hi> by his
<hi>Divinity</hi> being united to <hi>human Nature</hi>
as the <hi>Soul</hi> is vitally united to the
<hi>Body;</hi> without either being changed
into it, or confounded with it, or
ſwallowed up by it, as the <hi>Eutychian
Hereticks</hi> fancied the <hi>human Nature</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> to be ſwallowed up of his
<hi>Divinity:</hi> Which had it been ſo,
St. <hi>John</hi> had expreſſed himſelf very
untowardly when he ſays, <hi>The Word
became fleſh;</hi> for it had been quite
contrary, and <hi>fleſh had become the
Word,</hi> being changed into it, and
ſwallowed up by it, and loſt in it.</p>
            <p>The only thing then that we can
reaſonably imagine to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this expreſſion is this, that
the <hi>Son of God</hi> aſſumed <hi>our Nature,</hi>
and united himſelf with it, as our
<hi>Souls</hi> are united with our <hi>Bodies:</hi> And
as the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> united make
one <hi>Perſon,</hi> and yet retain their
diſtinct <hi>Natures</hi> and Properties; ſo
may we conceive the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Natures in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be united
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103163:64"/>
into one <hi>Perſon:</hi> And this without
any change or confuſion of the two
<hi>Natures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, the <hi>Divinity</hi> united it ſelf
with <hi>human Nature:</hi> For though <hi>fleſh</hi>
be only mentioned in the <hi>Text,</hi> yet
he did not <hi>only</hi> aſſume <hi>a human Body,</hi>
which was the Hereſie of <hi>Apollinaris</hi>
and his Followers, upon a miſtake
of <hi>this</hi> and ſome other <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi>
But he aſſumed the <hi>whole human
Nature,</hi> that is, a human <hi>Soul</hi> united
to a real and natural <hi>Body:</hi> for ſo I
have ſhewn the word <hi>fleſh</hi> to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
uſed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> not only
for the <hi>Body</hi> but for the <hi>whole Man,</hi> by
an uſual Figure of ſpeech: As on
the other hand, <hi>Soul</hi> is frequently
uſed for the <hi>whole Man</hi> or <hi>Perſon:</hi> So
many <hi>Souls</hi> are ſaid to have gone
down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> that is,
ſo many <hi>Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this I need not inſiſt longer
upon, our <hi>Saviour</hi> being ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and ſo expreſly ſaid to
be a <hi>Man;</hi> which could with no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103163:64"/>
of ſpeech have been ſaid, had
he only aſſumed a <hi>human Body:</hi> Nor
could he have been ſaid to have been
<hi>made in all things like unto us, ſin only
excepted,</hi> had he only had a human
<hi>Body</hi> but not a <hi>Soul:</hi> For then the
meaning muſt have been, that he
had been <hi>made in all things like unto us,</hi>
that is, like to a <hi>Man,</hi> that only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
which chiefly makes the <hi>Man,</hi>
that is, the <hi>Soul:</hi> And the addition
of thoſe words, <hi>Sin only excepted,</hi> had
been no leſs ſtrange; becauſe a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Body,</hi> without a <hi>Soul,</hi> is neither
capable of being ſaid to have Sin, or
to be without it.</p>
            <p>And this may ſuffice to have been
ſpoken in general concerning that
great <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Hypoſtatical,</hi> as
they that love hard words love to call
it, or <hi>Perſonal</hi> Union of the <hi>Divine</hi>
and <hi>human Natures</hi> in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of our
<hi>B. Saviour:</hi> In the more particular
explication whereof it is not ſafe for
our ſhallow underſtandings to wade
further than the <hi>Scripture</hi> goes before
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103163:65"/>
us, for fear we go out of our depth
and loſe our ſelves in the profound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the deep things of God,
which he has not thought fit in this
preſent ſtate of darkneſs and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to reveal more plainly and fully
to us. It ought to be thought ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
that the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſpeaking of
the ſame <hi>Perſon, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our <hi>B.
Saviour,</hi> doth frequently and expreſly
call him both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man:</hi> Which
how it can be ſo eaſily conceived
upon any other Suppoſition than that
of the Union of the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>human
Natures</hi> in one <hi>Perſon,</hi> I muſt confeſs
that I am not able to comprehend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly</hi> and laſtly, All this which
I have ſhewn to be implyed in this
<hi>Propoſition, the Word was made fleſh,</hi>
does ſignifie to us the wonderful and
amazing condeſcenſion and love of
God to Mankind in ſending his <hi>Son</hi>
into the World, and ſubmitting him
to this way and method for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and recovery. <hi>The Word was
made fleſh:</hi> What a ſtep is here made
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103163:65"/>
in order to the reconciling of Men
to God? From <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>Earth;</hi>
from the top of Glory and Majeſty
to the loweſt gulf of meanneſs and
miſery: The <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſeems here
to uſe the word <hi>fleſh,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the meaneſt and vileſt part of
Humanity, to expreſs to us how low
the <hi>Son of God</hi> was contented to
ſtoop for the Redemption of <hi>Man.
The Word was made fleſh:</hi> Two <hi>terms,</hi>
at the greateſt diſtance from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
are here brought together:
The <hi>Son of God</hi> is here expreſſed to
us by one of his higheſt and moſt
glorious Titles, the <hi>Word,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
both <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom; Chriſt
the Power of God, and the Wiſdom of
God,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls him: And
<hi>human Nature</hi> is here deſcribed by its
vileſt part, <hi>fleſh;</hi> which imports
frailty and infirmity: <hi>The Word became
fleſh,</hi> that is, ſubmitted to that from
which it was at the greateſt diſtance:
<hi>He</hi> who was the <hi>Power of God, and
the Wiſdom of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 24.</note> ſubmitted not
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103163:66"/>
only to be called, but really to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a frail and miſerable <hi>Man;</hi> not
only to aſſume our Nature, but to
put on all the infirmities, and which
is the greateſt of all, the <hi>Mortality</hi>
of it.</p>
            <p>And this is the <hi>great Myſtery of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
that is, of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi>
that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be <hi>manifeſted in the
fleſh,</hi> and <hi>become man,</hi> with a moſt
gracious and merciful deſign to bring
man back again to God: That he
ſhould become a miſerable, and a
<hi>mortal</hi> man to ſave us from eternal
<hi>death,</hi> and to make us partakers of
everlaſting <hi>life:</hi> That the <hi>Son of God</hi>
ſhould condeſcend to inhabit our
vile Nature, to wear <hi>Rags</hi> and to
become a <hi>beggar</hi> for our ſakes; and
all this not only to repair thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Ruins which Sin had made in it,
and to reſtore us to our former eſtate;
but to better and advance our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and by degrees to bring us to a
ſtate of much greater perfection and
happineſs than that from which we
fell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:103163:66"/>
And that <hi>he</hi> ſhould <hi>become man</hi> on
purpoſe that he might <hi>dwell among us,</hi>
and converſe with us, and thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſtruct us in our Duty, and ſhew
us the way to eternal life by his
heavenly Doctrine, and as it were
take us by the hand and lead us in
that way by the perfect and familiar
Example of a moſt blameleſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life; ſhewing us how <hi>God himſelf</hi>
thought fit to live in this World,
when he was pleaſed to <hi>become man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That by converſing with us <hi>in the
likeneſs</hi> and nature <hi>of man,</hi> he might
become a <hi>human,</hi> and in ſome ſort
an equal and familiar, an imitable
and encouraging Example of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and goodneſs, of meekneſs
and humility, of patience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to the Will of God under the
foreſt afflictions and ſufferings, and
in a word a moſt perfect Pattern of a
Divine and Heavenly converſation
upon Earth.</p>
            <p>And that by this means we might
for our greater encouragement in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103163:67"/>
and vertue, ſee all that which
the Law of God requires of us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified
in our Nature, and really
performed and practiſed by a <hi>Man</hi>
like our ſelves.</p>
            <p>And that likewiſe in our nature he
might conquer and triumph over the
<hi>two</hi> great Enemies of our Salvation,
the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Devil:</hi> And by firſt
ſuffering <hi>Death,</hi> and then overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, and by reſcuing our nature
from the power of it by his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the dead, he might <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us from the fear of Death,</hi> and give
us the glorious hopes of a bleſſed
<hi>Immortality:</hi> For by aſſuming our
frail and mortal Nature he became
capable of ſuffering and of ſhedding
his precious Blood for us, and by
that means of purchaſing <hi>forgiveneſs
of ſins</hi> and <hi>eternal Redemption for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further yet, that by being
ſubject to the miſeries and infirmities
of Humanity, he might from his
own Experience, the ſureſt and moſt
ſenſible ſort of knowledge and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103163:67"/>
learn to have a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
ſenſe of our infirmities,
and be more apt to commiſerate us
in all our ſufferings and temptations,
and more ready to <hi>ſuccour</hi> us labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under them.</p>
            <p>And finally, that as a Reward of
his Obedience and ſufferings in our
Nature, he might in the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be <hi>exalted to the right hand of the
Majeſty on high,</hi> there to continue <hi>for
ever to make interceſſion for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. I ſhall in the next place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the <hi>Objections</hi> againſt the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> from the
ſuppoſed <hi>impoſſibility</hi> and incongruity
of the thing. I ſhall mention <hi>three,</hi>
and endeavour in as few words as I
can to give a clear and ſatisfactory
<hi>Anſwer</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is objected, that the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of the <hi>Son of God</hi> as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
it, necceſſarily ſuppoſing an
Union of the <hi>Divinity</hi> with <hi>human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:103163:68"/>
is, if not altogether <hi>impoſſible,</hi>
yet a very unintelligible thing.</p>
            <p>Now that there is no impoſſibility
in the thing ſeems to be very evident
from the Inſtance whereby I have
endeavoured to illuſtrate it, of the
Union between the <hi>Soul</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi>
of man, which we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to be a thing poſſible, becauſe
we are ſure that it is; and yet no
man can explain, either to himſelf
or to any one elſe, the manner how
it is, or can be conceived to be;
but for all that we are certain, as
we can be of any thing, that it is
ſo.</p>
            <p>And is it not every whit as poſſible
for God, if he ſo pleaſe, to unite
<hi>himſelf</hi> to <hi>human Nature,</hi> as it is for
the <hi>Soul</hi> to be united to the <hi>Body?</hi>
And that we are not able to conceive
the manner how this is or can be
done, ought not in reaſon to be any
prejudice againſt the truth and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the thing: This indeed
may make it ſeem ſtrange to us, but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103163:68"/>
by no means incredible: Becauſe
we do moſt firmly believe a great
many things to be, the manner of
whoſe Being we do not at all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.
And therefore I take it for
an undoubted <hi>Principle</hi> which no
Man can gainſay, <hi>That to aſſure us
that a thing really is, it is not neceſſary
for us to know the manner how it is, or
can be:</hi> It is ſufficient for us to know,
that the thing is not impoſſible; and
of <hi>that</hi> we have the very beſt <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi>
that can be, if we be ſure
that it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſuppoſing this thing to
be poſſible, and capable in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to be underſtood, which yet I
have ſhewn not to be neceſſary to
our firm belief of it: it is further
<hi>objected,</hi> that it ſeems to be a thing
very incongruous, and much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the Dignity of the <hi>Son of God,</hi>
to be united to <hi>human Nature,</hi> and to
ſubmit to ſo near an Allyance with
that which is ſo very mean and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable:
Yea to be infinitely more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103163:69"/>
               <hi>Him,</hi> than for the greateſt <hi>Prince</hi>
in this World to match with the
pooreſt and moſt contemptible Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
            <p>But herein ſurely we meaſure God
too much by our ſelves, and becauſe
we <hi>who are evil</hi> have ſeldom ſo much
goodneſs as to ſtoop beneath our
ſelves for the benefit and good of
others, we are apt to think that God
hath not ſo much goodneſs neither:
And becauſe our ill nature, and
pride, and folly, as indeed all pride
is folly, will not ſuffer us to do it,
we preſently conclude that it does
not become God. But what <hi>Pliny</hi>
ſaid to the Emperour <hi>Trajan</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
earthly Kings and Potentates, is
much more true of the <hi>Lord of Glory,</hi>
the great King of Heaven and Earth;
<hi>Cui nihil ad augendum faſtigium ſupereft,
hoc uno modo creſcere poteſt, ſi ſe ipſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittat,
ſecurus magnitudinis ſuae, He
that is at the top, and can riſe no higher,
hath yet this one way left to become great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
by ſtooping beneath himſelf;</hi> which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103163:69"/>
he may very ſafely do, <hi>being ſecure of
his own Greatneſs.</hi> The lower any
Being, be he never ſo high, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
to do good, the glory of his
Goodneſs ſhines ſo much the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Men are many times too proud
and ſtiff to bend, too perverſe and
ill natur'd to ſtoop beneath their
own little Greatneſs for the good of
others: But God, whoſe <hi>ways are
not as our ways,</hi> and whoſe <hi>thoughts
are as</hi> much above <hi>our</hi> low and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<hi>thoughts as the Heavens are high
above the earth,</hi> did not diſdain nor
think it below him to become <hi>Man</hi>
for the good of Mankind; and as
much as the <hi>Divinity</hi> is capable of
being ſo, to become miſerable to
make us happy. We may be afraid
that if we humble our ſelves we ſhall
be deſpis'd, that if we ſtoop others
will get above us and trample upon
us: But God, though he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
never ſo low, is ſtill ſecure of
his own Greatneſs, and that none
can take it from him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:103163:70"/>
So that in truth, and according to
right Reaſon, it was no real diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or diſparagement to the <hi>Son of
God</hi> to become <hi>Man</hi> for the Salvation
of Mankind: But on the contrary,
it was a moſt glorious Humility, and
the greateſt Inſtance of the trueſt
Goodneſs that ever was. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> when
he ſays that <hi>Chriſt glorifyed not himſelf
to be made an High-Prieſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 5.</note> 
               <hi>but</hi> was <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of God</hi> to this <hi>Office, as was
Aaron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> does hereby ſeem to intimate
that it was a <hi>glory</hi> to the <hi>Son of God
to be made an High-Prieſt</hi> for the Sons
of Men: For though it was a ſtrange
condeſcention, yet was it likewiſe a
moſt wonderful Argument of his
Goodneſs, which is the higheſt Glory
of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, if God for our ſakes did
ſubmit himſelf to a condition which
we may think did leſs become him,
here is great cauſe of thankfulneſs,
but none ſurely of cavil and excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
We have infinite reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103163:70"/>
and admire his goodneſs,
but none at all to upbraid him with
his kindneſs, and to quarrel with him
for having deſcended ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
himſelf to teſtifie his love to
us and his tender concernment for
our happineſs: Beſides, that when
we have ſaid all we can about this
matter, I hope we will allow God
himſelf to be the beſt and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Judge what is fit for God to
do; and that he needs not to take
counſel of any of his Creatures,
what will beſt become him in this or
any other Caſe:<note place="margin">Job 33. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Behold in this thou
art not juſt; I will anſwer thee, that God
is greater than man: Why doſt thou diſpute
againſt him? for he giveth not account of
any of his matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If our Reaſon could get
over this Difficulty, and admit that
God might become <hi>Man;</hi> yet it
ſeems very unſuitable to the <hi>Son of
God</hi> and to his great Deſign of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
and reforming Mankind,
to appear in ſo low and ſuffering a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103163:71"/>
condition. This, to the <hi>Heathen
Philoſophers,</hi> who as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells
us <hi>by Wiſdom knew not God,</hi> did not
only ſeem unreaſonable but even ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 21.</note>
So St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>We,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>preach Chriſt crucified, to the
Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks
fooliſhneſs:</hi> To think that ſo poor and
mean a Man was fit to give Laws to
Mankind, and to awe the minds of
men by the Authority of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
That One who was put to
Death himſelf ſhould be believed by
others when he promiſed to them
Life and Immortality in another
World, could not but appear very
ſtrange and unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer to this; beſides other
excellent Reaſons and Ends which
the <hi>Scripture</hi> expreſly aſſigns of our
<hi>B. Saviour</hi>'s Humiliation, in his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
our Nature with the frailties
and miſeries of it: As that he might
be a <hi>Teacher,</hi> and an <hi>Example</hi> to us:
That by his bitter Paſſion he might
make Expiation for sin, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et us
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103163:71"/>
a pattern of the greateſt meekneſs and
patience under the greateſt provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and ſufferings: That having
ſuffered ſo grievouſly himſelf, he
might know how to commiſerate and
pity us in all our temptations and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings:
That <hi>by death he might deſtroy
him that had the power of Death, that is, the
Devil; and might deliver thoſe who through
fear of Death were all their Life-time ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to bondage:</hi> I ſay, beſides all this, it
was of great uſe that the great <hi>Teacher</hi>
and <hi>Reformer</hi> of Mankind ſhould
live in ſo mean and afflicted a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
to confront the pride and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the World by this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the Son of God, and the
very beſt man that ever was, was <hi>a
Beggar,</hi> and <hi>had not where to lay his
head:</hi> And likewiſe to convince Men
of theſe <hi>two</hi> great <hi>Truths, That God
may grievouſly afflict thoſe whom he dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loves;</hi> and, <hi>That it is poſſible for men
to be innocent and contented in the midſt of
poverty, and reproach, and ſufferings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:103163:72"/>
Had our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> appeared in the
<hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Pomp</hi> of a great <hi>temporal
Prince,</hi> the influence of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Example would probably
have made more Hypocrites and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
Converts, but not have perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
men one jot more to be inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
holy and good. The great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
that muſt do that, muſt not
be fetch'd from the Pomp and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
of this World, but from the
great and eternal Recompences of
the other.</p>
            <p>And it is very well worth our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
that nothing puzzled <hi>Ceſar
Vaninus,</hi> who was perhaps the firſt,
and the only <hi>Martyr</hi> for <hi>Atheiſm</hi> that
ever was; I ſay, nothing puzzled
him more, than that he could not
from the Hiſtory of our <hi>Saviour's</hi>
Life and Actions, written by the
<hi>Evangeliſts</hi> with ſo native a ſimplicity,
faſten upon him any probable impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a ſecular intereſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in any thing that he ſaid or did.
No doubt but <hi>Vaninus,</hi> before he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103163:72"/>
made this acknowledgment, had
ſearched very narrowly into this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and could he have found any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
for ſuch an imputation, he
would have thought it ſufficient to
have blaſted both Him and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>You may be pleaſed to conſider
further, that it was the opinion of
the Wiſeſt <hi>Jews,</hi> that the beſt men,
<hi>the Children of God</hi> who called God
<hi>their Father,</hi> were many times expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the greateſt ſufferings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
for the trial of their faith,
and meekneſs, and patience, as we
may ſee at large in the <hi>Wiſdom of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
where ſpeaking of the malice
and enmity of the wicked to one
that was eminently righteous, he
brings them in ſaying after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">Chap. I. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</note>
               <hi>Let us lie in wait for the righteous,
becauſe he is not for our turn; he is clean
contrary to our doings: He upbraideth us
with our offending the Law, and objecteth
to our infamy the tranſgreſſions of our
youth: He profeſſeth to have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103163:73"/>
of God, and he calleth himſelf the
Child of the Lord: He is grievous unto
us even to behold; for his life is not like
other mens, his ways are of another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion:
We are eſteemed of him as counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits,
he abſtaineth from our ways as from
filthineſs: He pronounceth the end of the
juſt to be bleſſed, and maketh his boaſt
that God is his Father: Let us ſee if his
words be true, and what ſhall happen in
the end of him: For if the juſt man be
the Son of God, he will help him, and
deliver him from the hands of his Enemies:
Let us examine him with deſpitefulneſs
and torture, that we may know his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and prove his patience: Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him to a ſhameful Death,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is ſo exact a Character of our
<hi>B. Saviour,</hi> both in reſpect of the
holineſs and innocency of his Life,
and of the reproaches and ſufferings
which he met with from the wicked
and malicious <hi>Jews,</hi> who perſecuted
him all his life, and at laſt conſpir'd
his death, that whoever reads this
Paſſage can hardly forbear to think
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103163:73"/>
it a Prophetical Deſcription of the
innocency and ſufferings of the <hi>B.
Jeſus:</hi> For He certainly in the moſt
eminent manner was the <hi>Son of God,</hi>
being called by the <hi>Evangeliſt, the
only begotten of the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or if this was not a <hi>Prediction</hi>
concerning our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi> yet thus
much at leaſt may be concluded from
it, that in the judgment of the <hi>Wiſeſt</hi>
among the <hi>Jews,</hi> it was not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of
the Divine Providence to permit the
beſt Man to be ſo ill treated by
wicked men: And further, that in
their judgment the innocency and
vertues of an eminently righteous
man are then ſet off to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and do ſhine forth with the
greateſt luſtre, when he is under the
hardeſt circumſtances of ſuffering
and perſecution from an evil World.</p>
            <p>Add to this likewiſe, that the beſt
and wiſeſt of the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers</hi>
do frequently inculcate ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
as theſe: That <hi>Worldly Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103163:74"/>
and Power are not to be admir'd, but
rather to be deſpis'd by a wiſe man:</hi> That
<hi>men may be very good, and dear to the
Gods, and yet liable to the greateſt miſeries
and ſufferings in this World.</hi> That <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſuffers unjuſtly, and bears it patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
gives the greateſt teſtimony to Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and does moſt effectually recommend
Piety and Vertue, as things of greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
than the eaſe and pleaſure of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Life:</hi> Nay further, that <hi>a good
man</hi> caſt into the hardeſt circumſtances
of poverty and miſery, of reproach
and ſuffering, is the fitteſt perſon of
all other to be the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
and <hi>Preacher of God</hi> to Mankind;
Which are the very words of <hi>Arian a
Heathen Philoſopher,</hi> in his <hi>Diſcourſes
of Epictetus.</hi> Now ſurely they who
ſay ſuch things have no reaſon to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> his low and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
condition, as misbecoming
one that was to be the great <hi>Teacher</hi>
and <hi>Reformer</hi> of the World.</p>
            <p>And as to that part of the <hi>Objection,</hi>
that He who ſo freely promiſed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103163:74"/>
               <hi>Immortality</hi> to others could not, or
however did not ſave himſelf from
<hi>Death:</hi> This vaniſheth into nothing
when we conſider, that he reſcued
himſelf from the power of the Grave:
And it is ſo far from being <hi>ridiculous</hi>
to rely upon his Promiſe of raiſing
us up from the dead, that the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it ſelf is really <hi>ſo.</hi> For can any
thing be more reaſonable than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon Him for our hopes of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
who by riſing from the
Grave himſelf, and by conquering
the Powers of Death and Darkneſs,
and <hi>triumphing openly</hi> over them by his
viſible Aſcenſion into Heaven, hath
given ſo plain and ſenſible a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
to all Mankind that he is
able to make good to the uttermoſt
all the glorious Promiſes which he
hath made to us of a bleſſed Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to eternal Life and Happineſs

            <p>THE <hi>third</hi> and laſt thing which
I propoſed upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Son of
God</hi> was,<note place="margin">III.</note> to give ſome account of
this <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> and to ſhew that the
Wiſdom of God thought fit thus to
order things, in great condeſcenſion
to the weakneſs and common preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
of Mankind: And that when
all things are duly weigh'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
it will appear much more for
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103163:76"/>
our comfort and advantuge, than
any other way which the wiſdom of
men would have been moſt apt to
deviſe and pitch upon.</p>
            <p>And it is the more neceſſary to
give ſome account of this matter,
becauſe after all that hath hitherto
been ſaid in anſwer to the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
againſt it, it may ſtill ſeem very
ſtrange to a conſidering man that
God, who could without all this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
and condeſcenſion have
done the buſineſs for which his <hi>Son</hi>
came into the World and appear'd in
our Nature, that is, could have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the ſame Laws to Mankind, and
have offer'd to us the forgiveneſs of
our Sins and eternal Life upon our
Repentance for Sins paſt, and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
endeavour of obedience for the
future: I ſay, that notwithſtanding
this, he ſhould yet make choice of
this way for the Redemption and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of fallen Man, by ſending
his Son in our Nature, to accompliſh
this Deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:103163:76"/>
And in the handling of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I ſhall, as I ſaid before, all
along take the expreſs declarations,
or at leaſt the pregnant intimations
of Scripture for my ground and
guide: It being always ſafeſt to take
the Reaſons of the Divine counſels
and actions from God himſelf: And
in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> place, I make no manner of
doubt to ſay, that it would be a
great preſumption and boldneſs in
any man to affirm that the infinite
Wiſdom of God could not have
brought about the Salvation of Men
by any other way, than by this very
way in which he hath done it. For
why ſhould we take upon us to ſet
limits to infinite Wiſdom, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to know the utmoſt extent of
it? But ſince God hath been pleaſed
to pitch upon this Way rather than
any other, this ſurely ought to be
reaſon enough to ſatisfie us of the
peculiar wiſdom and fitneſs of
it, whether the particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103163:77"/>
of it appear to us or not.</p>
            <p>And yet it cannot be denied to be
a very noble Argument, and well
worthy our conſideration, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the Reaſons of this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
and to aſſign them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
if we can. For I look upon
<hi>Myſteries</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> in Religion to
be much of the ſame nature, and
that a great Reverence is due to both
where they are certain, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the Nature and Reaſon of the
thing: But neither of them are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be admitted without neceſſity,
and very good evidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I conſider in the next
place that in the ſeveral Revelations
which God hath made of himſelf to
Mankind, he hath with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion
accommodated himſelf,
both as to manner and degree of
them, to the condition, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and other circumſtances of the
Perſons and People to whom they
were made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:103163:77"/>
Particularly we find that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation
of God towards the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Nation was full of condeſcenſion to
the temper, and prejudices, and
other circumſtances of that <hi>People.</hi>
For the <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> which God
gave them were far from being the
beſt and moſt perfect in themſelves;
in which ſenſe ſome underſtand that
<hi>Paſſage</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where
it is ſaid that God <hi>gave</hi> them <hi>Statutes
which were not good,</hi> that is, very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
in compariſon of what he
could and would have given them,
had they been capable of them; and
yet ſuch as were very well ſuited and
fitted to their preſent capacity and
circumſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I obſerve yet further;
That though the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion,
as to the main and ſubſtance of it,
be a moſt perfect Inſtitution, being
the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> reviv'd and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
yet upon a due conſideration
of things it cannot be denied that the
manner and circumſtances of this
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103163:78"/>
Diſpenſation are full of condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the weakneſs of mankind and
very much accommodated to the
moſt common and deeply radicated
Prejudices of Men concerning God
and Religion; and peculiarly fitted
to remove and root them out of the
minds of men, by ſubſtituting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the place of them of as near
a compliance with them as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the Honour of Almighty
God, and the great Deſign of the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>It is not eaſie to give a certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the true <hi>Original</hi> of ſome
<hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Prejudices</hi> concerning <hi>God</hi>
and <hi>Religion</hi> which have generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the World, in that variety
of <hi>Religions,</hi> and the different ways
of <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Superſtition</hi> which have
been in ſeveral <hi>Nations</hi> of the Earth:
But in <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Fact</hi> this is certain,
that ſome <hi>Notions,</hi> and thoſe very
groſs and erroneous, did almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
prevail even among thoſe
who did extremely differ in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103163:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Modes</hi> of their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though ſome of theſe were
much more tolerable than others, yet
God ſeems to have had great conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of ſome very weak and
groſs apprehenſions of Mankind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Religion.</hi> And, as in ſome
of the <hi>Laws</hi> given by <hi>Moſes</hi> God was
pleaſed particularly to conſider the
<hi>hardneſs</hi> of <hi>the hearts</hi> of that <hi>People;</hi>
ſo he ſeems likewiſe to have very
much ſuited the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of the
<hi>Goſpel</hi> and the <hi>Method</hi> of our <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
by the <hi>Incarnation</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi>
of his <hi>Son,</hi> to the common <hi>Prejudices</hi>
of Mankind; eſpecially of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
World, whoſe minds were leſs
prepared for this <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> than the
<hi>Jews,</hi> if we conſider the Light and
advantages which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation
had above the <hi>Gentile</hi> World: That
ſo by this Means and <hi>Method</hi> he might
wean them by degrees from their
groſs conceptions of things, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify
more eaſily their wrong appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103163:79"/>
by gratifying them in ſome
meaſure, and in a gracious compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with our weakneſs by bending
and accommodating the way and
<hi>Method</hi> of our <hi>Salvation</hi> to our weak
<hi>Capacity</hi> and imperfect <hi>Conceptions</hi> of
things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And that God hath done
this in the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>
will I think very plainly appear in
the following Inſtances; in moſt
of which I ſhall be very brief, and
only inſiſt ſomewhat more largely
upon the laſt of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> The World was much given
to admire <hi>Myſteries</hi> in Religion. The
<hi>Jews</hi> had <hi>theirs;</hi> ſeveral of which
by God's own appointment were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
and kept ſecret in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
from the People; others were
added by the Superſtition of after
Ages, and held in equal or rather
greater Veneration than the former:
And the <hi>Heathen</hi> likewiſe had <hi>theirs;</hi>
the <hi>Devil</hi> always affecting to imitate
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103163:79"/>
God ſo far as ſerved his wicked and
malicious deſign of ſeducing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
into <hi>Idolatry</hi> and the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of
<hi>himſelf:</hi> And therefore the <hi>Scripture</hi>
always ſpeaks of the <hi>Heathen Idolatry</hi>
as the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> and not of
<hi>God:</hi> So that almoſt every <hi>Nation</hi> had
their peculiar and celebrated Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
moſt of which were either very
odd and phantaſtical, or very lewd
and impure, or very inhuman and
cruel, and every way unworthy of
the <hi>Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>great Myſtery of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation of the Son
of God;</hi> or, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls it,
<hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh;</hi> was ſuch a
<hi>Myſtery,</hi> as for the greatneſs and
wonderfulneſs, for the infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and condeſcenſion of it, did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
and ſwallow up all other <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
For which reaſon the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi>
in alluſion to the <hi>Heathen Myſteries</hi>
and in contempt of them, ſpeaking
of the great <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Religion ſays,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>without controverſy great
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103163:80"/>
is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, God was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. Since the World
had ſuch an admiration for Myſteries,
he inſtanceth in that which was a
<hi>Myſtery indeed;</hi> a <hi>Myſtery</hi> beyond all
diſpute, and beyond all compariſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> There was likewiſe a great
inclination in Mankind to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of a <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>ſenſible Deity:</hi>
And this was a main Root and Source
of the various <hi>Idolatries</hi> in the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
World. Now to take Men off
from <hi>this,</hi> God was pleaſed to appear
in our Nature; that they who were
ſo fond of a <hi>viſible Deity</hi> might have
one to whom they might pay <hi>Divine
Worſhip</hi> without danger of <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
and without injury to the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
even a true and natural <hi>Image</hi>
of God the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Fountain</hi> of
the <hi>Deity;</hi> or, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> deſcribes the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the
reſplendency or <hi>brightneſs of his</hi>
Fathers <hi>Glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and the expreſs</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
or <hi>Image of his Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:103163:80"/>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Another <hi>Notion</hi> which had
generally obtained among Mankind,
was concerning the <hi>Expiation</hi> of the
Sins of men and appeaſing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<hi>Deity</hi> by <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> upon
which they ſuppoſed the <hi>puniſhment</hi>
due to the <hi>Sinner</hi> was transferred, to
exempt him from it: Eſpecially by
the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of Men, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
univerſally prevailed in the
<hi>Gentile</hi> World.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Notion</hi> of the <hi>Expiation
of Sin,</hi> by <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of one kind or
other, ſeems to have obtained very
early in the World, and among all
other ways of <hi>Divine Worſhip</hi> to have
found the moſt univerſal reception in
all Times and Places. And indeed
a great part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion
and Worſhip was a plain Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the general apprehenſions of
men concerning this way of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the <hi>Deity</hi> by <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> And the
greateſt part of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion
and Worſhip was likewiſe founded
upon the ſame <hi>Notion</hi> and Opinion,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103163:81"/>
which becauſe it was ſo univerſal
ſeems to have had its <hi>Original</hi> from
the <hi>firſt Parents</hi> of Mankind; either
immediately after the <hi>Creation,</hi> or
after the <hi>Flood;</hi> and from thence, I
mean as to the ſubſtance of this
<hi>Notion</hi> to have been derived and
propagated to all their <hi>Poſterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And with this general <hi>Notion</hi> of
Mankind, whatever the ground and
foundation of it might be, God was
pleaſed ſo far to comply as once for
all to have a general <hi>Atonement</hi> made
for the <hi>Sins</hi> of all Mankind by the
<hi>Sacrifice</hi> of his <hi>only Son,</hi> whom his
wiſe Providence did <hi>permit by wicked
hands to be crucified and ſlain.</hi> But I
ſhall not at preſent inſiſt any further
upon this; which requires a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Diſcourſe by it ſelf, and may by
God's aſſiſtance in due time have it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> Another very common <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and very rife in the the <hi>Heathen</hi>
World, and a great <hi>Source</hi> of their
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> was their Apotheoſes or
<hi>Canonizing</hi> of famous and eminent
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103163:81"/>
Perſons, who in their Life time had
done great things and ſome way or
other been great <hi>Benefactors</hi> to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
by advancing them after their
Death to the Dignity of an <hi>inferiour</hi>
kind of <hi>Gods</hi> fit to be worſhip'd by
men here on <hi>Earth,</hi> and to have their
<hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Supplications</hi> addreſs'd to
them as proper and powerful <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
and Interceſſors for them with
the <hi>Superiour Gods:</hi> To theſe they
gave the Titles of <hi>Hero's</hi> and <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei,</hi>
that is, <hi>half Gods;</hi> though the
Notion of a <hi>Being</hi> that is juſt <hi>half-infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi>
ſeems to me very hard to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
and defin'd.</p>
            <p>Now to take men off from this
kind of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and to put an end to
it, behold <hi>One</hi> in our <hi>Nature exalted
to the right hand of the Majeſty on high;</hi>
to be worſhipped by <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels:
One</hi> that was the truly <hi>Great Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
of mankind: One that <hi>was dead,
and is alive again, and lives for evermore,
to make interceſſion for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:103163:82"/>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> To give but one <hi>Inſtance</hi>
more, which I have already intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
The World was mightily bent
upon addreſſing their requeſts and
ſupplications, not to the Deity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
becauſe their Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thought that too great a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
but by ſome <hi>Mediators</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> who might
with advantage in this humble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
preſent their Requeſts ſo as to
find acceptance. To this end they
made uſe of the <hi>Daemons</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi>
and of their <hi>Hero's,</hi> or <hi>Deifyed Men</hi>
whom I mentioned before, by whom
they put up their <hi>Prayers</hi> to the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Gods,</hi> hoping by their <hi>Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>Patronage</hi> of their Cauſe, to
obtain a gracious anſwer of them.</p>
            <p>In a gracious compliance with
this common apprehenſion, and
thereby more eaſily and effectually
to extirpate this ſort of <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
which had been ſo long, and ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
practiſed in the World, God
was pleaſed to conſtitute and appoint
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103163:82"/>
               <hi>One</hi> in our <hi>Nature</hi> to be a perpetual
<hi>Advocate</hi> and <hi>Interceſſor</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> for
us, to offer up our <hi>Prayers</hi> to <hi>God his
Father,</hi> and to obtain <hi>mercy for us and
grace to help in time of need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for ever to take us off from
all other <hi>Mediators,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> we are expreſsly
told in <hi>Scripture</hi> that as there is but
<hi>one God</hi> to whom we are to pray, ſo
there is but <hi>one Mediator between God
and men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> by
whom we are to offer up our <hi>Prayers</hi>
to <hi>God:</hi> And that we need not look
out for any other, ſince the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> that he <hi>is able to
ſave to the uttermoſt all thoſe that come
to God by him, ſeeing he lives for ever to
make interceſſion for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for this reaſon the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> is altogether inexcuſable in this
Point, for introducing more <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
and <hi>Interceſſors,</hi> more <hi>Patrons</hi> and
<hi>Advocates</hi> in Heaven for us: And this
not only without any neceſſity, for
who can add any vertue and efficacy
to the powerful and prevalent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103163:83"/>
of the <hi>Son of God?</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in direct contradiction to the
expreſs Conſtitution and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God himſelf, who ſays
there is <hi>but one Mediator between God
and men,</hi> and they ſay there ought to
be many more, not only the <hi>B.
Virgin,</hi> but all the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi>
in Heaven. Beſides that by this very
thing they revive one notorious Piece
of the old <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatry, which
God ſo plainly deſign'd to extinguiſh
by appointing <hi>One</hi> only <hi>Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this <hi>Condeſcenſion</hi> likewiſe God
hath given us the comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a moſt powerful and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<hi>Interceſſor</hi> at <hi>the right hand of
God</hi> in our behalf. For if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>Man</hi> and of the ſame <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
with us, <hi>bone of our bone, and
fleſh of our fleſh,</hi> ſo very nearly allied
and related to us, we may eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he hath a moſt tender care
and concernment for us: That he
ſincerely wiſheth our happineſs, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103163:83"/>
will by all means ſeek to procure it,
if we our ſelves by our own willful
obſtinacy do not hinder it, and reſiſt
the kindneſs and <hi>the counſel of God
againſt our ſelves:</hi> For if we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to continue impenitent, there
is no help for us; we muſt <hi>die in our
Sins,</hi> and Salvation it ſelf cannot
ſave us.</p>
            <p>But to proceed; it cannot ſurely
but be matter of greateſt conſolation
to us, that <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> who is
now ſo <hi>highly exalted at the right hand
of God,</hi> and who hath <hi>all power in
Heaven and Earth committed to him,</hi> is
our <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>Advocate</hi> in Heaven to
plead our Cauſe with God: Since
we cannot but think, that He who
was pleaſed to become <hi>Brother to us
all</hi> does bear a true affection and good
will to us: And that He who aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
our <hi>Nature</hi> will heartily eſpouſe
our <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and plead it powerfully
for us; and will with all poſſible
advantage recommend our Petitions
and Requeſts to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:103163:84"/>
But then if we conſider further,
that He did not only take our <hi>Nature,</hi>
but likewiſe took our <hi>infirmities</hi> and
bore them many years, in which he
had long and continual experience of
the ſaddeſt ſufferings to which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Nature</hi> is ſubject in this World,
and <hi>was tempted in all things like as we
are:</hi> This gives us ſtill greater aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that he who ſuffer'd and was
tempted himſelf cannot but be
touched with a lively ſenſe of our
infirmities, and muſt have learn'd by
his own Sufferings to compaſſionate
ours, and to be ready to ſuccour us
when we are tempted, and to afford
us <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>help</hi> ſuitable to all our
wants and infirmities: For nothing
gives us ſo juſt a ſenſe of the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of <hi>others</hi> as the remembrance of
our <hi>own,</hi> and the bitter experience of
the like Sufferings and Temptations
in our ſelves.</p>
            <p>And this the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
doth very particularly inſiſt upon as
matter of greateſt comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103163:84"/>
to us, that the <hi>Son of
God</hi> did not only aſſume our Nature,
but <hi>was made in all things like unto us,</hi>
and during his abode here upon Earth
did ſuffer and <hi>was tempted like as we are:
For verily,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 16, 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>he took not
on him the nature of Angels, but of the
ſeed of Abraham: Wherefore in all things
it behoved him to be made like unto his
Brethren, that he might be a merciful
and faithful High-Prieſt in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to God: For in that he himſelf
ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour
them that are tempted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again exhorting the <hi>Jews</hi>
who were newly converted to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi>
to continue <hi>ſtedfact in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi>
notwithſtanding all the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
to which upon that account
they were expoſed; he comforts
them with this conſideration, that
we have <hi>at the right hand of God</hi> ſo
powerful an <hi>Advocate</hi> and <hi>Interceſſor</hi>
for us as the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of our Caſe, having ſuffered
the ſame things Himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103163:85"/>
we cannot doubt of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
to us and readineſs to ſupport
us in the like Sufferings:<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 14, 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>Seeing then,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>that we have a great High
Prieſt that is paſſed into the Heavens,
Jeſus the Son of God, let us hold faſt our
Profeſſion: For we have not an High-Prieſt
that cannot be touched with the
feeling of our infirmities, but was in all
points tempted like as we are, yet without
Sin:</hi> From whence he concludes,
that having ſuch an <hi>Interceſſor</hi> we may
with great confidence and aſſurance
addreſs our Supplications to God for
his mercy and help in all our <hi>wants</hi>
and <hi>weakneſs,</hi> to ſupply the <hi>one,</hi> and
to aſſiſt the <hi>other: Let us therefore, ſays</hi>
he, <hi>come boldly to the throne of Grace, that
we may obtain mercy and find grace to help
in time of need, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
grace for ſeaſonable relief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi>
now that he is advanced to
Heaven and exalted to the right
hand of God, is not unmindful of
us in this height of his Glory and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103163:85"/>
Greatneſs; but with the tendereſt
affection and compaſſion to Mankind
doth ſtill proſecute the Deſign of our
Salvation; and in vertue of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
Obedience and Sufferings,
which he preſents to God continually,
he offers up our Prayers to Him, and
pleads our Cauſe with Him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
to Him all our wants and
neceſſities, and procures for us a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
anſwer of our Prayers, and
ſupplies of grace and ſtrength pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to our temptations and
infirmities.</p>
            <p>And thus, by vertue of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
<hi>interceſſion</hi> of his with God for
us, our <hi>Sins</hi> are forgiven, and our
<hi>Wants</hi> ſupplied, and our <hi>Requeſts</hi>
granted, and the gracious <hi>aſſiſtance</hi>
and <hi>ſupports</hi> of God's <hi>H. Spirit</hi> are
ſeaſonably afforded to us, and we
are <hi>kept by the mighty power of God
through Faith unto Salvation:</hi> In a
word, all thoſe <hi>Bleſſings</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi>
are procured for us by his
<hi>Interceſſion</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> which he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103163:86"/>
purchaſed for us by his <hi>Blood</hi> upon
<hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that in this <hi>Method</hi> of our <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
beſides many other gracious
<hi>Condeſcenſions</hi> which God hath made
to the <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>prejudices</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> hath perfectly
ſupplied the <hi>two</hi> great <hi>Wants</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which Mankind was at ſo great
a loſs before, <hi>namely</hi> the <hi>Want</hi> of an

and <hi>Interceſſor</hi> with God in
<hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he hath, in great Goodneſs
and Condeſcenſion to our inveterate
Prejudices concerning theſe things,
taken effectual care fully to ſupply
both theſe <hi>Wants;</hi> having <hi>appeared in
the end of the World to take away Sin by
the Sacrifice of himſelf;</hi> and in vertue
of that Sacrifice <hi>appearing</hi> now <hi>in
Heaven in the preſence of God for us,</hi>
he is become our perpetual <hi>Advocate</hi>
and a moſt prevalent <hi>Interceſſor</hi> with
God in our behalf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:103163:86"/>
For inſtead of the various and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathen,</hi>
the <hi>Son of God</hi> hath <hi>by one Sacrifice for
Sins perfected for ever them that are
ſanctified:</hi> And inſtead of the <hi>Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of <hi>Daemons</hi> and <hi>Hero's,</hi> to offer up
our <hi>Prayers</hi> to God, which were the
<hi>Interceſſors</hi> made uſe of among the
<hi>Heathen,</hi> we have <hi>one Mediator between
God and men,</hi> appointed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
even the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who <hi>is
entred into Heaven it ſelf,</hi> there to <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the preſence of God for us:</hi> And
to aſſure us that he commiſerates our
Caſe and hath a true and tender
ſenſe of our infirmities and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the very manner of his <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi>
for us, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
it to us, is a plain Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the thing: For he intercedes
for us in <hi>Heaven</hi> by repreſenting to
God his <hi>Father</hi> his ſufferings upon
Earth; and pleading them in our
behalf: So that the very Argument
which he uſeth to God for us cannot
but ſtir up compaſſion in Him
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103163:87"/>
towards us, and whilſt he repreſents
his <hi>Own</hi> ſufferings in our behalf, we
cannot think that he is unmindful and
inſenſible of <hi>Ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee then that in this <hi>Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of God for our Salvation, by
ſending his <hi>Son</hi> in our Nature, things
are not only ſuited in great <hi>condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to our <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> but are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in great compaſſion to us every
way fitted for our comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.
God hath made him
our great <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>Advocate</hi> who
was our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Propitiation.</hi>
And ſurely we have all the reaſon in
the World to believe that he who <hi>in
the days of his fleſh</hi> humbled himſelf
and became <hi>obedient to the death</hi> for our
ſakes, will be ready to do us all
good offices now that he is advanced
to the right hand of God; that he
who dyed for us upon Earth, now
that he lives again will make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
for us in Heaven and perfect
that Salvation which he purchaſed for
us upon the Croſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:103163:87"/>
And therefore we find in <hi>Scripture</hi>
that as the <hi>purchaſing</hi> of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is aſcribed to the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo the <hi>perfecting</hi> of it
is attributed to his <hi>Interceſſion</hi> for us
at the right hand of his <hi>Father:
Wherefore,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt
all thoſe that come to God by him, ſeeing
he liveth for ever to make interceſſion for
us:</hi> He <hi>dyed once</hi> to purchaſe theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
but <hi>he lives for ever</hi> to procure
them for us, and to apply them to
us: And now that he is in Heaven,
he is as intent upon our Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and lays our Happineſs as
much to heart as when he dwelt here
among us on Earth, and poured out
his Blood a Sacrifice for Sin upon the
Croſs: And that when he lived here
below he ſuffer'd and was tempted as
we are, this very conſideration gives
us the greateſt aſſurance poſſible that
he is ſtill touched with the feeling of
our infirmities and hath a lively ſenſe
of our Sufferings; and conſequently,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103163:88"/>
that he doth compaſſionate our Caſe
and will uſe all his power and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
for our advantage, for our ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
ſupport and ſuccour in all our
trials and ſufferings. But beſides
the wonderful <hi>Gondeſcenſion</hi> of this
<hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> there is likewiſe in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifth</hi> and laſt place, a great <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity</hi>
and <hi>fitneſs</hi> in the thing it ſelf;
and this <hi>Method</hi> of our Salvation
which the Wiſdom of God hath
pitched upon is in many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
very much for our real benefit
and comfort. For by this means we
have a perfect and familiar <hi>Example</hi> of
holineſs and obedience in our own
Nature, by which we plainly ſee that
God requires nothing of us, but what
he himself when he ſubmitted to
become Man did think fit to do: For
<hi>being made of a Woman,</hi> he was of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<hi>made under the Law,</hi> and by
aſſuming <hi>human Nature</hi> he became
naturally ſubject to the <hi>Laws</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of his Being.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:103163:88"/>
And here likewiſe is a proviſion
made for the <hi>Expiation</hi> and <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi>
of our <hi>Sins,</hi> in a way not only very
honourable to the Juſtice of God
and the Authority of his Laws, but
likewiſe very effectual to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
Sin and to deter men from it;
ſince God did not think fit to forgive
the Sins of men without great Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and that in our Nature: For
though God was willing to ſave the
Sinner, yet rather than encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould be given to Sin by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it go unpuniſh'd, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to give up the <hi>dearly beloved of
his Soul</hi> to be a <hi>Sarcifice</hi> and <hi>Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the Sins of the whole World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the ſame means alſo we have a
moſt powerful Antidote againſt the
fear of Suffering, and particularly
againſt the fear of Death one of the
greateſt ſlaveries of human Nature:
So alſo the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells
us,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>that for this cauſe</hi> Chriſt <hi>himſelf alſo
took part of fleſh and blood, that by
Death he might deſtroy him that had the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103163:89"/>
power of Death, that is the Devil; and
might deliver thoſe who through fear of
Death were all their life-time ſubject to
bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, we have hereby full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a bleſſed Immortality in
another Life, becauſe in our Nature
Death and all the Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
were baffled and overcome.
The <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which could
not have been without his <hi>Incarnation;</hi>
and ſo likewiſe his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from
the dead and his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
are ſenſible Demonſtrations to
all Mankind of a bleſſed <hi>Immortality</hi>
after Death; which is the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
motive in the world to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and a holy Life.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, we may upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
promiſe to our ſelves a fair and
equal <hi>Trial</hi> at the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>great
Day,</hi> becauſe we ſhall then be judged
by a Man like our ſelves. Our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
and <hi>Judge</hi> himself hath told us,
that for this reaſon <hi>God hath committed
all Judgment to the Son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 22, 27.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe he is the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103163:89"/>
Son of man.</hi> And this in human
Judgments is accounted a great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,
to be judged by thoſe who
are of the ſame Rank and condition
with our ſelves, and who are likely
to underſtand beſt and moſt carefully
to examine and conſider all our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
and to render our Caſe
as if it were their own.</p>
            <p>So equitably doth God deal with
us, that we ſhall be acquitted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by ſuch a Judge as according
to human meaſures we our ſelves
ſhould have choſen; by One in our
own Nature <hi>who was made in all things
like unto us, that</hi> only excepted which
would have rendered him incapable
of being our <hi>Judge,</hi> becauſe it would
have made him a <hi>Criminal</hi> like our
ſelves. And therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
offers this as a firm ground of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to us that <hi>God will judge the World
in Righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhall be adminiſtred by a <hi>Man</hi>
like our ſelves; <hi>He hath,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a Day wherein be will Judge the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103163:90"/>
World in Righteouſneſs, by that Man
whom be bath ordained,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now only make a practical
<hi>Inference</hi> or two from what hath been
delivered upon this <hi>Argument</hi> and ſo
conclude this whole <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſerious conſideration
of what hath been ſaid concerning
the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of our <hi>B. Saviour</hi>
ſhould effectually prevail with us to
comply with the great End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of the <hi>Son of God's</hi> becoming
<hi>Man</hi> and <hi>dwelling amongſt us,</hi> and of
his doing and ſuffering all thoſe things
which are recorded of him in the
<hi>Hiſtory</hi> of his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> written
by the <hi>H. Evangeliſts:</hi> I ſay, the
conſideration hereof ſhould perſuade
us all to comply with the great <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi>
of all this, which is the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Mankind and the <hi>Recovery</hi> of
us out of that ſinful and miſerable
eſtate into which we were fallen:
Becauſe the <hi>Salvation</hi> which the <hi>Son
of God</hi> hath purchaſed for us, and
which he offers to us by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103163:90"/>
not to be accompliſhed and brought
about any other way than by our
forſaking our Sins and reforming our
<hi>Lives. The Grace of God, which hath
appeared to all men and brings Salvation,</hi>
will not make us partakers of it in
any other way, nor by any other
means, than by <hi>teaching us to deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs
and worldly luſts,</hi> and to <hi>live
ſoberly and righteouſly, and godly in this
preſent World.</hi> God <hi>ſent his Son</hi> Jeſus
<hi>to bleſs us, by turning us away every one
from his iniquities;</hi> and unleſs this
change be effectually wrought in us,
we are utterly incapable of all the
Bleſſings of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> All
that He hath done for us <hi>without us</hi>
will avail us nothing, unleſs we be
<hi>inwardly</hi> transformed and <hi>renewed in the
ſpirit of our minds;</hi> unleſs we become
<hi>new Creatures,</hi> unleſs we make it the
continual and ſincere endeavour of
our lives to <hi>keep the commandments of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Scripture</hi> is moſt expreſs
and poſitive in this matter; That
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103163:91"/>
               <hi>without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the
Lord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> That <hi>every man that hath this hope
in Him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 3.</note> that is, in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be ſaved
by <hi>Him,</hi> muſt <hi>purifie himſelf even as
be is pure.</hi> We do not rightly and
truly believe <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt came into
the World to ſave Sinners,</hi> if we be
not alſo thoroughly convinced that
it is as neceſſary for us to leave our
Sins, as to believe this moſt <hi>faithful</hi>
and <hi>credible Saying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obedience and Sufferings of
our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> are indeed <hi>accounted to
us for Righteouſneſs,</hi> and will moſt
certainly redound to our unſpeakable
benefit and advantage upon our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the <hi>Condition</hi> which the
<hi>Goſpel</hi> doth require on our Part, <hi>name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
that <hi>every man that names the Name
of Chriſt depart from iniquity:</hi> And the
<hi>Grace</hi> of God's <hi>H. Spirit</hi> is ready to
enable us to perform this Condition,
if we earneſtly ask it, and do ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
co-operate with it: Provided
we do what we can on <hi>our</hi> part, God
will not be wanting to us on <hi>His.</hi> But
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103163:91"/>
if we <hi>receive the Grace of God in vain,</hi>
and take no care to perform the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
and do neglect to implore the
Grace and aſſiſtance of God's <hi>H.
Spirit</hi> to that purpoſe, we have none
to blame but our ſelves; becauſe it
is then wholly our own fault if we
fall ſhort of that Happineſs which
<hi>Chriſt</hi> hath purchaſed, and promiſed
to us upon ſuch eaſie and reaſonable
<hi>Conditians</hi> as the <hi>Goſpel</hi> propoſeth.</p>
            <p>But I no where find that God hath
promiſed to force Happineſs upon
the negligent, and a reward upon
the <hi>wicked and ſlothful Servant:</hi> A <hi>gift</hi>
may be given for nothing, but ſurely
a <hi>Reward</hi> does in the very nature of it
always ſuppoſe ſome <hi>Service.</hi> None
but <hi>a righteous man</hi> is capable of <hi>a
righteous mans Reward:</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi>
hath ſufficiently cautioned us not to
think our ſelves <hi>Righteous</hi> unleſs we
be <hi>doers of righteouſneſs:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>let no man deceive you,
he that doth righteouſneſs is righteous,
even as He is righteous.</hi> This is ſo
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103163:92"/>
very plain a <hi>Text,</hi> that if men were
not either very eaſie to be deceived by
others, or very willing to deceive
themſelves, they could not poſſibly
miſtake the meaning of it: And
therefore I will repeat it once more,
<hi>Little children, let no man deceive you; he
that doth righteouſneſs is righteous even as
He is righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The other <hi>Inference</hi> which
I would make from the precedent
<hi>Diſcourſe</hi> is this, That with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thankfulneſs we ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and adore the wonderful
Goodneſs and Condeſcenſion of
Almighty God in ſending his <hi>only
begotten Son</hi> into the World in our
Nature, to be <hi>made fleſh,</hi> and to <hi>dwell
amongſt us</hi> in order to our Recovery
and Salvation: A Method and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation
not only full of mercy and
goodneſs, but of great Condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to our meanneſs, and of mighty
vertue and efficacy for our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Deliverance from the Guilt
and Dominion of Sin; and upon all
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103163:92"/>
accounts every way ſo much for our
benefit and advantage. So that well
may we ſay with St. <hi>Paul, This is a
faithful Saying,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a credible
Word, <hi>and worthy of all acceptation,</hi>
that is, fit to be embraced and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with all poſſible Joy and
thankfulneſs, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt came
into the World to ſave Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What an everlaſting Fountain of
the moſt invaluable Bleſſings and
Benefits to Mankind is the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Son of God? His vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing
to aſſume our Nature, and to
reſide and converſe ſo long with us?
And what are we, that the eternal
and <hi>only begotten Son of God</hi> ſhould
condeſcend to do all this for us?
That the High and Glorious Majeſty
of Heaven ſhould ſtoop down to the
Earth, and be contented to be
clothed with Miſery and Mortality?
That He ſhould ſubmit to ſo poor
and low a Condition, to ſuch dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and diſgraceful Sufferings for our
ſakes? For what are <hi>We?</hi> vile and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103163:93"/>
deſpicable Creatures, guilty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
Offenders and Apoſtates,
Enemies and Rebels. Bleſſed God!
how great is thy Goodneſs? how
infinite are thy tender Mercies and
Compaſſions to Mankind? That
thou ſhould'ſt regard us whilſt we
neglected thee, and remember us
in our low condition when we had
<hi>forgotten thee days without number,</hi> and
ſhouldſt take ſuch pity on us when we
ſhewed none to our ſelves; and whilſt
we were thy declared and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Enemies ſhould'ſt expreſs more
kindneſs and good will to us, than
the beſt of Men ever did to their beſt
Friends.</p>
            <p>When we reflect ſeriouſly upon
thoſe great things which God hath
done in our behalf, and conſider that
mighty Salvation which God hath
wrought for us; what thanks can we
poſſibly render, what acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhall we ever be able to make,
I do not ſay equal but in any wiſe
meet and becoming, to this great
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103163:93"/>
Benefactor of Mankind? Who, when
we had ſo highly offended and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
Him, and ſo fooliſhly and ſo
fatally undone our ſelves; when we
were become ſo guilty and ſo miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and ſo much fitter to have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
been the objects of his wrath
and indignation than of his pity and
compaſſion, was pleas'd to ſend his
<hi>own,</hi> his <hi>only Son</hi> into the World to
<hi>ſeek</hi> and <hi>ſave us;</hi> and by Him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
all our ruines, to <hi>forgive all our
iniquities,</hi> to <hi>heal all our</hi> ſpiritual <hi>diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and to crown us with</hi> loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and tender mercies.</p>
            <p>And what Sacrifices of Praiſe and
Thankſgiving ſhould we alſo offer
up to this gracious and moſt merciful
<hi>Redeemer</hi> of ours, <hi>the everlaſting Son of
the Father,</hi> who debaſed himſelf ſo
infinitely for our ſakes, and <hi>when he
took upon Him to deliver Man did not
abhor the Virgins womb:</hi> Who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be born ſo obſcurely and
to live all his life in a poor and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
condition; and was pleaſed
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103163:94"/>
both to undergo and to <hi>overcome the
ſharpneſs of Death, that he might open
the Kingdom of Heaven to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every time we have occaſion to
meditate upon this, eſpecially when
we are communicating at his <hi>H. Table</hi>
and receiving the bleſſed <hi>Symbols</hi> and
<hi>Pledges</hi> of his precions <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi>
How ſhould <hi>our Hearts burn
within us</hi> and leap for Joy? How
ſhould the remembrance of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
and raiſe our Spirits, and put us
into an Extaſie of Love and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to this great <hi>Friend and Lover of
Souls:</hi> And with the <hi>B. Mother</hi> of our
<hi>Lord,</hi> how ſhould <hi>our Souls,</hi> upon
that bleſſed occaſion, <hi>magnify the
Lord, and our Spirits rejoyce in God our
Saviour?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Holy men of old were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported
with Joy at the obſcure and
confuſed apprehenſion and remote
foreſight of ſo great a Bleſſing, at ſo
great a diſtance: It is ſaid of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
the Father of the faithful, that he
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103163:94"/>
ſaw His Day afar off and was glad:</hi>
How ſhould <hi>we</hi> then be affected with
Joy and Thankfulneſs, to whom the
<hi>Son of God</hi> and <hi>B. Saviour</hi> of Men is
actually come? <hi>He</hi> is come many
ages ago, and hath enlightened a
great part of the World with his
Glory. Yea, He is come to <hi>us,</hi>
who were in a manner ſeparated
from the reſt of the World: To <hi>Us</hi>
is this great <hi>Light</hi> come, who had ſo
long <hi>ſate in Darkneſs and the ſhadow of
Death:</hi> And this <hi>mighty Salvation</hi>
which He <hi>hath wrought for us</hi> is near
to every one of us that is willing to
lay hold of it, and to accept it upon
thoſe gracious terms and conditions
upon which it is offer'd to us in his
<hi>H. Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by His <hi>Coming</hi> he hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
Mankind from that groſs Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance

               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 20.</note> 
               <hi>And we know that

And we are in Him that is</hi> true, <hi>even in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103163:95"/>
his Son Jeſus Chriſt: This is the true God,

               <hi>Little Children, keep

the meaning of this Caution? and
what is the Connection of it with
the foregoing Diſcourſe? It is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this: That the <hi>Son of God</hi> by <hi>His
Coming</hi> had reſcued Mankind from the

inſtead of God. And becauſe he
foreſaw that it might be objected to
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as in fact it was afterwards
by the <hi>Heathen,</hi> that the Worſhip of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was a man, was as much
Idolatry as that which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
charged the <hi>Heathen</hi> withal: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
St. <hi>John</hi> effectually to prevent
the force of this plauſible Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though he perpetually, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his <hi>Goſpel</hi> declares Chriſt to be
really a <hi>Man,</hi> yet he expreſly alſo
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103163:95"/>
affirms Him to be <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>the true
God;</hi> and conſequently, <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
might ſafely pay Divine Worſhip to
<hi>Him</hi> without fear or danger of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry:
We are in Him that is true, even
in his Son Jeſus Chriſt: This is the true
God, and eternal Life: Little Children,
keep your ſelves from Idols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this I am ſenſible is a Digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet ſuch a one as may not be all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>To proceed then in the recital of
thoſe great Bleſſings which the <hi>Coming</hi>
of the <hi>Son of God</hi> hath brought to
Mankind. He hath reſcued us from
the bondage of <hi>Sin,</hi> and from the
ſlavery of <hi>Satan:</hi> He hath openly
proclaimed Pardon and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the World: He hath clearly
revealed eternal Life to us, which
was but obſcurely made known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles; but
is now made manifeſt by the appearance of
our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who
hath aboliſhed Death, and brought Life
and immortality to light by the Goſpel:</hi> He
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103163:96"/>
hath purchaſed this great Bleſſing for
us; and is ready to confer it upon us,
if we will be contented to leave our
Sins and to be ſaved by Him: A
Condition without which as Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not to be had, ſo if it were, it
would not be deſirable, it could not
make us happy; becauſe our Sins
would ſtill ſeparate between God
and us, and the guilt and horrour of
our own minds would make us eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
miſerable.</p>
            <p>And now ſurely we cannot but
thus judge, that all the Praiſes and
acknowledgments, all the Service
and Obedience which we can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
render to Him, are infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
thoſe infinite Obligations
which the <hi>Son of God</hi> hath laid upon
the Sons of men by his <hi>Coming into the
World to ſave Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then remains, but that at
all times, and more eſpecially at this
<hi>Seaſon</hi> we gratefully acknowledge
and joyfully commemorate this great
and amazing Goodneſs of God to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103163:96"/>
us, in the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of his <hi>Son</hi> for the
Redemption and Salvation of the
ſinful and miſerable Race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?
A Method and Diſpenſation
of the Divine Grace and Wiſdom,
not only full of mercy and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion,
but of great power and
vertue to purifie our hearts and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our Lives; to beget in us a
fervent love of <hi>God our Saviour,</hi> and
a perfect hatred and deteſtation of
our Sins, and a ſtedfaſt purpoſe and
reſolution to lead a new Life, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Commandments of God
and walking in his ways all the days
of our life. In a word, a Method
that is every way calculated for our
unſpeakable Benefit and Comfort.</p>
            <p>Since then the <hi>Son of God</hi> hath ſo
graciouſly condeſcended to be <hi>made in
all things like unto us, Sin only excepted;</hi>
let us aſpire to be as like to Him as is
poſſible in the exemplary Holineſs
and Vertues of his Life. We cannot be
like Him in his Miracles, but we
may in his Mercy and Compaſſion:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103163:97"/>
We cannot imitate his Divine Power,
but we may reſemble Him in his
Innocency and Humility, in his
Meekneſs and Patience. And as
He aſſumed Human Nature, ſo let
us re-aſſume Humanity which we
have in great meaſure depraved and
put off; and let us <hi>put on bowels of
mercy</hi> towards thoſe that are in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
and be ready to relieve the
poor for <hi>His</hi> ſake, <hi>who being rich, for
our ſakes became poor, that we through
his poverty might be made rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, Let us imitate <hi>Him</hi>
in <hi>that</hi> which was his great Work
and buſineſs here upon Earth, and
which of all other did beſt become
the <hi>Son of God;</hi> I mean in His <hi>going
about doing good:</hi> That by <hi>giving Glory
to God in the Higheſt,</hi> and by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
as much as in us lies to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
and promote <hi>Peace on Earth, and
Good Will amongſt Men,</hi> we may at
laſt be <hi>made meet to be made partakers of
the Inheritance of the Saints in Light:</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:103163:97"/>
Through the Mercies and Merits
of our <hi>B. Saviour and Redeemer.
Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Almighty God, who haſt given us thy
only begotten Son to take our Nature upon
Him, and as at this Time to be born of a
pure Virgin: Grant that we being regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and made thy Children by Adoption and
Grace, may daily be renewed by thy Holy
Spirit; through the ſame our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, who liveth and reigneth with Thee
and the ſame Spirit, ever one God, world

            </epigraph>
            <p>AMONG many other great
ends and reaſons for which
God was pleaſed to ſend his Son into
the World to dwell amongſt us, this
was one of the chief, that by a long
courſe of the greateſt innocency and
the greateſt ſufferings in our Nature
he might be capable to make a perfect
Expiation of Sin: <hi>But now once in the
end of the world,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
in the concluſion of the Ages, that is
in the laſt Age of the World,
which is the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Age, <hi>hath he
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103163:99"/>
appeared to take away ſin by the ſacrifice of
himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The general deſign of God in
ſending his Son into the World was
to ſave mankind from eternal death
and miſery, and to purchaſe for us
eternal life and happineſs. So the
<hi>Author</hi> of our Salvation himſelf tells
us,<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 16.</note> That <hi>God ſo loved the World, that
he gave his only begotten Son, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
believeth in him ſhould not periſh,
but have everlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in order to the procuring of
this Salvation for us, the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and hindrances of it were to
be removed: theſe were the <hi>guilt,</hi>
and the <hi>dominion</hi> of Sin: By the <hi>guilt</hi>
of Sin we were become obnoxious
to the wrath of God and to eternal
condemnation, and by the <hi>defilement</hi>
and <hi>dominion</hi> of it we were incapable
of the happineſs of Heaven and the
reward of eternal Life.</p>
            <p>To remove theſe two great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
two things were neceſſary:
the Forgiveneſs of ſins paſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103163:99"/>
to our deliverance from the
wrath of God and the eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the next Life; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of our hearts and lives to
make us capable of eternal Life and
happineſs in another World. And
both theſe, if God had ſo pleaſed,
might for any thing we certainly
know to the contrary, have been
effected by the abundant mercy and
powerful grace of God, without
this wonderful method and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of ſending his Son in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>to take away ſin by the ſacrifice of
himſelf:</hi> But it ſeems the wiſdom of
God thought fit to pitch upon this
way and method of our Salvation,
and no doubt for very good <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi>
amongſt which theſe <hi>three</hi> ſeem
to be very obvious and very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To vindicate the honour of
his Laws, which if Sin had gone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unpuniſh'd would have
been in great danger of falling into
contempt. For if God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103163:100"/>
a general Pardon of Sin to
all mankind, without any teſtimony
of his wrath and diſpleaſure againſt
it, who would have had any great
veneration for his Laws, or have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in good earneſt that the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of them had been either ſo
extremely offenſive to Him, or ſo
very dangerous to the Sinner?</p>
            <p>Therefore to maintain the honour
of his Laws, rather than Sin ſhould
paſs unpuniſn'd God would lay the
puniſhment of it upon his only
begotten Son, the deareſt Perſon to
him in the World: Which is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
teſtimony of his high diſpleaſure
againſt Sin, and of his tender regard
and concernment for the honour of
his Laws, than if the Sinner had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the puniſhment due to it in his
own perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Reaſon of this
Diſpenſation, and that likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſiderable, was, that God
might forgive Sin in ſuch a way as
yet effectually to diſcountenance
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103163:100"/>
and diſcourage it, and to create in
us the greateſt horror and hatred of
it: Which could not have been by
an abſolute Pardon, without any
puniſhment inflicted, or ſatisfaction
made to the honour of his Juſtice.
For had Sin been ſo eaſily forgiven,
who would have been ſenſible of
the great evil of it, or afraid to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
for the future?</p>
            <p>But when God makes his own
Son a Sacrifice, and lays upon him
the puniſhment due for the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of us all, this is a demonſtration
that God hates Sin as much, if it be
poſſible, as he loved his own Son.
For this plainly ſhews what Sin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
and what the Sinner may
juſtly expect, if after this ſeverity of
God againſt it he will venture to
commit it.</p>
            <p>And if this Sacrifice for Sin, and
the Pardon purchaſed by it, be not
effectual to reclaim us from Sin, and
to beget in us an eternal dread and
deteſtation of it: If we ſin wilfully
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103163:101"/>
after ſo clear a revelation of the
<hi>wrath of God from heaven againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs
and unrighteouſneſs of men,</hi>
there remains <hi>no more ſacrifice for ſin,
but a certain fearful looking for of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and fiery indignation to conſume the
adverſaries.</hi> For what could God
do more to teſtify his diſpleaſure
againſt ſin, and to diſcountenance
the practice of it, than to make his
only Son an offering for Sin, and to
give him up to be wounded for our
tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our
iniquities? In what clearer Glaſs
can we at once behold the great evil
and demerit of Sin, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
goodneſs and mercy of God to
Sinners, than in the ſorrows and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of the Son of God for our Sins and for our
ſakes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another Reaſon of this
Diſpenſation ſeems to have been a
gracious condeſcenſion and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Almighty God with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
apprehenſion and perſuaſion,
which had very early and univerſally
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103163:101"/>
obtained among Mankind, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the expiation of Sin and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the offended Deity by Sacrifices:
by the Sacrifices of living Creatures,
of Birds and Beaſts; and afterwards
by Human Sacrifices and <hi>the blood of
their ſons and daughters:</hi> by offering
to God, as the expreſſion is in the
<hi>Prophet, their firſt-born for their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
and the fruit of their body for
the ſin of their ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Notion of the expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sin by Sacrifice, whether it
had its firſt Riſe from <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and was afterwards propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from Age to Age by <hi>Tradition:</hi>
I ſay, from whence ſoever this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
came, it hath of all other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concerning Religion, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe of the <hi>Being</hi> of God, and
his <hi>Providence,</hi> and of the <hi>Recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of <hi>another Life,</hi> found the moſt
univerſal reception, and the thing
hath been the moſt generally practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in all Ages and Nations, not only
in the <hi>old,</hi> but in the <hi>new</hi> diſcovered
parts of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:103163:102"/>
And indeed a very great part of
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
by God himſelf, ſeems to
have been a plain condeſcenſion to
the general Apprehenſion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
concerning this way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing
the offended Deity by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices:
As it was also a Figure of
that great and effic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cious Sacrifice
which ſhould in due time be offer'd
to God to make atonement once for
all for the Sins of all Mankind.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
doth very particularly inſiſt upon
this condeſcenſion of God to them,
in the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel:

great a neceſſity of an <hi>High-Prieſt</hi>

for the ſins of the People, that it

them, that <hi>without ſhedding of blood
there was no remiſſion of Sins;</hi> God was
pleaſed to comply ſo far with theſe
Notions and Apprehenſions of theirs,
as to make his own Son both a <hi>Prieſt</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:103163:102"/>
and a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> to do that once for

            </p>
            <p>And this Apprehenſion prevailed
no leſs in the <hi>Heathen</hi> World, and
proceeded to the Sacrifices of Men,
even of their <hi>firſt-born.</hi> And with
this Apprehenſion, not to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
but to aboliſh it, God was
pleaſed to comply ſo far as to make
a general Atonement for the Sins of
Mankind by the Death of his Son,
appearing in our Nature to become
a voluntary Sacrifice for us: God
permitting him to be unjuſtly put to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103163:103"/>
death and his blood to be ſhed by
the malice of men, in appearance
as a Malefactor, but in truth as a
Martyr; and accepting of his Death
as a meritorious Sacrifice and <hi>propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
for the Sins of the whole World:</hi>
That by this wiſe counſel and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of his Providence he might
for ever put an end to that barbarous
and inhuman way of ſerving God
which had been ſo long in uſe and
practice among them: The Son of
God by the voluntary Sacrifice of
himſelf having effected all that at
once, and for ever, which Mankind
from the beginning of the World
had in vain been endeavouring to
accompliſh by innumerable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Sacrifices; namely, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of their Sins, and perfect peace
and reconciliation with God.</p>
            <p>For theſe Ends and Reaſons, and
perhaps for many more as great and
conſiderable as theſe which our
ſhallow underſtandings are not able
to fathom, the Wiſdom of God
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103163:103"/>
hath pitched upon this way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of delivering Mankind from
the guilt and dominion of Sin by
the Sacrifice of his Son. And to
this end it was requiſite that he
ſhould appear in our Nature and
dwell amongſt us for ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
time, that by a long courſe of
the greateſt Innocency and of the
greateſt Sufferings in our Nature he
might be capable of making a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
expiation of Sin.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>two</hi> things were requiſite
to qualify him for this purpoſe; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and great
<hi>Sufferings</hi> in our Nature, even to the
ſuffering of Death. Both theſe the
<hi>Scripture</hi> declares to be necceſſary
qualifications of a Perſon capable to
make expiation of Sin; and both
theſe were found in the Perſon of our
<hi>B. Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Unſpotted <hi>Innocency</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Obedience.</hi> This the <hi>Scripture</hi>
teſtifies concerning Him, and the

<hi>as is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate
from Sinners, who needs not as thoſe
High-Prieſts,</hi> that is as the High-Prieſts
under the Law, <hi>to offer up ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
firſt for his own Sins, and then for
the People:</hi> The plain force of which
Argument is this, that he who will
be qualified to make atonement for
the Sins of others muſt be without
ſin himself.</p>
            <p>And then if we conſider <hi>Chriſt</hi> as
a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for Sin; perfect holineſs
is neceſſary to make a Sacrifice accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and available for the expiation
of Sin. The neceſſity of this was
typified by the quality of the <hi>expiatory
Sacrifices</hi> under the <hi>Law:</hi> the <hi>Beaſts</hi>
that were to be offered were to be
<hi>without ſpot and blemiſh:</hi> To which the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103163:105"/>
               <hi>Apoſtle</hi> alludes, ſpeaking of the quality
and efficacy of the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt:
How much more,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> ſays he, <hi>ſhall the blood of
Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himself without ſpot to God, purge your
conſciences from dead works to ſerve the
living God?</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe
St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>Foraſmuch as ye know ye were
not redeemed with corruptible things, as
ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood
of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh
and without ſpot, &amp;c.</hi> hereby intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that nothing leſs than the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
innocency and holineſs of him
who was to be a Sacrifice for us could
have expiated the guilt of our <hi>ſins</hi>
and purchaſed eternal Redemption
for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> great <hi>Sufferings</hi> likewiſe
in our Nature, even to the ſuffering
of Death, were requiſite to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
expiation of Sin: I ſay, even to
the ſuffering of Death. For the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
which were to make expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were to be ſlain. And it was a
conſtant <hi>Maxim</hi> and Principle among
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103163:105"/>
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> more than
once in this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> ſeems to allow and
confirm it, that <hi>without ſhedding of blood
there was no remiſſion of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that God could not have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
Sin without ſatisfaction made
to his Juſtice, either by the ſuffering
of the Sinner himſelf, or of a Sacrifice
in his ſtead: But, according to the
method and Diſpenſation which the
Wiſdom of God had pitched upon, he
was reſolved not to diſpenſe Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in any other way. For which
reaſon he ſeems either to have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
Mankind with this <hi>Principle,</hi> or
to have permitted them to be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,
that <hi>Sin was not to be expiated but
by Blood,</hi> that is, either by the Death
of the Sinner, or of the Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Now the Life of our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi> as
well as his Death, was made up of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of one kind or other: Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Sufferings from his Cradle to his
Croſs, from the time he drew his firſt
breath to his giving up of the ghoſt:
And not only continual Sufferings, but
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103163:106"/>
the greateſt that ever were, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Dignity of the Perſon that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
and the nature of the Sufferings:
Conſidering likewiſe that theſe Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were not only wholly undeſerved
on his part, but unmerited alſo on ours,
for whoſe ſake he ſubmitted himſelf
to them: Nay, on the contrary, he had
obliged to the utmoſt thoſe for
whom and by whom he ſuffered, and
continued ſtill to oblige them by the
greateſt Bleſſings and Benefits purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and procured for them by thoſe
very Sufferings which with ſo much
Malice and Cruelty they inflicted on
him.</p>
            <p>Had our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> been a mere
Man, the perfect Innocency and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted
Purity of his whole Life; his
Zeal to do the Will of God, and his
delight in doing it; his infinite pains
and unwearied diligence in <hi>going about
doing good:</hi> His conſtant Obedience to
God in the moſt difficult Inſtances, and
his perſeverance in well doing, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the ill uſage and hard
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103163:106"/>
meaſure, the bitter Reproaches and
Perſecutions he met withal for it,
from a wicked and ill natured World:
His perfect ſubmiſſion to the Will of
God, his invincible Patience under the
greateſt and bittereſt Sufferings, and
his infinite Charity to his Enemies and
Perſecutors: Theſe muſt needs be
highly acceptable to God, and if Man
could merit of God, likely enough to
be available for the Sins of others.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Saviour</hi> and our <hi>Sacrifice</hi>
being the <hi>Son of God</hi> in our Nature;
and He voluntarily aſſuming it, and
ſubmitting to the condition of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in its loweſt and moſt miſerable
ſtate, Sin only excepted; and his being
contented to live a Life of doing good
and ſuffering evil, and at laſt to be put
to Death and ſlain a Sacrifice for us:
The Dignity of the Perſon who did
and ſuffered all this for us, and his
dearneſs to God, muſt needs add a
mighty value to ſo perfect an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and ſuch patient Sufferings; ſo as
to render them a full, perfect and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103163:107"/>
Sacrifice, oblation and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the Sins of the whole World.</p>
            <p>And all this being willingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in our Nature, and accepted
by God as done upon our account,
may reaſonably be preſumed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to our benefit and advantage, as
much as if we our ſelves had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in our own perſons: Nothing
being ſo proper, and ſo available to
make an <hi>hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urable amends</hi> and ſatisfaction
to the Juſtice of God for the Sins
of all Mankind, as the voluntary Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Sufferings of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in a Perſon of ſo great Dignity
and dearneſs to God as his eternal and
entirely beloved Son.</p>
            <p>Now that Expiation of Sin was
made by the Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in our
ſtead, I ſhall endeavour to make good
theſe <hi>three</hi> ways.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> From plain Teſtimonies of
<hi>H. Scripture,</hi> declaring this matter to
us as clearly and fully as it is poſſible
for words to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:103163:107"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of <hi>Expiatory Sacrifices,</hi> both
among the <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathen; to
which the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in the
<hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſo frequently compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and in point of vertue and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
to take away Sin infinitely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By vindicating this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and Diſpenſation of the Divine
Wiſdom from the Objections which
are brought againſt it; and by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there is nothing in it that is
unreaſonable, or any wiſe unworthy
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. I ſhall produce ſome plain Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
of <hi>H. Scripture</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
this matter as clearly and fully
as it is poſſible for words to do it;
namely, that the <hi>Son of God,</hi> in order
to the effectual <hi>Expiation</hi> of Sin,
ſuffered in our ſtead, and bore the
wrath of God for us, and made a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Atonement for Sin, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
eternal Redemption for us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:103163:108"/>
This the <hi>Scripture</hi> declares to us in
great variety of expreſſions; as, that
<hi>Chriſt died for us,</hi> and <hi>for our Sins;</hi>
that he was <hi>a Sacrifice for us,</hi> and <hi>a
propitiation for the Sins of the whole World,</hi>
that is, of all Mankind; that <hi>be
bare our Sins in his own body on the
Tree,</hi> and <hi>appeared to take away Sin by
the Sacrifice of himſelf;</hi> that <hi>we are
juſtified in his blood,</hi> and <hi>redeemed by the
price of it;</hi> and in very many other
expreſſions to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And this is ſo evidently the ſcope
and meaning of theſe Expreſſions,
that it cannot be denied without
offering the greateſt violence imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to the <hi>H. Scriptures.</hi> For can
any man think that God would have
uſed ſo many expreſſions in <hi>Scripture,</hi>
the plain and moſt obvious ſenſe of
all which is that the <hi>Son of God</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for our Sins and in our ſtead, if
this had not been his deſign and
meaning? Would not this be in
effect to ſay, that God hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a great Book to puzzle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103163:108"/>
but not to inſtruct and teach
Mankind?</p>
            <p>I will at preſent ſingle out ſome
few of thoſe many <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi>
which might be produced to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note>
               <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us,
who knew no ſin,</hi> that is, he hath made
him who had no ſin himself a Sacrifice
for our ſins.<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 10</note> Again; <hi>and walk in love,
as Chriſt alſo hath loved us and given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for us, an offering and a ſacrifice to
God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the ſame purpoſe
tells us, that <hi>Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered
for Sins, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he
might bring us to God, being put to death in
the fleſh:</hi> Here <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for Sin;</hi> and to declare that the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> did not only mean that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
ſuffered upon the occaſion of our Sins,
but that he ſuffered in the place and
ſtead of the Sinner, he adds, <hi>the juſt
for the unjuſt,</hi> that is, the Son of God,
who was innocent and had no Sin,
ſuffered for us who were Sinners; or
as it is elſewhere expreſs'd, <hi>he bare our
ſins in his own body on the Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:103163:109"/>
It is true indeed, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for our benefit and advantage;
which the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have to be
all that is meant in the <hi>Texts</hi> which I
have cited: But then it ought to be
conſidered, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſuffering for
our benefit and advantage does by no
means exclude, nor is any wiſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with his ſuffering in our ſtead.
For whoever ſuffers in another man's
ſtead, and to ſave him from ſuffering,
does undoubtedly ſuffer for his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and advantage, and gives the beſt
demonſtration of it that can be: But
the manner of the expreſſion, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with other parallel <hi>Texts</hi> of
<hi>Scripture,</hi> and eſpecially with what is
ſo often ſaid of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s being a
<hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which I ſhall have occaſion
further to urge by and by: I ſay the
manner of the expreſſion, if well
conſidered, will appear to any man
that is not contentious to ſignify our
<hi>Saviour</hi>'s ſuffering inſtead of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:103163:109"/>
But not to argue from words and
phraſes, I will produce two <hi>Texts</hi>
which declare this matter ſo plainly,
that the force of them is not to be
avoided without the moſt ſhameful
wreſting and perverting of them.
<hi>This is my Commandment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 12.</note> ſays our
<hi>Saviour, that you love one another, as
I have loved you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 13.</note> How is that? he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
in the next words, <hi>Greater love
than this hath no man, that a man lay
down his life for his friend,</hi> that
is, that he be contented to die in his ſtead.
And to the ſame purpoſe St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 6, 7, 8.</note>
               <hi>For when ye were yet Sinners in due time
Chriſt died for the ungodly:</hi> Now the
queſtion is, whether by this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>dying for the ungodly</hi>
be meant only his dying for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and advantage of Sinners, but
not his dying in their ſtead? This,
let the words which immediately
follow determine: <hi>For ſcarcely for a
righteous man will one dye, yet peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for a good man one would even dare to
dye: But God commendeth his love to us,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:103163:110"/>
in that whilſt we were yet ſinners Chriſt
dyed for us.</hi> And now I appeal to
any man of good ſenſe, whether it
be not plain that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here
ſpeaks of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s dying for ſinners in
the ſame ſenſe as one man is ſaid to
dye for another, that is, to ſave
another from death; which what is
it elſe but to dye in his ſtead? He
that can deny this, is perverſe to the
higheſt degree, and I fear almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the poſſibility of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.</p>
            <p>And the Argument from theſe two
<hi>Texts</hi> is ſo much the ſtronger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we do not here reaſon merely
from the phraſe and expreſſion, but
from the main Scope of our <hi>Saviour's</hi>
diſcourſe in the <hi>one,</hi> and of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
in the other. For the deſign of both
is to recommend the Superlative love
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to us above the greateſt
love that ever any man expreſs'd to
another. The higheſt pitch that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
affection did ever riſe to, was
for a man to lay down his life for his
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103163:110"/>
Friend; but the <hi>Son of God</hi> laid
down his life for his Enemies.
<hi>Scarcely,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, would one lay
down his life for a righteous man,</hi> that is,
for one who is but ſtrictly juſt and
honeſt, and does no body wrong;
but for a <hi>good man,</hi> that is, for one
that is kind and beneficial to all, and
hath obliged Mankind by great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
ſome one may be found that
would lay down his life to ſave the
life of ſuch a Perſon: But the love
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath gone far beyond this:
He <hi>dyed for Sinners,</hi> for thoſe who
were neither <hi>good men</hi> nor <hi>righteous:
But God commendeth his love to us, in
that whilſt we were yet Sinners Chriſt dyed
for us.</hi> Now where doth the force
of this Argument lye, if not in
this? that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done that for
us, who were <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi>
which ſome very few perſons in the
World have done for their <hi>Friend,</hi> or
for ſome very eminently <hi>good man:</hi>
And what is that? Why they have
laid down their lives in their ſtead:
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103163:111"/>
And ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done for us. This
ſeems to be so very plain, that I do
not ſee how the force of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is poſſible to be avoided.</p>
            <p>It is evident then from <hi>Scripture,</hi>
that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed not only for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
but in our stead; as truly
and really as any man ever did or can
dye for another who lays down his
own life to ſave another from death.
For if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not dyed, we had
periſhed everlaſtingly; and becauſe
he dyed, we are ſaved from eternal
Death and miſery.</p>
            <p>And though this be no where in
<hi>Scripture</hi> ſpoken of by the name or
<hi>term</hi> of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> yet it is ſaid to
be the <hi>price</hi> of our <hi>Redemption;</hi> which
ſurely is the ſame thing in effect with
<hi>Satisfaction.</hi> For as we are Sinners
we are liable, and, as I may ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to the Juſtice of God: And
the Son of God, by his Death and
Sufferings in our Nature, hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
this obligation and paid this
debt for us: Which diſcharge ſince it
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:103163:111"/>
was obtained for us by the ſhedding
of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s blood, and the <hi>Scripture</hi>
tells us that <hi>without ſhedding of blood
there is no remiſſion of Sins:</hi> And ſince
God is graciouſly pleaſed to accept of
it for the Debt which we owed to his
Juſtice, and to declare himſelf fully
pleaſed and contented with it, why
it may not properly enough be called
<hi>payment</hi> or <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> I confeſs I am
not able to underſtand. Men may
eternally wrangle about any thing,
but what a frivolous contention,
what a trifling in ſerious matters,
what <hi>barretrie</hi> in <hi>Divinity</hi> is this?</p>
            <p>Not that God was <hi>angry</hi> with his
<hi>Son,</hi> when he thus <hi>laid on him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
of us all:</hi> No he was always
well pleaſed with him; and never
better, than when he <hi>became obedient
to the Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi>
and <hi>bore our Sins in his own body on the
Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor yet that our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſuffered
the very ſame that the Sinner ſhould
have ſuffered, namely, the proper
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:103163:112"/>
Pains and Torment of the Damned:
But that his Obedience and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were of that value and eſteem
with God, and his voluntary Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of himſelf ſo well-pleaſing to
him, that he thereupon entred into
a Covenant of Grace and Mercy
with Mankind, wherein he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
himſelf to forgive the Sins of
thoſe who believe and repent, and
to make them partakers of eternal
life. And hence the <hi>Blood of Chriſt</hi>
which was ſhed for us upon the <hi>Croſs</hi>
is called <hi>the Blood of the Covenant,</hi> as
being the <hi>Sanction</hi> of that <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
into which God is entred with
Mankind: and not only the <hi>Sanction</hi>
and confirmation of that <hi>Covenant,</hi>
but the very <hi>Foundation</hi> of it: For
which reaſon the <hi>Cup</hi> in the <hi>Lord's
Supper</hi> is called <hi>the New Teſtament,</hi>
or, as the word ſhould rather be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
<hi>the New Covenant in his Blood,
which was ſhed for many for the remiſſion
of Sins.</hi> I proceed now to the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:103163:112"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>: Thing propounded, which
was to ſhew that the Expiation of
our Sins was made by the Sufferings
of Chriſt, from the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Expiatory Sacrifices,</hi> both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathen;</hi> to
which the <hi>Death of Chriſt</hi> is in the
<hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſo frequently compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and in point of vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
to take away Sin infinitely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to it.</p>
            <p>Now the nature and deſign of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory
Sacrifices</hi> was plainly this: To
ſubſtitute one <hi>Living Creature</hi> to
ſuffer and die inſtead of another, ſo
that what the Sinner deſerved to
have ſuffered was ſuppoſed to be
done to the Sacrifice, that is, it was
ſlain to make an atonement for the
Sinner.</p>
            <p>And though there was no reaſon
to hope for any ſuch effect from the
Blood of <hi>Bulls,</hi> or <hi>Goats,</hi> or of
any other <hi>Living Creatures</hi> that were
wont to be offered up in Sacrifice;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:103163:113"/>
yet that both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> did
expect and hope for it, is ſo very
evident, that it cannot without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Ignorance or Obſtinacy be
deny'd.</p>
            <p>But this expectation, how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
ſoever, plainly ſhews it to
have been the common Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Mankind, in all Ages, that,
God would not be appeaſed, nor
ſhould Sin be pardoned without
Suffering: But yet ſo that men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
conceived good hopes that
upon the Repentance of Sinners God
would accept of a <hi>vicarious</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that is, of the Suffering of
ſome other in their ſtead. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
probably, as I ſaid before, in
compliance with this Apprehenſion
of Mankind, and in condeſcenſion
to it, as well as for other weighty
Reaſons beſt known to the Divine
Wiſdom, God was pleaſed to find
out ſuch a Sacrifice as ſhould really
and effectually procure for them
that great Bleſſing of the Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103163:113"/>
of Sins which they had ſo long
hoped for from the multitude of
their own Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth
in a large Diſcourſe ſhew the great
vertue and efficacy of the Sacrifice of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> to the purpoſe of Remiſſion
of Sins, above that of the Sacrifices
under the Law: And that the Death
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is really and effectually to
our advantage all that which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
under the Law were ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be to the Sinner: <hi>But now once,</hi>
ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here in the <hi>Text, in
the end of the World, hath he appeared to
take away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf.</hi>
This is the great vertue and efficacy
of the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that what
ever was expected from any other
Sacrifices, either by <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi>
was really effected by <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was plainly ſignified by the
<hi>Jewiſh Paſſover,</hi> wherein the <hi>Lamb</hi>
was ſlain, and the <hi>Sinner</hi> did <hi>eſcape</hi>
and was <hi>paſs'dby.</hi> In alluſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes no ſcruple to call
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103163:114"/>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Paſſover</hi> or <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi>
who was <hi>ſlain</hi> that we might <hi>eſcape:
Chriſt our Paſſover,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 7.</note> ſays he, <hi>is ſlain</hi> or
<hi>offer'd for us;</hi> that is, He by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
appointment of God was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
to ſuffer all that in our ſtead
which the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> was ſuppoſed
to ſuffer for the <hi>Sinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this was likewiſe ſignified
by the Sinners laying his hand upon
the Sacrifice that was to be ſlain,
thereby as it were transferring the
puniſhment which was due to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon the Sacrifice that was to
be ſlain and offered up. For ſo God
tells <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the Sinner, who
came to offer an Expiatory Sacrifice,
ſhould do:<note place="margin">Lev. 1. 4.</note> 
               <hi>He ſhall put his hand upon
the head of the burnt-offering, and it ſhall
be accepted for him, to make an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for him.</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells
us, that it was an eſtabliſhed Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, that <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhedding of blood there was no Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Sins:</hi> Which plainly ſhews
that they expected this Benefit of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:103163:114"/>
the Remiſſion of Sins, from the
Blood of their Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>And then he tells us, that we are
really made partakers of this Benefit
by the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by the
vertue of his Sacrifice: And again,
<hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 28.</note> ſays he, <hi>was once offered to bear
the Sins of many;</hi> plainly alluding to
the Sacrifices under the Law, which
did, as it were, bear the faults of the
Sinner.</p>
            <p>And that this expreſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
being <hi>offered to bear our Sins,</hi> cannot
be meant of his taking away our Sins
by his holy Doctrine which was
confirmed by his Death, but of his
bearing our Sins by way of <hi>imputation,</hi>
and by his ſuffering for them in our
ſtead, as the Sacrifice was ſuppoſed
to do for the Sinner; This, I ſay,
is evident beyond all denial from
the oppoſition which follows, after
the <hi>Text,</hi> between his <hi>firſt</hi> Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and his <hi>ſecond; Chriſt,</hi> ſays our
<hi>Apoſtle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 28.</note> 
               <hi>was once offered to bear our Sins;
but unto them that look for him he ſhall
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103163:115"/>
appear a ſecond time without Sin unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
Why? Did he not appear
the firſt time without Sin? Yes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
as to any inherent guilt;
for the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us <hi>he had no Sin.</hi>
What then is the meaning of the
oppoſition, That at his <hi>firſt</hi> Coming
<hi>he bore our Sins,</hi> but at his <hi>ſecond</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>he ſhall appear without Sin unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
Theſe words can have no other
imaginable ſenſe but this, that at
his <hi>firſt</hi> Coming he ſuſtain'd the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a Sinner and ſuffered inſtead
of us; but his <hi>ſecond</hi> Coming
ſhall be upon another account,
and <hi>he ſhall appear without Sin
unto Salvation,</hi> that is, not as a
<hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but as a <hi>Judge</hi> to confer
the Reward of Eternal Life upon
thoſe who are partakers of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which he offered
to God for us <hi>in the days of his Fleſh.</hi>
I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> III<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Thing I propoſed, and which
yet remains to be ſpoken to; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103163:115"/>
to vindicate this Method and
<hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of the <hi>Divine Wiſdom</hi>
from the <hi>Objections</hi> which are
brought againſt it; and to ſhew that
there is nothing in it that is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
or any wiſe unworthy of
God. I ſhall mention <hi>four Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
which are commonly urged in
this matter, and I think they are all
that are conſiderable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obj. 1ſt.</note> That this Method, of the
<hi>Expiation</hi> of Sin by the Sufferings of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſeems to argue ſome defect and
want of Goodneſ in God, as if he
needed ſome external Motive and
were not of himſelf diſpoſed to
forgive Sinners.</p>
            <p>To which I think the <hi>Anſwer</hi> is not
difficult, namely, that God did not
want Goodneſs to have forgiven Sin
freely and without any Satisfaction,
but his Wiſdom did not think it
meet to give encouragement to Sin
by too eaſy a forgiveneſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome remarkable teſtimony of
his ſevere diſpleaſure againſt it: And
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:103163:116"/>
therefore his greater Goodneſs and
Compaſſion to Mankind deviſed this
way to ſave the Sinner, without
giving the leaſt countenance and
encouragement to Sin.</p>
            <p>For God to think of ſaving us any
way, was exceſſive Goodneſs and
Mercy; but to think of doing
it in this way, by ſubſtituting his
dearly beloved Son to ſuffer in our
ſtead, is a Condeſcenſion ſo very
amazing, that if God had not been
pleaſed of his own Goodneſs to
ſtoop to it, it had almoſt been Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
in Man to have thought of
it, or deſired it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obj. 2d.</note> How can our Sins be
ſaid to have been forgiven <hi>freely,</hi> if
the Pardon of them was purchaſed
at ſo dear a rate and ſo mighty a
Price was paid for it?</p>
            <p>In <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this I deſire theſe
<hi>two</hi> things may be conſidered.
<hi>1ſt.</hi> That it is a wonderful grace
and favour of God to admit of this
tranſlation of the Puniſhment which
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103163:116"/>
was due to us, and to accept of the
Sufferings of another in our ſtead,
and for our benefit; when he might
juſtly have exacted it of us in our
own Perſons: So that, even in this
reſpect, we are, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,
<hi>juſtified freely by his grace, through the
Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt:</hi>
And <hi>freely</hi> too in reſpect of any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
that lay upon God to forgive
us in this or any other way. It was
a free act of his Goodneſs to ſave us,
even by the Satisfaction and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his own Son. <hi>2dly.</hi> It was
in effect freely too, notwithſtanding
the mighty Price which was paid for
our Redemption. Becauſe this Price
was not of our own procuring, but
of God's providing; He <hi>found out
this Ranſome for us.</hi> And will any
man ſay, that a Prince who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
with his Son to intercede
for the Pardon of a Rebel, yea and
to ſuffer ſome puniſhment or to pay
a Fine for the obtaining of it, does
not in effect and in all equitable and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103163:117"/>
grateful conſtruction forgive him freely?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obj. 3d.</note> It is yet further objected,
That this ſeems to be more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
than the ſacrificing of <hi>Beaſts</hi>
among the <hi>Jews,</hi> nay than the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
of <hi>Men</hi> among the <hi>Heathen,</hi>
and even of their <hi>own Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi>
Becauſe this is the offering up
of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and the moſt excellent Perſon
that ever was.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the <hi>manner,</hi> and the <hi>deſign</hi> of it,
the thing will appear to be quite
otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>manner</hi> of it, God did not
command his Son to be ſacrificed,
but his Providence permitted the
wickedneſs and violence of men
to put him to death: And then
his Goodneſs and Wiſdom did
over-rule this worſt of Actions to
the beſt of Ends. And if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the matter aright, how is this
any more a reflection upon the Holy
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103163:117"/>
Providence of God, than any Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and Cruelties which by his
permiſſion are daily committed in the
World?</p>
            <p>And then if we conſider the End
and <hi>Deſign</hi> of this permiſſion of
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death, and the application of
it to the purpoſe of a general Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
we cannot but acknowledge,
and even adore the gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Deſign of it. For by this means
God did at once put an end to that
unreaſonable and bloody way of
Worſhip, which had been ſo long
practiced in the World: And after
this one Sacrifice, which was ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
dear to God, the benefit of
Expiation was not to be expected in
any other way; all other Sacrifices
being worthleſs and vain in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of this: And it hath ever ſince
obtained this effect, of making all
other Sacrifices to ceaſe, in all Parts
of the World where <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> hath
prevailed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:103163:118"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obj. 4th.</note> The laſt <hi>Objection</hi> is, the
Injuſtice and Cruelty of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Perſon's ſuffering inſtead of the
Offender.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That they who
make ſo great a noiſe with this <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
do ſeem to me to give a full and
clear <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it themſelves, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging,
as they conſtantly and
expreſly do, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſuffered
all this for our <hi>benefit</hi> and <hi>advantage,</hi>
though not in our <hi>place</hi> and <hi>ſtead.</hi>
For this, to my apprehenſion, is
plainly to give up the Cauſe, unleſs
they can ſhew a good reaſon why
there is not as much Injuſtice and
Cruelty in an innocent Perſon's
ſuffering for the benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of a Malefactor, as in his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his ſtead: So little do Men,
in the heat of diſpute and oppoſition,
who are reſolved to hold faſt an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in deſpite of Reaſon and good
ſenſe, conſider, that they do many
times in effect, and by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
grant the very thing which
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103163:118"/>
in expreſs terms they do ſo ſtifly and
pertinaciouſly deny.</p>
            <p>The truth of the matter is this;
there is nothing of Injuſtice or Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
in either Caſe; neither in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Perſon's ſuffering for the <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi>
of an Offender, nor in his <hi>ſtead;</hi>
ſuppoſing the Suffering to be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary:
But they have equally the
ſame appearance of Injuſtice and
Cruelty: Nor can I poſſibly diſcern
any reaſon why Injuſtice and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhould be objected in the one
Caſe more than in the other, there
being every whit as little reaſon why
an <hi>Innocent Perſon</hi> ſhould ſuffer for
the <hi>benefit</hi> of a <hi>Criminal,</hi> as why he
ſhould ſuffer in his <hi>ſtead.</hi> So that I
hope this <hi>Objection,</hi> which above all
the reſt hath been ſo loudly and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidiouſly
urged, hath received a juſt
<hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I believe, if the matter were
ſearched to the bottom, all this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
contention, about our Saviour's
ſuffering for our <hi>benefit</hi> but not in our
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103163:119"/>
               <hi>ſtead,</hi> will ſignify juſt nothing. For
if <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for our <hi>henefit</hi> ſo as
ſome way or other, by vertue of his
Death and Sufferings, to ſave us
from the wrath of God and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
our eſcape from eternal Death,
this, for ought I know, is all that any
body means by his dying in our
<hi>ſtead.</hi> For he that dies with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to do that <hi>benefit</hi> to another as
to ſave him from Death, doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to all intents and purpoſes dye
in his place and <hi>ſtead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if they will grant this to be
their meaning, the Controverſie is at
an end; and both ſides are agreed in
the thing, and do only differ in the
phraſe and manner of expreſſion:
which is to ſeek a quarrel and an
occaſion of difference where there is
no real ground for it; a thing which
ought to be very far from reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and peaceable Minds.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, that our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>'s
voluntary Obedience and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
did procure his Exaltation at
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103163:119"/>
the right hand of God, and Power
and Authority to forgive Sins, and
to give eternal Life to as many as he
pleaſed: So that they grant that his
Obedience and Sufferings, in the
meritorious conſequence of them,
do redound to our <hi>Benefit</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
as much as we pretend and
ſay they do; only they are loth in
expreſs terms to acknowledge that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed in our <hi>ſtead:</hi> And this,
for no other reaſon, that I can
imagine, but becauſe they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it ſo often and ſo long.</p>
            <p>But I appeal to the ingenuity of
our <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> whether this do not in
the laſt iſſue come all to one; and be
not, on their part, a mere Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
about words? For ſuppoſe a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour
condemned to ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
puniſhment, and the King's
Son to ſave him from it is contented
to ſubmit to great diſgrace and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings:
In reward of which Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
the King takes his Son into
his Throne and ſets him at his own
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103163:120"/>
right hand, and gives him power
to pardon this Malefactour, and
upon a fitting Submiſſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
to advance him to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
Will not any man in this
Caſe allow that the King's Son ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
inſtead of this Malefactour, and
ſmile at any man that ſhall be ſo
nice as to grant that indeed he <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered</hi>
for him, but yet to deny that
he was <hi>puniſh'd</hi> for him, to allow
that he bore the inconvenience of his
faults, but yet obſtinately to ſtand
it out that the faults of this Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
were not laid upon him, or
in any wiſe ſo imputed to him that
he can be ſaid to have ſuffered in his
ſtead? This is juſt the Caſe, and
the difference in reality, and in the
laſt reſult of things is nothing but
words.</p>
            <p>Thus far have I tryed your patience
in a contentious Argument; in
which I take no pleaſure, but yet
ſhall be glad if I may be ſo happy as
by any thing that hath been ſaid to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103163:120"/>
contribute towards the putting an end
to ſo unhappy a Controverſy, which
hath troubled the World ſo long,
and raiſed ſuch a duſt that very few
have been able to ſee clearly through
it.</p>
            <p>However I cannot diſmiſs this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
without making ſome uſeful
but very ſhort reflection upon this
great Doctrine of our Religion,
namely, That the Son of God being
made a Sacrifice for us, and expoſed
to ſuch bitter Sufferings and ſo cruel
a Death for the Expiation of our Sins,
ſhould create in us the greateſt dread
and deteſtation of Sin, and for ever
deter us from all wilful tranſgreſſion
and diſobedience. For if the guilt
of our Sins was done away upon ſuch
hard terms and coſt the dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Son of God ſo much ſweat and
blood, then ſurely we ought to take
great heed how by our renewed
Provocations we renew his Paſſion,
and do what in us lies to <hi>crucify to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:103163:121"/>
our ſelves the Son of God afreſh, and to
put him to an open ſhame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If God did ſo terribly afflict the
dearly beloved of his Soul for our
ſakes; if the Son of God was
ſo grievouſly <hi>wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions</hi>
and ſo ſorely <hi>bruiſed for our
iniquities:</hi> If ſo fearful a Storm of
Vengeance fell upon the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Perſon that ever was for our
Sins, then we have reaſon to take
that kind and merciful admonition
of the Son of God to Sinners, to <hi>ſin
no more, leſt a worſe thing,</hi> if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>come upon</hi> our ſelves.</p>
            <p>In this Diſpenſation of God's
Grace and Mercy to Mankind, by
the Death of his Son, God ſeems to
have gone to the very extremity of
things, and almoſt further than Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Juſtice will well admit;
to afflict Innocency it ſelf to ſave the
Guilty: And if herein God hath
expreſſed his hatred of Sin in ſuch
a wonderful way of love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the Sons of Men as looks
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103163:121"/>
almoſt like hatred of Innocency and
his own Son: This ought in all inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
and gratitude to our gracious
Redeemer, who <hi>was made a curſe for
us,</hi> and <hi>loved us</hi> to that degree as to <hi>waſh
us from our Sins in his own Blood:</hi> I ſay,
This ought to beget in us a greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
againſt Sin, and a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
deteſtation of it, than if we had
ſuffered the puniſhment due to it, in
our own Perſons: For in this Caſe,
we could only have been diſpleaſed
at our Selves and our Sins as the juſt
Cauſe of our Sufferings: but in the
other, we ought to hate Sin as the
unhappy occaſion of the ſaddeſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
and ſoreſt Calamities to the
<hi>beſt Man</hi> that ever was, and to our <hi>beſt
Friend,</hi> for our Sins and for our Sakes.</p>
            <p>Since then the <hi>Son of God</hi> hath ſo
graciouſly condeſcended to be <hi>made in
all things</hi> like unto us, <hi>Sin only excepted;</hi>
let us aſpire as much as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to become like to Him: Above
all, let us hate and avoid Sin as the
only thing in which the Son of God
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:103163:122"/>
would have no part with us, though
he was contented to ſuffer ſuch bitter
things to ſave us from the Defilement
and Dominion of it, from the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and all the diſmal conſequences
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He had no Sin,</hi> but God was pleaſed
to <hi>lay upon him the iniquities of us all,</hi> and
<hi>to make his Soul an offering for Sin,</hi> and
to permit all that to be done to Him
which was due to us: He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be ſacrificed once for all
Mankind, that Men might for ever
ceaſe from that inhuman and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
way of ſacrificing one another,
whereby inſtead of <hi>expiating</hi> their
guilt they did inflame it, and by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make Atonement for their Sins
they did in truth add to the number
and heinouſneſs of them.</p>
            <p>And let us likewiſe learn from
this admirable Pattern, to pity thoſe
that are in miſery, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo hath
pitied us; and to <hi>ſave them that are
ready to periſh,</hi> for His ſake who <hi>came
to ſeek and to ſave us that were loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:103163:122"/>
Let us, upon all occaſions, be ready
to open our bowels of Compaſſion
towards the Poor; in a thankful imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his Grace and Goodneſs who
for our ſakes choſe to be a Beggar, that
we for his ſake might not deſpiſe the
Poor, but might have a tender regard
and compaſſion to thoſe whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in this World does ſo nearly
reſemble that in which the <hi>Son of God</hi>
thought it fitteſt for him to appear
when he was pleaſed to become <hi>Man.</hi>

            <p>In a word, Let us in the whole

lives, <hi>ſhew forth the Vertues of Him who
hath called us out of darkneſs into his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous

Jeſus Chriſt, the firſt begotten from the

and whilſt we were <hi>Enemies</hi> to Him,
loved us at ſuch a rate as never any

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Particle <hi>for</hi> leads us to
the conſideration of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
and Occaſion of theſe words,
which in ſhort is this. The deſign
of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> is to direct <hi>Timothy,</hi> to
whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> had committed the
Government of the Church of
<hi>Epheſus,</hi> how he ought to demean
himſelf in that great and weighty
Charge. And at the beginning of
this <hi>Chapter</hi> he gives direction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Publick Prayers</hi> in the
Church; that <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:103163:124"/>
he made for all men,</hi> and for all
Ranks and Orders of men; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for <hi>Kings and all that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that under them</hi> Chriſtians <hi>might
lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this he tells us was very ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, by which
God deſigned the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
and therefore it muſt needs be
very acceptable to him that we
ſhould offer up <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings</hi>
to him in behalf of <hi>all men: For
this,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, is good and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in the ſight of God our Saviour,
who will have all men to be ſaved, and to
come to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then it follows in the next
words, <hi>For there is one God, and one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
between God and men, the Man Chriſt
Jesus, who gave himſelf a Ranſome for
all:</hi> As if he had ſaid, this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Charity of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in <hi>praying
for all men,</hi> muſt needs be very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to <hi>Him</hi> to whom we put up

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:103163:124"/>
his <hi>Son</hi> for the Salvation of <hi>all men:</hi>
And to <hi>Him</hi> likewiſe by whom we
offer up our Prayers to God, and is
among us <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the only <hi>Media or
between God and Men,</hi> in virtue of that
Price and Ranſom which he paid
for the Redemption of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
I ſay, for this reaſon it muſt
needs be very acceptable to Him
that we ſhould pray for all men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he died for all men, and now
that he is in Heaven at the right hand
of God intercedes with him for the
Salvation of thoſe for whom he died:
<hi>There is One God, and one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Men, the Man Chriſt
Jeſus, who gave himſelf a Ranſome for
all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words, though they be
brought in to prove more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
that it is <hi>acceptable to God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
that we ſhould put up Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to Him <hi>for all men,</hi> becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103163:125"/>
and in virtue of that Sacrifice
to be the only <hi>Mediator</hi> between God
and us: I ſay, though this be the
immediate ſcope and deſign of theſe
words, yet they are likewiſe a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to us, unto whom we ought
to addreſs our Prayers, namely, to
<hi>God;</hi> and by whoſe <hi>mediation</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion

            <p>There are ſeveral <hi>Propoſitions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in this and the following <hi>verſe;</hi>
but I ſhall at preſent confine my ſelf
to the <hi>firſt,</hi> namely, That <hi>there is
One God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 4.</note> that is, <hi>but One,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
elſewhere expreſſeth it, <hi>There is none
other God but One.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> lays
this as the Foundation of the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
Law, as well as of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Religion,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 35.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord he is One God, and
there is none beſides him,</hi> that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<hi>Jehovah,</hi> whom the People of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> did worſhip as the only true
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:103163:125"/>
God. And this the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
perpetually declares in oppoſition
to the <hi>Polytheiſm</hi> and variety of Gods
among the <hi>Heathen.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 44. 6.</note> 
               <hi>I am the firſt,
and I am the laſt, and beſides me there is
no God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 8.</note> And again, <hi>Is there any God
beſides me? there is no God, I know not
any:</hi> He, who hath an infinite
knowledge and knows all things,
knows no other God. And our
<hi>B. Saviour</hi> makes this the <hi>Fundamental
Article</hi> of all Religion, and the
knowledge of it neceſſary to every
man's Salvation; <hi>This,</hi> ſays <hi>He, is
life eternal, to know thee the only true
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is
a <hi>Notion</hi> wherein the greateſt and the
wiſeſt part of Mankind did always
agree, and therefore may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
be preſumed to be either <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
or to have ſprung from ſome
<hi>Original Tradition</hi> delivered down to
us from the <hi>firſt Parents</hi> of Mankind:
I mean, that there is <hi>One Supreme
Being,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:103163:126"/>
things, whom the moſt ancient of
the <hi>Heathen Poets</hi> commonly called
<hi>the Father of Gods and men.</hi> And thus
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> defines
God, <hi>the eternal and moſt</hi> excellent, or
<hi>beſt of all Living Beings.</hi> And this
<hi>Notion,</hi> of <hi>One Supreme Being,</hi> agrees
very well with that exact Harmony
which appears in the Frame and
Government of the World, in which
we ſee all things conſpiring to one
End, and continuing in one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Order and Courſe; which
cannot reaſonably be aſcribed to
any other but a conſtant and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Cauſe; and which to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
man does plainly ſhew that
all things are made and governed
by that <hi>One</hi> powerful <hi>Principle,</hi> and
great and wiſe <hi>Mind</hi> which we call
<hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But although the generality of
Mankind had a <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>One Supreme
God,</hi> yet the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Heathen</hi>
plainly ſhews that this <hi>Notion,</hi> in
proceſs of time, was greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:103163:126"/>
and corrupted into an
apprehenſion of a <hi>Plurality</hi> of <hi>Gods;</hi>
though in reaſon it is evident
enough, that there can be no more
Gods than <hi>One;</hi> and that <hi>One,</hi> who
is of infinite Perfection, is as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to all purpoſes whatſoever,
as ten thouſand Deities, if they
were poſſible, could poſſibly be;
as I ſhall ſhew in the following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Now this multitude of <hi>Deities;</hi>
which the fond Superſtition and
vain Imagination of Men had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to themſelves, were by the <hi>Wiſer</hi>
ſort, who being forced to comply
with the Follies of the People en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to make the beſt of
them, ſuppoſed to be either <hi>Parts</hi>
of the <hi>Univerſe</hi> which the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, thought to be
the ſame with <hi>God;</hi> but then the
more conſiderable parts of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi>
they parcelled out into ſeveral
<hi>Deities;</hi> and as the <hi>Ocean</hi> hath ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Names,</hi> according to the ſeveral
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:103163:127"/>
               <hi>Coaſts</hi> and <hi>Countries</hi> by which it
paſſeth; ſo they gave ſeveral <hi>Names</hi>
to this <hi>One Deity</hi> according to the
ſeveral Parts of the World which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Nations made the Objects of
their Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Or elſe, they adored the ſeveral
Perfections and Powers of the <hi>One
Supreme God</hi> under ſeveral <hi>Names</hi> and
<hi>Titles,</hi> with regard to the various
<hi>Bleſſings</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi> which they
thought they received from <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Indian</hi> Philoſophers,
the <hi>Brachmans,</hi> are ſaid to have wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
the <hi>Sun</hi> as the <hi>Supreme Deity;</hi>
and he certainly is the moſt <hi>Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
of all ſenſible Beings, and bids
faireſt for a <hi>Deity;</hi> eſpecially if he
was, as they ſuppoſed, animated
by a <hi>Spirit</hi> endued with knowledg
and underſtanding. And if a man,
who had been bred in a dark Cave,
ſhould all on the ſudden be brought
out at Noon-day to behold this viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
World; after he had viewed and
conſider'd it a while, he would in
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:103163:127"/>
all probability pitch upon the <hi>Sun</hi>
as the moſt likely, of all the things
he had ſeen, to be a <hi>Deity.</hi> For if
ſuch a man had any Notion of <hi>a
God,</hi> and were to chuſe one upon
ſight, he would without diſpute
fix upon the <hi>Sun,</hi> and fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Him and worſhip Him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Macrobius</hi> manageth this as
his main <hi>Plea</hi> for the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the
<hi>Heathen;</hi> that under all the ſeveral
<hi>Names</hi> of their <hi>Gods</hi> they Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the <hi>Sun:</hi> And this diverſity of
<hi>Names</hi> was but a more diſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
and acknowledgment of
the many Bleſſings and advantages
which mankind received from Him,
and a more particular and expreſs
Adoration of the ſeveral <hi>Powers</hi> and
<hi>Perfections</hi> which were in <hi>Him.</hi> And
this was the very beſt defence, and
all the tolerable ſenſe which the
<hi>Wiſeſt</hi> among the <hi>Heathen</hi> could
make of the <hi>multitude</hi> of their <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:103163:128"/>
And yet whilſt they generally
owned <hi>One Supreme Being</hi> that was
the <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of all
things, they worſhipped ſeveral
<hi>ſubordinate Deities</hi> as really diſtinct
from one another. Some of theſe
they fancied to be <hi>ſuperior</hi> to the
reſt and to have their reſidence in
<hi>Heaven;</hi> by which <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi>
ſuppoſes <hi>Plato</hi> to mean no more
but the <hi>Chief</hi> of the <hi>Angels.</hi> Theſe
were called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Dii Superi</hi> and <hi>Dij
Caeleſtes, ſuperior</hi> and <hi>heavenly Gods:</hi>
The <hi>Scripture</hi> terms them <hi>the Hoſt of
Heaven,</hi> meaning the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi>
and <hi>Stars,</hi> which they ſuppoſed to
be animated, or at leaſt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by <hi>Angels,</hi> or glorious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
whom they called <hi>Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other of their <hi>Deities</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
much <hi>inferior</hi> to theſe, being
ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Souls</hi> of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
<hi>Heroes;</hi> who for their great
and worthy Deeds, when they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon Earth, were ſuppoſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Death to be tranſlated into the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:103163:128"/>
number of their <hi>Gods.</hi> And theſe
were called <hi>Semidei</hi> and <hi>Deaſtri,</hi> that
is, <hi>half Gods</hi> and <hi>a ſort of Gods:</hi> And
as the other were <hi>Celeſtial,</hi> ſo theſe
were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a kind of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial</hi>
Spirits that were <hi>Preſidents</hi>
and <hi>Procurators</hi> of Human affairs
here below, that is, a middle ſort
of <hi>Divine Powers</hi> that were <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
and <hi>Agents</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Men,</hi> and did carry the Prayers and
Supplications of Men to God, and
bring down the Commands and
Bleſſings of God to Men.</p>
            <p>But in the midſt of all this <hi>Crowd</hi>
and confuſion of <hi>Deities,</hi> and the
various <hi>Superſtitions</hi> about them, the
Wiſer <hi>Heathen,</hi> as <hi>Thales, Pythagoras,
Socrates, Plato, Ariſtotle, Tully, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
and others, preſerved a true
Notion of <hi>One Supreme God,</hi> whom
they defined an <hi>infinite Spirit, pure
from all Matter and free from all imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:</hi>
And all the variety of their
<hi>Worſhip</hi> was, as they pretended in
excuſe of it, but a more particular
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:103163:129"/>
owning of the various repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the <hi>Divine</hi> Power and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
which manifeſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the World, and of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
communications of Bleſſings
and Favours by <hi>them</hi> imparted to
<hi>Men:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Adverſus Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> I. 1. c. 10.</note> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> obſerves, that
even when <hi>Idolatry</hi> had very much
obſcured the Glory of the <hi>Sovereign
Deity,</hi> yet the greater part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
did ſtill in their common <hi>Forms</hi>
of <hi>Speech</hi> appropriate the Name of
<hi>God</hi> in a more eſpecial and peculiar
manner to <hi>One,</hi> ſaying, <hi>If god grant,
If God pleaſe,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>So that there is ſufficient ground
to believe that the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature,</hi> or the Notion of <hi>One
Supreme God,</hi> Creator and Governor
of the World, was the Primitive
and general belief of Mankind:
And that <hi>Polytheiſm</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> were
a corruption and degeneracy from
the <hi>Original Notion</hi> which Mankind
had concerning <hi>God;</hi> as the <hi>Scripture-Hiſtory</hi>
doth declare and teſtify.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:103163:129"/>
And this account which I have
given of the <hi>Heathen Idolatry</hi> doth
by no means excuſe it. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may be ſaid by way of exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
in behalf of ſome few of the
wiſer and more devout among
them, the generality were groſsly
guilty both of believing <hi>more Gods,</hi>
and of worſhipping <hi>falſe Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this muſt needs be a very
great Crime, ſince the <hi>Scripture</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where declares God to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<hi>jealous</hi> in this Caſe, and that
<hi>he will not give his glory to another, nor
his praiſe to graven Images.</hi> Nay, we
may not ſo much as make uſe of
ſenſible Images to put us in mind of
God, leſt devout Ignorance, ſeeing
the Worſhip which Wiſe men paid
towards an <hi>Idol,</hi> ſhould be drawn
to terminate their Worſhip there, as
being the very <hi>Deity</hi> it ſelf; which
was certainly the Caſe of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of the <hi>Heathen</hi> World.</p>
            <p>And ſurely thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are in
no leſs danger of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> who pay
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:103163:130"/>
a Veneration to <hi>Images</hi> by <hi>kneeling
down</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> before them; and in
this they are much more inexcuſable,
becauſe they offend againſt a much
clearer Light; and yet when they
go about to juſtify this Practice are
able to bring no other nor better
<hi>Pleas</hi> for themſelves than the <hi>Heathen</hi>
did for their worſhipping of <hi>Images,</hi>
and for praying to their <hi>inferior Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
whom they looked upon as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators</hi>
between the <hi>Gods</hi> in Heaven
and <hi>Men</hi> upon Earth.</p>
            <p>There is but one <hi>Objection,</hi> that I
know of, againſt the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of Mankind concerning the
<hi>Unity of God;</hi> and it is this, That
there was an ancient Doctrine of
ſome of the moſt ancient Nations,
that there were <hi>two Firſt Cauſes</hi> or
<hi>Principles</hi> of all things; the <hi>one</hi> the
Cauſe of all <hi>Good,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> of
all the <hi>Evil</hi> that is in the World:
The reaſon whereof ſeems to have
been, that they could not apprehend
how things of ſo contrary a nature,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:103163:130"/>
as <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> could proceed from
<hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe <hi>two Principles</hi> in ſeveral
Nations were called by ſeveral
Names. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays that among
the <hi>Greeks</hi> the <hi>Good Principle</hi> was
called <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Evil Principle</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or the <hi>Devil.</hi> In conformity
to which ancient <hi>Tradition</hi> the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi>
a <hi>Sect</hi> which called themſelves
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> did advance <hi>two Principles,</hi>
the <hi>one</hi> infinitely <hi>Good,</hi> which they
ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Original Cauſe</hi> of
all the <hi>good</hi> which is in the World;
the <hi>other</hi> infinitely <hi>Evil,</hi> to which
they aſcribed all the <hi>evils</hi> that are in
the World.</p>
            <p>But all this is very plainly a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of a much more ancient <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
concerning that <hi>old Serpent</hi> the
<hi>Devil,</hi> the Head of the <hi>fallen Angels,</hi>
who by tempting our <hi>Firſt Parents</hi>
to tranſgreſs a poſitive and expreſs
Law of God brought <hi>Sin</hi> firſt into
the World and all the <hi>Evils</hi> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
upon it; of which the <hi>Scripture</hi>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:103163:131"/>
gives us a moſt expreſs and particular
account.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
Evil,</hi> into which this <hi>Tradition</hi>
was corrupted, after <hi>Idolatry</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
in the World, beſides that it
is a Contradiction, it would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be to no purpoſe to aſſert <hi>two</hi>
oppoſite <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>infinite,</hi> that is
of <hi>equal</hi> force and Power, for <hi>two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finites</hi>
muſt of neceſſity be equal to
one another; becauſe nothing can
be more or greater than infinite,
and therefore if <hi>two</hi> infinite Beings
were poſſible they would certainly
be equal, and could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>Now that the Notion of a <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
infinitely Evil</hi> is a Contradiction
will be very plain, if we conſider
that what is <hi>infinitely Evil</hi> muſt in
ſtrict Reaſoning, and by neceſſary
conſequence, be infinitely imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
and therefore infinitely weak,
and for that reaſon, though never ſo
malicious and miſchievous, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:103163:131"/>
infinitely weak and fooliſh,
could never be in a capacity either
to contrive miſchief or to execute
it.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould be admitted that
a Being infinitely miſchievous could
be infinitely knowing and powerful,
yet it could effect no Evil; becauſe
the oppoſite <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
being alſo infinitely Wiſe
and Powerful, they would tye up
one another's hands. So that upon
this ſuppoſition the <hi>Notion of a Deity</hi>
muſt ſignify juſt nothing, becauſe
by virtue of the eternal oppoſition
and equal conflict of theſe <hi>two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
they would keep one another
at a perpetual <hi>Baye;</hi> and being juſt
an equal Match to one another, the
<hi>one</hi> having as much mind and power
to do <hi>good</hi> as the <hi>other</hi> to do <hi>evil,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of being <hi>two Deities</hi> they would
be but <hi>two Idols,</hi> able to do neither
<hi>good</hi> nor <hi>evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having, I hope, now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
cleared this <hi>Objection,</hi> I
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103163:132"/>
ſhall proceed to ſhew how agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
this <hi>Principle,</hi> that <hi>there is but
one God,</hi> is to the common Reaſon
of Mankind, and to the cleareſt
and moſt eſſential Notions which
we have of God: And this will
appear theſe <hi>two</hi> ways.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By conſidering the moſt
eſſential <hi>Perfections</hi> of the Divine
Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the repugnancy
and impoſſibility, the great abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
and inconvenience of ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
more Gods than One.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By conſidering the moſt
eſſential <hi>Perfections</hi> of the Divine
Nature. <hi>Abſolute Perfection</hi> which
we aſcribe to God, as the moſt
eſſential Notion which Mankind
hath always had concerning Him,
does neceſſarily ſuppoſe <hi>Unity;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this is eſſential to the Notion of
a Being that is <hi>abſolutely Perfect,</hi> that
all Perfection meets and is united
in ſuch a Being: But to imagine
more Gods, and ſome Perfections
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103163:132"/>
to be in one and ſome in another,
does deſtroy the moſt <hi>eſſential</hi> Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which men have of God, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that <hi>He</hi> is a <hi>Being abſolutely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
that is, as perfect as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
Now to ſuppoſe ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in one God which are not
in another, is to ſuppoſe ſome poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Perfection to be wanting in
God, which is a Contradiction to
the moſt natural and the moſt eaſie
Notion which all men have of God,
that He is a Being in whom all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
do meet and are united:
But if we ſuppoſe more Gods,
each of which hath all Perfections
united in Him, then all but One
would be ſuperfluous and needleſs;
and therefore by juſt and neceſſary
conſequence not only <hi>may,</hi> but of
neceſſity <hi>muſt</hi> be ſuppoſed not to be;
ſince <hi>neceſſary exiſtence</hi> is <hi>eſſential</hi> to
the <hi>Deity;</hi> and therefore if <hi>but One
God</hi> be neceſſary, there can be no
more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:103163:133"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the <hi>repugnancy</hi> and
<hi>impoſſibility,</hi> the great <hi>abſurdity</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience</hi>
of the contrary. For
ſuppoſe there were more <hi>Gods, two</hi>
for example; and if there may be
<hi>two</hi> there may be a <hi>Million,</hi> for we
can ſtop no where: I ſay, ſuppoſe
<hi>two Gods;</hi> either theſe <hi>two</hi> would be
in all Perfections equal and alike,
or unequal and unlike: If equal and
alike in all things then, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
one of them would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and ſuperfluous, and if <hi>one</hi> why
not as well the <hi>other?</hi> they being
ſuppoſed to be in all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
alike; and then there would
be no neceſſity at all of the being
of a God; and yet it is granted on
all hands that <hi>neceſſary exiſtence</hi> is
eſſential to the Notion of a <hi>God:</hi>
But if they be unequal, that is, <hi>one</hi>
of them inferior to and leſs perfect
than the <hi>other,</hi> that which is inferior
and leſs perfect could not be God,
becauſe he would not have all
perfection. So that which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103163:133"/>
we turn the thing and look
upon it, the Notion of more Gods
than One is by its own repugnancy
and ſelf-contradiction deſtructive of
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Before I come to apply this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
of the <hi>Unity of God,</hi> I muſt
not paſs by a very conſiderable
<hi>Difficulty,</hi> which will moſt certainly
ariſe in every mans mind, without
taking particular notice of it, and
endeavouring to remove it, if I
can. And it is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the
<hi>B. Trinity,</hi> or of <hi>three</hi> real <hi>Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
or <hi>diſtinct Perſons</hi> in <hi>One</hi> and the
ſame <hi>Divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though this be not a <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>
peculiar only to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as by the generality of thoſe
who urge this <hi>Objection</hi> againſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
hath been inconſiderately
thought; for it is certain, that long
before <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> appeared in the
World, there was a very ancient
<hi>Tradition,</hi> both among <hi>Jews</hi> and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103163:134"/>
               <hi>Heathen,</hi> concerning <hi>three</hi> real <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi>
or <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> in the Divine
Nature, very nearly reſembling the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as I
ſhall have occaſion more fully to
ſhew by and by: Yet it cannot be
denied, but that this <hi>Difficulty</hi> doth
in a more eſpecial manner affect the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion; the generality of
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who do moſt firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Trinity,</hi> believing likewiſe
at the ſame time, more ſtedfaſtly if
it be poſſible, <hi>that there is but One God.
To us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 6.</note> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, <hi>to us
Chriſtians, there is but One God.</hi> But
how can this poſſibly conſiſt with
the common <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
concerning the <hi>Trinity,</hi> God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son,</hi> and <hi>H. Ghoſt,</hi> to each of
whom they Attribute, as they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believe the <hi>Scripture</hi> does, the
moſt incommunicable <hi>Properties</hi> and
<hi>Perfections</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature?</hi>
And what is this leſs in effect than
to ſay, <hi>That there are three Gods?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:103163:134"/>
For the clearing of this <hi>Difficulty</hi>
I ſhall, with all the brevity I can,
offer theſe following <hi>Conſiderations;</hi>
which I hope, to an impartial and
unprejudiced Judgment, will be
ſufficient to remove it, or at leaſt to
break the main force and ſtrength
of it.</p>
            <p>I. I deſire it may be well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
that there is a wide difference
between the nice <hi>Speculations</hi> of the
<hi>Schools,</hi> beyond what is revealed in
<hi>Scripture,</hi> concerning the Doctrine
of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and what the <hi>Scripture
only</hi> teaches and aſſerts concerning
this <hi>Myſtery.</hi> For it is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
but that the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
in wit and leiſure, though
very few among them had either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
skill in the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> or in
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity</hi> and the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi>
of the <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
Church: I ſay, it cannot be
denied but that theſe <hi>Speculative</hi> and
very acute men, who wrought a
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:103163:135"/>
great part of their <hi>Divinity</hi> out of
their own Brains as <hi>Spiders</hi> do <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs</hi>
out of their own bowels, have
ſtarted a thouſand <hi>ſubtleties</hi> about
this <hi>Myſtery,</hi> ſuch as no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is
bound to trouble his head withal;
much leſs is it neceſſary for him to
underſtand thoſe <hi>niceties</hi> which we
may reaſonably preſume that they
who talk of them did themſelves
never thoroughly underſtand; and
leaſt of all is it neceſſary to believe
them. The modeſty of <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
is contented in <hi>Divine Myſteries</hi> to
know what God hath thought fit to
reveal concerning them, and hath
no curioſity to be <hi>wiſe above that which
is written.</hi> It is enough to believe
what God ſays concerning theſe
matters; and if any man will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſay more, every other man
ſurely is at his liberty to believe as
he ſees reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. I deſire it may in the next
place be conſidered, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103163:135"/>
of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> even as it is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> is acknowledged
by us to be ſtill a great <hi>Myſtery,</hi> and
ſo imperfectly revealed as to be in
a great meaſure incomprehenſible
by Human Reaſon. And therefore
though ſome learned and judicious
Men may have very commendably
attempted a more particular explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this great <hi>Myſtery</hi> by the
ſtrength of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> yet I dare not
pretend to that, knowing both the
difficulty and danger of ſuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and mine own inſufficiency
for it.</p>
            <p>All that I ever deſigned upon this
Argument was to make out the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility
of the thing from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deſcending to a more particular
explication of it than the <hi>Scripture</hi>
hath given us; leſt by endeavouring
to lay the <hi>Difficulties</hi> which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſtarted about it new ones
ſhould be raiſed, and ſuch as may
perhaps be much harder to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:103163:136"/>
than thoſe which we have now
to grapple withal. And this I hope
I have in ſome meaſure done in one
of the former <hi>Diſcourſes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Serm. II.</note> Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
do I ſee that it is any ways
neceſſary to do more; it being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
that God hath declared what
he thought fit in this matter, and
that we do firmly believe what he
ſays concerning it to be true, though
we do not perfectly comprehend the
meaning of all that he hath ſaid
about it.</p>
            <p>For in this and the like Caſes I
take an <hi>Implicite Faith</hi> to be very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
that is, to believe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we are ſufficiently aſſured God
hath revealed, though we do not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtand his meaning in ſuch a
Revelation. And thus every man
who believes the <hi>H. Scriptures</hi> to be
a truly <hi>Divine</hi> Revelation does <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely</hi>
believe a great part of the
<hi>Prophetical</hi> Books of <hi>Scripture</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
obſcure expreſſions in thoſe
Books, though he do not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:103163:136"/>
underſtand the meaning of all
the Predictions and expreſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in them. In like manner,
there are certainly a great many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and comprehend the Myſteries
of Faith nicely enough to approve
themſelves to a <hi>Scholaſtical</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial
<hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Controverſies,</hi> who
yet if they do heartily embrace the
<hi>Doctrines</hi> which are clearly revealed
in <hi>Scripture</hi> and live up to the plain
<hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion,
will I doubt not be very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the Great and Juſt, and
by the <hi>infallibly</hi> Infallible Judge of
the World.</p>
            <p>III. Let it be further conſidered,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
That though neither the word <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
nor perhaps <hi>Perſon,</hi> in the ſenſe
in which it is uſed by <hi>Divines</hi> when
they treat of this <hi>Myſtery,</hi> be any
where to be met with in <hi>Scripture;</hi>
yet it cannot be denied but that <hi>Three</hi>
are there ſpoken of by the Names of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:103163:137"/>
               <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>H. Ghoſt,</hi> in whoſe
Name every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is baptized,
and to each of whom the higheſt
<hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are in
<hi>Scripture</hi> attributed: And theſe <hi>Three</hi>
are ſpoken of with as much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
from one another as we uſe
to ſpeak of <hi>three</hi> ſeveral Perſons.</p>
            <p>So that though the word <hi>Trinity</hi>
be not found in <hi>Scripture,</hi> yet theſe
<hi>Three</hi> are there expreſly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
mentioned; and a <hi>Trinity</hi> is
nothing but <hi>three</hi> of any thing. And
ſo likewiſe though the word <hi>Perſon</hi>
be not there expreſly applied to <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son,</hi> and <hi>H. Ghoſt;</hi> yet it will
be very hard to find a more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
word whereby to expreſs the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of theſe <hi>Three.</hi> For which
reaſon I could never yet ſee any juſt
cauſe to quarrel at this <hi>term.</hi> For
ſince the <hi>H. Spirit</hi> of God in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
hath thought fit in ſpeaking of
theſe <hi>Three</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from
one another, as we uſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſpeech to diſtinguiſh <hi>three</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:103163:137"/>
               <hi>Perſons,</hi> I cannot ſee any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why, in the explication of this
<hi>Myſtery</hi> which purely depends upon
<hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> we ſhould not
ſpeak of it in the ſame manner as
the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth: And though the
word <hi>Perſon</hi> is now become a <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erm
of Art,</hi> I ſee no cauſe why we
ſhould decline it, ſo long as we
mean by it neither more nor leſs
than what the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſays in other
Words.</p>
            <p>IV. It deſerves further to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
That there hath been a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>ancient Tradition</hi> concerning <hi>three</hi>
real <hi>Differences</hi> or <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> in the
<hi>Divine Nature;</hi> and theſe, as I ſaid
before, very nearly reſembling the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence this <hi>Tradition</hi> had its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
is not eaſie upon good and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
grounds to ſay; but certain it is
that the <hi>Jews</hi> anciently had this <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
And that they did diſtinguiſh
the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and <hi>the H. Spirit of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:103163:138"/>
God,</hi> from <hi>Him</hi> who was <hi>abſolutely</hi>
called <hi>God,</hi> and whom they looked
upon as the <hi>Firſt Principle</hi> of all
things; as is plain from <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi>
and <hi>Moſes Nachmanides,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. 5.</note> and others
cited by the Learned <hi>Grotius</hi> in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
<hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Truth of the
Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And among the <hi>Heathen, Plato;</hi>
who probably enough might have
this <hi>Notion</hi> from the <hi>Jews,</hi> did make
<hi>three Diſtinctions</hi> in the <hi>Deity</hi> by the
Names of <hi>eſſential Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi>
and <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that whatever Objections this
matter may be liable to, it is not
ſo peculiar a <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Religion as many have imagined,
though it is revealed by it with
much more clearneſs and certainty:
And conſequently, neither the <hi>Jews</hi>
nor <hi>Plato</hi> have any reaſon to object
is to us <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> eſpecially ſince
<hi>they</hi> pretend no other ground for it
but either their own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or an
<hi>ancient Tradition</hi> from their <hi>Fathers:</hi>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:103163:138"/>
whereas we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do appeal to
expreſs <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> for what we
believe in this matter, and do believe
it ſingly upon that account.</p>
            <p>V. It is beſides very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
That the <hi>Scriptures</hi> do deliver
this Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> without
any manner of doubt or queſtion
concerning the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine
Nature:</hi> And not only ſo, but do
moſt ſtedfaſtly and conſtantly aſſert
that there is but <hi>One God:</hi> And in
thoſe very <hi>Texts,</hi> in which theſe
<hi>three Differences</hi> are mentioned, the
<hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is expreſly
aſſerted; as where St. <hi>John</hi> makes
mention of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Unity</hi> of theſe <hi>Three</hi> is
likewiſe affirmed, <hi>There are Three that
bear record in Heaven, the Father, the
Word, and the Spirit; and theſe Three
are One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. It is yet further conſiderable,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
That from this <hi>Myſtery,</hi> as delivered
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:103163:139"/>
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> a Plurality of Gods
cannot be inferred without making
the <hi>Scripture</hi> groſly to contradict it
ſelf; which I charitably ſuppoſe the
<hi>Socinians</hi> would be as loth to admit
as we our ſelves are. And if either
<hi>Councils,</hi> or <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Schoolmen,</hi>
have ſo explained this <hi>Myſtery</hi> as to
give any juſt ground, or ſo much as
a plauſible colour for ſuch an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
let the blame fall where it is
due, and let it not be charged on the
<hi>H. Scriptures;</hi> but rather, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
ſays in another Caſe, <hi>Let God be true,
and every Man a liar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>
               <hi>VIIthly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I deſire it may
be conſidered, That it is not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Reaſon to believe ſome
things which are incomprehenſible
by our Reaſon; provided that we
have ſufficient ground and reaſon for
the belief of them: Eſpecially if
they be concerning <hi>God,</hi> who is in
his Nature <hi>Incomprehenſible;</hi> and we
be well aſſured that he hath revealed
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:103163:139"/>
them. And therefore it ought not
to offend us that theſe <hi>Differences</hi> in
the <hi>Deity</hi> are <hi>incomprehenſible</hi> by our
finite underſtandings; becauſe the
<hi>Divine Nature</hi> it ſelf is ſo, and yet
the belief of <hi>that</hi> is the Foundation
of all Religion.</p>
            <p>There are a great many things in
<hi>Nature</hi> which we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
how they either are, or can
be: As the <hi>Continuity of Matter,</hi> that
is, how the parts of it do hang ſo
faſt together, that they are many
times very hard to be parted; and
yet we are ſure that it is ſo, becauſe
we ſee it every day. So likewiſe
how the ſmall <hi>Seeds</hi> of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the whole <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of
the things from which they proceed
and into which by degrees they grow;
and yet we plainly ſee this every
year.</p>
            <p>There are many things likewiſe
in our <hi>Selves,</hi> which no man is able
in any meaſure to comprehend, as
to the manner how they are done
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:103163:140"/>
and performed: As the <hi>vital union</hi> of
<hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body:</hi> Who can imagine
by what device or means a <hi>Spirit</hi>
comes to be ſo cloſely united and ſo
firmly link'd to a <hi>material Body,</hi> that
they are not to be parted without
great force and violence offer'd to
Nature? The like may be ſaid of
the operations of our ſeveral <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Imagination,</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi>
and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and eſpecially of
the <hi>Liberty</hi> of our <hi>Wills:</hi> And yet we
certainly find all theſe <hi>Faculties</hi> in
our ſelves, though we cannot ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
comprehend or explain the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
manner in which the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Operations of them are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>And if we cannot comprehend
the manner of thoſe Operations
which we plainly perceive and feel
to be in our <hi>Selves,</hi> much leſs can we
expect to comprehend things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us; and leaſt of all can we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to comprehend the infinite <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>Perfections</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and every
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:103163:140"/>
thing belonging to Him. For God
himſelf is certainly the greateſt
<hi>Myſtery</hi> of all other, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by Mankind to be in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and in the particular manner
of his Exiſtence, incomprehenſible
by Human Underſtanding. And the
reaſon of this is very evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God is infinite, and our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and underſtanding is but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite:
And yet no ſober man ever
thought this a good reaſon to call
the Being of God in queſtion.</p>
            <p>The ſame may be ſaid of God's
certain knowledge of future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies
which depend upon the
uncertain Wills of free Agents: It
being utterly inconceivable how any
Underſtanding, how large and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſoever, can certainly know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
that which depends upon
the <hi>free Will</hi> of another, which is an
arbitrary and uncertain Cauſe.</p>
            <p>And yet the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth not
only attribute this Foreknowledge
to God, but gives us alſo plain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:103163:141"/>
of God's foretelling ſuch
things, many Ages before it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
as could not come to paſs
but by the Sins of Men, in which
we are ſure that God can have no
hand; though nothing can happen
without his permiſſion: Such was
that moſt memorable Event of the
Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> who, as the <hi>Scripture</hi>
tells us, was <hi>by wicked hands crucified
and ſtain;</hi> and yet even <hi>this</hi> is ſaid to
have happened <hi>according to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
foreknowledge of God,</hi> and was
punctually foretold by Him ſome
hundreds of years before. Nay, the
<hi>Scripture</hi> doth not only aſcribe this
power and perfection to the <hi>Divine</hi>
Knowledge, but <hi>natural Reaſon</hi> hath
been forced to acknowledge it, as
we may ſee in ſome of the wiſeſt of
the <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> And yet it would
puzzle the greateſt <hi>Philoſopher</hi> that
ever was, to give any tolerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
how any Knowledge whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
can certainly and infallibly
foreſee an Event through uncertain
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:103163:141"/>
and contingent Cauſes. All the
reaſonable ſatisfaction that can be
had in this matter is this, that it is
not at all unreaſonable to ſuppoſe
that <hi>infinite Knowledg</hi> may have ways
of knowing things which our <hi>finite
Underſtandings</hi> can by no means com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
how they can poſſibly be
known.</p>
            <p>Again, There is hardly any thing
more inconceivable than how a
thing ſhould be of it ſelf, and
without any Cauſe of its Being;
and yet our Reaſon compels us to
acknowledge this; Becauſe we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
ſee that ſomething is, which
muſt either have been of it ſelf and
without a Cauſe, or elſe ſomething
that we do not ſee muſt have been
of it ſelf and have made all other
things: And by this reaſoning we
are forced to acknowledge a <hi>Deity,</hi>
the mind of Man being able to find
no reſt but in the acknowledgment
of one <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>wiſe Mind</hi> as the
<hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>firſt Cauſe</hi> of all other
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:103163:142"/>
things; and this <hi>Principle</hi> is that
which Mankind do by general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
call <hi>God.</hi> So that God hath laid
a ſure foundation of our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of his Being in the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of our own Minds: And though
it be one of the hardeſt things in the
world to conceive how any thing
can be of it ſelf, yet neceſſity drives
us to acknowledge it whether we
will or no: And this being once
granted, our Reaſon, being tired
in trying all other ways, will for
its own quiet and eaſe force us at
laſt to fall in with the general appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
and belief of Mankind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a <hi>Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To give but one <hi>Inſtance</hi> more;
There is the like Difficulty in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<hi>how any thing can be made</hi> out
of nothing; and yet our Reaſon
doth oblige us to believe it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Matter,</hi> which is a very <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Being</hi> and merely <hi>paſſive,</hi> muſt
either always have been of it ſelf;
or elſe, by the infinite Power of a
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:103163:142"/>
moſt <hi>perfect and active Being,</hi> muſt
have been made out of nothing:
Which is much more credible, than
that any thing ſo <hi>imperfect</hi> as <hi>Matter</hi>
is ſhould be of it ſelf: Becauſe that
which is of it ſelf cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to have any bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of its <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Perfection;</hi> for
by the ſame reaſon that it neceſſarily
is and of it ſelf, it muſt neceſſarily
have all perfection, which it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Matter</hi> hath not; and yet <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Exiſtence</hi> is ſo great a Perfection,
that we cannot reaſonably ſuppoſe
any thing that hath this Perfection to
want any other.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, by theſe <hi>Inſtances,</hi>
that it is not repugnant to Reaſon
to believe a great many things to
be, of the manner of whoſe Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
we are not able to give a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and diſtinct account. And
much leſs is it repugnant to Reaſon
to believe thoſe things concerning
God which we are very well aſſured
he hath declared concerning Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:103163:143"/>
though theſe things by our
Reaſon ſhould be incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>And this is truly the Caſe as to
the matter now under debate: We
are ſufficiently aſſured that the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi>
are a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and that
this <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is therein
declared to us. Now that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend it, is no ſufficient
Reaſon not to believe it: For if this
were a good Reaſon for not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, then no man ought to believe
that there is a God, becauſe his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is moſt certainly incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
But we are aſſured by many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
that there is a God; and the
ſame <hi>natural Reaſon</hi> which aſſures us
that <hi>He is,</hi> doth likewiſe aſſure us
that <hi>He is incomprehenſible;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our believing Him to be ſo doth
by no means overthrow our belief
of His Being.</p>
            <p>In like manner, we are aſſured by
<hi>Divine Revelation</hi> of the truth of this
Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> and being
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:103163:143"/>
once aſſured of <hi>that,</hi> our not being
able fully to comprehend it is not
reaſon enough to ſtagger our belief
of it. A man cannot deny what he
ſees, though the neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of admitting it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which he cannot comprehend.
One cannot deny the Frame of this
World which he ſees with his eyes,
though from thence it will neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow that either <hi>that</hi> or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe muſt be of itſelf; which
yet, as I ſaid before, is a thing
which no man can comprehend how
it can be.</p>
            <p>And by the ſame Reaſon a man
muſt not deny what God ſays, to be
true; though he cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
many things which God ſays:
As particularly concerning this <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi>
of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> It ought then to
ſatisfy us that there is ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that this Doctrine is delivered
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and that what is there
declared concerning it doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a Contradiction. For why ſhould
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:103163:144"/>
our finite underſtandings pretend to
comprehend that which is infinite,
or to know all the real <hi>Differences</hi>
that are conſiſtent with the Unity of
an Infinite Being: or to be able ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to explain this <hi>Myſtery</hi> by any ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
or reſemblance taken from
<hi>finite Beings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I leave this Argument,
I cannot but take notice of one thing
which they of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are
perpetually objecting to us upon this
Occaſion. And it is this, That by
the ſame reaſon that we believe the
Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> we may and
muſt receive that of <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
God forbid: Becauſe of all
the <hi>Doctrines</hi> that ever were in any
Religion, this of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is
certainly the moſt abominably ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</p>
            <p>However, this <hi>Objection</hi> plainly
ſhews how fondly and obſtinately
they are addicted to their own Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
how miſhapen and monſtrous
ſoever; inſomuch that rather than
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103163:144"/>
the Dictates of their Church, how
abſurd ſoever, ſhould be called in
queſtion they will queſtion the truth
even of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf; and if we
will not take in <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi>
and admit it to be a <hi>neceſſary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> they grow ſo
ſullen and deſperate that they mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not what becomes of all the reſt:
And rather than not have their Will
of us in that which is <hi>controverted,</hi>
they will give up that which by their
own confeſſion is an <hi>undoubted Article</hi>
of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> and not contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
on either Side; except only
by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who yet are hearty
Enemies to <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and
have expoſed the abſurdity of it with
great advantage.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall endeavour to return a
more particular <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;</hi>
and ſuch a one as I hope
will ſatisfy every conſiderate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced
mind, that after all this
confidence and ſwaggering of theirs
there is by no means equal reaſon
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103163:145"/>
either for the <hi>receiving</hi> or for the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting</hi>
of theſe <hi>two Doctrines</hi> of the
<hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is not equal reaſon
for the <hi>belief</hi> of theſe <hi>Two Doctrines.</hi>
This <hi>Objection,</hi> if it be of any force,
muſt ſuppoſe that there is equal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and proof from <hi>Scripture</hi> for
theſe <hi>two Doctrines:</hi> But this we ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
deny, and with great reaſon;
becauſe it is no more evident from
the words of <hi>Scripture</hi> that the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Bread</hi> is ſubſtantially changed
into <hi>Chriſt's natural Body</hi> by virtue of
thoſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> than
it is that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſubſtantially
changed into a <hi>natural Vine</hi> by virtue
of thoſe words,<note place="margin">Joh, 15, 1.</note> 
               <hi>I am the true Vine;</hi>
or than that the <hi>Rock</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
of which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> drank,
was ſubſtantially changed into the
<hi>Perſon of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſaid, <hi>That Rock was Chriſt;</hi> or
than that the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially
changed into the <hi>natural
Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it is in expreſs
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:103163:145"/>
terms ſaid of the <hi>Church,</hi> That <hi>it is his
Body.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides this, ſeveral of their
own moſt learned <hi>Writers</hi> have freely
acknowledged, that <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
can neither be directly proved,
nor neceſſarily concluded from <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi>
But this the <hi>Writers</hi> of the
<hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> did never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
concerning the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and
the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
appealed to the clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Teſtimonies of <hi>Scripture</hi> for
the Proof of theſe <hi>Doctrines.</hi> And then
the whole force of the Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to this, That if I am bound to
believe what I am ſure God ſays, tho
I cannot comprehend it; then I am
bound by the ſame reaſon to believe
the greateſt Abſurdity in the World,
though I have no manner of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of any <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it. And if this be their
meaning, though we underſtand
not <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> yet we very
well underſtand what they would
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:103163:146"/>
have, but cannot grant it; becauſe
there is not equal reaſon to believe
<hi>two</hi> things, for <hi>one</hi> of which there
is good proof, and for the other no
proof at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Neither is there equal
reaſon for the <hi>rejecting</hi> of theſe <hi>two
Doctrines.</hi> This the Objection ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
which yet cannot be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
but upon one or both of theſe
two grounds: Either becauſe theſe
two <hi>Doctrines</hi> are equally <hi>incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible,</hi>
or becauſe they are equally
loaded with <hi>Abſurdities</hi> and <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is no good ground of
<hi>rejecting</hi> any <hi>Doctrine,</hi> merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is <hi>incomprehenſible;</hi> as I have
abundantly ſhew'd already. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, there is a wide difference
between plain matters of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and
<hi>Myſteries</hi> concerning God; and it
does by no means follow that, if a
man do once admit any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God which he cannot <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,</hi>
he hath no reaſon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103163:146"/>
to believe what he himſelf
<hi>ſees.</hi> This is a moſt unreaſonable
and deſtructive way of arguing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſtrikes at the foundation of
all Certainty, and ſets every man at
liberty to deny the moſt plain and
evident <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> if he
may not be humor'd in having the
abſurdeſt things in the World ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
for true. The next ſtep will
be to perſuade us that we may as
well deny the Being of <hi>God</hi> becauſe
his Nature is <hi>incomprehenſible</hi> by our
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> as deny <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi>
becauſe <hi>it evidently contradicts</hi> our
<hi>Senſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Nor are theſe <hi>two Doctrines</hi>
loaded with the like <hi>Abſurdities</hi> and
<hi>Contradictions:</hi> So far from this, that
the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as it
is delivered in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and
hath already been explained, hath
no Abſurdity or Contradiction ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
involved in it, or neceſſarily
conſequent upon it: But the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is big
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:103163:147"/>
with all imaginable Abſurdity and
Contradiction. And their own
<hi>Schoolmen</hi> have ſufficiently expoſed
it; eſpecially <hi>Scotus,</hi> and he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to do ſo, as any man that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
reads him may plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
For in his <hi>Diſputation</hi> about it
he treats this <hi>Doctrine</hi> with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
contempt, as a new Invention of
the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> under Pope
<hi>Innocent</hi> Ill. To the <hi>Decree</hi> of which
<hi>Council</hi> concerning it he ſeems to pay
a formal ſubmiſſion, but really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides
it as contrary to the common
<hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Mankind, and
not at all ſupported by <hi>Scripture;</hi> as
any one may eaſily diſcern that will
carefully conſider his manner of
handling it and the reſult of his
whole <hi>Diſputation</hi> about it.</p>
            <p>And now Suppoſe there were
ſome appearance of Abſurdity and
Contradiction in the Doctrine of the
<hi>Trinity</hi> as it is delivered in <hi>Scripture,</hi>
muſt we therefore believe a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which is not at all revealed
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:103163:147"/>
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and which hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
in it all the <hi>abſurdities</hi> in the
World, and all the <hi>Contradictions</hi>
to <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and which
once admitted, doth at once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
all Certainty? Yes, ſay they,
why not? ſince we of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> are ſatisfied that this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is
revealed in <hi>Scripture;</hi> or, if it be
not, is defined by the Church,
which is every whit as good. But
is this equal, to demand of us
the belief of a thing which hath
always been controverted, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
between <hi>us</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> but even
among themſelves, at leaſt till
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent?</hi> And this
upon ſuch unreaſonable terms,
that we muſt either yield this
<hi>Point</hi> to them or elſe renounce a
<hi>Doctrine</hi> agreed on both Sides to
be revealed in <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſhew the unreaſonableneſs
of this proceeding, Let us ſuppoſe
a <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Turk</hi> to the belief of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:103163:148"/>
               <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and becauſe one
kindneſs deſerves another, the <hi>Jew</hi>
or <hi>Turk</hi> ſhould demand of him the
belief of all the <hi>Fables</hi> in the <hi>Talmud,</hi>
or in the <hi>Alchoran;</hi> ſince none of
theſe, nor indeed all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
are near ſo abſurd as <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation:</hi>
Would not this be much
more reaſonable and equal than
what they demand of us? Since no
Abſurdity, how monſtrous and
big ſoever, can be thought of,
which may not enter into an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in which a Breach hath
been already made wide enough to
admit <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> The Prieſts
of <hi>Baal</hi> did not half ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be expoſed by the <hi>Prophet</hi>
for their Superſtition and folly, as
the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do
for this ſenſleſs and ſtupid <hi>Doctrine</hi>
of theirs with a <hi>hard Name.</hi> I ſhall
only add this one thing more, That
if this Doctrine were poſſible to be
true, and clearly prov'd to be ſo;
yet it would be evidently uſeleſs
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:103163:148"/>
and to no purpoſe. For it pretends
to change the ſubſtance of one
thing into the ſubſtance of another
thing that is already and before this
change is pretended to be made.
But to what purpoſe? Not to make
the <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt, for that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in Being; and the Subſtance
of the <hi>Bread</hi> is loſt, nothing of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
but the <hi>Accidents</hi> which are
good for nothing, and indeed are
nothing when the Subſtance is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
and gone.</p>
            <p>All that now remains is to make
ſome <hi>practical Inferences</hi> from this
<hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine
Nature.</hi> And they ſhall be the ſame
which God himſelf makes by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
which <hi>Text</hi> alſo is cited by our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,

               <hi>and
with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind,
and with all thy ſtrength: And thou
ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> So
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:103163:149"/>
that according to our <hi>Saviour</hi> the
whole Duty of Man, the <hi>love of God</hi>
and <hi>of our neighbour</hi> is founded in the
<hi>Unity</hi> of the Divine <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. The <hi>love of God; The Lord thy
God is One Lord,</hi> therefore <hi>thou ſhalt
love Him with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>this is
the firſt and great Commandment:</hi> And
it comprehends in it all the <hi>Duties</hi> of
the <hi>first Table</hi> as naturally flowing
from it. As that we ſhould <hi>ſerve
him only,</hi> and pay no <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi>
to any but to <hi>Him.</hi> For to pay <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worſhip</hi> to any thing is to make
it a <hi>God</hi> and to acknowledge it for
ſuch: And therefore <hi>God</hi> being but
<hi>One,</hi> we can give <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi> to
none but to <hi>Him</hi> only. And among
all the parts of <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi> none
is more peculiarly appropriated to
the <hi>Deity</hi> than <hi>ſolemn Invocation</hi> and
<hi>Prayer.</hi> For he to whom men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
their Requeſts, at all times,
and in all places, muſt be ſuppoſed
to be always every where preſent,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:103163:149"/>
to underſtand all our deſires and
wants, and to be able to ſupply
them; and this God only is, and
can do.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe from the <hi>Unity</hi> of the
<hi>Divine Nature</hi> may be inferr'd, that
we ſhould not worſhip God by any
<hi>ſenſible Image</hi> or Repreſentation:
Becauſe <hi>God</hi> being a <hi>ſingular Being</hi>
there is nothing like <hi>Him,</hi> or that
can without injuring and debaſing
his moſt <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
Being</hi> be compared to <hi>Him:</hi>
As <hi>He</hi> himſelf ſpeaks in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa 46. 5.</note>
               <hi>To whom will ye liken me, ſaith the
Lord, and make me equal?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with no <hi>Diſtinction</hi> whatſoever
can it be lawful to give <hi>Religious
Worſhip,</hi> or any part of it, to any
but <hi>God:</hi> We can <hi>pray</hi> to none but
to <hi>Him,</hi> becauſe <hi>He only</hi> is every
where preſent,<note place="margin">1 Kings 8. 39.</note> and <hi>only knows the
Hearts of all the children of men;</hi>
which <hi>Solomon</hi> gives as the reaſon
why we ſhould addreſs our Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to <hi>God</hi> only, <hi>who dwelleth in
the Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:103163:150"/>
So that the Reaſon of theſe <hi>two
Precepts</hi> is founded in the <hi>Unity</hi> and
<hi>Singularity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and
unleſs there be more <hi>Gods</hi> than <hi>One,</hi>
we muſt <hi>worſhip Him only,</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> to
none but <hi>Him:</hi> Becauſe we can give
<hi>Invocation</hi> to none but to <hi>Him only</hi>
whom we believe to be <hi>God;</hi> as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> reaſons,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> 
               <hi>How ſhall they call on Him
in whom they have not believed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. The <hi>love</hi> likewiſe of our
<hi>Neighbour</hi> is founded in the <hi>Unity</hi> of
the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
from it: <hi>Hear, O Iſrael, the
Lord thy God is One Lord, therefore thou
ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi>
And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gives this reaſon why
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould be at unity among
themſelves;<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>There is One God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all,</hi> and therefore we ſhould
<hi>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
Peace,</hi> that is, live in mutual love
and peace. The <hi>Prophet</hi> likewiſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
this reaſon why all Mankind
ſhould be upon good terms with one
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:103163:150"/>
another, and not be injurious one to
another,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Have we not all One Father?
hath not One God created us? Why do
we then deal treacherouſly every man
againſt his brother?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore when we ſee ſuch
hatred and enmity among <hi>Men,</hi> ſuch
diviſions and animoſities among
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> we may not only ask
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s queſtion, <hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi>
that we cannot agree about ſerving
him; either all to ſerve him in one
way, or to bear with one another
in our differences: I ſay we may
not only ask St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s queſtion, <hi>Is
Chriſt divided?</hi> but may ask further,
<hi>Is God divided?</hi> Is there not <hi>One</hi> God,
and are we not all his Offspring?
Are we not all the Sons of <hi>Adam,
who was the Son of God?</hi> So that if
we trace our ſelves to our <hi>Original,</hi>
we ſhall find a great nearneſs and
equality among men: And this
equality that we are all God's <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
and <hi>Image,</hi> and that the <hi>One only
God</hi> is the <hi>Father of us all,</hi> is a more
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:103163:151"/>
real ground of mutual <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi>
and <hi>equity</hi> in our dealings one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
than any of thoſe petty differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and diſtinctions of <hi>ſtrong</hi> and
<hi>weak,</hi> of <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> of <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>fooliſh,</hi>
of <hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>honourable,</hi> can be to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
men to any thing of <hi>Inſolence
injuſtice,</hi> and <hi>inequality of dealing</hi> one
towards another. Becauſe <hi>that</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we all agree, that we are the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
and <hi>Children of God</hi> and have all
<hi>One</hi> common <hi>Father,</hi> is eſſential and
conſtant; but thoſe things wherein
we differ are accidental and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and happen to one another by
turns.</p>
            <p>Thus much may ſuffice to have
ſpoken concerning the <hi>firſt Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in the <hi>Text, There is one God:</hi> To
<hi>Him, Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>H. Ghoſt,</hi> be
all Honour and Glory, Dominion
and Power, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
