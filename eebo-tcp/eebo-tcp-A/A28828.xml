            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>So that after all, if there be any Deficiency in what I shall relate, it may well be pardon'd, where there hath been as much Artifice to parget Truths, as Countenance could reach to; though as to what may be objected, (in reference to my Relation) I have been so cautious, that in Disputes I have not let Interest biass me: no! where I have found any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, though it may be conjectur'd to proceed from self-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, that it may be return'd in gratitude, I have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly let it o're-slip me; but of this nature there hath been little: indeed the whole Scene hath been so barbarous, as I have scarce found any into whose wound the Traveller hath pour'd Oyl: and yet willingly (more then what a just ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Business requires) I would not fester the least Soar; However I expect all will not think so, 'tis natural for the Wasp to be angry; yet when it shall be weighed on what little reason the <hi>Irish</hi> more then the <hi>English,</hi> (equally, if not beyond them, concern'd in all Levies, Oppressions, and Grievances,) had to be enraged, <hi>pretending to be held in with a ruder Bit,</hi> I doubt not but the more Intelligent will allow them no common Sinners.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant what examples (some say) they had to encourage them to their Insurrection; though that encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (how confidently soever affirmed to be their Guide) never commenc'd in Blood, or march'd on in Murthers and Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, of an innocent, naked, and unarm'd People, or (at first) seiz'd on those (much less murther'd them) who contrary to their Judgment, lived peaceably amongst them: However it is not my intention, to mitigate the flame they light their Torches by; all Rebellions being detestable; But certainly the Copy exceeded the Original, and what they would solely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title to their Religion, (as interdicted by the Age) more justly is to be imputed, to their Detestation of the <hi>English</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Nation, which from the Conquest to this instant, hath been the grounds for all Rebellions, even when both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were drunk with the Wine of <hi>Romes</hi> Fornication; So that though some (to mitigate the Result of so horrid a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion)
<pb facs="tcp:93738:3"/>
place the grounds of it on Religion, which (as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> observes) <hi>Erects a Monarchy in the minds of Men, by which they would enforce all to that yoke;</hi> Yet it is evident, they never had so free an exercise of their Religion, (under Pretexts of Civil Contracts, and Politick Agreements,) as when the Troubles began; not so much then as the least Violence being offer'd to their <hi>Diana,</hi> nor after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, till they made <hi>it</hi> one of their principal Demands; so that if at any time (since or before) they found a check, <hi>That must be attributed to the rude and boisterous beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (as a Statist <note n="*" place="margin">The Author of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions upon Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism. <hi>Page</hi> 88.</note> seasonably notes) of some of them, who disturb'd the happy Calm they all enjoy'd, rather then to any willing severity in the State, whose bounty and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity towards them, hath (by their ill usage of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence) been interpreted a Product of the Kings Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to their Religion, not his charity and compassion towards their Persons; That thence some have proceeded to Acts, which have alienated the affections of those, who desired they should not have been disquieted;</hi> Till Recusancy began over-boldly to look Government in the Face; in as much as thence some have suspected whether <hi>Hannibal</hi> were not at the Gates: Else could any vaunt at home? as others write to their Friends abroad, that they hope all will be well, and doubt<note place="margin">As Sir <hi>Edward Dering</hi> (in his Collection of Speech, <hi>P.</hi> 6.) observes of Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyard,</hi> treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, 1641.</note> not to prevail and win ground upon us; in as much as (meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from this encouragement) a <hi>Romanist</hi> (well observ'd by the Silver-Mouth Trumpet) not long since congratulated in Print, <hi>That the Face of our Church began to alter, and the Language of our Religion to change;</hi> (<hi>saith</hi> Sancta Clara) <hi>So as if a Synod were held</hi> non intermixtis Puritanis, <hi>(O those are Pestilent fellows!) our Articles and their Religion would soon be agreed.

This being their usual saying,</hi> If our Flesh be not good, why do you drink of our Broth? <hi>The consideration of which, made King</hi> James <hi>of blessed memory, take notice*, That having after some time spent in setling the Politck Affairs of this Realm, of late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
<pb facs="tcp:93738:4"/>
no small labour, in composing certain differencies we found amongst our Clergy, about Rites and Ceremonies, heretofore Established in this Church of</hi> England, <hi>and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the same to such an Order and Form, as we doubt not, but every Spirit that is led only with Piety, and not with Humour, shall be therein satisfied. It appear'd unto us in the debating of those Matters, that a greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion to our Religion, then could arise from those light differencies, was imminent by Persons, common Enemies to them both; namely,</hi> the great number of Priests, both Seminaries and Jesuits, <hi>abounding in this Realm, as well of such as were here before our coming to this Crown, as of such as have resorted hither since; using their Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Professions with greater liberty, then heretofore they durst have done, partly upon a vain confidence of some Innovation in matter of Religion, to be done by us, which we never intended, nor gave any man cause to expect, and partly upon the assurance of our general Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, granted according to the custom of our Progenitors, at our Coronation, for offences past, in the days of the late Queen, which Pardons, many of the said Priests have procur'd under our great Seal, and holding themselves thereby free from the danger of the Laws, do with great Audacity, exercise all Offices of their Profession, both saying Masses, perswading our Subjects from the Religion Established, and reconciling them to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and by consequence, seducing them from the true perswasion, which all Subjects ought to have of their Duty and Obedience to Us;</hi> Of which though I might urge more, I have no itch to enlarge, their own Scourge may be their Punishment, <hi>Saepe in Magistrum scelera redierunt sua:</hi> Certain it was, the <hi>Irish</hi> hop'd to shake off the <hi>English</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by that attempt; but how improbable, a Series of 500 years Succession, sufficiently evinces, every defection in the People having rooted the Prince more intire; that at length (methinks) they should be wean'd from further As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says of that nature; though where there are a People who look towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> there will not want some to cry out for a Captain to lead them.</p>
            <p>But to descant hereupon, is not my design, being willing to believe that <hi>Janus</hi>'s Gates may henceforth be shut, Allegiance being the aim, not the pretence of their present Submission:
<pb facs="tcp:93738:4"/>
What I here endeavour, is to clear by what Steps the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion arrived at its Height, and how it came (in so short a time) to sweep all before it.</p>
            <p>In handling of which, I shall first shew the Condition of the Kingdom some years before the Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Then I shall speak of the preliminary Acts thereunto, and therein detect the vanity of those who would fix the Rebellion at first, upon a few discontented inconsiderable Persons, a Rable (Authors of all the Civil War that followed) in <hi>Ulster</hi> onely; when the Plot was a long laid Design, determin'd by the main Body of the Nation; as <hi>Rory-Mac-Guire</hi> ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously told Colonel <hi>Audley Mervin <note n="*" place="margin">Col. <hi>Audley Merv.</hi> Exam. 5. <hi>July,</hi> 1643. <hi>Husb.</hi> Collect. <hi>Fol.</hi> 253.</note>, That this great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, was never the Act of one or 2 giddy fellows: We have (said he) our Party in</hi> England, <hi>we have our Party in</hi> Scotland, <hi>that will keep such (as would oppose us) busy from sending you any Aid: in as much, as I could tell you, who the Persons were that were designed for the Surprisal of all the Places of Strength;</hi> And in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Archbishops, Bishops, and other Prelates of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at <hi>Jamestown,</hi> the 12. of <hi>August,</hi> 1650. It is there acknowledged, <hi>That the Catholick People of</hi> Ireland, <hi>(so not the Rable) in the year 1641. were forc'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to take up Arms for the defence of Holy Religion, their Lives and Liberties,</hi> which some (very industriously) would fain wipe off, as being too undeniable an evidence of their inclinations, before those vain pretences they fly to, (as their main Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge) drove them into the Net with others; Yet we shall herein so clear the folly of what they would have the World believe, as their Excuse serves mainly to aggravate their Crime.

have detected the whole Proceedings at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where the Design was so closely anvil'd, as all things afterwards were found <hi>there</hi> in defiance of his Majesties Authority: <hi>There</hi> first the Clergy compact a General Congregation, which summon'd a General Assembly, equivalent (in their Veneration) to a Parliament; and that Established a Supream Council of the Confederate Catholicks, which received from them Sanction and Laws, by which Coin was stamped, National and Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Court, Established, Estates setled, their Clergy Re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, the Popes Nuncio receiv'd Ambassadors sent <hi>thence,</hi> and others entertain'd from Foraign Princes; all under a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Seal of their own, and what else might bespeak them independent on any, but their own Power: But the Evidence of these and some other Records, being the Treasure of fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, (whom a specious Artifice had charm'd) easy Keys o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

The Records however of that presumptious Assembly, are (notwithstanding the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunateness of the Age) yet secur'd in his Library, which (though before it wanted little to make it venerable) will in future Ages be resorted to, as a Treasure invaluable, securing those Secrets, which the malice of so potent an Enemy would have improv'd, to the ruine of an Empire: Yet (as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready said) I ground little, (if any thing) but on Proofs; Nay! I have so well sifted <hi>Kilkenny</hi> it self, (though no Art hath been omitted to shuffle up the Proceeding there) as the Original Progress and State of that Conclave, is not without faithful and notable Remarks, more being under the Vizard, than appear'd in the Disguise; though the Retirement I have now betook my self to, (suitable to the effects of so disconso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a Rebellion) deprives me of those Councils and Societies, which (by a free'r Commerce) might have rectified either my Sence or Stile.</p>
            <p>For the most part, I have in the <hi>Appendix</hi> set down Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the weightiest Records, they carrying so much (even of the History) in them, as they eas'd me in the Story: I should have been forward to have enlarg'd more, nothing of that nature being otherwise than important; But in that, his Majesty's Works, Sir <hi>John Temple,</hi> of the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion, <hi>Husbands</hi> Collections of Orders, Ordinances and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of both Houses of Parliament, the Commissioners of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Remonstrance to the House of Commons in <hi>England,</hi> of the condition of the Clergy and Protestants, the Speeches

of several Members, <hi>Diurnals, Walshes</hi> Loyal Formulary, the Answer to the <hi>Irish</hi> Remonstrance, presented at <hi>Trim, 1642.</hi> And other Prints being extant, I have rather chose to refer the Reader often thither, then engage him in too Voluminous a Tract; though where any Relation, act, or other Material Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes up the Story, (not without injury to be abreviated) we have tied our selves to the Words. It was my happiness (I must acknowledge) to meet with a Manuscript, whence I was supplied with much of the latter part of this History, though a part of it was so weaved, as if Justice could not have been done to some, without mutchthing of others, which we had reason to wave; and if there be any obstinacy in that Particular, we are ready to clear the truth.</p>
            <p>In handling of which, I have insisted on the Proceedings of the King and Parliament too long, (I suspect) some will judge, considering the diversity of the Subject; but when it shall be weighed, how jointly they were interessed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the War against the <hi>Irish,</hi> and that the unfortunate difference betwixt them, retarded the success in <hi>Ireland;</hi> I fear not that any ingenious Person should esteem this addition Alien: However the affections of the King (whom some have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced) were so legible to chastise the Rebels, as without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to his Sacred Memory, less could not be collected for Posterity, least the <hi>Irish</hi> by their Pamphlets, (plentifully scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at home and abroad) should entitle the Parliament, more then his Majesty, to their just Correction; The bleeding Iphigenia, being forward to cast more upon a Malignant Part of the Council, (whom he would have the World believe, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform'd his Majesty) then his Majesty of himself was really sensible of: A Consideration so important, as he abuses Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, who delivers not the Truth intire. And that we may yet further assume this Particular, I must affirm, <hi>That</hi> when the Confederates Agents insisted passionately, why Ordinances of Parliament should be in force against them? It was most ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially answer'd by the Committee (then managing that Affair) that the constitution of our Laws, (indeed) receive their Essence from the Royal Assent: but yet when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd the Act 17. <hi>Car. 1.</hi> wherein a particular Trust is in an extraordinary, and unusual manner, devolv'd unto the Lords and Commons in Parliament; <hi>It is possible,</hi> that such Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance or Ordinances may equitably continue, when others are justly laid aside; And <hi>tis observable,</hi> that during the time
<pb facs="tcp:93738:6"/>
of the unhappy and unnatural War betwixt his late Majesty and his two Houses; <hi>That</hi> his Majesty was so far from discountenancing any Ordinances or Proceedings of them, in order to the War of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that his Majesty (in all his Condemnation of <hi>the Injustice of that War,</hi> betwixt himself and them) laid it as an aggravation of their Fault, that (by such Diversion) his Protestant Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (the care of whom he had intrusted them withall) were exposed to the Butchery and Rapine of their merciless Enemies: Nor would his Majesty have charg'd them, for not affording Protection to his said Subjects, if the onely Mediums for effecting <hi>it, viz.</hi> Their Ordinances had been unjust, irregular, or unreasonable; as is evident in his Answer, the 5. of <hi>May,</hi> 1643. to a Bill brought him to <hi>Oxford,</hi> by Commissioners for the Service of <hi>Ireland,</hi> could they have secur'd the Ends, his Majesty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd might be observ'd in that Bill.</p>
            <p>I had thought (for the fuller Illustration of the History) to have inserted constantly the Articles on the delivery of each Place, but finding those sometimes many, I rather chose to exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie a few, that thence the scope of the rest might be conceiv'd, that (which in the whole) was most considerable, was, That none who Contrived the Rebellion, or had a hand in the first years Murthers, were ever to have any other Conditions, then to be left to Justice.</p>
            <p>It must be confessed, I have missed it some times in the <hi>Synerisis,</hi> as in such variety and confusion of Matter, it is imposible to be exact; But then considering that Relative Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs are brought sooner under on Head.</p>
            <p>The Descrepancy of the other may be better excused.</p>
            <p>I shall find it a hard task to run the Gantlet, for that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral have (in their Prints abroad) vented already their venom, not only as to what may skreen the Rebellion, but on the proceedings of the State before; So <hi>Carue</hi> in his Annals of <hi>Ireland,</hi> 1603. insinuates, <note n="*" place="margin">P. 312<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>But considering what Glosses, what Depravations of credible Witnesses, and expurgation of their own, what Evasions, what leavings out, and Insertions would have happen'd, had this History (in his hand) proceeded: I rather chose to expose my Weakness, than leave Truths (of this consequence) nipt and sullied to Posterity, not much valuing whose Teeth corrode most, Truth being in its Lenith.</p>
            <p>And truly when I consider how many are excellently skilled in Foraign Histories, who scarce know our common occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at home, I think their omission hardly pardonable, <hi>A man (as one <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Full.</hi> Col. of Speech. in the Preface.</note> well observes) being most morally edified by reading such Men, and Matters as are his own Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries;</hi> the Recitement of those things, which come nearest to our times, being of most force and efficacy to instruct and delight us: A sence of which made a most Reverend, and Intelligent Person (some months since) so apprehensive of this Story, to be necessarily writ, that (upon Discourse) he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed his observing so little of it before, became his wonder,
<pb facs="tcp:93738:7"/>
having satisfied himself (as most do, where the Concern touches the State, not their Personal Interest) with the bare sound of the thing, rather then enquire into the Nature, Growth, and Virulency thereof, (the Commons crying loud) which throughly considered, is the import of the Nation; Though when such designs are blasted, as the present tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Plot against his Sacred Majesty, and the constituted Government, some often undervalue them as foolishly laid, and weakly attempted, though that was not (as it seems) to determin here, but (as a place more combustible and fit for fewel) to extend to <hi>Ireland,</hi> carefully provided against by Proclamations, <note n="*" place="margin">Dubl. 16th. Octob. 1678. 2d. Novemb. 20. Novemb. 13. Decemb.</note> (if not since relaxed?)</p>
            <p>The Management of which Affairs fell to be very difficult on those then at the Helm, which I cannot but say, some might have more easily carried on; yet when it shall be impartially considered, I believe the caution and prudence of the State, then will in their Acts to Posterity, appear more significant and valuable, than Malice or ingratitude can justly sully them with: Besides, what Exigences? what Misapprehensions? what Straights? did these daily encounter in their own, and the State Affairs, (supportable by none that had not been of an even and great Courage) is not to be passed over: Yet as to the Integrity of their Service, few ever waded through their Task with greater Acquiescency, what ever hath been their misfortune to be censur'd at Pleasure, That being their aim, which was their Glory, <hi>His Majesties Honour, and the Protestants Support,</hi> how slenderly soever the Merit of that Service hath been since looked on, in their Posterity; To whom little hath been indulg'd, <hi>Praeter Nomen &amp; Famam &amp; ea quoque a multis calcata.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:93738:8"/>
(not affection or sence of what they had done) was the grounds of that Compliance, appears in their subsequent Acts, shamefully afterwards diserting the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> fixing upon him incredible Scandals, when he had exposed himself (at their request) to all the inconveniencies imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, for their Peace and his Majesties Interest; <hi>First,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>English</hi> under his Command, (an evidence that <hi>those</hi> were <hi>they whom</hi> they still endeavoured to root out) and <hi>then</hi> ordering their Bishops and Commissioners of Trust, to share in his Councels, and the management of Affairs; <hi>At last</hi> ejecting him as questionable before his Majesty, for his injuries to them, and his ill Government; whilst they assumed the Management of all, in acting, That <hi>no Temporal Government or Jurisdiction, should be assumed, kept, or executed in that Kingdom, or any Province or County thereof, other then what is approved or instituted by their General Assembly or Supream Council,</hi> which was indeed the first Common-Wealth set up in his Majesties Empire: And yet these are those who were receiv'd as Penitents to Mercy, strange Penitents! Who after so much blood, and spoil of Innocents, such sins against Indulgence, and Oaths of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Submission, were so far from satisfying <hi>their wrong doings,</hi> that they were never brought to profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Guilty,</hi> whose Penitence seems to be only, in that they fail'd to accomplish their evil in fulness: Twice Conspir'd they a Peace, the better to accomplish (to the utmost) what they might not need further Penitence, <note n="*" place="margin">Act of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in <hi>Fol.</hi> 10.</note> thereby foolishly forfeiting all the Grace <hi>which</hi> they might have expected from his Majesty; though amongst the General, there were some, who upon the Peace made with them, <hi>honestly perform'd what they had promised to him, though with inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency enough to themselves, whose demeanour could not but be thought very worthy of his Protection, Justice, and Favour,</hi> as they find fully enlarg'd in the Act of Settlement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And here</hi> I cannot but take notice, that though some would impute the Irregularity of these Proceedings to the Clergy only, (who indeed were the main spoak in the Wheel) yet some of the Committee of Trust, and of the Nobility, (who ever else were free?) were also privy thereunto, (how close soever they behav'd themselves) as appears in their cherishing privately the ill Humors and Jealousies of the
<pb facs="tcp:93738:9"/>
People, and their averseness to punish the greatest exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, wherein the Clergy were concern'd without the Coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bishops, whose consent they were sure never to have: Indeed I dare not but say, (having it from an excellent Pen) that some of <hi>the Irish Discent</hi> have in the late Troubles (as in all Ages) well deserv'd of the Crown, though it may wrack the Memory of the strictest observer to enumerate many, few having assisted the Protestants against the Mighty.</p>
            <p>However great strugling there hath been, <hi>That the Peace of 1648. should be inviolable,</hi> whereas besides other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Reasons referring to their abominable Reservation; <hi>That if those Articles of Peace were not in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular for their Advantage performed, they would not be concluded thereby:</hi> It must be considered, that when the King was necessitated to comply with the Rebels, he was then under sad streights; <hi>The odious Court</hi> (by which his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Life was afterwards taken away) being then erected: So as <hi>no body could wonder, that he desir'd (though upon difficult Conditions) to get such an united Power of his own Subjects, as might have been able with Gods blessing, to have prevented that infamous and horrible Parricide;</hi> Yet then in that Article of time, the <hi>Irish</hi> prest for the conclusion of the Peace: Whereas if they had been truly Loyal and Unanimous? Generous Souls, would never have took that opportunity to have enhaunc'd their Price: But (in submission to what Grace they might afterwards find) freely have waded through the difficulties they were call'd to, having long before promised a vigorous Assistance, which they never attempted: Though many of these since, <hi>must confess, that they have been as well provided for, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so great Troubles and Confusions, and such blessed Circumstances of his Majesties Restauration, they could reasonably expect;</hi> And yet the bleeding Iphigenia (that piece of Ingratitude and Scandal) will tell you, <hi>That the Body of a noble, antient, Catholick Nation,</hi> (Ireland) <hi>clad all in red Robes, is not now to be offer'd up as Vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, but is already Sacrificed; not to a Prophane Diety, but to the living God for Holy Religion,</hi> As if after all the Indulgence, (which hath been and is vouchsaf'd, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) nothing attends it but Misery and Ruine, a Trumpet certainly to another Insurrection.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:93738:9"/>But to proceed, the success of our Armies (considering the numbers they often oppos'd) exceeds a common Belief; in as much, as some have extenuated the Glory of their Service, by the Cowardliness of the Enemy, who seldom made a noble or brave Defence, <hi>save where an extremity reduced them to an exigence, or a surprize made them cruel:</hi> But on this subject Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> (in a Letter <note n="*" place="margin">Scrin. Sacr. <hi>P.</hi> 46.</note> to the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> going for <hi>Ireland</hi>) observes, <hi>That the justest Triumphs that the</hi> Romans <hi>in their greatest Greatness did obtain, and that whereof the Emperors in their Stiles took Additions and Denominations, were of such an Enemy, that is, People bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and not reduced to Civility; magnifying a kind of Lawless Liberty, Prodigal of Life, hardness in Body, fortified in Woods and Bogs, placing both Justice and Felicity in the sharpness of their Swords: It being a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Point of Honour to reduce such to Civility, than to be enrich'd by a Praeditory War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>am sensible that the undertaking of this War hath passed with many, as an opportunity to enrich the Servitour; nor can it be denied, but that reward is the just expectation of Merit: But when it shall be consider'd at what rates Debenters were paid off, what hardship the Souldiers encountred, how many in Rebellion shar'd the mercy of a Gracious Prince, what were the Difficulties attended all in Government; it cannot be denied, but more then a Praeditory War, even the Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Religion and Nation the <hi>Irish</hi> would have extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, the settling of his Majesties Rights, and the reducing of a People (loose in their Principles) to Civility, were the main Ends of this War, to which his Majesty was forc'd by the causeless and inhuman Insurrection of the <hi>Irish:</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to which, the Rebels (being before prepar'd thereunto) soon Marshall'd a considerable Force; But though it was for their Altars and Inheritance (as they pretended,) never any Nation fell under greater Pusillanimity, which some impute to their want of Warlick Provisions; their ignorance in the Discipline of their Army, the lack of unity amongst themselves; and the Supplies of the <hi>English</hi> ever found of all necessaries: But certainly the greatest Defect was in the badness of their Cause, which <hi>Conor O Mahon</hi>

               <hi>Here I might enlarge much in the Encomiums of those who so vigorously oppos'd them, though at length the</hi> Irish <hi>got Courage, or rather (from the certainty of what they were sure to suffer) grew desperate; extremity forcing that, no sence of Honour before could Animate; And yet then, the Conduct and vigor of the</hi> English <hi>appear'd such, as the Rebels though in some skirmishes (assisted by surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals) prevail'd, they could never arrive at a perfect Defeat: Here though I am sometimes lead to mention eminent Persons in their Places, I am yet forced to omit many, whose Offices and Names I cannot attain to, which by their Prowess and Virtue, would have added Date to the History; And yet I know some Persons are so apprehensive of their Merits, that not to express them in Terms aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, may be worse than to omit them; willingly I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on None, with a Disrespect to others.</hi>

                     <p>I Understood by Letters from <hi>London,</hi> and after by Two from your self, of your forwardness in the <hi>History of the</hi> Irish <hi>Rebellion,</hi> Anno 1641. that being, I find, now in the Press.</p>
                     <p>How far you have therein proceeded, or what is your way in that, I know not, that not having been to me by any communicated; To that therefore I can say no more, than, that its passing your hands, assures me of what may satisfie.</p>
                     <p>What may satisfie, I mean not those, <hi>who shut their eyes against light,</hi> and even <hi>Rebel against it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are, who contrary to all evidence, confidently averr, write and openly proclaim to the World, that there was then no such Rebellion of the <hi>Irish,</hi> neither such Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres of the <hi>British</hi> and Protestants in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but that they themselves, <hi>the</hi> Irish <hi>and Papists of</hi> Ireland, were then <hi>the Sufferers,</hi> and that by the Protestants, (they say) the first aggressors.</p>
                     <p>This bold assertion in the face of the Sun; and in that very age, when things were acted, there having been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny also then, and some yet living, who can speak to the truth in that; This (I say) might gain on Strangers to the Kingdom, and hath already on some, even at home, especially at this time, about 40 years after.</p>
                     <p>But the contrary appear'd <hi>by those Collections,</hi> which you had from me, to which herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in other particulars, I refer.</p>
                     <p>And what do they in this, but what was before, and is by them done ordinarily? Have they not with like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence disclaimed that black and hellish Powder-Plot, <hi>Nov.</hi> 5. 1605. from being Popish? do they not give that out for false, and as a forg'd Calumny cast on that Party, of whom none of theirs (they say) was therein concern'd? whereas, it is well known, that <hi>Hammond, Baldwin, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi> and <hi>Tesmond,</hi> Jesuits, with their <hi>Provincial Garnet,</hi> were all in that Conspiracy; <hi>Thomson</hi> also, a Jesuit boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after at <hi>Rome, that his shirt was often wet with digging under the Parliament-House in</hi> London, besides others in that Conspiracy, who were all Papists, and many of them
<pb facs="tcp:93738:12"/>
Suffering for their so practicing; the publick proceedings on those Tryals remaining extant on Record.</p>
                     <p>And do <hi>They</hi> not now, even now, cry down what our eyes behold of their horrid and bloody Design, and hellish Treason against the Royal Person of our Gracious Sovereign King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and against his <hi>Protestant Subjects:</hi> and for <hi>total extirpation of the Protestant Religion</hi> out of the Three Kingdoms? The truth of which is every day, even as by miracle, more and more evidenc'd, to the Glory of Gods watchful Providence over this his Church and People.</p>
                     <p>Among which, I find our selves threatned with a yet <hi>other like demonstration of zeal, for the promoting of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, and Interest in</hi> Ireland, (Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> Nar. §. 50.) so they term those Massacres, and Blood, for root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Protestant Religion, and casting off the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Government in <hi>Ireland;</hi> which their <hi>other demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Zeal,</hi> (as they term it) shews the former actings in that kind to have bin theirs, and how such their Actings are by them esteemed; <hi>a demonstration of Zeal for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Catholick Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>He that sits in Heaven laughs them to scorn, and hath them in derision, speaking to them in his wrath, and vexing them in his sore displeasure, saying; yet</hi> (or notwithstanding all such their Designs) <hi>have I set up my King;</hi> preserving our <hi>Gracious Soveraign, the breath of our Nostrils,</hi> by the care and vigilance of those our <hi>worthy Patriots</hi> whom God hath raised up happy instruments in it.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>Ireland.</hi> To evidence the restless Spirits of such there for mischief: I shall mind here in brief, what in the mentioned Collections, had bin given you more at large, so to lay all open at one view; thereby not to wonder at Rebellions here, than which, comparing times, nothing will appear so ordinary.</p>
                     <p>In which, passing what occurs of that kind in elder ages, and fixing only on such as had Religion for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and was by <hi>Rome</hi> influenc'd, and by its Emissaries fomented: Therefore I begin with the Reign of that Queen of famous memory, Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> of whose Troubles in <hi>England</hi> from <hi>that Party,</hi> I speak not, as not of present consideration, but recounting what work they found <hi>Her</hi> in this her Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> only.</p>

The very next year <hi>Anno</hi> 1608. was the breaking out of Sir <hi>Cahie O Dogherty's Rebellion in Ulster,</hi> by whom <hi>Derry</hi> was taken and burnt, the Governor Sir <hi>George Paulet</hi> murther'd, and <hi>Culmore</hi> Castle, some miles distant, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, that being the Magazine for Arms and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for those parts: His Confederates were considerable, his Forces increasing, and expecting <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and <hi>Tyrcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nil</hi>'s return with Forces from <hi>Flanders.</hi> Against him was the <hi>Marshal</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Wingfield,</hi> sent with a strong Party, the <hi>Deputy</hi> following with more Forces from <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin:</hi> But this short, yet smart Rebellion, ended with the death of the Arch rebel, and the dispersing his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
                     <p>VII. Seven years after <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. was a Providential discovery made by one <hi>Teige O Lenan,</hi> to Sir <hi>Thomas Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> of <hi>Lemovadey</hi> in <hi>Ulster,</hi> of a Design of <hi>Alexander mac Donel, Bryan Crosse O-Neal,</hi> and other the principal of the <hi>Irish</hi> in <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and <hi>Tyrconnil,</hi> with large Confederacies for Religion; They first designed the taking <hi>Charlemount,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Sir <hi>Toby Caulfield,</hi> where was then Prisoner <hi>Conne Greg O-Neal, Tyrones</hi> Son, and about the same time by severally appointed Parties, was order'd the taking in the principal Forts and Towns in <hi>Ulster:</hi> and murthering the Protestants in that Province and elsewhere. They had promises of Foreign assistance from <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the particulars you have: During the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> were these 4 last mentioned.</p>
                     <p>VIII. After <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. under the Government of the Lord Viscount <hi>Wentworth</hi> Lord Deputy, <hi>Ever,</hi> or <hi>Emerus mac Mahon,</hi> a Popish Priest, privately discover'd to Sir <hi>George Radcliffe,</hi> principal in trust with the Lord Deputy, that there was a Design for a general rising in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be seconded and assisted from abroad: The Discoverer having assurance of Pardon, acknowledging himself engaged in that Conspiracy; having been employed some years on that account in Foraign Courts, soliciting supplies for
<pb facs="tcp:93738:14"/>
carrying on that work for Religion. This Discoverer was after the Popish Bishop of <hi>Down,</hi> and after of <hi>Clogher:</hi> Hereof the Lord Deputy inform'd his Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> I. who thereupon by his Ambassadors, watching practices in Courts abroad, there were at length, general and dark hints given of something tending to a Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but how, or when, or by whom, was not then so appearing.</p>
                     <p>Hereof his Majesty by his Royal Letters, Signed by Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> one of his principal Secretaries, dated <hi>March</hi> 16. 1640. and directed to the then Lords Justices, Sir <hi>William Parsons,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Borlase,</hi> did charge them with the care of that danger imminent, of which his Majesties Letter you have likewise a Copy.</p>
                     <p>And this brings to that Rebellion <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. which on the <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> did break out unexpectedly, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all cautions concerning it, this, like a violent <hi>Hurricane,</hi> bearing all down before it, which gives you your work at present.</p>
                     <p>The result and design of all which, thus here briefly collected, shews.</p>
                     <p>1. That from <hi>Shane O-Neals</hi> Rebellion, <hi>Anno</hi> 1566. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that in 1641. there passed about 75 years, a space of time within the ordinary age of a man.</p>
                     <p>2. That within those but 75. years, there had been in <hi>Ireland, Five open Rebellions,</hi> one as it were in the neck of another, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Shane O-Neals,</hi> Anno 1566. <hi>Desmonds, Anno</hi> 1569. <hi>Hugh O-Neal,</hi> called <hi>Tyrones</hi> Rebellion, <hi>Anno</hi> 1595. <hi>O Doghertyes,</hi> Anno 1608. and this <hi>Grand Rebellion</hi> 1641. this surpassing all before, I know not why that Rebellion of the <hi>Cities of Waterford, Cork,</hi> and <hi>Limerick,</hi> may not add to that number, this being as open as any, and dangerous, and requiring the presence of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Commander, and the marching of the Forces of the Kingdom to suppress it. Add to these, those 2 Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries mentioned, <hi>Anno</hi> 1607. and 1615. (not to mention apart that <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. falling into that of 1641.) which 2 former had been dismal to the Kingdom, if not by Gods providence, seasonably, and wonderfully discovered, and happily prevented.</p>
                     <p>Therefore have we herein not to wonder at Rebellions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> than which, nothing there more common, from
<pb facs="tcp:93738:14"/>
generation to generation, and may not the like be yet expected, when opportunity shall be for it, the same Spirit and Causes remaining.</p>
                     <p>This is not (Sir) to forestal your work, but serves as an Index directing to what follows of yours: giving also an edge to this desire of finding the breviat as by you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, if you have thought fit to make use of it.</p>
                     <p>I shall now end your trouble herein, giving you the deserved praise of your labours, and zeal to that necessary undertaking. I rest</p>

            </p>
            <p>Since I reduced the History to what it is, I reflected on several, to whom I might have adrest it, some <hi>who</hi> (having run through the Hazzard of that War, and the Councils of that Age) might well have own'd it, it being (in the main) an Epitome of their Illustrious Actions: <hi>Others</hi> being design'd to the Government, but not aiming at the Work, (as too sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the <hi>English</hi> Interest to betray it) justly challenges a respect and Title thereunto: And not a few (through whose Provision the <hi>Irish</hi> were subdued) might well have conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd the Event; But considering how insignificant a great Title is, where Truth must be the main support, (elated De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications bespeaking Authors more ambitious than known) I could not delude my Reason with a Conceipt that a Mecaenas, as the Laurel, exempts from Thunder, and therefore countent with the Integrity of the Story, (having no ends to oblige me to a single respect) I here comit it naked to the Decision of the Age.</p>
            <p>It may be some (whose Excellency consists in Detraction) will think (by this) I had a particular Design (besides the bare History) to preserve the Memory of some, who (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) in tract of time might be lost in the common Rubbish: And I dare not disown those Conjectures, the Deserving being
<pb facs="tcp:93738:15"/>
to be in everlasting Remembrance; Nor hath it in all Ages, and amongst the worthiest Persons, been esteem'd Pride, but Justice, to erect Memorials and Altars to Meriting He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes; Though herein (I conceive) none could be so much concern'd who would have less insisted thereon, then my self, resolving to be sparing, in what I might have been prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal; How contrary soever it may be Conjectur'd by some, who (pleas'd with the publick breath) dare blaspheme those whom they could never wean from their Countries Interest, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; though as to an utter extirpation, (which was strongly insisted on by many) I may affirm that they (whom the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of some would traduce) were ever so far from that, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominating the thought) as the Rebels Reformation not their Ruine, was their Principal care, well distinguishing betwixt the Head and the Train, which a most eminent and noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (just to his Honour) ever avouch'd.</p>
            <p>Somethings (it may be) were not always suited to the just standard of the Law, which in such Exigences have ever been indulged, though not commanded; The preservation of a State being more than the security of a Person; And thence Prudence as well as Justice, hath been a necessary Attendant on Magistrates: No State being so secur'd by her Laws, as that something emergent may not require a speedier Help, the effect of which if severe? (being out of the common Road) is the Offenders, not the State Fault.</p>
            <p>And hereupon a known Instrument of State perfectly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd in that Road, excellently well Cautions, <hi>Not to weigh and measure Statesmen's Proceedings, by grains and scruples, lest the publick Affairs of a Kingdom lie wast, whilst men of Honour and Fortune in medling with them are sure to loose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rebels (by their Pamphlets) affirm that few Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (if any?) were done, till some examples of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were acted by the <hi>English;</hi> whereas the contrary plainly appears by those Examinations in the Remonstrance <note n="*" place="margin">Printed at <hi>London.</hi> 1642.</note> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse remarkable Passages concerning the Church and Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which cannot be waded, whatever <hi>R. S.</hi> in his Collections of Murthers <note n="*" place="margin">1662.</note> would insinuate, as if that was only framed to win Compassion and Succour from <hi>England,</hi> or scandalize Authority, whereas it is clear the Remonstrance<note place="margin">P. 6.</note> was passed on such undeniable Evidences, that the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances he takes notice off, (to justisie his own) of Time,
<pb facs="tcp:93738:15"/>
Place, and Persons, (as if they were not considered in the Remonstrance) are generally observed and that on Oath, <hi>Not encouraged (as he would infer) from the hurry of the Times, and the Examinants Frights,</hi> but before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Commissioners, a Circumstance this Detractor dare not pretend to, what Favour soever he thinks to draw from <hi>Cromwel's</hi> proceedings <hi>(Summo Jure)</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which<note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note> was on another score than we shall here insist on, and were promiscuously cruel; yet those lessen nothing of the <hi>Irish</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism at <hi>First,</hi> or indeed of their Mercy at <hi>Last,</hi> in stripping the <hi>English</hi> in so miserable a Season, driving them from their Habitations, and exposing them to the Woods and Deserts for their Rest and Sustenance, such as remain'd (being deluded by the Rebels promises, and wedded to their own Habitations) were generally Massacred: Certainly the lingring and sad Deaths which attended many, are justly to be accounted the highest Barbarism, worse than whatever determin'd in a short time, how cruel soever: Though some (who would be thought Civil and Compassionate) think they merit much, <hi>in not having</hi> (as they write, not others) <hi>their hands actually imbrued in the Blood of any of the</hi> British <hi>Protestants:</hi> of which its believ'd there are but few if any) that may be justly intituled to that Clemency. However are they not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted equally Guilty, who mov'd by the same Councils? Subsisted by the same maintenance? Whose Victory was their Victory, and the Blood shed by One, was the consent of the Other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qui non vetat peccare, cum possit, jubet,</hi> Especially when they knew of the Villanies that had passed, and yet sided with the Party so imbrued and fleshed in Blood; No Check being given to that Career, when <hi>Leinster,</hi> and <hi>Ulster, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> and <hi>Brabant</hi> agreed: However we have contexed in this History few examples of Murthers and Cruelties, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Luxury of the Rebels took in the Scene: The effect of whose Malice and Animosity, being (in truth) the Burthen of the whole, is not omitted, (as not abounding in Proofs) but because the Martyrology of the Clergy and the Protestants, deserve an account a-part. Besides though there be some Gleanings of Murthers in <hi>Ulster, Connaght,</hi> and <hi>Leinster,</hi> yet the care which was took to register those in <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> hath been obstructed, as the others (if they had not been
<pb facs="tcp:93738:16"/>
early) might have been so too, However they are not lost, though at present confin'd.</p>
            <p>Some Remarks on the Rebels Pamphlets and Pretentions, we have coursorarily answer'd; Not holding our selves obliged to reply to each Particular, else the Volume would swell too big; Besides there are many things which (in reading) an Intelligent Person cannot but blow over with an easie Breath; Some are so ridiculous, others improbable, most without their Circumstances: what is fairer Varnish'd we have (from their own Principles, or their Parties Confession) clear'd, therein not so much veiling Truths, (whether for or against us) as disclosing their nakedness, a deformed Face needs a <hi>Fucus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Favourers of that Party insist much on the Parliaments being Prorogued, which should have met soon after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; <hi>whereby what they would have presented to the King,</hi> (by way of Accommodation) was (say they) <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prevented, and that the Lords and old</hi> English <hi>of the</hi> Pale, <hi>who had been constant to the Crown in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, were (by the usage of the State) forced to take part with the</hi> Ulster <hi>Rebels;</hi> The first of these is in the main discoursed <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. 32.</note> of, to which we must add, (as being an undeniable consequence of their Desires then) <hi>That</hi> their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours (to meet at that time in Parliament) was to no other end, but that the Plot having been discover'd, (whereby <hi>they</hi> could not strike hands at first with the Northern Rebels, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out apparent Rebellion, which they were willing to screen under fairer pretences) <hi>They</hi> might in Parliament the more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly contest with the King, for their Religion and Liberty; which neither the just Jealousies of the State, or the Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions then, could rationally admit of, lest meeting in such numbers (as a Parliament would colourably bring to Town) they might take new Councils, the former (seeming in some part) to be disappointed. And as to the <hi>Latter,</hi> the truth thereof is already cleared from <hi>Fol. 39.</hi> to <hi>42.</hi> nor indeed needs there any thing more to be said, but what his Majesty <hi>(C. I.)</hi> on this subject verified to the Protestant's Agents at <hi>Oxford, 1644. That what the Rebels pleaded as to this Particular, was not his Belief but an Assertion of the</hi> Irish; And when the Protestant Agents would further have cleared this Point, (some at Court being apt to blow up those Cindars) the King said, <hi>That needed not, for to what purpose is it to prove the Sun shines this day, when we all see it?</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:93738:16"/>
from the Proceedings of <hi>the State</hi> exprest in their <note n="*" place="margin">25th. of Oct 1641.</note> Letter to the Lord Lieutenant, it is evident that all the hopes <hi>they had, was of the old</hi> English <hi>of the</hi> Pale, <hi>and some other Parts, that they would continue constant to the King, as they did in former times,</hi> Then which, what could be a clearer demonstration of their Confidence in them, strengthening af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards their Belief in affording them Arms and Trusting them with Commissions Civil and Martial? And wheras <hi>these men</hi> will have it, that they offer'd Propositions to the State, charging them with the neglect thereof, it is justified in the Lords Justices Letter <note n="*" place="margin">14th. of Dec. 1641.</note> to the Lord Lieutenant, <hi>That not one of them (to that hour) offer'd to the State any Advice or real Assistance, towards the Pacification of these Troubles:</hi> Or when they were invited, (by all the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Honour or Loyalty could enforce) would <hi>they</hi> ever comply with any; Nay, let the Insolency <hi>They</hi> used to the Orders <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. 35.</note> of Parliament, and the Invitation and Condescention of the State, <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. 40.</note> tearing the First, and vilifying the Latter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a perpetual Witness of their Arrogance and Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that the <hi>State</hi> would have secur'd their Allegiance, and they would not.</p>
            <p>When I first enter'd on this History, I propos'd to my self a Series of the whole, but prest with my own Affairs, and Matter encreasing plentfully upon me, I held it rational to sum up the whole after I had brought it to the Cessation, which some <note n="*" place="margin">Col. <hi>Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's</hi> Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance <hi>Pag.</hi> 5.</note> had an apprehension was not a less Plot to deliver the Remainder of his Majesties true Subjects, into the Rebels hands, and to root out the Protestant Religion, then what was commenc'd the 23. of <hi>October 1641.</hi> But the Articles of that Cessation speak otherwise, necessity being the Ground thereof, legible in his Majesties Motives to a Cessation the 19th. of <hi>October 1643.</hi> which afterwards was highly contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and in the end so enfeebled, as the War (according to the first intent) was (after the long Parliament grasp'd all) pursued with Vigour and Success: Which here (induced to it by many Reasons) we have at last (according to our first thoughts) brought to a Period under his Majesties Test, in the Voice of his Parliament in <hi>Ireland 1662.</hi> though with omission of many Circumstances, lest in such variety, we might fall short of those considerable Actions, which frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terven'd, fit indeed for none less Privy to the Rebels, than the State: However we have not omitted sufficient to clear the
<pb facs="tcp:93738:17"/>
Rise as well as the Conclusion of this War, not so much dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Censures, as caring to inform Right: Yet I Question not, but there will be some who will find (if not sufficient) enough to carp at; No History was so round as to pass a General Acceptance: Happily Reader.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough we date the Conquest of <hi>Ireland</hi> from the submission of the Kings and Natives there to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, 1172. yet on a truer estimate, we must conclude, that <hi>Ireland</hi> was never really subjugated to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> till our Laws became as communicable to the Natives, as the <hi>English,</hi> whereby each Party, without distinction, grew up together into one Nation; which was never effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vouchsafed, till after <hi>Tir-Oen</hi>'s last sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission at <hi>Mellifont,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> 1603. by which, the minds of the People were broken to the obedience of the Law, and after that became so pliable, as near fourty years there seemed no material distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt the Natives and other Inhabitants, each concentring in subjection to the Laws, making up but one Jury, living in mutual amity and friendship; till Indulgence so far became a mischief, as thence <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies</hi> hatch'd our ruine; not discernable, ere the Monster arriv'd at its Birth; a Prodigy scarce credible in so vigilant a State: Though when it's consider'd how tenderly the great concerns of Religion (the principal wheels of all Commotion in a State) were handled, the astonishment (that things aspir'd to so much Villany) may easily be unridl'd.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of the Lord <hi>Falkland</hi>'s Government (there being great need of Money for support of the standing Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and maintaining of 500 Horse, and 5000 Foot; much by extraordinary means having been otherwise disposed) the Catholicks of <hi>Ireland</hi> (glad of the occasion) seem'd very forward to supply the State, in hopes of a Connivance (if not a Toleration) of their Religion, though therein they were onely to bear their share (or rather offered their Mite) with the Protestants; which they improved to so great an insolence, as the Lord <hi>Falkland</hi> (with the Council) was forced to take notice in a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dated the <hi>1st.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1629. <hi>That the late Intermission of Legal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against Popish pretended Titulary Arch-bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Deans, Vicars General, Jesuits, Friers, and others of that sort, that derive
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93738:20"/>
their pretended Authority and Orders from the See of</hi> Rome, (<hi>in contempt of his Majesties Royal Power and Authority</hi>) <hi>had bred such an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary insolence and presumption in them, as he was necessitated to charge and command them, in his Majesties name, to for bear the exercise of their Popish Rites and Ceremonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding which, their Insolencies afterwards so increased, as that the power of the High Commission (rais'd in respect of them) being withdrawn, they erected a new <hi>University</hi> at <hi>Dublin,</hi> to confront his Majesties <hi>Colledge</hi> there, continuing their Nunneries and Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; that thence many things were objected against the Lord <hi>Falkland</hi>'s Government: to clear which, the Council of <hi>Ireland</hi> (in his defence to the King the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1629.) declared, <hi>That towards the insolencies of the Papists, and the late outragious presumption of the unsetled</hi> Irish; <hi>in some parts</hi> your Deputy and Council <hi>of late us'd particular Abstinence, holding themselves somewhat limited concerning them by late Insinuations, Letters, and Directions from</hi> England. And yet afterwards so mindful too were the Lords of the Council in <hi>England</hi> of what had been (by the State of <hi>Ireland</hi>) happily supprest, that the 31 of <hi>January,</hi> 1629. they return'd their acknowledgment, and put the State of <hi>Ireland</hi> in mind, <hi>How much it concern'd the good Government of</hi> Ireland, <hi>to prevent in time the first growing of such evils; for that where such People are permitted to swarm, they will soon grow licentious, and endure no Government but their own, which cannot otherwise be restored, than by a due and seasonable execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law, and of such Directions as from time to time have been sent from his Majesty and Council, &amp;c. further encouraging them to carry a soft or harder hand according to their discretions.</hi> Which I do not find but they prudently observ'd; though all was too little to root out the <hi>Leven</hi> that had season'd the <hi>Batch,</hi> during the Government of the then Lords Justices. (As Dr. <hi>Bedel</hi> (the Reverend Bishop of <hi>Kilmore</hi>) takes notice of at large, <note n="*" place="margin">In his Letter to the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</hi> the 5. of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1633. as formerly in a Letter to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Laud</hi> of the <hi>1st.</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> 1630.</note> with a deep and hearty resentment, worthy his Piety, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and Learning) till the arrival of <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord Viscount <hi>Wentworth,</hi> who by his singular Wisdom, Courage, and quick Intelligence, so managed affairs there, (though some thought they were carried on too severely) as doubtless the Nation, in general, was never more seemingly in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; what ever afterwards was aggravated against that Noble Person, whose behaviour was less pleasing to some men (interess'd in the detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their morose and sinister dealings) than to the Nation, which flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd under his Auspicious Government. Reverence is that wherewith Princes are girt from God: Yet then the contrivance of some Spirits was so restless, as <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. (being the <hi>10th.</hi> of King <hi>Charls</hi> the First) they design'd to have engag'd the Nation in a War, which one <hi>Ever Mac-Mahon</hi> (an eminent Popish Priest) privately discovered to some of the Privy Council at <hi>Dublin,</hi> at whose feet he prostrated himself for mercy, having, with others been employ'd abroad to Foreign Princes (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and other <hi>Princes</hi>) on that service, as (in the Relation writ by the Lord <hi>Macquire</hi> in the <hi>Tower</hi>) is apparent, the Design having been of as ancient a Date, as the Isle of <hi>Rhee</hi>'s Enterprise, 1628. About which time the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> held an intimate correspondence; though the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Wars then in <hi>Italy</hi> frustrated, for that time, the Insurrection and Invasion. Upon the discovery of which, <hi>Ever Mac-Mahon</hi> seeming penitent, had his Pardon: So that the thing being onely treated of in general, the prudence of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93738:20"/>
Governour (giving the People no suspicion that he feared it, and yet watched against it) blasted their design: The same Providence we may also believe this Noble Person had in the antecedent warnings, which the Reverend Dean of <hi>Kilmore</hi> particularly mentions<note n="*" place="margin">In his Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions annexed to the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance of the state of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> p. 24.</note>, though he (in reference to the Intregues of State) mov'd not so visibly as to make every one capable of his foresight. Prime Ministers are not to level their proceedings to the capacities of all, who pretend vigilancy of the State: yet thence (during his Government) all things in the Publick proceeded with a serene countenance, so as the Lord Deputy <hi>Wentworth</hi> came for <hi>England,</hi> and return'd into <hi>Ireland</hi> several times, with his Majesties great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Approbation, and the Peace of the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. a Parliament was summon'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by his motion; 1. For that the Contribution from the Countrey, towards the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Army, ended that <hi>December.</hi> 2. For that the Revenues there fell short of his Majesties Charges <hi>20000 l.</hi> yearly. 3. That there was a Debt of <hi>80000 l.</hi> upon the Crown. 4. For that there had been no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies but one since the beginning of King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign; and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were now grown wealthy, being continued in their Estates, who ever had enjoy'd them twenty years. By the Supply of which Parliament, the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> paid the <hi>80000 l.</hi> Debt due from the Crown; than which, nothing was more to his Majesties Honour, and his Servants In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; in testimony of which, his Majesty <note n="*" place="margin">In his Answer to the two last Papers of <hi>Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, fol.</hi> 569.</note> saith, <hi>That they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but witness (who know that Kingdom) that during the Government there by Lieutenants of his choice, that Kingdom enjoyed more Plenty and Peace than ever it had since it was under the subjection of the Crown of</hi> England; <hi>Traffick by Sea, and Trade by Land increas'd, Values of Land improv'd, Shipping multipli'd beyond belief, never was the Protestant Religion more advanc'd, nor the Protestants protected in greater security against the Papists; Inasmuch as we must remember you</hi> (the Parliament capitulating with him to nominate a Governour for <hi>Ireland</hi>) <hi>that the present Rebellion was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun when there was no Lieutenant there, and when the Power (which had been formerly us'd in that Kingdom) was question'd and disgrac'd; when those in the Parliament there (by whom that Rebellion was hatch'd) were countenanc'd in their Complaints and Prosecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the Progress of <hi>Religion</hi> there, receive from the Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi> this account, in his Discourse of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. 934.</note> where (having occasion to mention the incomparable and pious Primate, Archbishop <hi>Usher</hi>) he takes notice, <hi>That having liv'd sundry years a Bishop in the Province of</hi> Ulster, <hi>whilst the Political part of the care of that Church lay heavy upon his shoulders, he prais'd God, they were like Candles in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Temple, looking one towards another, and all towards the Stem; no contention arising amongst them, but who should hate contention most, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the Peace of the Church with swiftest paces; inasmuch as if the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soaring Counsels of some short-wing'd Christians, whose eyes regarded nothing but the present Prey, with the Rebellious practises of the Irish Enemy, tied together like</hi> Samson's <hi>Foxes, with Firebrands at their tails, had not thrust them away from the Stern, and chas'd them from their Sees with</hi> Bellona's <hi>bloody Whip: They might before this time, without either persecution or noise, have given a more welcome and comfortable account of the</hi> Irish <hi>Church, than our Age is likely to produce.</hi>

            <p>The last time this Noble Person (the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Strafford</hi>) enter'd <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was the <hi>18th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1639. when he arriv'd at <hi>Dublin</hi> Lord
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93738:21"/>
Lieutenant a little before, having (in an extraordinary Solemnity and conflux of Ambassadors and Peers) been made <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Strafford;</hi> at which time he appear'd in Parliament (begun the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> in the <hi>14th.</hi> of King <hi>Charles</hi> the I.) expressing his Majesties Necessities in such terms, as immediately Four entire Subsidies (without further expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) were unanimously consented unto; the freedom of which added much to the largeness of the gift, with which he rais'd 8000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, additional to the Veterain Forces, which (at the breaking forth of the Rebellion) consisted but of 2297 Foot, and 943 Horse. And so having setled his Majesties affairs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he went for <hi>England</hi> to the Parliament at <hi>Westminster,</hi> summon'd by his Mediation the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1640. being attended from <hi>Ireland</hi> with the acclamations of the whole House of Parliament, yet legible, in a very remarkable manner, in the Preamble of their Act of Subsidies, <hi>Anno</hi> 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. yet afterwards we know his fate. <hi>Never</hi> (writes <hi>Perinshief) sufficiently bewail'd by the King, till the issue of his blood dri'd up those of his tears.</hi> All the actions of his Government were narrowly sifted, and though <hi>no one thing</hi> (after the mercenary Tongues of the Lawyers had endeavour'd to render him a Monster of men) could be found Treason, <hi>many accumulated</hi> were so voted. That him (whom even now the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> extolled as an excellent Governour, and one for whose due and sincere Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice, they had principally consented to so great a <hi>Subsidy</hi>) they afterwards pursued as the cause of all their mischiefs, and so by their Agents even those who afterwards complotted the <hi>Rebellion</hi>) incens'd the Parliament at <hi>Westminster</hi> against him, as they denied all that they had attributed to his <hi>Worth,</hi> fixing on him what-ever might contribute to a <hi>praevious Government,</hi> or the Kingdom's impoverishment; the <hi>state</hi> of which cannot be better clear'd, than by what his Majesty, in a full Council at <hi>White-hall</hi> the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>Ian.</hi> 1640. seem'd clearly to acquiesce in, upon the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s avowing of the Answer to the <hi>Irish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance against him, ordering, that a Copy thereof should be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with given, by the Clerk of the Council, to the Committee of <hi>Ireland</hi> then attending upon him; since Registred among the publick Records.</p>
            <p>Thus was this great Man accused, thus justifi'd; yet all was not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to exempt him from the <hi>destructive Bill</hi> of <hi>Attainder,</hi> suggesting, <hi>His tyrannous and exorbitant Power over the Liberties and Estates of his Majesties Subjects in</hi> Ireland, <hi>laying and assessing of Soldiers by his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon the Subject, against their consent; saying also, that he had an Army in</hi> Ireland, <hi>which his Majesty might make use of to reduce this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> meaning <hi>England,</hi> as appears by the Act which passed the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1641.

presented his Actions at his Trial more significant than I dare pretend to, such a Scene of Justice (attended with that Magnificence in its Structure, such Seats for their Majesties, for Ambassadors, and the most discerning Audience of <hi>England</hi>) not being to be parallel'd.

               <hi>That his great abilities were prone to create in him great confidence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, and this was like enough to betray him to great Errors, and many Enemies, whereof he could not but contract good store, while moving in so high a Sphere, and with so vigorous a Lustre, he must needs (as the Sun) raise many envious Exhalations, which, condens'd by a Popular Odium, were capable to cast a Cloud upon the brightest Merit and Integrity, &amp;c.

            <p>Which was delivered to the Lord Justice <hi>Parsons,</hi> and since his death found in his Study, and by Sir <hi>James Barry,</hi> Lord <hi>Baron of Santry,</hi> (a right Honourable and worthy Person) presented to his present <hi>Majesty;</hi> who look'd upon it as a precious Jewel, discovering his Father's Royal thoughts towards the preservation of his Protestant Subjects and People. But how far it was at first communicated, is uncertain, though being of so great a Trust, it may very well be believed to have been often refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on with caution and prudence: Certain it is, that notwithstanding that there was an <hi>Item,</hi> that there should be an especial care against le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying of Soldiers for <hi>Spain,</hi> yet Colonel <hi>John Barry,</hi> Colonel <hi>Taaff,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Garret Barry,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Porter,</hi> had all Warrants to transport 4000 Men <hi>thither,</hi> which several of the House of Commons in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> too, with much artifice (though with divers ends) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to prevent on plausible terms; <hi>As that,</hi> from the experience of what they might learn abroad, they afterwards might prove ill Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at home; whereas it was more necessary, that they should be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd on Husbandry, whereof that Kingdom had great need. And many of the active men of the House of Commons in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as <hi>Darcy</hi> the Lawyer, <hi>Plunket, Chevers, Martin,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> urg'd their stay, with a passion seemingly much concern'd, <hi>for that,</hi> amongst many Reasons, which I will not undertake (at so long a distance) positively to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, (though I had the honour to be a Member of that House) yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget, that their chief Argument was drawn from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having long born an ill will to <hi>England</hi> and her Empire: And therefore <hi>they did not know</hi> (mark the insinuation) <hi>how soon those very Regiments (acquainted with every Creek of the Kingdom) might be return'd on their own Bowels, having naturally a love to their Religion, which such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary (as the King of</hi> Spain) <hi>might soon inflame to the highest prejudice.</hi> Which I the longer insist on, for that the Collection of Murthers commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the <hi>Irish</hi> (published by <hi>R. S.</hi> 1662.) would insinuate (the better to invalidate the Abstract of Murthers committed by the <hi>Irish</hi>) that the Catholick Members of the House of Commons in <hi>Ireland</hi> never hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred (as that Abstract affirms) the Transportation of the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> disbanded Soldiers into <hi>Spain,</hi> purposely to advance the <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which is clear they did: Inasmuch as upon these and other Arguments, their Transportation was deferr'd; though if the discontented <hi>Irish</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had been disposed of beyond-Sea (according to the Contracts with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadors) it was very clear, as is judicially affirmed, that there could have been no Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Pretence
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93738:23"/>
and Means thereof having been thereby taken away; though some were of opinion, that where-ever these Forces had been, they could yet easily have been brought over again, (as others have been since) the principal Heads of the Rebels Army being led by old experienc'd Soldiers, who (at the breaking out of the Rebellion) were generally beyond-Sea, as the <hi>Leimster</hi> Forces by Colonel <hi>Preston,</hi> a branch out of the House of <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manston;</hi> the <hi>Ulster</hi> Forces by <hi>Owen Roe O-Neal,</hi> (both bred in <hi>Flanders</hi>) <hi>Munster</hi> Forces by <hi>Garret Barry,</hi> and the <hi>Connaght</hi> Forces by one <hi>Burck;</hi> animated with their Cause and the <hi>Pope</hi>'s encouragement. And it cannot be denied, that the promiscuous compleating of the Army (lately rais'd of 8000 Foot and 1000 Horse) in <hi>Ireland,</hi> taught many of the Common Soldiers the use of Arms, who otherwise would have been ignorant thereof: And evil in <hi>Perrot's</hi> and <hi>Fitzwilliam's</hi> Government, much took notice of, and by <hi>Camden</hi> in his <hi>Eliz. Anno</hi> 1593. towards the end, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in the like case to be most improvidently done, as afterwards was found, the <hi>Irish</hi> being always disloyal to the <hi>English.</hi> Upon which I cannot but reflect on what <hi>Antalcidas</hi> (in <hi>Plutarch</hi> *) tells <hi>Agesilaus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The life of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesilaus, fol.</hi> 624.</note> of being sorely hurt by the <hi>Thebans, That they had paid him his deserved hire, for teaching them against their wills to be Soldiers, who before had neither will nor skill to fight.</hi> Certain it is, that most of these Soldiers (thus rais'd) betook themselves to the Rebels Party; although very few of their Officers (if we may credit a late Historian) were polluted with the crime.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding the Letter fore-cited, and many troublesome passages in Parliament, wherewith the Lords Justices and Council were not seldom alarm'd, (sufficient to waken their confidence) no Cloud, not the breadth of a hand, appear'd; but the Lords Justices kept a fair correspondence with the Parliament, giving all the furtherance they could to the going of their Committee into <hi>England,</hi> hoping that what his Majesty should be pleased to grant, (at their requests) might redound to the common benefit of the Nation. Neither did the <hi>Lords Justices</hi> or <hi>Council</hi> transmit unto his <hi>Majesty,</hi> or any of the State of <hi>England,</hi> any mis-reprehensions of the proceedings and actions of that Parliament, as some maliciously insinuated; in as much as a Noble Person, a Peer in the Lords House, said, <hi>That the Lords Justices had always cheerfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their Requests and Messages, and were ready to comply with them; desiring that this their compliance might be entred in the Journal, to the end that it might remain to Posterity.</hi> Having by his <hi>Majesties</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, dated the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1640. authority to Continue, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue, or Determine the Parliament, as they thought fit; which liberty they indulg'd much to the freedom of the Parliament. However (being resolv'd, as the sequel prov'd, to pretend any thing, rather than not to have some exceptions against the Government) the <hi>Irish</hi> Parliament sent to his Majesty a Declaration, therein magnifying the Six entire Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies they had given in the <hi>10th.</hi> year of his Majesties Reign, and the Four Subsidies in the <hi>15th.</hi> year of his Reign; pretending moreover, that they had been ill presented to his Majesty, which was clearly evinc'd to the contrary, and several Graces vouchsaf'd them thereupon.</p>
            <p>Amongst other things, the State (at that time) found difficult to do, the Disbanding of the new rais'd Army was not the least, which the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> had great jealousies of, and besought his Majesty that it should be dissolv'd. In answer whereof, his Majesty repli'd, <hi>That
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93738:24"/>
the thing was already upon consultation, but he found many difficulties in it, and therefore told the Parliament, He held it not onely fit to wish it, but to show the way how it might conveniently be done.</hi> However, in <hi>August,</hi> 1641. it was effectually perform'd, for which afterwards the <hi>Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices</hi> had his <hi>Majesties</hi> gracious approbation; and the Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition were carefully brought into his Majesties Stores, by the vigilance of the Master of the Ordnance, (the Lord Justice <hi>Borlase</hi>) else, certainly, most of those Arms (as well as the Men) had been undoubtedly listed in the Confederates Army; which many of their Party (in the House of Commons in <hi>Ireland</hi>) having an eye to, made them so averse to have them Disbanded. And the Plot proceeded, being so cunningly manag'd by some of the Members of Parliament, (subtil in their insinuations) that many of the Protestants, and well-meaning people of the House, (blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an apprehension of <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Redress,</hi> lying under the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Yoak with the rest) were innocently decoi'd into their acting violently with them. Hence Sir <hi>Richard Bolton,</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was impeach'd of High Treason, and <hi>others</hi> of the prime Officers and Ministers of State, were Articled against; yea, some of the <hi>Bishops</hi> were not spar'd, <hi>contrary to all presidents of that nature, as was certifi'd by the Lords Justices to the Principal Secretary, on search made, upon his Majesties commands, for that purpose.</hi> So as (besides) some of the active men of the House, Lawyers, <hi>Darcy, Martin, Plunket, Cusack, Brown, Linch, Bodkin, Evers,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> took upon them with much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <hi>to declare the Law, to make new Expositions of their own upon the Text, as, That killing in Rebellion was no forfeiture of Lands</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Appendix 1.</note>; <hi>and to frame</hi> 21 <hi>Queries:</hi> Which in a solemn Committee of the House, Adjourn'd from time to time, they discuss'd at their own freedom in the Dining-Room at the Castle, disdaining the moderate Qualifications of the Judges, (who gave them modest Answers, such as the Law and Duty to their Sovereign, would admit) and in stead of them, vented their own sense, as if the State were then in its Infancy, and from them meerly to receive its Constitution; as Sir <hi>John Temple</hi> observes, resolving upon an alteration in the Government, and drawing of it wholly into the hands of the Natives: Sir <hi>Phelim Oneal</hi> making it plain, in his Letters of Triumph to his Holy Confessor, <hi>That his purposes were Conquest, and not defence of Religion, his Majesties Prerogative, or their Liberty.</hi> No! <hi>No King of</hi> England (writes <hi>Mahony</hi> a Jesuit) <hi>nor Crown, nor People, nor state of that Kingdom, having at any time, any kind of Right to the Kingdom of</hi> Ireland, <hi>or any part thereof; that the</hi> English <hi>Title to it was but meer Usurpation and Violence, and that therefore the old Natives</hi> (i. e. <hi>the meer</hi> Irish) <hi>might chuse and make themselves a King of one of their own</hi> Irish; <hi>and in the then Circumstances of</hi> Charles <hi>the First of</hi> England'<hi>s, being a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, ought</hi> (i. e.) <hi>were bound in Conscience, to do so, and throw off together the Yoak both of Hereticks and Foreigners.</hi> Which Tenents, being rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn, the Confederate <hi>Irish</hi> seem'd afterward to condemn (forsooth) in a Council of their own at <hi>Kilkenny:</hi> Yet it is very observable (and that from <hi>Walsh</hi> himself) who says, He can never forget it (having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary great admiration thereat) <hi>That there was not</hi> one <hi>in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Congregation (met by an extraordinary favour the</hi> 11th. <hi>of</hi> June, <hi>at</hi> Dublin, 1666.) <hi>that open'd once his mouth for confession of any Villanies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against the King, at any time in the late Rebellion, or Civil War, or even to speak a word for so much as a general Petition to be exhibited
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93738:24"/>
to his Majesty, imploring his Majesties gracious Pardon. Notwithstanding the first Rebellion</hi> 1641. <hi>and what follow'd upon the Nuncio's access, and the violation of the first Peace</hi> 1646. <hi>and the Nuncio's Censures against the</hi> Cessation with the Lord <hi>Inchequin,</hi> and the Peace 1648. <hi>And</hi> the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Excommunication of the Bishops as <hi>James-Town</hi> 1650, against the Lord Lieutenant the Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and those who obey'd him. <hi>Emphatically enough exprest by</hi> P. W. No. 1. (He enforces this Argument further) <hi>There was no crime</hi> (writes he) <hi>at all committed by All or any of the Roman Catholick Clergy of</hi> Ireland, <hi>nor even at any time, nor in any occasion or matter hapen'd since the</hi> 23d. <hi>of</hi> October, 1641. <hi>that needed Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning for Pardon, either for themselves, or any other of the</hi> Irish <hi>Clergy; if we must believe the Bishop of</hi> Ardagh, Patrick Plunket, <hi>pleading for them in so express terms, and the tacit approbation of his words by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal silence of that Assembly.</hi> In pursuance of which, the Protestant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of <hi>Ireland</hi> (in their Answer to the Objections the Rebels Agents put in against the <hi>Preamble of the Bill of Settlement</hi>) took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that (in the whole Volume of Papers which were put in by the Catholicks about that Affair) there was not one grateful Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or so much as one civil mention of his Majesties singular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention. They having the favour to inspect that <hi>Act of Settlement,</hi> and object as they pleas'd, as if all his Majesty could do for them were no more than he ought. And further it is these Commissioners observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That in all the <hi>Irish</hi> Papers, they do not own the slaughter of so many thousands to be a Rebellion, or once give the Title of Rebels to those who were the first Agents in that horrid and bloody Massacre; which being not acknowledged by them, more easily absolves the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Ingratitude for his Majesties favours. And a Person of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (in his Animadversions on Fanaticism <note n="*" place="margin">p. 72.</note>, who deserves much for his excellencies in the case) takes notice, <hi>That no Catholick ever made any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession against the Rebellion, or manifested his detestation or dislike of it by any publick Writing, that the Design seem'd a Birth acceptable to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Community.</hi> And the <hi>Pope,</hi> by his Nuncio afterwards (to whom the general part of the Clergy and Natives adhear'd) in effect maintain'd what <hi>Mahony</hi> had deliver'd for wholesome Doctrine, accounting the Popes Bulls, and Interdictions, and Absolutions, (how long soever since publish'd) still in the same force and vigour, as they were the first day of their publication. <hi>And it is very few years since</hi> (writes this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Person <note n="*" place="margin">p. 74.</note>) <hi>that (upon the meeting of the Secular and Regular Clergy of</hi> Ireland, <hi>before-mention'd, to frame an Address to the King in testimony of their obedience, disclaiming any Temporal Authority in the Popes) the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>was so alarm'd by it, that Cardinal</hi> Barbarin <hi>writ to them, to desist from any such Declaration, putting them in mind, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> England <hi>was still under Excommunication.</hi> And <hi>Walsh</hi> acquaints us at large of <hi>Mac-Mahon,</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> Jesuits printed Book <hi>of the lawfulness of killing, not onely all the Protestants, but even all such of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Irish, <hi>who should stand for the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>and the Rights of the King to</hi> Ireland. A Tenent agreeable to <hi>Salamanca</hi>'s approbation of <hi>Oneal</hi>'s Rebellion, 1602. instigated by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> whereby it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>That all Catholicks who followed the</hi> English <hi>Standard against Prince</hi> Oneal, <hi>mortally sinned.</hi> And <hi>Osulevan</hi> the Priest, in King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, said, <hi>It was a Doctrine fetch'd from Hell, that Catholicks in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>should joyn with the Queens Forces, which were Protestants, against

the Rebels, Catholicks, in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and that such</hi> English <hi>ought to be no less set upon than the</hi> Turks. <hi>So that whatsoever delusive Tenents have been broach'd of late, as to perswade us the Adder is without sting, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hath been written in letters of blood, not in his Majesty's Kingdoms only, but wheresome-ever the Papal Power was exalted, That persons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the Reformed Religion, are but Tenants at Will for their Lives and Fortunes, and through Centuries of Ages it appears, that as their Fleeces grow, they are shorn, till a time of slaughter be appointed.</hi> That hence <hi>we</hi> may see, at what we should have arriv'd, had the <hi>Irish</hi> been fortunate in their attempt; for though the loyal Formulary or Remonstrance (highly magnified by some) may seem a Bond of Iron, it may easily (by the <hi>Pope</hi>) become <hi>weaker</hi> than a Rope of Straw.</p>
            <p>During the Summer Sessions of Parliament (already spoke of) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Heads of the Rebellion were closely complotting, some under a suspicion, that the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Servants (in revenge of their <hi>Lord</hi>'s death) intended a Mischief to the Parliament, mov'd the House, and accordingly had Orders, that the <hi>Lords Justices</hi> would let his Majesty's Stores (for Powder and Arms) be search'd, which (by a Committee) they so curiously perform'd, as they turn'd over several improbable Chests to find it out; and when they had seen that there was none, according to what the Officers of the Ordnance had before assur'd them, yet they seem'd unsatisfied, and repair'd (on a new Order) to the <hi>Lords Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> to be admitted to see the Stores of Powder and Arms, plac'd in other Parts in and about the Castle: To whom the <hi>Lord Justice</hi> Borlase (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Ordnance, principally interess'd in securing his <hi>Majesties</hi> Stores) answer'd, That those were the King's precious Jewels, not to be (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>special</hi> Gause) shewed, assuring them further, that they needed not to be afraid, for that, upon his Honour, there was no Powder under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath either of the Houses of Parliament, as at the Trial of the Lord <hi>Mac Quire,</hi> at the King's Bench in <hi>Westminster,</hi> was openly in Court testified by the Lord <hi>Blaney,</hi> a great sufferer, a worthy and gallant Person, the said Lord Justice <hi>Borlase,</hi> having at that time such a motion in his blood, (upon the importunity of that enquiry) as he would afterwards often mention that action of theirs, as aiming (how slightly soever then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by others) at some further mark, than was th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n discernable: So that at that instant he denied them, whereat they seem'd discontented, as being left in uncertainty, in what state his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Stores stood, which they desired particularly to know (the late new Army being disbanded then, and their Arms brought in) that if the Powder and Arms were not there, they might find them elsewhere; or if there, then (by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended surprize) to be sure of them, and to know where (on the sudden) to find them: In which search, the Lord <hi>Mac Quire</hi> was a chief actor, and very inquisitive.</p>
            <p>Thus, in order to their <hi>Design,</hi> they made ready for the <hi>Business,</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that Session of Parliament (began the xi. of <hi>May</hi> 1641.) for the most part away in Protestations, Declarations, Votes upon the Queries, the stay of Souldiers from going over Seas, and private Petitions, little to the good of the Common-wealth, or advancement of his Majesty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whereof the <hi>Lords Justices</hi> and <hi>Councel</hi> having notice, finding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that the Popish Party in both Houses grew to so great a height, as was scarce <hi>compatible</hi> to the present Government, they imparted (by a Message to both Houses the 14th. of <hi>July</hi> following) their intention to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93738:25"/>
give a recess for some months, the harvest coming on, and both Houses growing thin: Which intimation of a recess both Houses readily assented to; so that the 7th. of <hi>August,</hi> the <hi>Lords Justices</hi> adjourn'd the Houses to the 9th. of <hi>November</hi> following, which afterwards the Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament aggravated as a great unkindness, the <hi>Committee</hi> of Parliament being expected from <hi>England,</hi> and arriv'd at <hi>Dublin</hi> near the end of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust:</hi> Whereas, when the Parliament was adjourn'd, (and before) there was no certainty of their Committee's return, the Earl of <hi>Roscom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who (few days before) coming from <hi>England,</hi> expressing in plain terms, that the Bills desired were not likely (in any short time) to be dispatch'd, as the Letters from the <hi>Irish</hi> Committee at <hi>London,</hi> (which this Lord brought over) inform'd too; and, <hi>That they were daily about their dispatch, but could not guess when they might have it.</hi> Yet (as I have took notice) in <hi>August,</hi> beyond expectation, the Committee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, upon whose arrival, the <hi>Lords Justices</hi> and <hi>Councel</hi> (desirous to give them all satisfaction imaginable) sate daily composing of Acts, to be passed the next Sessions of Parliament, for the benefit of his Majesty, and the good of his Subjects, on which the Members of Parliament then at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and their Committee (newly arriv'd) seem'd with great contentment to retire into the Countrey, the <hi>Lords Justices</hi> forthwith sending Briefs to all the Ports in the Kingdom of the Graces concerning Customs, commanding the Officers punctually to obey those his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Directions, particularly what-ever concern'd Wool, Tobacco, as all other things of that nature, wherein his Majesty had been pleas'd to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Committee. They gave Order also for drawing a Bill, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of the Preamble of the Act of Subsidies. They also desired Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Cole</hi> and Sir <hi>James Montgomery</hi> (two of the Committee) if they could ever take the Assizes in the County of <hi>Ulster,</hi> to give publick no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to all the Undertakers, of what his Majesty had graciously granted and intended to them; which accordingly <hi>they</hi> undertook to do, the <hi>Lords Justices</hi> leaving (as they thought) nothing omitted, which might evidence their compliance with his Majesty's gracious Intentions, acting (during this recess of Parliament) so vigilantly, and with that vigor, in relation to all the Committee's Transactions in <hi>England,</hi> and his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Service, that they had little time (if any) to spare for their other occasions; that if we reflect on their unwearied and faithful Endeavours, it cannot but be imputed as the greatest act of ingratitude (that ever a Nation was guilty of) to calumniate such a Government, which had been mainly instrumental to accomplish those Graces, that Favour, such Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as never any of his Majesty's Predecessors would vouchsafe.</p>
            <p>Yet then (in the midst of this Condescention) many of those (even the major part which were Papists) who had been thus graciously heard by his Majesty, countenanc'd in <hi>England,</hi> carassed at Court, most treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously conspired against his Crown and Dignity, the original of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion being brought over (deposeth <hi>Prisley</hi> of <hi>Mac-Mahon</hi>) by the <hi>Irish</hi> Committee, who were imployed by the Parliament to his Majesty, for the redress of their Grievances in that Kingdom, complotting thereby the most execrable and bloody Rebellion History can parallel, improving their Neighbourhood (at that time) to a mighty access of Visits and Freedom, especially in <hi>Ulster,</hi> where the <hi>Irish</hi> seem'd to mind nothing else but Entertainment, lodging (under colour of friendship) the night before themselves, with those whom they intended to kill the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

               <hi>That with his Majesty</hi> (in his Solitude) I may say that; <hi>That Sea of Blood, which these Men have cruelly and barbarously shed, is enough to drown any Man in eternal both infamy and misery, whom God shall find the malicious Author or Instigator of this effusion.</hi> And all this perpetrated, not for Religion, (as with great industry they endeavour to make foreign Princes believe) No! It was their inbred malice and hatred to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> which (from the first Conquest to this present) may (by very sad Examples) be clearly demonstrated, all Rebellions to <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. his time (that the Reformation in Religion seem'd more favourable) being wholly to extirpate the <hi>English,</hi> then with them all of one Religion, as may be easily shewed in a constant <hi>Series</hi> of Affairs, were not every Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story (concerning <hi>Ireland</hi>) full of this Truth, with horrible Presidents of Treachery and Barbarism.

            <p>Yet that we may come more closely to the Business, it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to recount what <hi>Rebellions</hi> ensued upon Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, and since to the fatal year 1641. That the practice of the <hi>Irish</hi> formerly being summ'd up, it may appear what seeds of <hi>Rebellion</hi> were ever sown in their hearts and soil, ripen'd constantly as opportunity and season gave them hopes of a harvest, all their submissions (as Sir <hi>John Davies</hi> observes) being meer mockery and imposture. <hi>Nor are we now without jealousies of what may yet be, were there opportunity for it,</hi> writes that excellent <hi>Bishop</hi> before cited, in the said Epistle.</p>
            <p>Soon after this glorious Queen (whom the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rhodes</hi> calls one of the most Heroick and Illustrious Princes of her Age) came to the Crown, all the Interests and Powers of <hi>Rome</hi> were animated against her, <hi>she</hi> having clear'd the light of the Gospel, by dissipating the fogs and mists of Superstition, so as thence the Spirits of Darkness rag'd every where, the Confederates of the Beast exalting their Power.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Anno</hi> 1567. <hi>Shane O-Neal</hi> rais'd a notable Rebellion in <hi>Ulster,</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in hatred to the <hi>English,</hi> erecting a Castle upon <hi>Lac-Eaugh,</hi> which he nam'd <hi>Feognegall,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> The hatred of the <hi>English</hi>) and prevail'd much, till Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi> routed his Forces.</p>

which War, an Edict was shortly after divulg'd, which in respect of those Tenents, yet maintain'd in the bleeding <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> and is indeed the sum of all their Infelicity and Malice, we have thought good to insert immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately betwixt the first and second Appendix.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Hugh O-Neal, Anno</hi> 1595. succeeded in his Villanies, (the War being call'd <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s Rebellion) till 1603. the War determining with that Glorious Queen. Of which three Rebellions, the <hi>Analecta de rebus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicorum in Hibernia,</hi> publish'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1617. has summ'd up these nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and just Remarks.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Praecesserat Spiritus grandis &amp; fortis subvertens montes &amp; conterens petras, id factum est in famoso illo Dynasta</hi> Johanne Nealo <hi>initio Regni</hi> Eliz. <hi>instar saevientis procellae omnia provadente, &amp; populante, qui nec mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus pepercit, nec collibus aut petris divina pariter &amp; humana miscens—Post multas strages quas fecit, accitis etiam è Conacia &amp; Momonia Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilaribus quos sui Consilii participes fecit, deinde post probra &amp; opprobria quae contraxit plurima cum vellet haberi restitutor Patriae Libertatis &amp; avitae Religionis, quia non erat de Numero eorum per quos salus facta est in Israel.

            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Post hunc Spiritum sequuta est gravis Commotio, quam suscitavit in Monronia Jacobus Geraldinus Mauritii filius cui accessit Johanne Geraldi Desmoniae Comitis Germanus frater, &amp; ipse postmodum Comes Geraldus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequutus est cum multis sequalibus; in Lagenia vero se adjunxerant Jacobus Vice-Comes de Baltinglass cum Kavanachiis, Briniis &amp; aliis Nobilibus illius Provinciae, visa est magnis &amp; piis Principibus Causa Dei tractari &amp; quia pro fide bellum susceptum intellexerunt.

            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Illa vero Geraldinorum commotione sic praetervecta successit ignis omni late devastans, dum flamma ferroque omnia populatur Comes Tyronensis plus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam decennali bello intercipiens hujus Insulae quietem, multa visus pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere aggredi multis etiam congressibus victor, sed nonnullis victoriis info<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescens exercitus tametsi Cohortium antesignari &amp; ipse Gubernator &amp; Dactor exercitus causam praetulerit honorificam restituendae Religionis nec ullam vellet capitulationem admittere, cum Anglis in qua Primario non ageretur De fide Orthodoxa publicè stabilanda per universum regnum, quia Tamen via &amp; violentia tunc exercita non erat secundum propositum Dei efficax, hinc peccatis Hominum irato Numine frustra se exerebant vires Hominum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. At King <hi>James</hi>'s access to the Crown, <hi>Waterford, Cork,</hi> and <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> in <hi>Munster, Kilkenny,</hi> and <hi>Wexford</hi> in <hi>Lemster,</hi> openly oppos'd the King's Title, as not being a Catholick; but were soon brought into obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the Lord Deputy <hi>Mountjoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Within four years after, the Lord <hi>Chichester</hi> Deputy, <hi>Tyrone</hi> and <hi>O Donnel</hi> conspiring with <hi>Mac-guire, Cormack O Neal, O Cahan,</hi> the Lord
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93738:27"/>
               <hi>Delvin,</hi> and others, design'd a notable Rebellion, but were prevented in <hi>May,</hi> 1607. and an Act of Attainder past, <hi>Anno</hi> 11, 12, 13 <hi>Jacobi, Cap.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>6. The year following <hi>Anno scil.</hi> 1608. Sir <hi>Cahir O Doghertie</hi>'s War succeeded, sharp, though short, determining in five months, encourag'd by the Priests, <hi>That all who died in that Service, went forthwith into Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards the State of <hi>Ireland</hi> seemed very happy, both as to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Land, Plenty, and Peace, till the year 1634. that <hi>Ever Mac-Mahon</hi> (before mention'd) discover'd an intended Plot, which by the prudence of the Governour (the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi>) never arriv'd at its design, nor afterwards was any thing further suspected, till Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> by his Majesties command (K. <hi>C.</hi> 1.) gave the Lords Justices, the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> notice of a suspected Rebellion; of which (with its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances) we have already insisted. Though we must say, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of the former Conspiracies, which by the blessedness of the Times, prudence of Governours, or other accidents, were delayed, in this (<hi>Anno sc.</hi> 1641.) met the accomplishment of them all. Yet nothing was here attempted, which the bleeding <hi>Iphigenia</hi> (the great Incendiary of that Nation) doth not passionately justifie, it being, in his Divinity and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, rational, That the <hi>Irish</hi> (though not then visibly assaulted) might however <hi>assume Arms in defence of their Religion and Property,</hi> both threatned; it being (writes he) a common Doctrine of Divines, <hi>That it is lawful to prevent an evil, that cannot be otherwise avoided than by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting it; nor need the authority of the Prince</hi> (in that case) <hi>be required.</hi> A Doctrine so hellish, as none certainly is so besotted, but he may easily read therein the ruine of States and Kingdoms; excellently answered by the Learned and accurate late Proselyte, Dr. <hi>Andrew Sal,</hi> to whom in this point we must refer you: And as to matter of Fact, bequeath you to the ensuing History, clearly evidencing, That before the <hi>Irish</hi> assumed Arms, no Instrument was ever thought on, much less found against them.</p>
            <p>Formerly indeed it hath been strongly imputed to the State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that (conquering <hi>Ireland</hi>) they did not also endeavour <hi>to make them one People;</hi> holding them Enemies, not taking care to settle Civility and a Property amongst them; the cause (as some thought) of frequent Rebellions. But though these and some other defects in the Civil Policy (some think) are inexcusable, it may clearly be demonstrated, they were not of so large a size as they are mark'd. And it may appear (by antient Records) that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were at first communicated to the meer <hi>Irish,</hi> as far as their Barbarism and Cruelties exercis'd (on occasions) upon the <hi>English</hi> would well admit. But (to let these times pass, whereof we cannot speak much with any certainty) let us now see what fruits we have of all the Royal endeavours of his Gracious Majesty, and his two Glorious Predecessors, what return for all their Care, for all their Charge, and for all the <hi>English</hi> Blood which hath (within the compass of the last Age) been spilt for purchasing of Peace, and introducing of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and common Civility into <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, that since the happy Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> all the former defects in the Government, and Civil Policy, have been abundantly supplied, and all those Means us'd, those Acts perform'd, those Designs fully accomplish'd, and all things else perfectly brought
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93738:27"/>
to pass, which (in the judgement of all wise Men) were conceiv'd, would undoubtedly effect the full settlement and reduction of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. As first, The barbarous Customs continually us'd by the <hi>Irish,</hi> have been quite abolished; all sorts of People (even the most wicked amongst them) have been allowed the benefit of the Law, and liv'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King's immediate Protection; all the Laws of <hi>England</hi> (found useful for that Kingdom) have been made currant by Act of Parliament, in <hi>Ireland;</hi> many other good Laws enacted, and the execution of them hath had free course through all parts of the Kingdom; the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice have been open, and the Judges (for the more free distribution of Justice to the People) have constantly (twice every year) gone their Circuits, through the several Counties of the whole Land; the Church-Government hath been fully setled, many preaching Ministers (general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plac'd throughout the several Parishes) as likewise Free-Schools, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with sufficient Maintenance for them, have been establisht; the Lands (belonging to the Natives) have been always duely setled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law in the Proprietor; and what noise soever was rais'd, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituling the Crown to <hi>Roscommon, Mayo, Slego, Galloway, Clare,</hi> besides some parts of <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Tipperary</hi> (as one of the Master-pieces of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Service in <hi>Ireland</hi>) nothing was ever effected thereupon, though it had cost his Majesty 10000 <hi>l.</hi> upon the enquiry, and had they had patience till the next Sessions of Parliament, there was an Act for Limitations, pass'd by his Majesty, to bar all Titles, Claims, and Challenges of the Crown, before 60 years last past, to have cut off all expectations upon the ancient Title, and have strengthned (by new Grants and Patents) all Titles from the Crown. Multitudes of <hi>British</hi> were brought in, and planted in great numbers, even in the most barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Places of the Kingdom; many corporate Towns have been erected; some wall'd Towns have been also lately built; Castles, Stone-houses, and Villages, daily made in every part in great abundance; Trade and Traffick so well setled, as (the obstructions therein being remov'd) the native Commodities were so freely exported, as they did (to the great advantage of the Kingdom) by far exceed the foreign Importation; and all other necessary Provisions were made for the Publick, which might be thought any ways to conduce to the Peace, Plenty, and flourishing Estate of a growing Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And for the <hi>Irish</hi> themselves (though they have ever been observ'd to be a whining Generation, a People always given unjustly to complain of their Governours) yet (in these later times) there hath been a most spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care taken, to preserve them free from all manner of Pressures. They have had liberty (beyond the examples of former Ages) to redress their Grievances in their own Parliament, being elected Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, according to the Affections of the Commons; they had too (of their Communion) Lawyers bred up in <hi>England,</hi> frequent at their Bar; also upon their Bench Justices of the Peace; in their Counties She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, and Mayors and other Officers in their Corporations, Favours not aspir'd to by the Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> or ever granted. And in Cases where they thought fit to present their Complaints unto his Majesty, they were graciously receiv'd, and fitting Remedies applied. They were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enjoy the free and full exercise of the Roman Religion without controul; to entertain Priests, Friers, Jesuits, and all sorts of their Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Orders, without number, whilst the Protestants dissenting from
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93738:28"/>
the Regimen of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were frequently summon'd to the Bishop's Court. Justice was equally administred to the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> without any manner of difference; the Countrey Duties and other Taxes were levied upon all without distinction of Persons; all private Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties suppress'd; all ancient Grudges remov'd; and in all outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they liv'd so affectionately intermixt together, as they could not be esteem'd two Nations in one Kingdom, but that they did <hi>Coalescere in unam Gentem.</hi> And it is without all contradiction not to be denied, That never any <hi>Conquer'd Nation</hi> enjoy'd more fully the Liberties and Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Free Subjects, and (through the great Indulgence of his Majesty) liv'd with greater contentment, Ease, Peace, Plenty, and freedom from all manner of extraordinary Taxations, other than such as they were pleas'd to impose upon themselves in Parliament, than the Natives of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have lately done.

                  <hi>THE</hi> first dark Light, of which Sir <hi>William Cole</hi> (the 11th. of<note place="margin">Sir <hi>William Cole</hi> gave the first light of the Rebellion.</note> 
                  <hi>October,</hi> 1641.) gave the <hi>Lords Justices, and Council</hi> notice of: <hi>As that there was a great Resort made to Sir</hi> Phelim O Neals, <hi>in the County of</hi> Tyrone, <hi>as also to the House of the Lord</hi> Mac-Guire, <hi>in the County of</hi> Fermanagh, <hi>and that by several suspected Persons (fit Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Mischief.) As also that the said Lord</hi> Mac-Guire <hi>had of late made several Journeys within the</hi> Pale, <hi>and other Places, and had spent his time much in writing Letters, and sending Dispatches abroad.</hi> Upon the receipt of which Intelligence, the Lords Justices and Council writ to Sir <hi>William Cole, requiring him to be very vigilant and industrious, to find out what should be the occasion of those several Meetings, and speedily to advertise them thereof, or any other particular that he conceiv'd might tend to the publick service of the State.</hi> And more than this (rationally) could not have been done; for that what Sir <hi>William Cole</hi> inform'd the State of, was but conjectural; and had any notice been took publickly of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal,</hi> or the Lord <hi>Mac-Guire</hi> had been seiz'd on, the same would certainly have been a pretended cause for the <hi>Irish</hi> (ready Touch-wood) to have risen in Arms, being suspected, before they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested any dis-satisfaction. Besides, there was <hi>some</hi> so unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the least mis-conceit of the <hi>Irish,</hi> (believing Time had worn out all Animosities, and the State had secur'd each Interests) as they us'd the utmost artifice imaginable to suppress those thoughts in others: <hi>That thence more than a circumspect eye was not to be advis'd.</hi> Some say, one <hi>John Cormack</hi> reveal'd to Sir <hi>William Cole,</hi> the 21. of <hi>October,</hi> That the <hi>Irish</hi> resolv'd to seize upon his Majesties Castle and City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> to murder his <hi>Lords Justices</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> there, and to seize upon all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Forts of the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Sir <hi>William Cole</hi> the same day sent the <hi>Lords Justices</hi> notice of. As others from an <hi>Ultogh</hi> would infer, That they had inform'd the State thereof, and that Sir <hi>Lucas Dillon</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon had been summon'd before them, and told, that they had heard something of him and others in <hi>Connaght,</hi> that made their fidelity suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which with a sober countenance, and solemn protestation, (Arts he had been long bred to) he soon wiped off. So (saith my Author) that <hi>for our sins our Counsellors were infatuated, and our Watch-men slumber'd.</hi> But Sir <hi>John Temple</hi> (whose Integrity over-weighs all Assertions to the contrary) testifies <note n="*" place="margin">In his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 28. of <hi>May,</hi> 1677.</note>, <hi>That those Letters and Informations never came to their knowledge, and that indeed they had never any certain notice of this general Conspiracy of the</hi> Irish, <hi>until the 22d. of</hi> October, <hi>late in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>J.

               </p>
               <p>At first, the Lord <hi>Parsons</hi> gave little belief to the Relation, in regard it came from an obscure Person, and one, as he conceiv'd, somewhat distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd (at that time) with drink, delivering his story besides in so broken a manner, that it scarce seem'd credible; whereupon his <hi>Lordship</hi> let him go, strictly charging him to return back the same evening, with what
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93738:29"/>
further discoveries he could make. Yet in the interim, the Lord <hi>Parsons</hi> (being touch'd with the Relation) repair'd (about Ten of the Clock at night) to the Lord <hi>Borlase,</hi> at <hi>Chichester-house,</hi> without the Town, and disclos'd to him what <hi>Owen O Conally</hi> had imparted; which made so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible an impression on his Colleague, as (the Discoverer being let go) <hi>He</hi> grew infinitely concern'd thereat, having none to punish, if the story should prove false; or means to learn more, were it true. In the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of which perplexity, <hi>Owen O Conally</hi> comes (or, as others write, was brought) where the Lords Justices were then met, sensible that his discovery was not thorowly believed, professing, <hi>that what-ever he had acquainted the Lord</hi> Parsons <hi>with,</hi> (touching the <hi>Conspiracy</hi>) <hi>was true; and could he but repose himself,</hi> (the effects of drink being still upon him) <hi>he should discover more.</hi> Whereupon he had the conveniency of a Bed. In the interim, the Lords Justices summon'd as many of the Council, as they could give notice to, to their assistance that night, at <hi>Chichester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Rotheram,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Meredith,</hi> Chancellor of the Exchequer, came immediately to them. They then with all diligence secur'd the Gates of the City, with such as they could most confide in, and strengthen'd the Warders of the Castle, (which were a few in-consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable men) with their Foot-Guard, usually attending their Persons, charging the Mayor and his Brethren to be watchful of all persons, that should walk the streets that night. However, many of the Conspirators escaped over the River, or at least lay conceal'd in Citizens houses, (a Receptacle too ready for most of them) and some of those who were brought before the Lords Justices and Council, as <hi>James Warren,</hi> (Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal</hi>'s Servant) and <hi>Paul O Neal,</hi> (an active Priest) though neither of them then were discover'd to be such, found means to get away; of which Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> bragg'd of afterwards; <hi>Paul O Neal</hi> having been a prime Instrument in the contrivance of the Rebellion: Whilst <hi>Hugh Oge, Mac-Mahon</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> (Grandson by his Mother to the Traitor <hi>Tir-Oen</hi>) a Gentleman of good Fortune in the County of <hi>Monaghon,</hi> who had serv'd as a Lieutenant Colonel in the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Quarters, was, after some little resistance, apprehended before day in his own Lodging over the Water near the Inns, and brought to <hi>Chichester-house,</hi> where, upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, he did, without much difficulty, confess the Plot, resolutely<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mac-Mahon</hi>'s Examination abbreviated.</note> telling them, <hi>That on that very day</hi> (it was now about 5 in the morning, the 23. of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1641.) <hi>that all the Forts and strong Places in</hi> Ireland <hi>would be taken; That he with the Lord</hi> Mac-Guire, Hugh Birn, <hi>Captain</hi> Brian O Neal, <hi>and several other</hi> Irish <hi>Gentlemen, were come up expresly to surprize the Castle of</hi> Dublin, <hi>and that twenty men out of each County of the Kingdom were to be here to joyn with them. That all the Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Kingdom (that were Papists) were engag'd in this Plot; That what was that day to be done in other parts of the Countrey, was so far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd by that time, as it was impossible for the wit of Man to prevent it.</hi> And withal told them, <hi>That it was true, they had him in their power, and might use him how they pleased; but he was sure he should be reveng'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before <hi>Mac-Mahon</hi> was apprehended, <hi>Owen O Conally</hi> having (on his repose) recovered himself, had his Examination taken in these words.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93738:29"/>
County of</hi> Monaghan, <hi>and to be with him on</hi> Wednesday <hi>or</hi> Thursday <hi>last. Whereupon he this Examinant came to</hi> Connaght <hi>on</hi> Wednesday <hi>night last, and finding the said</hi> Hugh <hi>come to</hi> Dublin, <hi>followed him thither; he came hither about six of the Clock this evening, and forthwith went to the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the said</hi> Hugh, <hi>to the house near the Boat in</hi> Oxmantown, <hi>and there he found the said</hi> Hugh, <hi>and came with the said</hi> Hugh <hi>into the Town, near the Pillory, to the Lodging of the Lord</hi> Mac-Guire, <hi>where they found not the Lord within, and there they drank a cup of Beer, and then went back again to the said</hi> Hugh's <hi>Lodging. He saith, That at the Lord</hi> Mac-Guire's <hi>Lodging, the said</hi> Hugh <hi>told him, That there were, and would be this night, great numbers of Noblemen and Gentlemen of the</hi> Irish <hi>Papists, from all parts of the Kingdom, in this Town, who, with himself, had determin'd to take the Castle of</hi> Dublin, <hi>and to possess themselves of all his Majesties Ammunition there to morrow morning, being</hi> Saturday: <hi>And that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended first to batter the Chimneys of the said Town; and if the Citizens would not yield, then to batter down the Houses, and so to cut off all the Protestants that would not joyn with them. He further saith, That he the said</hi> Hugh <hi>told him, That the</hi> Irish <hi>had prepared men in all parts of the Kingdom, to destroy all the</hi> English <hi>inhabiting there to morrow morning by Ten of the Clock; and that in all the Sea-Ports, and other Towns in the Kingdom, all the Protestants should be killed that night, and that all the Posts that could be could not prevent it. And further saith, That he moved the said</hi> Hugh <hi>to forbear executing of that business, and to discover it to the</hi> State, <hi>for saving of his own Estate; who said, He could not help it: But said, That they did owe their Allegiance to the King, and would pay him all his Rights; but that they did this for the Tyrannical Government that was over them, and to imitate</hi> Scotland, <hi>who had got a Priviledge by that course. And he further saith, That when he was with the said</hi> Hugh <hi>in his Lodging, the said</hi> Hugh <hi>swore, That he should not go out of his Lodging that night, but told him, he should go with him the next morning to the Castle; and said, if this matter were discovered,</hi> some body <hi>should die for it. Whereupon this Examinant feign'd some necessity for his Easment, went down out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and left his Sword in pawn, and the said</hi> Hugh <hi>sent his Man down with him; and when this Examinant came down into the Yard, and finding an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, he, this Examinant, leaped over a Wall, and two Pales, and so came to the Lord Justice</hi> Parsons.</p>

                                 <hi>Who being examined, saith, That about the time when Mr.</hi> John Bellew <hi>came out of</hi> England, <hi>with the Commission for the continuance of the present Parliament,</hi> Roger Moore, <hi>in the said</hi> Moore's <hi>Chamber, in the House of one</hi> Peter de Costres, <hi>of this City, acquainted him this Examinant,</hi> That if the <hi>Irish</hi> would rise, they might make their own Conditions, for the regaining of their own Lands, and freedom of their Religion. <hi>At which time the said</hi> Moore <hi>also acquainted him this</hi> Examinant, <hi>that he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with sundry in</hi> Leimster, <hi>who would be ready for that purpose; and withal told him this</hi> Examinant, <hi>that he was assured a good part of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght <hi>would do the like; and thereupon mov'd this</hi> Examinant <hi>to joyn like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with them, with all he could make; unto which motion he this</hi> Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>yielded.

And this</hi> Examinant <hi>further saith, That about</hi> May <hi>last, he this</hi> Examinant, Roger Moore, Philip O Relie, <hi>and</hi> Roger Mac-Guire (<hi>this</hi> Examinant's <hi>Brother</hi>) <hi>dispatched a Priest</hi> (<hi>one</hi> Toole O Conley) <hi>who lived in</hi> Leim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, <hi>unto</hi> Owen O Neal, <hi>into</hi> Flanders, <hi>to acquaint him with the</hi> Business, <hi>concerning the General Rebellion then in preparation; which said Priest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd about a month before the time appointed for execution thereof: And the Answer which the said Priest brought from the said</hi> Owen O Neal, <hi>was, That he would (within</hi> 15 <hi>days after the People were up) be with them, with his best Assistance and Arms: And it being demanded, Why he the said</hi> Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en <hi>would bring Arms, considering the Castle of</hi> Dublin <hi>was to be taken, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93738:32"/>
the Arms therein; this</hi> Examinant <hi>answer'd, That they so provided for Arms, that they might not want any in case they could not take the said Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, whereof they doubted.

The like was intended by the Conspirators about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Chichester</hi> Lord Deputy.</p>
               <p>The full determination of the Conspiracy we now speak of, was (as Dr. <hi>Jones,</hi> in his clear and excellent account he gives thereof, in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions took the <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1641.) design'd at the Abbey of <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifernan;</hi> (notwithstanding that <hi>Tyroen</hi>'s Son, who had long consulted it in <hi>Flanders,</hi> was suddenly strangled about that time in <hi>Bruxels,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Tirconnel</hi> drown'd near the time of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s death; prime Instruments in anvilling the Design abroad, and great hopes of countenancing it at home) where there was a Covent of <hi>Franciscans,</hi> (conven'd, it seems, on a pious intent) in the County of <hi>West-Meath,</hi> after the last Sessions of Parliament; where, amongst many other things there debated, the question was, <hi>What course should be taken with the</hi> English, <hi>and all others, that were found in the whole Kingdom, to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants? Some</hi> were onely for their Banishment, as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd the <hi>Mores</hi> out of <hi>Granado,</hi> with some of their Goods. <hi>Others</hi> were urgent, that all the Protestants should be universally cut off; the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s lenity being his and his Queen's act, not the advice of his Council, which (say they) afterwards cost Christendom dear, the <hi>Mores</hi> surviving to return with Swords in their hands and infest them, as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers</hi> and <hi>Sally</hi> doth at present. Those Disputes held long; at last, <hi>some</hi> lean'd a middle way, neither to dismiss or kill. And we find by the event, each of these thoughts had some execution; in some places <hi>All</hi> being generally put to the Sword, or a more deplorable end; in other places, Imprisonment (accompanied with the utmost extremity of that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) was the lot of many; and others (who being dismiss'd with their Goods) were afterwards stript of all, expos'd to Cold and Famine, worse than Sword or Halter.</p>
               <p>Thus having determin'd what to do with the Protestants, which (in general, too sadly succeeded to their wishes) they (according to the presumption of the event) consulted (in the next place) what course they would peruse in reference to their Government of the State.</p>
               <p>First, (they agreed) That their Loyalty to his Majesty should be still reserv'd, say they of the modest sort; but both his Revenues and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must be reduc'd to certain bounds: His Rents none other than the antient Reservations before the Plantations; and the Customs so order'd, as to them should be thought fitting.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the Government, such as would be esteem'd Loyal, would have it committed into the hands of two Lords Justices, one of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93738:33"/>
antient <hi>Irish</hi> Race, the other of the antient <hi>British</hi> Inhabitants in the Kingdom, provided that they be of the <hi>Romish</hi> Profession.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That a Parliament be forthwith call'd, consisting of whom they shall think fit to be admitted, wherein their own Religious Men shall be Assistants.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That <hi>Poining</hi>'s Act must be repeal'd, and <hi>Ireland</hi> declar'd to be a Kingdom independent on <hi>England,</hi> and without any reference to it in any case whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, All Acts prejudicial to the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion shall be abolish'd, and it to be Enacted, That there be none other Profession in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom but the <hi>Romish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, That onely the antient Nobility of the Kingdom shall stand; and of them, such as shall refuse to conform to the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, to be remov'd, and others put in their room. Howsoever, the present Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> must be put out, and another put in his place.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, All Plantation Lands to be recall'd, and the antient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors to be invested into their former Estates, with the Limitations in their Covenant express'd, That they had not formerly sold their Interests on valuable Considerations.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, That the respective Counties of the Kingdom be subdivided, and certain Bounds or Baronies assign'd to the Chief Septs, and other of the Nobility, who are to be answerable for the Government thereof: and that a standing Army may be still in being, the respective Governours are to keep a certain number of men to be ready at all Risings out (as they term it) they also being to build and maintain certain Fortresses, in places most convenient within their Precincts: And that these Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours be of absolute Power, onely responsible to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Lastly, For maintaining a Correspondency with other Nations, and for securing the Coasts, that also they may be render'd considerable to others, a Navy of a certain number of Ships is to be maintain'd; that to this end, five Houses are to be appointed, one in each Province, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting <hi>Meath</hi> for one of them) that to these Houses shall be allotted an Annual Pension of certain thousands of Pounds, to be made up of part of the Lands appropriate to Abbeys; and a further Contribution to be rais'd in the respective Provinces to that end: That these Houses are to be assign'd to a certain order of Knights, answerable to that of <hi>Malta,</hi> who are to be Sea-men. And to maintain this Fleet, that all Prizes are to be apportion'd, some part for a Common Bank, the rest to be divided; to which purpose, the selling of Woods serviceable for this use is forbidden. The House for this purpose to be assign'd to the Province of <hi>Leimster,</hi> is <hi>Kilmainham,</hi> or rather <hi>Howth,</hi> (the Lord of <hi>Howth</hi> being otherwise to be accommodated, provided he joyn with them) that place being esteem'd most convenient in respect of situation, which they have small grounds to hope for.</p>
               <p>For the effecting of which, they consider'd, that the Forces of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would easily amount to two hundred thousand able men, wanting onely Commanders; which (as I have already took notice of) might be supplied from <hi>O-Neals</hi> Regiment in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and other places, breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the <hi>Irish</hi> in Arms and Rebellion. And for Money, (the other Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new of War) they were resolv'd not to want it, if it could be rais'd-either from Tenant, or the Farmers of the Customs, who (having it then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) were to bring it to their respective Banks. So as nothing was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93738:33"/>
omitted, which rationally might further their design: Which, after the State, by Proclamation, had made known, and many (on suspicion) were daily seiz'd on, <hi>Certainties of its success</hi> were hourly brought to the State: That night the Lord <hi>Blany</hi> brought the ill news, of the Rebels seising upon <hi>Castle Blany</hi> in the County of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> and his Wife, and Children, and Servants; as also of the surprisal of <hi>Carrick Mac-ross,</hi> a House of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s, and Sir <hi>Henry Spotswood</hi>'s in the same Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, burning divers Villages, robbing and spoiling many <hi>English,</hi> none but Protestants. On <hi>Sunday,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Tirringham</hi> gave intelligence, that the <hi>Irish</hi> in <hi>Newry</hi> had broken up the King's Store of Arms, and had seiz'd upon them and the Ammunition there, listing themselves under the command of Sir <hi>Con Mac-Gennis</hi> Knight, and one <hi>Creely</hi> a Monk. Thus almost every hour some (like <hi>Job</hi>'s Messengers) hasted to the State, as preserv'd onely to acquaint them of the disasters of their Relations, and the sufferings of the Protestants: of which, with all circumstances to it, the Lords Justices and Council gave his Majesty an account by Sir <hi>Henry Spotswood,</hi> (being then in <hi>Scotland</hi>) and sent <hi>Owen O Conally</hi> with Letters, dated the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>John Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>'s History of the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>p.</hi> 28.</note>, the effect of which Letter you may see in its proper place. In the interim, the State being from all parts terrifi'd with the insolencies of the Rebels, they scarce knew how to steer their course, no Money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Treasury, and the main part of the Citizens being justly sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, for that being mov'd to advance Money on the occasion, (will Posterity believe it) <hi>their whole Community</hi> would not reach 50 <hi>l.</hi> And such as had escaped the violence of the Rebels, having nothing but their Persons for a prey, could contribute little, many of which were so fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what they had seen and suffered, that, like inanimate Bodies, they appear'd sensless and stupid. However, the Lords Justices and Council having secur'd the Castle by a Company of Foot, under the command of Sir <hi>Francis Willoughby,</hi> (one of the Privy Council) a known and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd Soldier, and setled Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> (also of the Privy Council) in the Government of the City, wherein (as in other Services) he proved afterwards signally eminent and noble. They advertis'd the Earl of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> (whom the Rebels boasted they had made of their Party) then at his House at <hi>Carrick,</hi> of what had hitherto happen'd, desiring him to repair to <hi>Dublin</hi> with his Troop, which he accordingly observ'd about the beginning of <hi>November.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> the <hi>Lords Justices and Council</hi> sent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions to the Lords Viscounts of <hi>Clandeboys,</hi> and of the <hi>Ardes,</hi> to raise the <hi>Scots</hi> in the Northern Parts; they also writ to Sir <hi>William</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Stewart,</hi> with other Gentlemen of Quality in the North, <hi>Giving them power to prosecute the Rebels with Fire and Sword; yet so, as to res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue such as should submit to his Majesties Grace and Mercy; signifying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, That although by the said Commission they gave them full power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, yet they did then let them know, that for those who were chief among the Rebels, and Ring-Leaders of the rest to disobedience, that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged them less worthy of favour than the others whom they had mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided: And therefore for those principal Persons, they required them to take care not to be too forward (without first consulting the Counsel-board) in proffering or promising mercy to those, unless they the said Commissioners saw it of great and unavoidable necessity.</hi> They likewise writ to the Lords Presidents of <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Connaght,</hi> advising them to be upon their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93738:34"/>
Guards: And that several of the Catholick Communion might not say, but that they also were confided in, the Lords Justices (who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to continue all proofs imaginable of their confidence in them) gave in <hi>November</hi> several Commissions of Government to the Lord <hi>Gormanston</hi>
                  <note place="margin">As in Sir <hi>J.

And because the Times required something extraordinary, beyond the course of Common-Law, the Lords Justices and Councel gave several Commissions of Martial-Law, to the<note place="margin">Commissions of Martial-Law granted to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the prime <hi>Irish.</hi>

But in the interim the Magistrates of the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> perceiving great numbers of Strangers to come to Town from several Parts, (lingring in the Suburbs and Fields, to the terror of the Inhabitants) they repair'd to the Councel Board with much fear and astonishment, beseeching the Lords Justices and Councel to inhibit the same, lest the concourse of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">Strangers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hited (by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation) the City.</note> (promiscuously gathering in such a crowd) might threaten the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the City.

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Walsh, 121.</note>.

               <p>And that none ignorantly involv'd in so detestable a Guilt (as the publick Conspiracy) might suffer, the State yet further to manifest their desire, of reducing all into a general obedience, (having never drawn his Majesty's Sword upon jealousies or presumptions, till the highest Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities and unparallel'd Outrages compell'd them thereunto) publisht, the first of <hi>November,</hi> a Proclamation, declaring, That all in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Meath, Westmeath, Lowth,</hi> and <hi>Longford,</hi> being no Free-holders, nor now in prison, who had taken any Goods from his Majesty's faithful Subjects, not having shed blood in the Action, and came in within ten days after this Proclamation, should be receiv'd to his Majesty's mercy, and no further prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Which (as others of the like nature) little prevail'd to un-deceive the Rebels, they being before link'd in an un-dissolvible tye of Animosity and Superstition. Thus every day (notwithstanding that the Conspiracy was discovered, and all endeavours used to reclaim them) the <hi>Irish</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their Massacres and Rebellion, though they did not (after the knowledge of the detection of their Plot) execute so generally their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany with such open slaughters and cruelties, as they did at first; but stripping, wounding, and turning the <hi>English</hi> and Protestants out of their Houses, they sent them naked and desolate (in miserable weather) to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where their numbers (at length) grew so burdensom, as though Thousands were ship'd away soon after they arriv'd there, and such as could serve in the Army were daily in-listed, yet they brought so great an extremity, and want of all provisions to <hi>Dublin,</hi> as the Inhabitants were reduced to great exigencies, inasmuch as the <hi>mercies</hi> of the Rebels were <hi>extream cruelty,</hi> Thousands of the dispoiled <hi>English</hi> dying afterwards by lingring Diseases, contracted by the inhumane and cruel usage of their Enemies.</p>
               <p>Miseries still increasing, the <hi>Lords Justices and Councel</hi> sent a second Dispatch to the King, the 5th. of <hi>November,</hi> then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> directing also their Letters to his Privy Councel in <hi>England,</hi> there being an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessity to invoke all Powers, that might stand with his Majesty's Honour. They then (and not before) directed Letters to the Speakers of both Houses of Parliament, (inclosing in those they writ to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty) what they had signified by Letters to the Lords of the Councel, or to the Speakers of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

               <p>And now by reason that more People flock'd to the City, and that the Lords Justices and Council had frequent intelligence from several parts, of the insolent proceedings of the Rebels against the British and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in the Borders of the <hi>Pale,</hi> as well as the adjacent Counties, they (the xi. of <hi>November</hi>) prohibited the access of unnecessary Persons, not<note place="margin">The States Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation against unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Persons flocking to the City.

               <p>However there were some (venom'd with the vigilancy of the State) who endeavour'd to cast a blemish on this Proclamation, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it appear'd to be his Majesties sense in his Letters to the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices in <hi>December</hi> following.

As by another Proclamation the same <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> the <hi>Lords Justices and Council</hi> had adjourn'd <hi>Michaelmass-Term, To avoid, in that exigency, those great and manifold perils and dangers, that might have ensu'd to the State by such concourse of People, out of all the parts of the Kingdom, unto the City of</hi> Dublin, <hi>as the holding of the Term would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily require, by reason of the late most disloyal and detestable Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, plotted by a multitude of evil-affected</hi> meer Irish Papists. But however, the Parliament met. And here it was visible, that more were tainted with the Infection, than appear'd in Rebellion. Lord! what artifice? what cunning? what varnish was put upon all the Rebels actions and cruelties? Those who seem'd to be most affected with the Insurrection, cover'd it with such a vail, treated of it so nicely, with such tenderness, as if they themselves (being all indeed of the Conspiracy) had been to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate immediately of the Punishment, as well as they were clandestinely involved in the Plot; <hi>By always contesting, that they might not be called Traitors and Rebels, being privy to what themselves had formerly (with these Rebels) contrived to be done.</hi> And fearing it might move the Rebels to recriminate, writes a most judicious Instrument of State <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Irish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd. <hi>p.</hi> 65.</note>, That the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of discontented Gentlemen was the worst that could be wrung from them; till <hi>One,</hi> heartily detesting the Fig-leaves thrown over this nakedness, told the <hi>Speaker, That though he had not arriv'd at that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency of years, as that his words might challenge there an audience;</hi> Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom; <hi>yet he could not but observe many passages in that Assembly, too like</hi> Catilines <hi>in the Senate; and therefore moved, that it might not be told in that House, or publish'd at</hi> Askelon, <hi>that so general a Revolt (accompani'd with such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and barbarous circumstances) should be took notice of with a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable expression than</hi> Treason <hi>and</hi> Rebellion. <hi>He added further, That he did not know, but that that was the season wherein they were cast on their trial, whether Allegiance or Rebellion, God or the Pope were to be own'd. And that as to any thing that might soften the Rebels, he conceiv'd they were harden'd with so much villany, that they esteem'd all things justifiable that were attainable.</hi> Iram atque animos à crimine sumunt. <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was fit that that House should act as sensible of the Rebels cruelties, and trust God to vindicate his and his Peoples Cause.</hi> Upon which, and other Arguments, (too shameful for them to palliate) the Parliament dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their Resentment in these words.

               <p>Upon the information of which, especially that there should be a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Popish Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it was resolv'd on the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1641. upon solemn Debate by the Lords and Commons in the Parliament of <hi>England, That they would never give consent to any To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of the Popish Religion in</hi> Ireland, <hi>or in any other his Majesties Dominions.</hi> Which Vote hath been since adjudged a main motive for making the War a cause of Religion, consequently of calling in Foreign Princes to their aid and assistance; which before ever this Vote past, to ground the least pretence thereupon, the <hi>Irish</hi> made Religion the principal end of their Insurrection; and this Proposition was (as you see) one of the first to be demanded, which gave the Parliament a cause for the Vote fore-mention'd. In pursuance of which, Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyard</hi> (whom the cause ever made eloquent) thus delivered his sense.

Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi>'s Speech in defence of Religion.</note> at this time come in question; but now it is brought on the Stage, I am brought to the Stake. When Religion is so nearly concern'd, I love not to take any Civil or Politick respects into consideration: Reason of State hath almost eaten up all the Laws and Religion of Christendom.</p>
                              <p>I have often heard it discours'd, whether we should make Religion an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of any of our undertakings abroad, wherein the wiser sort have been very nice and tender, believing, that the over-number of Papists would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm us; yet I have been long of opinion, that our Attempts and Assistances have so often miscarri'd, because we have not boldly and publickly avowed our Religion. It may be, God thinks we are too many, who can conquer as well with few as with many. Shall the <hi>Irish</hi> now make their Religion the cause of their Rebellion, and shall we be asham'd or afraid to maintain our Religion, in reducing them to their Duty and Obedience? God will not honour them who do not honour him. Let us remember that expostulation in the <hi>Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Why transgress ye the commandments of God, so that ye cannot prosper?</hi> This is a great transgression, to shrink from God in his truth.</p>
                              <p>When we deny the <hi>Irish</hi> a Toleration, we do not withdraw the eases and favours they have heretofore enjoy'd; Greater, I am sure, than they would afford us, if we were in their power. Wherefore, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> let us uphold our Religion, and trust God with the success.</p>

The Lord <hi>Dillon</hi> (upon his coming into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) was seiz'd on by the Parliament, and his Papers rifled, (according to a Vote in Parliament the <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>November</hi>) which (by the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates) was look'd upon as a heinous crime, though the discovery of the Concerns in <hi>Ireland</hi> (as well as the management of the War) were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to the <hi>English</hi> Parliament, (so no crime in them.) But he escaped from them at last, and went to the King; having in his private Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions orders to move, that no Forces might be sent over out of <hi>England,</hi> but that the whole work might be left to the Remonstrants, and that they would then undertake to suppress the Rebels themselves.</p>
               <p>In the interim, we must not omit, that some of both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">The Parliament Prorogued.</note> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> lately met, but now Prorogu'd, were appointed to treat with the Rebels; <hi>So they receiv'd their Instructions from the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, who were to impower them under the great Seal thereunto.</hi> But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of any happy effects thereon, the Rebels were so puffed up with their Victories over the poor, surpriz'd, unresisting, innocent <hi>English,</hi> as they barbarously tore the Order of Parliament, together with the Letter sent unto them, promising themselves success and Dominion in all their Attempts.</p>

                              <p>THE Lords and Commons in this present Parliament, being advertis'd of the dangerous Conspiracy and Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and wicked Instigations of <hi>Romish</hi> Priests and Jesuits, for the bloody massacre and destruction of all Protestants living there, and other his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's loyal Subjects of <hi>English</hi> blood, though of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, being ancient Inhabitants within several Counties, and Parts of that Realm, who have always in former Rebellions, given testimony of their fidelity to this Crown. And for the utter depriving of his Royal Majesty, and the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> from the Government of that Kingdom, (under pretence of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the Popish Religion) have thereupon taken into their serious Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, how those mischievous Attempts might be most speedily and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually prevented, wherein the Honour, Safety and Interest of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are most nearly and fully concern'd. Wherefore they do hereby declare, That they do intend to serve his Majesty with their Lives and Fortunes, for the suppressing of this wicked Rebellion, in such way as shall be thought most effectual by the Wisdom and Authority of the Parliament: And thereupon have order'd and provided for a present Supply of Money, and raising the number of 6000 Foot and 2000 Horse, to be sent from <hi>England,</hi> being the full proportion desired by the Lords Justices, and his Majesty's Council resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in that Kingdom, with a resolution to add such further Succours, as the necessity of those Affairs shall require. They have also resolv'd for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding Arms and Ammunition, not only for those Men, but likewise for his Majesty's faithful Subjects of that Kingdom, with store of Victuals, and other Necessaries, as there shall be occasion. And that these Provisions may more conveniently be transported thither, they have appointed three several Ports of this Kingdom, that is to say, <hi>Bristol, West-Chester,</hi> and another in <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> where the Magazines and Store-houses shall be kept, for the supply of the several Parts of <hi>Ireland.</hi> They have likewise resolv'd to be humble Mediators to his most Excellent Majesty, for the encouragement of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

or <hi>Irish,</hi> who shall upon their own charges raise any number of Horse or Foot, for his Service against the Rebels, that they shall be honourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with Lands of Inheritance in <hi>Ireland,</hi> according to their merit. And for the better inducing of the Rebels to repent of their wicked Attempts, they do hereby commend it to the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, to the Deputy, or Lords Justices there, according to the power of the Commission granted to them in that behalf, to bestow his Majesty's gracious Pardon to all such, as within a convenient time (to be declar'd by the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or in his absence, by the Lord Deputy, or Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices there, according to the power of the Commission) shall return to their due obedience, the greatest part whereof they conceive to have been seduced on false grounds, by the cunning and subtil practices of some of the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Rebels, enemies to this State, and to the Reformed Religion; and likewise to bestow such rewards as shall be thought fit, and publisht by the said Lord Lieutenant, Lord Deputy, or Lords Justices and Council there, upon all those who shall arrest the Persons, or bring in the heads of such Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as shall be personally nam'd in any Proclamation publisht by the State there. And they do hereby exhort and require all his Majesty's loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, both in this and in that Kingdom, to remember their duty and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God and his Religion, and the great and eminent danger which will befal this whole Kingdom in general, and themselves in particular, if this abominable Treason be not timely supprest, and therefore with all readiness, bounty, and chearfulness, to confer their assistance in their Persons, or Estates, to this so important and necessary Service, for the common Good of all.</p>

               <p>And that the Army might be led by an honourable and promising Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the Lord Lieutenant (being not permitted to come over speedily himself) made the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> Lieutenant-General of the Army, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of afterwards by the King, as one who (by his Relation, Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Quality) was pitch'd on as the fittest Person for that imployment, of whose affection to the Protestant Religion, and his Majesty's Service, his Majesty had great cause to be assured <note n="*" place="margin">As in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Reply to the House of Commons Answer, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Licences to Persons to go into <hi>Ireland,</hi> is at large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed upon Mr. <hi>Pym</hi>'s Speech, at a Conference with the Lords, the 25th. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1641. therein affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That since the stop upon the Ports, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all <hi>Irish</hi> Papists, by both Houses, many of the chief Commanders (then in the Head of the Rebels) had been suffer'd to pass, by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Warrant; sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested in his Answer.

               <p>Soon after his settlement in that Place, he had notice from Sir <hi>Hen.

               <p>This Siege of <hi>Mellifont</hi> somewhat retarded the Rebels unanimous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to <hi>Tredath;</hi> upon which the Lords Justices forthwith design'd 600 Foot and a Troop of Horse, for the further strengthning of that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.

               <p>Now the <hi>State</hi> finding the Storm to increase, and that (though they had some glimmerings of comfort by the success of their Forces in <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe,</hi> under Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi>) the Rebellion grew general, the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices and Council publish'd a Proclamation the 27th. of <hi>November, for a Weekly Fast every Friday, to be devoutly and piously observed and solemnized, in and through the whole City of</hi> Dublin, <hi>and the Suburbs thereof;</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humbled for their sins, the affliction might be remov'd.</p>
               <p>The 28th. of <hi>November,</hi> the <hi>State</hi> had an Account of Sir <hi>Phelim O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Neal</hi>'s and Sir <hi>Con.

               <p>Yet notwithstanding his <hi>Majesty,</hi> the <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi>'s appearing thus incens'd against the Rebellion, (all fair means of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being remov'd, and a desire of its suppression endeavour'd) the <hi>Irish</hi> finding as yet no considerable relief sent to the <hi>English,</hi> (and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly flush'd with the defeat of those commanded to re-enforce the Garrison of <hi>Tredath</hi>) they unanimously drew down their Northern For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to infest that Town.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93738:40"/>
That whosoever shall deny to joyn with them, or refuse to assist them therein, they would account him as an enemy, and to the utmost of their power labour his destruction. And this</hi> Examinate <hi>saith, That after the Agreement made as aforesaid, there issued another Warrant to the</hi> She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff <hi>of the County of</hi> Meath, <hi>to be at the Hill of</hi> Taragh, <hi>about a week after; and accordingly there met at the same place the Earl of</hi> Fingal, <hi>the Lord</hi> Gormanston, <hi>and the rest of the Lords and Gentry aforenam'd, together with Sir</hi> Thomas Nugent, <hi>and</hi> Nicholas Plunket <hi>the Lawyer,</hi> Birford <hi>the Lawyer, and a multitude of others. And the work of that day was first, to make Answer to a Summons made by the State, for the calling of the Lords of the</hi> Pale <hi>to</hi> Dublin; <hi>which Answer was brought ready drawn by the Lord</hi> Gormanston, <hi>and presented by his Lordship; and being perused by the said Council at Law, was signed by the Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we will add (passing by many other testimonies of their Conjunctions) that which is confirm'd by a very credible Person, of Colonel <hi>Richard Plunket</hi> of <hi>Dunsaghly,</hi> in the County of <hi>Dublin,</hi> within the Pale, (one destin'd for the taking of the Castle of <hi>Dublin</hi>) who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd openly, <hi>That he had a Contract under the hands of all the Lords of</hi> Ireland (that were Catholicks) <hi>to stand firm in this Insurrection;</hi> most of their actions confirming his words.

               <p>Whereupon the Lords Justices found it absolutely necessary, that some Forces should be sent against them at <hi>Clantarf;</hi> which Forces were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Sir <hi>Charles Coote,</hi> the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Decemb.</hi> who burnt the Village, destroy'd their Boats, and excellently well quitted the service injoyn'd him, clearing that place of Piracy and Rebels: Though in the interim, <hi>Nettervile</hi> (being frighted from <hi>Santry</hi>) lay with near 2000 men at <hi>Swoards,</hi> and possess'd himself of the Castle of <hi>Artain,</hi> and some other places, within two miles of <hi>Dublin.</hi> On the West side of which, at <hi>Tassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, Rath-Coole, Castle-Lyons,</hi> and other Villages, there lay 2000 more of the Rebels out of the Counties of <hi>Katerlagh, Kings County,</hi> and <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare,</hi> under the command of <hi>Roger Moore,</hi> and <hi>Sutton Eustace</hi> of <hi>Castle-Martin,</hi> and <hi>others.</hi> The <hi>Clandonells, Birns,</hi> and <hi>Tooles fr<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>And that nothing may be omitted on my Part, I must here take notice of the Bill for pressing of Souldiers, now depending among you, my Lords, concerning which I declare, that in case
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93738:42"/>
it comes so to me, as it may not infringe or diminish my Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, I will pass it. And farther, seeing there is a Dispute rais'd (I being little beholding to him whosoever at this time began it) concerning the bounds of this ancient and undoubted Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to avoid further Debate at this time. I offer that the Bill may pass with a <hi>Salvo Jure,</hi> both for King and People, leaving such Debates to a time that may better bear them. If this be not accepted, the fault is not mine that this Bill pass not, but theirs that refuse so fair an offer.</p>
                              <p>To conclude, I conjure you by all that is or can be dear to you or me, that laying away all Disputes, you go on chearfully and speedily for the reducing of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <p>A Charm (one should think) sufficiently powerful: Yet the Lords and Commons in Parliament, from his Majesty's Speech took great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, suffering the Supplies of <hi>Ireland</hi> to be retarded, <hi>demanding of the King the Names of those, who had counsell'd Him to take notice of any Debate in the House, before it was from'd into a Bill;</hi> whence began the Cry against evil Counsellors, afterwards the pretext of the Misery that ensued. Some Forces indeed the <hi>Parliament</hi> had sent to the Sea-side, and others were on their March, yet Winds and Tides, Votes and Councels, did not equally agree, so as the Exigences (by this means) that the State of <hi>Ireland</hi> was cast upon, almost split them. Whereupon the Lords Justices and Council publisht a Proclamation, dated the 28th. of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1641. <hi>Requiring all Persons, other than such as had necessary Causes to</hi> Dublin, <hi>such as the Lords Justices, the Lieutenant-General of the Army, or the Governour of his Majesty's Forces in the City of</hi> Dublin, <hi>should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, or other than such as should bring Provision to the City to be sold, should forbear coming to the City or Suburbs thereof, upon pain of Death.</hi> Which was done in time of high necessity, Provision being scarce, and few repairing to the City but what were Spies and Traitors.</p>
               <p>And because what his <hi>Majesty</hi> had propos'd (before-mention'd) for the service of <hi>Ireland,</hi> seem'd to have little effect, he again sends a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the Lords House by the Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> the 28th. of <hi>December: That being sensible of the Miseries of</hi> Ireland <hi>(the Succours for which went on slowly) he offer'd to raise</hi> 10000 <hi>Voluntiers, if the Commons would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to pay them:</hi> A Proposition rather heard than consented to.</p>
               <p>About this time Sir <hi>Thomas Carey</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cale</hi> (a Sorbonist) offer'd from the Rebels these Propositions, to the Council Board, for a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That there should be a Toleration of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That Popish Officers, as well as Protestant, should be admitted to all Employments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the Wrongs of Plantations should be repair'd, since</hi> 1610.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That there should be a Protlamation to take off the File, the Title of Rebels and Traitors.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:93738:43"/>All which pass'd somewhat currantly, till <hi>One</hi> (then being absent through sickness) hearing thereof, repair'd to the Council Board, though at that time much indispos'd, and upon strong Arguments (Arguments that would admit of no Sophistry) stop'd the proceeding of so dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Motion; so early did some endeavour <hi>to</hi> force on the <hi>State,</hi> a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of complying with the insolent Demands of the Rebels, by this faithful Minister of State confidently rejected. And here that you may see, what the Rebels afterwards thought the only means to reduce <hi>Ireland</hi> into Peace and Quietness, we shall here present you with their Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, methodically digested.

               <p>And that nothing irregular might justly be imputed to the State, who studied the preservation of his Majesties Subjects; or <hi>those</hi> indeed who but pretended (without appearance to the contrary) a submission to his Ministers, the <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1641. they publish'd a severe Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against Pillagers, and Voluntiers not listed under some Colonel or Commander: So early was the vigilancy of the State in what might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their Integrity and Repute: Which some finding contrary to their envious Licentiousness, wanted not boldness to encourage the Soldiers to a return for <hi>England.</hi> Which the Lords Justices and Council having notice of, publish'd this Proclamation.

                  <hi>will have it that the</hi> Gentlemen at Westminster, <hi>instead of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the</hi> Irish <hi>speedily by Arms, made an Ordinance wholly to extirpate them, whereby the</hi> Irish <hi>extirpated most part of the Protestant Colonies, killing Man, Woman, and Child, with most horrible Barbarousness:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is apparent that the greatest, and most horrid Massacres, were acted before the Parliament could possibly know there was a Rebellion, for after that the Plot was detected, the Rebels somewhat slackned their first Cruelties: though then they proclaim'd, <hi>That if any</hi> Irish <hi>should har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or relieve, any</hi> English <hi>suffer'd to escape, them with their lives, that it should be penal, even to death, to such</hi> Irish; So that though they put not those <hi>English</hi> actually to the Sword, yet by that Design, they cut them off more cruelly: It being a certain truth (not subject to the evasion of the Sophister) that in all the four Provinces, the horrid cruelties used towards the <hi>British,</hi> either in their bloody Massacres, or merciless dispoiling, stripping, and extirpation of them, were generally acted in most parts of the Kingdom, before they could gather themselves together, to make any considerable resistance against their fury, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the State had assembled their Forces, or were enabled by the power of his Majesties Arms, to make any inroads into the Countreys possessed by the Rebels: A circumstance, which totally destroyeth all those vain pretences, and fond recriminations, which they have since most falsly taken up to palliate this their most abominable Rebellion, or actings thereupon; Besides, in the first Order of the Lords Commons, in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England,</hi> touching this Concern, for the better inducing of the Rebels to repent of their wicked Attempts, they did thereby commend it to the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or in his absence to the Lord Deputy, or Lords Justices there, according to the power of the Commission granted them in that behalf, <hi>To bestow his Majesties gracious Pardon to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93738:45"/>
all such as within a convenient time (to be declared by any of the said Magistrates) should return to their due obedience:</hi> Which rule the Lords Justices in all Commissions, either to Officers, or Marshals, they had also before observed, that if (amongst them) there had been any relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they might have experienc'd the mercy of the State.</p>
               <p>And thus much may be said even for the Parliament, that after the expence of much blood and treasure, for suppression of the horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when they had brought that Affair to such an issue, as that a total Reducement, and settlement of the Nation was effected, whereby they came to divide the Rebels Estates; They manifested, <hi>that it was not the Parliaments intentions, to extirpate that whole Nation, but</hi>

               <p>It is indeed Enacted, in the Acts of subscriptions for <hi>Ireland, that every Person who shall make, enter into, or take any Compact, Bond, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Oath, promise, or agreement, to introduce, or bring into the said Realm of</hi> Ireland, <hi>the authority of the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>in any case whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or to maintain, or defend, the same, shall forfeit his Lands, and Goods, as in case of Rebellion:</hi> Before which there was no pretence (some thought) to make the War a matter of Religion, Whereas, I do not conceive, that that Clause is any more then what was in several Acts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, as <hi>Anno</hi> 28. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Capite</hi> 13. <hi>Anno</hi> 2. <hi>Eliz.

               <p>Now besides other miseries (which aggravated the unhappiness of the State at that time) there flocked to the City (from all Parts) such as having escaped the fury of the Rebels, sheltered themselves there, of which (by reason of the diseases they had contracted by their journey, and ill usage) there died many, else prov'd a burthen to the City; Which the Confederates of the <hi>Pale</hi> would have the World believe, was mercy and Signal Humanity in them, <hi>not to have imbrued their hands in the blood of any</hi> British <hi>Protestants,</hi> When as the lingring deaths, and Exigences these were put to, exceeded any death which at once might have been inflicted: though after the Siege of <hi>Tredath,</hi> that the old <hi>English</hi> Papists of the <hi>Pale,</hi> were driven into <hi>Ulster,</hi> they (as a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious act) vaunted that they had killed more <hi>English</hi> and Protestants in <hi>Fingall,</hi> then were killed in many other Counties; for the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of whose miseries, and what besides others had suffered by the Rebels, the Lords Justices authorised several Commissioners to <hi>state</hi> their Case, and the state of the deplorable <hi>English,</hi> by two Commissions, the one bearing date the 23d. of <hi>December,</hi> the other the 18th. of <hi>January,</hi> both in the 17th. year of his Majesties Reign, whereby the Murders, Losses, and Cruelties, committed upon the <hi>English</hi> and Protestants, were disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered on Oath, and presented in a Remonstrance by the Dispoil'd Clergy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Honourable House of Commons in <hi>England;</hi> And lest

the Remonstrance should seem the act of a few Persons (highly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed in their own Concerns) it was accompanied with a Letter from the Lords Justices, and Council, dated at <hi>Dublin</hi> the 7th. of <hi>March,</hi> 1641. to the Speaker of the said House of Commons; the Remonstrance shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>such depredations of Goods, such cruelties exercis'd on the Persons and Lives of the loyal Subjects, such wasting, and defacing of all monuments of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, with such Prophanation of Holy Places, and Religion, that by the most barbarous, and heathenish Nations, the like could not in any Age be found to be perpetrated:</hi> of which I might say more, having not yet forgot the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties legible in most Noble, and antient Families; But the day would fail us, should we sum up what is in the Clergies Remonstrance, Printed at <hi>London,</hi> 1642. briefly mention'd, to which, and the History of the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion, 1646. from p. 84. to 136, we must refer you, that the Proofs of all may be before your eyes; May they be writ on our Posts of our houses, and our Gates? that they may be looked upon, and remembred for ever; <hi>what</hi> Amalek <hi>did, when we were faint, and weary, and he feared not God!</hi>

I further swear, that I will bear Faith and Allegiance to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord King <hi>Charles,</hi> his Heirs and Successors, and that I will defend Him and Them, as far as I may, with my Life, Power and Estate, against all such Persons as shall attempt any thing against their Royal Persons, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Estates, and Dignities, and against all such as shall directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly endeavour to suppress their Royal Prerogatives, or do any Act or Acts contrary to Regal Government; as also the Power and Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the lawful Rights and Priviledges of the Subjects, and every Person that makes this Vow, Oath and Protestation, in whatsoever he shall do, in the lawful pursuance of the same. And to my Power, as far as I may, I will oppose, and by all means and ways endeavour to bring to condign punishment, even to the loss of Life, Liberty, and Estate, all such as shall, either by Force, Practice, Counsels, Plots, Conspiracies, or otherwise, do or attempt any thing to the contrary of any Article, Clause, or any thing in this present Vow, Oath, or Protestation, contain'd.</p>

               <p>This is the Oath the Confederates thought so loyal, so worthy their owning; whereas never any thing was more pernicious, more destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to his Majesty, and his Protestant Subjects, the close of it (after all their insinuating and fair pretensions of Faith and Allegiance to their Soveraign, his Heirs and lawful Successors) <hi>vowing to bring to condign punishment, all that should attempt any thing to the contrary of any Article therein;</hi> whereas the first thing (they insist on in this Vow) is <hi>the free exercise of the Catholick Roman Religion,</hi> which if the King shall not admit of, He is (by the issue of this Vow and Protestation) to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, <hi>all being to be oppos'd, that shall be against, do, or attempt any thing to the contrary of any Article, Clause, or any thing in this present Vow, Oath, or Protestation, contain'd.</hi> And if in a more favourable sence this were not (as to his Majesty) to be so interpreted, yet his Protestant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were doubtless to be fallen upon with fire and sword, resisting the Ends the Rebels propos'd to themselves by this Oath, and without which no Peace was to be accepted. How loyal and acceptable this could be to a Protestant Prince (who in testimony of his Faith laid down his life) is legible without Spectacles: so that in conclusion, this Oath could really
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93738:48"/>
deceive none, but those, who seeing will not see, and hearing will not understand.</p>
               <p>Thus their strength (notwithstanding whatsoever his Majesty had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd<note place="margin">The Rebels, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, grew more united.</note> in his Proclamation) by endeavouring to break it, was united; their Armies were now formed, the most considerable Persons amongst them had openly declared themselves, and the meanest of their Souldiers were flesht in the slaughter of the <hi>English;</hi> they had likewise almost all their Goods in their possession, and the strongest Places of the Kingdom with the whole Countrey at their Devotion; so as they now counted themselves powerful enough to go through with the Work, and resolv'd to expel all the <hi>British</hi> and Protestants out of the Kingdom, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves absolute Masters, or there to die ingloriously as Traitors and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers; which is fallen to their lot; for few of those inhumane Butchers have come with dry throats to their Graves, there being no more ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dispensation to be observ'd in the Revolutions of things here below, than returns of blood for blood, their blood being violently to be poured forth, who have maliciously contrived, or wantonly delighted, in the slaughter of others, which will appear by the sequel of the Story.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though</hi> the Polititian's Catechism <note n="*" place="margin">The Insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titian's Catech. briefly reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, and what the <hi>English</hi> are charged with.</note> (a Piece of as much Venom as Art or Malice can connect) would insinuate, that the Murthers and Massacres done in <hi>Ireland</hi> by Protestants, far exceeded without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son those committed by Catholicks, as well in respect of brutishness as numerousness; I may admit, that many things (contrary to the Law of Arms and Christianity) during the Rebellion, were severely commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>English:</hi> But then it must be considered, That whatsoever was rashly done by them, was either acted in open Hostility, or had the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and memory of former Villanies first commenc'd on their Relations, Friends, or Countreymen, without the least provocation for their ground, instigating them thereunto. Inasmuch as <hi>Mulmore O-Relie, O-Sule-van,</hi> and others, being at a Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> immediately after the King's happy <hi>Restauration,</hi> a Colonel (a Person of great Ingenuity and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Vertue, who had serv'd faithfully against the <hi>Irish</hi>) coming into their company, was acquainted by them, that they were met together, to draw up a Remonstrance of the Cruelties, the <hi>English</hi> Army had offer'd to the <hi>Irish,</hi> which (say they) indeed nothing concern'd him, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a noble and generous Enemy. Upon which he advis'd them to desist, in that they might be certain to have an Answer much to their dis-advantage, considering, that if any Violencies or Irregularities were offer'd, they might thank themselves, in respect that after Castles, or any Places, were delivered up upon Composition, it was a usual Custom with them to spoil the Meal and Food, which they should have left entire, and to have wet the Powder, as also to have made the Guns un-service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; all which were violations of Articles no ways justifiable, and might require a severe return: Upon which, they being confounded, this worthy Person heard no more of their Design. And for what the Polititian's Catechism would infer from a Daughter of <hi>O-Hara,</hi> an <hi>Irish</hi> Lord, being barbarously murther'd, as a President for what succeeded; it is evident, that the Rebellion commenc'd in blood, <hi>Rowry Mac-Guire</hi> that day (in which the Rebellion began) hanging not less than 18 Persons in the Church of <hi>Clownish,</hi> and afterwards burnt it; several other Examples may be produc'd of the same nature. And for what this inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Assertor braves the World with, from the <hi>Irish</hi> Remonstance, offer'd
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93738:49"/>
by Viscount <hi>Preston,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Talbot,</hi> the 17th. of <hi>March,</hi> 1642. <hi>That they desired the Murtherers on both sides should be punished,</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd but for a flourish; those Testimones of their Cruelties being given in upon Oath, in several Remonstrances, which must remain an evidence to posterity of their Villany; what-ever <hi>R. S.</hi> in his Collections of Murthers, would (by way of Recrimination) charge the <hi>English</hi> with: Inasmuch as what Cruelties he affirms to be acted after protection had been given, and Articles (at this or that Place) allowed, will be found upon due enquiry, (which they durst never stand to) to be raised on breach of Faith, and under colour of protection to act the greatest Villanies imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, some of which being found out, the Authors were punished, and it may be others (upon the same reason only suspected) were partners in equal sufferings. Nor could the State in such a confused, distracted time, be justly blamed, that some Irregularities (how cautiously soever look'd after) were not in each particular prevented, seeing the rage of the Souldier had exceeded the justice and providence of the State. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, can it be reasonable, that those who began and pursued so bloody a Conspiracy, with such un-heard of aggravations, should be put in bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with such, as (only to vindicate his Majesty and his People's Right) sometimes proceeded beyond their own Temper? Nor is it here to be omitted, That those whom they pretend should be singled out, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularized for barbarous and inhumane, should by vertue of their 18th. Article, be tryed by the Lord Lieutenant, and several Commissioners, some of which were chargeable with the same barbarous and inhumane Crimes, and all of them nearly interess'd in such as may be so charged, if to abett, aid, or countenance those, be in the eye of the Law accounted equally involv'd; so that from such, what justice could be expected, were easie to be conceiv'd, (how entire soever the Lord Lieutenant were in his Principles.) And whereas this <hi>R. S.</hi> would free <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and other Places, from the horrid actions which were committed there, the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of such as avows them, makes whatsoever he would extenuate as to them, and aggravate as to others, meer fabulous and vain; though to make up his Fardle, he takes in whatsomever <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Party af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards committed in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Thus confounding Actions with Times, an Artifice so shap'd to his Humour, as who is he that cannot see, but that those actions of <hi>Cromwel's</hi> no whit concern'd the <hi>British,</hi> or could be any encouragement for what the <hi>Irish</hi> did long before; <hi>Cromwel's</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings being on a ground well known, extending to the <hi>English</hi> as well as the <hi>Irish;</hi> such as if the Rebellion of <hi>Ireland</hi> had not been, no <hi>Sect</hi> had been able to have done any harm in <hi>England.</hi> Indeed his whole Piece is such a Web, as unravled, would be found meer Fictions and Imposture, after what is accounted for breach of Protection, forfeiture of Articles, Treachery, and the like. That which he writes of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Forces in <hi>Knockfergus,</hi> murthering (if you will believe him) in the Isle of <hi>Mac-Gee,</hi> 3000 innocent Persons, in the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> to be the first Massacre in <hi>Ireland</hi> on either side, (it seems he heard nothing then of <hi>O-Hara's</hi> Daughter) is so false, as he that will read <hi>John Carmick's</hi> Testimony, at the Tryal of <hi>Hugh Oge Mac-Mahon,</hi> the 18th. of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1644. attested by Sir <hi>William Cole,</hi> Sir <hi>William Hamilton,</hi> Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Loftus,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> upon Oath, (besides what the Clergy's Remonstrance clears) will plainly perceive the vanity and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that Assertion, as (amongst others) appears by <hi>John Kerdiff,</hi>

Rector of the Parish of <hi>Diserteraugh</hi> in <hi>Tyrone,</hi> a Person of known Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who deposeth, That the very first day Mr. <hi>Mader,</hi> Minister of the Parish of <hi>Donnoghmore,</hi> was murther'd by the <hi>Donnelies:</hi> and within a while after, Mr. <hi>New,</hi> Curate to Mr. <hi>Bradley,</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ardira,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Blyth,</hi> with eight more; not to say any thing of <hi>Rowry Mac-Guire's</hi> dealing with Mr. <hi>Middleton,</hi> the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> at <hi>Castle-Skeagh,</hi> alias <hi>Ballibalfure,</hi> where (after he had by treachery got into the Castle, seiz'd on his Mony, burnt the publick Records, and compell'd him to acknowledge the <hi>Mass</hi>) he caus'd him, his Wife and Children, to be hang'd, besides a hundred to be murder'd at least in that Town: And thence daily proceeded in such outrages.</p>
               <p>Thus for the present all things seem'd (in their sense) to prosper under their hands; for they had in this short time made themselves Masters of the whole Province of <hi>Ulster,</hi> except the Cities of <hi>London-derry</hi> and <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,</hi> the Town and Castle of <hi>Eniskillin,</hi> and some other Places and Castles, which were at first gallantly defended by the <hi>British</hi> Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, though afterwards, for want of relief, surrendred into the Rebels hands.</p>
               <p>The Fire thus kindled, shortly after spread its fury in the Provinces of<note place="margin">The Rebels en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to make themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>Leim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>

But their main design at present was, to make themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Province of <hi>Leimster,</hi> which was the chiefest and most flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the Kingdom; and having advanc'd their work, they so far prevail'd therein, as they had in a manner gain'd it wholely, except the Cities of <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Tredath,</hi> against which they appli'd their whole strength: For <hi>Dublin,</hi> it being the Seat of the State, (by the great care of the Lords Justices) had the best Provisions made for the strengthning of it, that those crazy Walls, and their want of Forces would admit. The Rebels contented themselves to block it up at a distance with their Forces, and to make some attempt to hinder Shipping from coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Harbour; but for <hi>Tredath,</hi> (having over-run the County of <hi>Meath,</hi> and surpriz'd the Towns of <hi>Trym, Kells, Navan, Ardbracan, Ashboy,</hi> &amp;c.) the Rebels sate down on both sides that Town, the last of <hi>November,</hi> or<note place="margin">The Rebels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt <hi>Tredath.</hi>
                  </note> the first of <hi>December,</hi> drawing very near the Walls, blocking up the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the River which runs into the Sea, that no succour could be brought in to them either by Sea or Land, no, nor Intelligence be gotten out of Town; so as Sir <hi>Henry Tichborn</hi> (as we have before mention'd) with the Provisions he had there, and the Forces he carried with him, which were not above a thousand men, remain'd close besieg'd, without any hopes of Succours, or further Supplies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tredath</hi> is an ancient City, of great Circuit, the River of <hi>Boyne</hi> passeth<note place="margin">The Situation of <hi>Tredath.</hi>
                  </note> through the midst of the Town; it is encompassed about with an old Stone-Wall, without Bulwarks or any kind of Rampiers, or other Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications than an ordinary Ditch; it lies about three miles from the Sea, the Harbour is but ill, yet such as would admit Vessels of good bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and such as exceed not 60 Tuns, may come up to the very Bridge in the Town: It is situated in a plain open Countrey, plentiful for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Provisions, no Bogs or Marsh-ground near it; so as the Rebels had all the opportunities and advantages they could desire, for making their approaches to the Place: But so unhappy were they in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93738:50"/>
and so unprosperous in their executions, as notwithstanding the weakness of the Place, and the small numbers of men that kept it, they lay before it (after they had thus closely begirt the Town almost three months) without doing any thing of moment, being resolv'd (either in regard of their want of great Guns to batter the Walls, skill to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine them, or courage to scale them) to sit still, till Famine within had made them an entrance.</p>
               <p>The State being very sensible of what this poor Place suffered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted in the first place, after the Landing of Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt</hi> which way was most likely to weaken the Rebels strength, the main of which <hi>Tredath</hi> had long felt; therefore they resolv'd now with their new Forces to relieve that Town. But before we come to the result of that<note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Tredath,</hi> and its strength.</note> Determination, it will not be unpleasant to shew, against how many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that Place incredibly extricated it self.

               <p>The Lord <hi>Moor,</hi> upon the first discovery of the Plot, (having notice of his Sister the Lady <hi>Blany's</hi> and her Childrens imprisonment, with sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal of her Castle, <hi>Castle Blany,</hi> the Town and Castle of <hi>Newry, Carrick Mac-ross, Charlemont,</hi> Town and Castle of <hi>Monaghan, Tonrages, Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, Cloughoter, Dunganon,</hi> and multitudes of Castles and Houses of Strength, Towns and Villages in the North) repair'd in the midst of the night from <hi>Mellifont</hi> to <hi>Tredath,</hi> and knocking up the Mayor and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, invited them to a speedy defence; who at first promis'd him fair, but proceeded slowly, producing few Arms, who (on a Muster-day before) could appear with some hundreds. His Lordship (conceiving his presence necessary) drew his whole Family thither; and having regain'd some old Pieces of Ordnance, cast into a Dungeon, he fitted them (and four took out of a Merchants Ship) for service; and placing some at
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93738:50"/>
one Gate, some at another; making up the North-Port, and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Walls, which he effected with singular diligence and speed; one <note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>John Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terviles.</hi>
                  </note> of the two half-Companies in the Town proving afterwards false, the Citizens themselves (Papists) being no way real; which put his Lordship on a perpetual watch, there being little relief; so that he was with his Troop constantly scouring the streets, the Inhabitants being no ways assisting: Yet so managed he his affairs, as he kept all passages free for Sir <hi>Henry Tichborn's</hi> admittance, who, entring Governour there<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Hen, Tich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi> enters the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>Novemb.</hi> Governour of <hi>Tredath.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> with his Forces, was coldly received by the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, not admitted into any Quarters, till himself (after many hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the streets) found one. Having first drawn out several Companies to continue the Watch that night, never excusing his own vigilance or pains: The next day after he enter'd. He endeavour'd to make the Town as defensible as might be, wherein he and his Officers order'd much to its security, though many things conspired to make it (in so short a time) not artificially tenable; which yet they afterwards made good with their Bodies and Valour. He expell'd many of the Popish Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, which held intelligence with the Rebels without, and got in all the Provisions he could, ordering them with the greatest parsimony imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. He and the Lord <hi>Moor</hi> (who accompani'd him in all services) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately walk'd the Rounds, performing all Duties so industriously, as they disappointed all the frequent little Plots which the Rebels had upon them; and so careful were they to encourage and provide for their Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as they rais'd them up to a far greater confidence of their Abilities to defend the Place, (against so numerous an Enemy) than there was just reason for. That which discourag'd the Soldiers most, was, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Duty which they perform'd in their Night-Watches; the circuit of the Wall was very large, the Weather (being the depth of Winter) was very sharp; and the numbers of the Soldiers (who were to watch) were but small, and those very ill cloth'd, so as it came oftner to their turns than usual, which bred sickness and diseases, and some even fell down and died upon the Walls.</p>
               <p>The third of <hi>December</hi> (there being a want of Corn) there issued forth a Party at St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> and the <hi>West-gate,</hi> of 350 Foot, and two Troops of Horse, to secure some Carriages sent out for Corn at the Green-hills, about half a mile off; where unexpectedly (the Citizens having been treacherous in their intelligence) there appear'd in view 3000 men: whereupon some Officers advis'd to retreat, and many of the Horse (Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists) in the Reer running back, with a confus'd cry exceedingly disturb'd those that were at the Gates drawing out. To remedy which, Sir <hi>Henry Tichborn</hi> presently lights off his Horse, and in the Front (to the hazard of his Person) march'd before the Foot, commanding the Musketeers up the Hill, and his Pikes in that narrow Passage to open for the Horse, and so with all expedition made ready to charge the Enemy, giving the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels so home a Charge, as they betook themselves to their heels, with the loss of above 200 of them, but not one of ours, though before we charg'd them they had set twice on us: The Victory exceedingly animated our Soldiers, notwithstanding afterwards many Soldiers (Papists) daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from us; and we receiv'd frequent Alarms, which we finding fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, afterwards neglected. Then the Confederates sent to Parley; upon which, one <hi>Darcy,</hi> a Frier, and a Captain of his <hi>Name,</hi> demanded the absolute surrender of the Town for his Majesties use and service, in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93738:51"/>
the name of the Commanders of the Catholick Army, expressing how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible it would be to keep it against their Forces. The Governour with the Captains return'd an Answer as short, That they had a Commission from his Majesty for the defence of the Town, and without his Majesties Command, or the Lords Justices, to the contrary, they would keep it; if the Rebels <hi>attempted</hi> it by the Sword, they would defend it; if by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, they should hear they eat their Horses Hides. In prosecution of which, the Governour and Captains of the City, made this unanimous Protestation in its defence, for his Majesties use and service.

Towards morning, the Rebels fled, being pursued by our

This deliverance was no sooner over, but new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies were hatch'd in the Town, a clandestine Oath being impos'd on some to seize on the Soldiers Arms as they were asleep, and kill others in their beds; happily discovered by a Priest, not so bloody as the rest: Yet necessities of all sorts (as well for Beasts as Men) grew so urgent, that within few days no Enemy but those need to do execution: In which extremity, God was particularly flown to, and even in the midst of their Devotion, the <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> there came in from the <hi>State</hi> (vigilant in whatsomever might concern them) a Pinnace, a Frigat, a Gab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, with two Shalloops, and a Vessel loaden with Bisket, Powder, and Ammunition; whereby the Garrison was seasonably reliev'd in the midst of great extremities; which at the first appearance, the Towns-men (well-wishers to the Rebels) would needs have perswaded the Soldiers, that they had been Ships from <hi>Spain</hi> in favour of the Rebels, and appear'd chearful. But the mercy proving otherwise, the Soldiers grew hearty, which (without an especial providence) might have prov'd their ruine; for, contrary to the Command of the Governour, and his vigilance, (which was never more remarkable than then) the Soldiers carous'd it too liberally, being (by the Friers themselves) made to drink, inasmuch as Sentinels (from their Guards) were drawn in: So as the Rebels, <hi>Jan.</hi> 12. (by the help and treacherous intimation of their own within) made a breach in the Wall about four in the morning, at which, many of their best Soldiers and Chief Commanders, to the number of 500, enter'd unheard, till having march'd as far as the Key, they gave a shout; which the Governour hearing, instantly ran down, unarm'd, onely with his Pistols in his hands, and was the first that caus'd a Drum to beat, at which all was soon alarm'd; and finding their Pikes to be short of ours by a yard, we charg'd home, and forc'd them to a retreat, though they had o'r-turn'd a Drake of ours (that lay there) off its Carriage. Soon came in my Lord <hi>Moor</hi> with 15 Horse, (all that could of a sudden be got ready) with which, and the rest, (that were now got together) they quickly repuls'd them. Sir <hi>John Borlase</hi> hasting so speedily, undrest, and with that courage to the Breach made by the Nunnery, that his service there in falling upon the Enemy (who fought it stoutly) was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. Here the Besieg'd kill'd many of the Rebels, as well those as came near the Walls for the succour of those that first entred, as they that Invaded it: and great was the deliverance, the Rebels Party within (ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry considerable) having their Doors mark'd with Chalk, as a token to the Rebels, should they have prevail'd: The Besieged lost few, if any. Though the Pinnace, on its return, ran a ground; upon which, the Rebels plaid thick upon her from both sides the River, desperately approaching her very Stern with Pick-axes and Crows of Iron; at which, Captain <hi>Stut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> (Comptroler of the Ordnance, an excellent Engineer, a stout and daring Person) presently threw some Granado's amongst them, which did such execution, as throughly frighted them; yet chas'd them not away till the seventh was flung; after which they parted, but were so pursued by our Musket and Canon, that many were slain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:93738:52"/>After this Relief, (for some time) <hi>Tredath</hi> enjoy'd reasonable Peace, though at distance they had often alarms, and within a fortnight, what quantity of Bisket and Meal was brought to the Garrison, was easily spent, Famine Fluxes, with other diseases return again, in as much as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse of the <hi>English</hi> Inhabitants (especially such as had flown thither for relief) died daily, and now the Town was narrowly search'd for Provisions, in which scrutiny the Friars (against their vow of Poverty) were found full of Trunks of Plate, Money, and other Treasure, which they not owning (being the Goods of the Rebels) were equally distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongst the Garrison, but could not supply the want of food, which rais'd Mutinies (speedily allayed by the Vigilance of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.) However many <hi>English</hi> as well as <hi>Irish,</hi> fled to the Rebels out of meer necessity. In as much as Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neal</hi> writ into the North, and gave it out amongst his Souldiers, that he was certain of the sudden surrender of <hi>Tredath:</hi> so as the Town being now driven to great streights, the best expedient that could be thought of, was to Man out a Boat for <hi>Dublin,</hi> that the <hi>State</hi> might be rightly inform'd of its Condition, in endeavouring which, the Aldermen and Mariners of the Town seem'd very backwards, till the Governour threatned to make some of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen themselves prove Mariners in that service; whereupon at last men were found, and Commissioners sent to the Lords Justices, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them of the misery of the <hi>Town,</hi> in which service Sir <hi>John Borlase,</hi> Junior, and others were imployed, who having obtained some men, and two Peeces of Battery, return'd with a very satisfactory supply.</p>
               <p>The same day they weighed Anchor for <hi>Dublin,</hi> a part of the Garrison made a sally on the Rebels, Northward, who encountred them sharply, but were soon affronted by ours; many of the Enemy were slain, but of ours none, onely by the breaking of a little brass Peece, a Gunner was hurt, which yet gave them so rugged a Salute, that they took leave of us, and we recovered some Provisions: Sir <hi>Henry Tichborn</hi> that night with some Musketiers, falling on their Court of Guard, and killed some of their Sentinels; As the 11th. of <hi>February,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Greenham,</hi> with a Party of Horse and Foot, routed 60 of the Enemy, taking a Lieutenant, Ensign, and several other, Prisoners; Sallying also forth the next day, with the like success, getting in some Grain, and burning the Countrey.</p>
               <p>By these <hi>Sallies</hi> though some were relieved, the Souldiers (in general) fell into great extremity, Horse-flesh, Dogs, and Cats, being greedy food, yet (having but an intention to seek God) <hi>February</hi> the 14th. a booty<note place="margin">The second Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief <hi>Febr.</hi> the 14th.</note> of 80 Cows, and 200 Sheep being offer'd, they were (though with much hazard) soon recovered of the Enemy: And from the worst of Winds, a Northwest, it instantly turn'd to the best, a S. E. and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till in the Evening, that Sabbath, (having all that day crav'd the blessing from God) tidings came in that our Relief was come within the Bar: <hi>viz.</hi> two Pinnaces, 6 Gabbards, 3 Frigots, with one Shallop, with a plentiful Relief for three months, a large Fisher-Boat of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, loaden with Herring (going to the Confederates) being also brought in, notwithstanding what Cables, Masts of Ships, and other things they had chain'd over the River, to prevent their arrival: so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and fortunate was Captain <hi>Stutfield,</hi> whose happy Conduct, <hi>Trodath</hi> had now twice experienc'd in the height of misery, a mercy not to be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93738:52"/>
forgot no more then that, that <hi>Sunday</hi> morning about four of the Clock, Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neale</hi> (marching silently with all the strength he could make) made so bold an Attempt, as to apply scaling Ladders to the Walls, especially near St. <hi>Laurence</hi> Gate, where (sometimes) a Sentinel had been omitted, two of which they had presently fixed, and on each one mounted, the Sentinel (missing fire) the Assailants presumed higher, till the Sentinel knocked them down with the Butt of his Musket, and cried out to the Guard, who instantly plyed the rest with their fill of shot, so that they left thirteen of their Ladders, and many of their dead behind them: nor could all that the Rebels Officers could say, encourage their Souldiers to return.</p>
               <p>With the last Relief, there came a Proclamation, dated the 8th. of <hi>February,</hi> 1641. from the State, prizing Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neals</hi> head at <hi>1000 l. O-Relie's,</hi> and others at <hi>600 l.</hi> and the rest of the Principal at <hi>400 l.</hi> if they were brought in before the 25th. of <hi>March</hi> next, which made the Souldiers ready to be abroad; the Proclamation may be found at large in the Appendix. After that the <hi>Lords Justices, and Council</hi> had<note place="margin">Appendix. 6th.</note> thus particularly named those then in Rebellion, and sate a Price on their heads, few (if any) were ever brought in, so intire were the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates; though in former Rebellions this Policy produced good effect: whereupon the Commons in Parliament, Ordered all rotten Members fit to be cut off, and new to supply their Places, publickly affixing in their Orders, their Names whom they knew engaged in the Rebellion, which Sir <hi>Audley Mervin</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In his Speech the 13th. of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1662. p. 17. 38.</note> brings in <hi>as just evidence of their Conviction, from undeniable Presidents of Parliament, how many Nocent Persons soever have since passed in Triumphant innocency, whilst those stand by, whose evidence (if admitted) would write the Letter of Condemnation on their foreheads.</hi> However the Catholick Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> (could words make them innocent) fram'd a Protestation against the Proclamation of the eight of <hi>February,</hi> but so false, scandalous, and insinuating, that no answer (further then every intelligent mans abhorrency thereof) is requisite or expedient.</p>
               <p>Since the last Relief, the Rebels (as to their Menaces) were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what milder; and relief and hope, having now animated the Souldiers, the 26 of <hi>February,</hi> the Governour issued out with 220 Foot, and 120 Horse to <hi>Beaubeck,</hi> securing thereby some Corn and Hay for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Town, and then advanc'd to <hi>Smithstown,</hi> where they met a Party of the Rebels, fought them, and slew 300. <hi>Serjeant Major Fortescue</hi> took two Colours, Captain <hi>Bryan</hi> a Drum, and eightscore Cows near <hi>Gellingston,</hi> where not long before they had defeated our men; Colonel <hi>Preston</hi> was there hard put to it: The Victory (that it might tend to the raising of the Siege) was pursued by 600 Foot, and 120 Horse, under the Conduct of my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> with Carriages and two Field Pieces, who assaied <hi>Stanime,</hi> which they found so unexpectedly Fortified, as having onely slain some of their men, (abundance of rain falling) the great Guns did small execution, that thence the Party return'd that night, and called in upon <hi>Colp,</hi> a little Village, where they loaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with Corn, and return'd without any opposition. Those of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime</hi> hearing of our Supplies, and resolution to come on, quitted the Castle few days after, which without further work fell into our hands; scarce a day now passed, without some attempt upon the Enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:93738:53"/>The first of <hi>March,</hi> Sir <hi>John Borlase</hi> Jun. Lieutenant Colonel, had the Command of four Companies, with which he fac'd the Enemy, and beat them with much disadvantage, securing at that time 200 l. worth of Corn, burning withall, such of their Lodgings as remain'd of the former days work at <hi>Colp,</hi> and return'd with great satisfaction: Whilst the same day, the Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> and the Governour marched further, and the Rebels having lin'd Hedges and Ditches, Captain <hi>Billingsley</hi> very resolutely scour'd those places with 80 Musketiers, soon routing them, a Lieutenant with 13 Souldiers were slain, and a Captain of the <hi>O-Neals</hi> taken Prisoner: The Castle of <hi>Colp</hi> (after much hazard) was taken, and all therein (<hi>viz.</hi> 26) were slain, save the Captain, who was taken Prisoner.</p>
               <p>The third of <hi>March</hi> some Forces marched out, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Waineman</hi> to <hi>Marlington</hi> (three miles off <hi>Tredath</hi>) with whom all Persons were permitted to pillage, and return'd home with all sorts of Grain, having burnt <hi>Draicot</hi>'s house, and some other places considerable: at which time the Rebels forsook many of their Houses, and we began to be at pretty ease.</p>
               <p>The first of <hi>March,</hi> the Lord <hi>Moore</hi> commanded out a Party of 400 Foot, and 80 Horse on the Northside, amongst his Traiterous Tenants, to <hi>Talagh-hallon,</hi> where Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neal,</hi> with Colonel <hi>Mac-Bryan,</hi> had that night confederated together, eight Colours instantly appear'd, being intrench'd much to their advantage, but our men (Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Byron</hi> commanding the Foot) drew up boldly, and gave such sure fire, as they soon betook themselves to their last refuge (their heels) near 400. with 7 Captains, were slain, and one took Prisoner (<hi>viz. Rory-mac-Art-mac-Cross-mac-Mahon,</hi> and one Colour; 100 Muskets were taken, and Pikes covered the ground, others securing themselves by a bog near at hand, were so roughly admonished by a Drake from us, that they soon removed their standing: This hot skirmish was in sight of our Walls, the Lord <hi>Moore</hi> in this encounter behaving himself most gallantly, indeed no man braver; for after he was known by the Rebels, they endeavoured to have seized on him; yet though he had but 7 in his Company (being then at a distance from the main Body) charged them home, killed many, scattered the rest, and got off clear.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Tredath</hi> had relieved it self, and his Majesties Forces<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tredath</hi> being freed, several of the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> offer (upon Conditions) to come in.</note> became full Masters of the field, several (as the Lord <hi>Nettervile,</hi> Lord <hi>Slane,</hi> and others) writ Letters to the State to excuse themselves, as did those with the Lord <hi>Gormanston,</hi> about the 21st. of <hi>March,</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> under the name of the United Lords, that he would move the State for a Cessation of Arms, and to know upon what Conditions they might come in and submit; which the Lords <hi>Justices and Council</hi> thought a demand full of Insolency, they having (till then) acted with the forwardest of the Rebels, notwithstanding whatever dehortations or encouragements, the State gave them to the contrary, so that then the <hi>State</hi> had no power to mitigate their Crimes; Nor did the Lords <hi>Justices and Councel</hi> then think fit to prostitute his Majesties Royal Grace, to men so ungrateful and unnatural: Besides, the <hi>State</hi> in their Commission and Instructions, found no express Warrant to pardon such pernicious Traitors, as (before they inclined to come in) hoped to carry all before them, by surprizal or open force.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:93738:53"/>In the last Service of my Lord <hi>Moore's, Barnewell</hi> of <hi>Rahasket</hi> (one of dangerous Parts) was taken, with some Priests and Friers; <hi>Darcy</hi> of <hi>Platten</hi> in <hi>Meath,</hi> about two miles from <hi>Tredath,</hi> was soon after sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd, who denied the surrender of his House to the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> yet after hearing of two Peeces of Battery, surrendred it. However, at <hi>Atherdee,</hi> the Rebels killed all the Protestants, whilst the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Lieutenant General, leaving <hi>Dublin</hi> the 7th. of <hi>March,</hi> (prosecuting the Design formerly mention'd, upon the arrival of the Forces out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that they might not be idle in the City) was not far from <hi>Tredath,</hi>

And the 23. of <hi>March,</hi> they advanc'd with Fire and Smoak towards <hi>Atherdee;</hi> about a mile from Town, the Enemy was descried to be drawn up into two Divisions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be 1100 or 1500. upon which Sir <hi>Henry Tichborn</hi> drew his Souldiers into Battalia, sending up a forlorn Hope before to scour the Ditches, which they so effectually did, as stumbling upon an Ambuscado of the Enemy's Musketiers, they beat them out of their Holes, drawing so nimbly upon them, as they killed about 400 of them in a miles space. At the foot of the Bridge our Foot found some resistance, by Musketiers plac'd in a Tower; upon which Sir <hi>Henry Tichborn</hi> (finding a passage over the River) galled them so on the other side, that they soon aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd it. The passage thus open'd, the Horse enter'd, and with a full ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer chas'd them through the Town, where one Lieutenant Colonel, and five Captains of the Rebels, were slain, the Lord <hi>Moore</hi> doing much exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution with his own hands. Now the passage being clear, our Forces<note place="margin">

Yet we approach'd the Town the 26th. of <hi>March,</hi> about Nine in the Morning, planted our Ordnance on a little Hill near the Gate, which 500 of them defended a while against a forlorn Hope of ours, till they pursued their Work so close, as they made many of the Rebels fall, at which they retired; which our Men perceiving, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd their fears by shouting, that at length a Division, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Waineman,</hi> of about 300, resolutely approach'd the Gate with Pick-axes, and after a strong encounter enter'd with the Horse, who pursued the Enemy with a full Gallop, killing many; but (upon the turning towards the next Gate, seeing 2 or 3 brass Peeces planted, and 500 of the Rebels ready to receive us) we fairly retreated, whilst a Castle, plac'd at the head of that Street, (man'd with their best Musketiers) in our return played very hot upon us, whereby 10 of our
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93738:54"/>
Men were slain, and Ensign <hi>Fortescue</hi> (a sprightly Gentleman) one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, and one that carried the Colours for another; Lieutenant <hi>Francis Moore</hi> was there also shot upon the shoulder-piece of his Armour, without much hurt, (a Gentleman that merits much for his service through the whole Business.) At this (we being not subject to lose any Men) the Governour and the Lord <hi>Moore</hi> were so enraged, that they set the Houses near the Castle (the only <hi>Remora</hi>) on fire, through which (the Wind blowing the smoak on the Castle, and the Souldiers making bundles of dried Bean-stalks, intermixt with Tow and Gunpowder, and carrying these on their heads) they got themselves un-descried to the Castle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door, where they laid down their bundles, and giving fire by a train of Powder, blew up the Door, and some other Boards, those within (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost choaked, and fully frighted) leapt out at a Window, and a Serjeant of Captain <hi>Owen</hi>'s, with 5 Men (upon condition that they might have the pillage of the Place) enter'd it, and speedily shewed (by their naked swords on the top of the Castle) that they were Masters of it. At which the <hi>Governour</hi> and the Lord <hi>Moore</hi> were reviv'd, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately quench'd the Fires, and man'd the Castle with 30 good Musketiers, who, playing thick into the Town, hindred the Rebels from walking the Streets. Afterwards we drew up two Peeces of Ordnance against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Gate, and with 10 Wool-packs (found in the Castle very opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) a kind of Bulwark was made for the Musketiers, which the Rebels perceiving, left their Peeces there loaden. Whereupon the <hi>Governour</hi> took a Division of a Party of Horse, and drew by the back of the Town, (towards the North-Gate) killing 40 in his way, and enter'd at a by-Gate, found the Town deserted. The Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> in the interim, also beating open the Gates, took possession of the two brass Peeces, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Market-place, and so at Seven a Clock the same Night we were Masters of all. About 100 of theirs were killed, and some 14 of ours, 120 Protestants were thereby reliev'd, and much good Pillage of all sort taken therein: Our Forces upon Muster next Morning were found to be but 750 Foot, and 200 Horse, theirs near 3000 within the Town, besides in Artillery and brass Peeces they much exceeded us.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Tredath,</hi> which not long since was (in the opinion of most) given up as an irrecoverable prey to the Rebels, now surviv'd their scorns; and that meerly through God's Mercy, on the courage and valour of the besieged, bearing out against the utmost of Extremity and Treachery, faithfully set down by <hi>Dean Bernard,</hi> in his siege of <hi>Tredath,</hi> 1642. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd with the Follies of several superstitions and vanities, no ways pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the practiser; and had not the providence of the State (at that time) been singular, no doubt but <hi>Dublin</hi> would soon have been the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of their malice and cruelties. And now the County of <hi>Lowth</hi> (which lay on the other side of the <hi>Boine</hi>) being clear'd, <hi>Ardes</hi> and <hi>Dundalk</hi> also being taken in, Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neal,</hi> who (on all occasions) made a most inconsiderable resistance, ran with the first, being reserv'd for a further mischief; he got to the <hi>Newry,</hi> and thence passed down into the Counties of <hi>Tyrone</hi> and <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> where (in revenge of his losses<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Phelim O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal</hi> being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed at <hi>Tredath,</hi> reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges himself on the <hi>British</hi> in other Parts.</note> before <hi>Tredath</hi>) he exercis'd the uttermost of his Cruelties on Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children, whom he had to that time suffer'd to live amongst the <hi>Irish,</hi> most barbarously killing the Lord <hi>Cawfield,</hi> when he least sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it, and caus'd Mr. <hi>Blany</hi> (a Gentleman of good Quality) to be hanged for refusing to hear Mass.

being likewise driven from the siege of <hi>Tredath,</hi> retiring to <hi>Belturbet,</hi> (in the County of <hi>Cavan</hi>) there commanded the poor <hi>British,</hi> who thitherto (<hi>i. e.</hi> after the great slaughter) had surviv'd to the number of 60. to be forced off the Bridge into the Water, where they were swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up: As did Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neal,</hi> who missing the taking in of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Augher,</hi> in the County of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> in revenge gave directions to <hi>Mulmore-Mac-Donnel,</hi> (a most cruel and merciless Rebel) to kill all the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> within the Parishes of <hi>Mullebrack, Loghgilly,</hi> and <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluneny,</hi> destroying there not less than 1500 Protestants, since the 23. of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. He exercis'd also his cruelty in the same manner, for his loss before <hi>Lisnagarvy, Newry,</hi> and other Places, upon the poor Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, as if by offering so many innocent Souls to death, he should have expiated the guilt of his Cowardliness and Treacheries.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>English</hi> Forces enduring no resistance where they came, either possest themselves of the Castles tenable, or demolisht the rest, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving clear'd all passages 'twixt <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Tredath,</hi> part of them retir'd to <hi>Dublin;</hi> whilst Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neal</hi> gave but cold entertainment to the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the <hi>Pale,</hi> that had for their safety (after their Confederacy with him) retir'd into his Quarters; he and his Confederates renewing their ancient Animosities against them, (the old <hi>English</hi>) as those who<note place="margin">The <hi>Irish</hi> taunt the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> with old Miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> formerly pursued the <hi>Irish</hi> in the defence of themselves, telling them, That the time was not yet past memory, when they had done, as now, stir'd up the meer <hi>Irish</hi> to rebel, making those in the North declare themselves, and when they found them not likely to prosper, deserted them, exposing them to the fury of the <hi>English,</hi> and their Countrey to ruine and desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but now they were even, their Countrey being first ruined. This harsh scornful usage of the old <hi>English,</hi> by the Northern <hi>Irish,</hi> after so solemn a conjunction between them, and under such a publick calamity fallen upon them, bred in them a great consternation and trouble; and it made so sad an impression upon the Lord Viscount <hi>Gormanston,</hi> (who was the chief instrument to bring the Northern <hi>Irish</hi> into the Pale, and there to work out that solemn conjunction between them) as it broke his heart, and he soon after died, <hi>lamenting his Treachery and Infidelity, that he had not been only the ruine of himself and his posterity, but the great fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand of his Countrey, out of vain ambitious ends, or for the setting up of fond superstitious Inventions, entertaining such Designs, as had already caus'd huge streams of blood to be shed, and were now likely to determine in nothing, but the extirpation of the old</hi> English <hi>Families, out of those plentiful Parts of the Countrey, wherein they had most happily seated themselves, and which they had most pleasantly enjoy'd, ever since the first Conquest of</hi> Ireland. Others had the same Apprehensions; but being now involv'd with the <hi>Ulster</hi> Forces, and having withstood the date of his Majesty's Favour, the next course was to colour their Proceedings by pretence of Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that by Forgeries and Calumnies, which they never spare to vent and publish, when they would withdraw the Subjects from their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they might the more colourably palliate their foul Contempts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding Times, that the rise of their Insurrection might seem to have some ground and encouragement thence: And to that end, they of the <hi>Pale</hi> made <hi>an Apology to his Majesty,</hi> fraught with so many vain, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and malicious Stories, as (in the judgement of the knowing and moderate States-man) serve only to increase their guilt; the main of whatsoever is there alledged, being fully answer'd, in the <hi>Reply to the Remonstrance given in at</hi> Trym, <hi>the 17th. of</hi> March, 1642.</p>

And that whosoever should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist him in it, should be an Enemy to the Common-wealth; and that the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs of Counties should raise Power to suppress any Levies he should make to that purpose: Being loath</hi> (saith his Majesty in his Solitudes) <hi>to shoot at any mark here less than himself; or that any should have the glory of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction but themselves.</hi> Whilst at the same time, his Majesties Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in an Act of Council at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the <hi>22d.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon this occasion takes notice, That <hi>there could be no greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of Care and Princely Courage, than this his Majesties intention to go in Person into</hi> Ireland <hi>against the Rebels.</hi> Upon the signification of which Royal Intent to the State there, the <hi>Lords Justices and Council,</hi> in a Letter to his <hi>Majesty</hi> the <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1642. taking notice of his Princely Purpose, to take just vengeance on the perfidious Rebels, humbly besought him <hi>to come so provided, as to appear in that Kingdom suitable to the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Wisdom of so mighty a King.</hi> Which Letter, how finely soever it was covered, went not (in some mens opinion) without a discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; forasmuch as that though some (at Court) might conceive (by his Majesties coming over) a Peace might be made with the <hi>Irish</hi> when his Majesty pleas'd; yet by taking in so base, perfidious, and barbarous a People, who in so execrable a manner had cut off such multitudes of the <hi>English, the event</hi> (as was privately signifi'd by some) <hi>could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to his Majesties Honour.</hi> Besides, the Soldiers were then grown so implacable to the <hi>Irish,</hi> as they would scarce endure any ordinary Papist, much less suffer a Rebel to be admitted amongst them. After all, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties resolutions for <hi>Ireland</hi> were prevented, not without several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, as each Party apprehended the <hi>Scene:</hi> Though his Majesty express'd, that he would never refuse or be unwilling to venture his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for the good and safety of his People, yet he was not so weary of his life as to hazard it impertinently, and therefore at present should desist. However as yet, the Protestant Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> being competently sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, the Rebels were frequently chastized.</p>
               <p>To say truth, after the raising of the Siege of <hi>Tredath,</hi> and the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thereupon, his Majesties Forces so enlarged their Quarters, as no considerable Enemy (save some Castles) lay nearer <hi>Dublin</hi> than twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93738:55"/>
miles on any side, that now the Lords Justices thought it high time to provide for the safety of such places as lay more remote in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the <hi>English</hi> having in many Places (upon the first rising of the <hi>Irish</hi>) possess'd themselves of some Forces, Strong Holds, Towns and Castles, which (though very ill provided) they did for many months (yea, some for years, after the first breaking out of the Rebellion) defend, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing long Sieges, multitudes of Rebels encompassing them, and all means by Treachery, Force or Famine, experienc'd to draw them into their possession.</p>
               <p>It will here take up too large a space in this Story (where many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable things may fall besides the Pen) to recite the gallant actions perform'd by several private Persons in some inconsiderable (in respect of Strength) Places; many Women shewing more courage, constancy, and resolution in the defence of what they were necessitated to, than the Men without did in their undertakings against them. Great were the Straits many of them were put unto, enduring all manner of extremities, subjecting themselves to all kind of dangers, not daunted with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Rebels that lay about them, they in many places issued out, and lived onely on the Spoils they took from them, fighting continually for their daily bread, which they never wanted as long as their Enemies had it. The Rebels were so undextrous in the management of their Sieges, as they took very few Places by force; in all their Attempts, whether by Mine, Battery, Assault, they seldom prosper'd: The great Engine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they master'd any Fort of the <hi>English,</hi> was Treachery; Offers of safe Conduct, and other Conditions of Honour and Advantage, which might induce the Besieged (sometimes reduc'd to the utmost extremities) to surrender their Places into their hand; which (though solemnly sworn and sign'd) they yet seldom or never kept, but left several Places as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of their Treachery and Infidelity, using those (who surrender'd them) as they did the poor Protestants in the Town and Castle of <hi>Longford,</hi> whom (they having besieged, and drawn to yield up into their hands upon condition of Quarters, and safety for their Persons) they (as soon as they issued out) fell upon with their Skenes, their Priest (as a signal for the rest to fall on) first ripping open the belly of the Minister amongst the <hi>English;</hi> then his followers soon kill'd and hang'd the rest. After this manner used they the 150 Protestants, who yielded up (upon fair Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) the Castle of <hi>Tullagh,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Newtown,</hi> in the County of <hi>Fermanagh.</hi> And the 1400 or 1500 at <hi>Belturbet,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Ardmagh</hi> and <hi>Loughgell,</hi> and those under the conduct of the Lord <hi>Mayo;</hi> and those 120 murther'd by the <hi>Mac-Swynes;</hi> as those who yielded the strong Castle of <hi>Cloghleigh</hi> (situate upon the <hi>Manningwater</hi>) to <hi>Richard Condon,</hi> who promised Quarter and a safe Convoy to <hi>Castelions,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to which, they were all of them either hang'd, kill'd, wounded, or kept Prisoners by him and his Company. In the same manner also he used a Party of the Earl of <hi>Barrimore</hi>'s Troop, who (having bravely maintain'd themselves in a House in <hi>Coole</hi> against his Forces) were by his Promise (on the Faith of a Soldier and a Christian) of a safe Conveyance to <hi>Castelions,</hi> contented to yield it up; but were immediately (upon their coming forth) murther'd: As some <hi>English</hi> Families, and the Garrison Soldiers at <hi>Sligo</hi> were used by <hi>O Connor Slygah,</hi> who (upon the quitting of their Holds) promis'd them Quarter, and to convey them over the <hi>Curlew</hi> Mountains in safety to <hi>Abbeyboyle</hi> or <hi>Roscommon;</hi> but he first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison'd
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93738:56"/>
them in a most nasty Goal, allowing them onely Grains for their food, and afterwards (when the Rebels were merry with Company, that came to congratulate their Victory over these poor Creatures) those which survived were brought forth (by a Frier, <hi>O Connor</hi>'s Brother, and others) and kill'd, or precipitated over the Bridge into a swift Water, where they were presently destroy'd. And at <hi>Teagh-Temple,</hi> after the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> (who retired thither, were not able longer to resist the Enemy) had yielded the Place, on Conditions to be brought in safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to <hi>Abbeyboil,</hi> were murther'd, hang'd, or buri'd alive: At which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible sight, Mrs. <hi>Olyfant</hi> (a Ministers Wife) being great with Child, fell in Labour, but was still beat forward, till at last the Child slipt from her, and, what was horrible, she was forced to draw that poor Infant (and the Concomitants of such an accident) after her, till she died, with sport to them. The Story would be too long, should we mention those 140 taken forth to be sent for <hi>England,</hi> and drown'd at <hi>Portadown:</hi> or those numbers drawn to <hi>Florence Fitz-Patricks</hi> house, and there slain: Or those 60 and odd persons gathered together, on pretence of sending them to <hi>Clanhughboyes,</hi> drown'd by them: Or their perfidious breach of Quarter, as that of Captain <hi>Sanders,</hi> which we rather remit to future Story, not touching what they do in open War, but their putting the blood of War in their Girdles in the time of Peace. Though we must say, that when the Instructions for the Protestant Agents of <hi>Ireland</hi> came afterwards to be consider'd, great artifice there was, that the cruelties committed against the Protestants, after Quarter given, Promises and Oaths for security or safe Convoy, should be struck out. But no more of this.</p>
               <p>The State considering these sad truths, and that none but a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army was to appear abroad, they provided 4000 Foot, and 1500 Horse, to be sent out under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General of the Army.</p>

                  </note> (who loved always to be in action) the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1642. took a small Party of men, and went out towards the County of <hi>Wickloe,</hi> where he found the Rebels had possessed themselves of a Castle, called <hi>Carrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> within four miles of <hi>Dublin;</hi> and seeing him draw near to it with those small Forces, and finding him to have no Artillery, so as their Walls were of sufficient strength to bear them out against any attempts he could make, they began to brave him from within, and to use reproachful signs from the top of the Castle, thereby to express their contempt and scorn of him. This his spirit was not well able to brook; and considering the Castle was not invincible, and that it would be very great advantage to the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> to remove so ill a Neighbour; and that with two Pieces of Battery he could take it (in some few hours) he sent presently away to the <hi>Lords Justices</hi> to acquaint them with his Design, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire them to send unto him the two Great Guns for the effecting of it. They very well approv'd his Design, and gave present order for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them out, together with all necessaries and provisions fitting for the service. In the mean time, he took special care for the surrounding of the Castle, and disposing of his Men so, as they might prevent the Rebels is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing out: In which Service, Serjeant Major <hi>Berry</hi> (with 200 Fire-locks, viewing the Castle) was shot in his side, though he died not till eight days after of a Feaver. All things being put in order, whilst they attended the coming of the Great Peeces, (now on their way) Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt,</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:93738:56"/>
with some of the Commanders, laid themselves down under the side of a little thatch'd house, standing near the Castle, (which they took as a shelter to keep off the Enemies bullets) from whence he suddainly rose up to call to the Souldiers, to stand carefully to their Arms, and to their Duties, in their several Stations; Which one of the Rebels (from within) perceiving, discharged his Piece at him, and shot him into his right breast, under the neck bone; and being so wounded, he was carried off, expressing his submission to the good hand of God, and much joy'd to pour out his last blood in that Cause; The pain of his Wound was so great, as they could not bring him to <hi>Dublin,</hi> but carried him to <hi>Mirian,</hi> a house of the Lord <hi>Fitz-Williams</hi> where the next day he died, to the great grief of the <hi>English,</hi> and the prejudice of the Service.

               <p>At the time that Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt</hi> went forth, the Lords Justices and Council, finding what ill Instruments the Priests continued to be, in kindling and fomenting the Rebellion, caused as many of them as were in Town to be seized on, who being put into <hi>French</hi> bottoms, were shipt into <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>By this time the intended preparations to march forth, under the Lieutenant General (the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi>) were ready; The Design was to relieve several Places of strength, some besieged, others much distressed by their wants and necessities, but which way the Army was<note place="margin">The Marquiss of <hi>Ormonds</hi> Expedition.</note> to march, or what Place they were first to go to, was kept as a secret; However the Army, <hi>Saturday</hi> the second of <hi>April,</hi> 1642. marched from <hi>Dublin</hi> towards the <hi>Naas,</hi> with 8000 Foot, and 500 Horse, arriving at <hi>Athy,</hi> the 5th. being 27 miles from <hi>Dublin;</hi> from whence they sent out several Parties to relieve <hi>Carlow, Marryburrough, Balinokill,</hi> the <hi>Burr, Caterlagh, Clogh-grevan, Ballylivan,</hi> and several other Castles and Towns then in distress, which they did without much opposition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leasing many Women, Children, and other unprofitable People, much incommoding those Places; Sir <hi>Patrick Weams,</hi> Captain of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Generals Troop, Captain <hi>Armstrong,</hi> Captain <hi>Yarner,</hi> Captain <hi>Harman,</hi> Captain <hi>Schout,</hi> Colonel <hi>Crafford,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Coote,</hi> in their several Commands,

doing excellent service in their Relief of these Castles, and strong Holds; The last passing with no little danger through <hi>Mountrath</hi> Woods (whence Sir <hi>Charles Coote's</hi> Heir had his title worthy his, and his Fathers merits) to <hi>Marryburrough,</hi> a Place of great consequence, seated amongst ill Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Whilst these things were acting, the Rebels having gathered their Forces from <hi>Wickloe, Wexford, Caterlagh, Kildare, Queen's</hi> County, <hi>Kilkenny, Tipperary,</hi> and <hi>West-Meath,</hi> on <hi>Easter</hi> Sunday, the 10th. of <hi>April,</hi> they displayed 40 Colours, within two miles of <hi>Athy,</hi> near the <hi>Barrow,</hi> (of which Colonel <hi>Crafford</hi> gave speedy intelligence) under the Command of the Lord Viscount <hi>Mountgarret,</hi> the Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's great Unkle, making of the old <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> near 10000 men, Horse and Foot; which the Lieutenant General perceiving, on the other side of the River of the <hi>Barrow,</hi> to have sent out some Horse near <hi>Tankards<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town,</hi> over against <hi>Grangemellain;</hi> His Lordship return'd to <hi>Athy,</hi> giving out he would fight them the next day; but their numbers vastly exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his, and he, having done the service he went out for, thought it as honourable to retire to <hi>Dublin,</hi> in the face of them, with Sir <hi>John Bowen, Fitz-Girrald</hi> of <hi>Timoga, Richard Grace</hi> of <hi>Marryburrough,</hi> and Captain <hi>Crosby,</hi> Prisoners.

                  <hi>Kilrush</hi> and <hi>Rathmore,</hi> about 20 miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Army of the Rebels drew up in a place of advantage, to hinder the passage of the <hi>English</hi> Army, having two great Ditches on each Wing, so high that we could see no more then the heads of their Pikes, and with such a hill before, (betwixt them and us) that we could scarce see their Colours, the wind also on their backs, and a great Bog a mile behind them. However the Lieutenant General called a Councel under a thorn hedge, (being loath to venture so gallant an Army on such disadvantages) but the <hi>English</hi> Commanders were all of opinion, they should be fought with, numbers making no difference, where the Cause was so good: in as much as Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> told them in few words, that he discern'd fear in the Rebels faces, as well as Guilt in their Persons, and that he thought they would hardly stay, till his Lordship had put his men in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the battle, and therefore desired they might have presently Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to fall on, which indeed he was ever ready to obey before the Word was given, neither the matter nor the time now admitting of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Whereupon, <hi>Friday</hi> the 15th. of <hi>April,</hi> about 7 in the morning, the <hi>English</hi> Army marching, as if they would force their way to <hi>Dublin,</hi> leaving in and about <hi>Athy,</hi> Captain <hi>Erasmus Burrows,</hi> Captain <hi>Grimes,</hi> Captain <hi>Thomas Welden,</hi> and the two Captain <hi>Piggots,</hi> with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, 300 whereof was part of our Army, which made ever now and then (as the Enemy halted) an halt, and resolving to fight the Enemy, drew up in that sort as did best agree with the Ground; Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> (who commanded in chief under his Lordship) had the ordering of the Foot; Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas</hi> of the right Wing of Horse, and Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile</hi> of the left; The Lieutenant-General having many Gentlemen with him, (who voluntarily followed him in that expedition) put them all in a Troop, under the Command of Major <hi>Ogle,</hi> a <hi>Reformade,</hi> (a worthy Person) and himself in the midst of the first rank of them, and so attended the Encounter; the Ordnance first began to play, but without much effect; The Rebels Army led by <hi>Mountgarret, Purcel Baron of Loghmo, Hugh-mac Phelim Birn,</hi> Lieutenant of the <hi>Leimster</hi> Forces,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93738:57"/>
Colonel <hi>Toole,</hi> Sir <hi>Morgan Cavenagh,</hi> Colonel <hi>Morris Cavenagh, Arthur Caanaugh,</hi> Colonel <hi>Bagnall,</hi> the Lord <hi>Dunboyne,</hi> Colonel <hi>Roger Moore,</hi> was drawn up (as I have said) in a place of great advantage, upon the top of a hill, where there were but too narrow passages to come at them; yet our forlorn Hope (commanded by Captain <hi>Rochford</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of 150 Musketiers, making up the hill fiercely, discharged upon the Rebels, and was seconded by Captain <hi>Sandford,</hi> with his Fire-locks, Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> leading up the rest of the Foot with great celerity; Colonel <hi>Crafford</hi> in the Van, and <hi>Serjeant Major Pigot,</hi> excellently well discharging their Commands. But before these could come near them, our Horse both under Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile,</hi> (one charging at one of the passages, the other at the other) fell in upon them, who would not stand the first shock, but fled presently, taking their flight to a great Bog not far from them, (a Sanctuary which the <hi>Irish</hi> in all their flights, chuse commonly to provide for themselves, and seldom fail to make use of it) and so the <hi>English</hi> gain'd this Victory without any considerable loss, or much hazard; whilst a body of 2000 Rebels, led by the Lord Viscount <hi>Mountgarret,</hi> and General <hi>Hugh Birn,</hi> wheeling about, thought to possess themselves of our Ordnance, Carriage, and Ammunition, which my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> perceiving, drew out one of his Divisions to attend that great Body, and with them and some Voluntier Horse, to the number of 30. which were then with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, (the rest following the execution) he faced that Body, and within a short time put them to rout: there were not above 600. some write 300, of the <hi>Irish</hi> slain, amongst which, there was the Lord of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyn's</hi> Brothers, the Lord of <hi>Ikernis</hi> Sons, and Colonel <hi>Cavenagh's</hi> Heads, brought by the Souldiers to the Lieutenant General. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my lost twenty Colours, many Drums, all their Powder and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Lord <hi>Mountgarrets</hi> Wain, drawn by 8 Oxen, where all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision was, his Sumpture, and the Lord of <hi>Ikernis</hi> Sumpture. Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> who (by the quick flight of the <hi>Irish</hi>) was prevented from doing that service in the field he intended, followed with a Party of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the Bog which the Rebels had taken, which looked even black, (for their Apparel was generally black) being all cover'd over with them, and there began to fall upon them, as resolving upon a severe execution; But he was commanded to retire, <hi>having got Honour enough that day,</hi> and so the Army marched off the field confusedly, whereas that Victory (how just soever) is ill gloried in, which is the loss of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The Van of our Army lay that night at old <hi>Connel,</hi> the rest on the <hi>Corrough</hi> of <hi>Kildare,</hi> all in open field; arriving at <hi>Dublin</hi> the 17th. of <hi>April,</hi> where they were receiv'd by the Lords <hi>Justices</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> with all imaginable demonstrations of Joy and Honour; The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General's behaviour being presented to the King and Parliament, with the greatest advantage to his Person, as the business would afford: in as much as the Parliament voted 500 l. to be bestowed in a Jewel, and to be sent him, as an honourable mark of the high esteem they had of him, for that days service, which was accordingly done, and brought to his Lordship, with a Letter of thanks from them, though I do not hear that he did ever place the Jewel or Letter in his <hi>Archive;</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing we find his Majesty takes notice, that he was the Person very well approv'd of by the two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Houses of Parliament, so as the War of <hi>Ireland</hi> was still managed by his Care, and the future Concerns thereof

intrusted to his vigilance, as the condition of his Majesties Affairs there, should be thought important: though it was not long before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment entertain'd some jealousies, to the prejudice of his service against the Rebels, which (in reference to what was committed to his charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) never alter'd his Principles or Integrity.</p>

In the Spring following, Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> being inform'd of a good Prey of Cattle in the Barony of <hi>Athlone,</hi> towards <hi>Balniaslo,</hi> in the <hi>O Mores</hi> Country, he (with his Forces) adventur'd thither, got some Cattle, great quantity of Cloth, and other necessaries, killing many of their Souldiers in their beds; though in his return he was fought with by the Rebels, sculking in in-accessible Places, from whence he at last got free, with no small hazard to his Person, and loss to the Enemy; Major <hi>Sumner</hi> in this (as in the whole Siege of <hi>Castle-Coot,</hi> and other places in <hi>Connaght</hi>) doing excellent service, as Councellor, Engineer, and Souldier, worthily keeping his promise with one <hi>Kelly,</hi> a Gentleman of good Quality, and a kin to the Earl of <hi>Clanrikard,</hi> whom, begging his life, he saved, ransoming himself afterwards for 10. <hi>l.</hi> in money, ten barrels of Wheat, and as much Salt, which at the following Siege of <hi>Castle-Coot,</hi> proved of great value, being sold then at 2s. a Quart. After which in <hi>Easter</hi> week 1642. Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> attempted to relieve <hi>Ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> and (after some small dispute) did it, though the access to the Place was such, as a few men might have been able to have stop'd 1000. he found his greatest difficulty was to fill up the trenches that the Enemy had made, as his Horse might have free access, which at last he compass'd,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93738:58"/>
relieving the Place with what Cattle and other Provisions he got in his Expedition, not being a little startled, that by such a Troop as the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there had, and other Conveniencies, no more should have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore attempted. Nor had <hi>Roscommon, Tulsk, Elphin, Knockvicar, Abbey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyle, Belanfad,</hi> Persons less active in their defence, even from the first surprizals of the Rebels, acting to amazement, when nothing but their own courage secur'd their Forts; though the last, for want of Water, was compell'd (after a long siege) to yield to the Rebels, after that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's two Brothers, (the <hi>Kings</hi> from <hi>Boyle</hi>) with Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> had resolv'd to have reliev'd him; but at <hi>Carickdrumroosk,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> having intelligence that his own Castle was assaulted, he was forced<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> lands at <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</hi>
                  </note> to retire back, and very happily prevented that Design in the nick of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, though thereby the other Design was frustrated.</p>
               <p>The 30th. of <hi>April,</hi> the Lords <hi>Justices</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> appointed a Fast <hi>to be observed monthly upon each</hi> Friday <hi>before the Sacrament, to continue until Declaration were made to the contrary, for the wonderful discovery of the late Plot against the State and true Religion, as for the happy and prosperous success which God in his mercy had given his Majesties Forces against the Rebels, and for the avoiding Gods just indignation for the future.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the return of our Forces from the Battle of <hi>Kilrush,</hi> within few days, <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> Lord Viscount <hi>Lisle,</hi> eldest Son to the Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> landed at <hi>Dublin,</hi> (his Regiment having arriv'd before.)

               <p>Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> accompanied the Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> in this Action, which,<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> relieve the Lady <hi>Offalia.</hi>
                  </note> with 120 Foot and 300 Horse, was perform'd without much difficulty, the Rebels not daring to attend their Approaches to the Castle in a Body, but made little skirmishes from the Bogs as they passed along. In their way they took in the strong Fort of <hi>Phillips-Town</hi> in <hi>Kings-County,</hi> which was built upon a Pass in a Countrey, almost inaccessible in the former Wars, and kept always by the <hi>English</hi> against the <hi>Irish;</hi> but the Rebels, having by Treachery surprized this, (as they had done most of the other Places of <hi>Ireland</hi>) it was now taken from them by this small Party under the Lord <hi>Lisle,</hi> with their Pistols and Muskets, the swiftness of their March, and the illness of the Way, not admitting any other Artillery, such an Enemy not much needing it.</p>
               <p>Being now upon their return to <hi>Dublin,</hi> understanding that the Lord <hi>Gormanston,</hi> and other Lords and Gentlemen of the Pale, had gather'd a considerable Force together about <hi>Trym,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> (by the advice<note place="margin">They take in <hi>Trym.</hi>
                  </note> of Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi>) turn'd his March that way with that small compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. When they came near the Town, they saw those Lords at no great
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93738:59"/>
distance from them, but in such a posture as shewed they intended not to fight; and so facing about, they marched directly into the Town of <hi>Trym,</hi> which was a Place of very inconsiderable strength, but pleasantly situated upon the River of the <hi>Boyne,</hi> in an open Champion Countrey, and incompassed with a stone-Wall so old and ruinous, as afforded (in some places of it) entrance to Horse, over the heaps of rubbish, that lay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the Wall. The Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> approach'd with those Forces to the Town, and Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> finding a place where he could get in some of his Horse, brought them on, and got them in without opposition, the Lords of the Pale resolving, of their dis-ability, to keep that Town, (though they had treble the number of the Assailants) quitted it, and march'd out in some hast, while the Lord <hi>Lisle</hi>'s Horse enter'd in: so as they became Masters of the Town without the loss of one Man, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a Place of great advantage, situated in the most plentiful part of the Rebel's Quarters, they resolv'd to make a Garrison of it. And for this Reason Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> got the Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> to go to the Lords Justices at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and acquaint them with the success they had had, and the great benefit which might redound to the service of the <hi>State,</hi> if they would think fit to send them down Moneys to fortifie that Place, and a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Foot to keep it.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> (willing to improve all Arguments that might secure the present Affair) took some of his Horse to guard him to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and soon acquainted their Lordships with the Concern, pressing the Business with all advantages imaginable, whilst the Rebels having notice (the day following) of his repair to <hi>Dublin,</hi> (no Business being carried so private, as they had not soon intelligence thereof) gathered all their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together, and having near 3000 Men, they came (in the dead of the<note place="margin">The Rebels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> in <hi>Trym.</hi>
                  </note> Night) to the very Walls of <hi>Trym,</hi> before they were discerned, thinking to surprize it. But the Sentinels gave the Alarm, and Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> (who never us'd to go to Bed when he was abroad) was the first that took it, and having his Horse ready, presently mounted, but could not (at the instant) get above 17 Horse with him; with these, however, he goes to the Gates, knowing that expedition was not only the life of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but must (at that time) be the only means of their preservation. He issued out, and fac'd the Enemy, very numerous, making their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches towards them, some few more Horse re-inforcing his strength: He charged the first Troop of the Rebels that came towards him, routing them immediately, and following on, (upon their disorder) charg'd their main Body, which presently began to grow loose, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, so vigorously charg'd in amongst them, as they all betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to flight, and he (having now more Men come out of the Town) pursued them with great alacrity, doing singular execution with his own hands. And as he was encouraging his Men, (bravely to pursue their<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> slain at <hi>Trym.</hi>
                  </note> flying Enemy) he was unfortunately shot in the Body (as it was thought) by one of his own Troopers, whether by design or accident was never known, it being (for many months after his death) generally report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as generally believed, that <hi>He</hi> was accidentally slain by one of the flying Rebels, who in despair turn'd about and discharg'd his Musket at him. And this end had this <hi>gallant Gentleman,</hi> who began to be so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the Enemy, as his very Name was formidable to them: His Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was brought to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and there inter'd with great solemnity, floods of <hi>English</hi> tears accompanying him to his Grave: After whose death, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93738:60"/>
Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt</hi>'s, the Fate of the <hi>English</hi> Interest in <hi>Ireland</hi> seem'd eclips'd, if not buried; the great Artifice being then (under several pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences) to keep the Souldiers within their Garrisons, to consume the Provisions and Stores they had, or else to lead them forth without any considerable service till the Battle of <hi>Ross.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> 1642. came over some Regiments, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conduct of Sir <hi>Foulk Hunks,</hi> and Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Kirk,</hi> who brought over the Regiment design'd for the Lord <hi>Rannelagh;</hi> whereupon two Regiments were immediately dispatch'd for <hi>Connaght,</hi> and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied thither by the Lord Lieutenant, who in that Expedition, took by storm, <hi>Knocklinch,</hi> a strong Castle of Mr. <hi>Linches,</hi> the besieged, except Women, (not accepting of Quarter) were put to the sword; and <hi>Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleston,</hi> a Castle of the Lord <hi>Trimbleston</hi>'s, quitted on the former's success, as <hi>Kymkelf,</hi> a fair Castle of the Lord <hi>Nettervile</hi>'s, and divers other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: And upon his approach towards <hi>Athlone,</hi> Sir <hi>James Dillon</hi> (who had besieged it ever since <hi>Christmass</hi>) ran away; so that the Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, with about 50 Horse, and some 200 Foot, met the Lieutenant General 5 miles from <hi>Athlone;</hi> and after an hour or two's stay in the Field, the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> took leave of the Lord President, leaving at his departure a Regiment for the President himself, and another under Sir <hi>Michael Earnly,</hi> Sir <hi>Abraham Shipman,</hi> and Sir <hi>Bernard Ashley,</hi> and two Troops of Horse, with which Forces the Lord President might have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all <hi>Connaght,</hi> except <hi>Galloway.</hi> But he, instead of imploying such brave Men abroad, while the Summer lasted, kept them at home on short and rotten Commons, whereby most of them were famish'd, or contracted mortal Diseases, and were presently so enfeebled, that the tenth Man was hardly able to march. In the mean time, all almost that had fought against him of his Neighbours, were receiv'd under Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was never paid, nor Victuals brought in for his Men, though the Countrey yet abounded in Corn and Cattle; so that the Garrison of <hi>Castle-Coot,</hi> for meer pity, baked Bread, and sent them many Cart-fulls thereof, bringing away in their empty Carts many of their sick Men, that they might not perish. And yet at last the General (the Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident) was perswaded to draw out his Men to service, besieging <hi>Ballagh</hi> Castle, in the mid-way between <hi>Roscommon</hi> and <hi>Athlone,</hi> wherein he made a breach, and commanded a Party to storm it. The Rebels killed many of our Men that day by shot, besides what perish'd by Stones, and other Materials thrown from the top of the Castle; the Night afterwards the Rebels stole to a Bog, not far distant, through the negligence of our Guards, and left us the Castle. The next Exploit of my Lord President, was (with the remnant of the two <hi>English</hi> Regiments, and what could be spared out of our Garrisons thereabouts) a March towards <hi>Balintober,</hi> to which he was provoked by the Enemy, and stimulated on by his own Party, impatient of further delays. <hi>O Conner Dun</hi> of <hi>Balintober,</hi> ever since his Son was taken, till now, (that is the middle of <hi>July,</hi> 1642.) had acted nothing, though the tacit Votes of the Province did seem to own him as their King, Prince, <hi>Roy telel,</hi> or what Name of Supremacy in that Province could be greatest; who seeing that those Forces which were sent from <hi>England,</hi> to the Lord President, to subdue that Province, (which at first much frighted the Rebels) had done nothing of moment, through a supine negligence, if not worse, and were much less considerable than those Forces which we had before, he began to awake out of his Ale and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93738:60"/>
Aqua-vitae, and to call in Subjects to help him, out of all the Parts of <hi>Connaght;</hi> but above all that came to joyn with him, none were more forward, or came in greater numbers, than the County of <hi>Maio</hi>-Men, and the rather, because in all the Conflicts of <hi>Connaght</hi> with the <hi>English,</hi> few of that great County came to fight with us. They drew together 1800 or 2000 Foot, and 160 Horse, and more had joyn'd with them, if we had defer'd to visit them. It was therefore adjudged necessary by the Lord President, Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> Sir <hi>Mich. Earnly,</hi> Sir <hi>Abraham Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Sir <hi>Edw. Povey,</hi> Sir <hi>Bernard Ashley,</hi> and others of the Council of War, That we should draw out all the Men, sick or sound, that were able to march, and march to <hi>Balintober.</hi> It was a wonder to see with what alacrity and courage, our new-come <hi>English</hi> put themselves on this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, even they that were ready to die, (as divers of them did on the way) rejoycing that they might expire, doping their Countrey the best service they could, as Souldiers, and not as Dogs on a Dunghil. Our March that day was from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Roscommon,</hi> through <hi>Molinterim,</hi> and over the Hill of <hi>Oran,</hi> near <hi>Clalby,</hi> which is little more than 2 miles from <hi>Balin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Battle of <hi>Balintober,</hi> fought at a Place called now <hi>Na Nart,</hi> the mid-way betwixt <hi>Oran</hi> and <hi>Balintober.</hi>
                  </note> from thence we might see the Enemy coming with all speed to meet us. The Lord President was of opinion that our Forces should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and commanded it; but the rest were otherwise resolv'd, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Orders drew on towards the Rebels, whilst he washed his hands from what evil might accrew. Our Commanders as they march'd, agreed how to order their Men, and on what piece of Ground; but the Enemy came on so fast, that they could not gain the Ground desired, which made the Work on our part more difficult, for all the way on that Hill, till we come near <hi>Balintober,</hi> is boggy, with great long Heath in all places, very unfit for Horse-service. However, when the Rebels came near us, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Rob. King</hi> with his Troop (well mounted, and well arm'd with Back and Brest, and as well disciplin'd as any in <hi>Ireland</hi>) was commanded to pass by their Front to their left Flank, as Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edw. Povey,</hi> with the rest of their Troops, being before, nearer to the top of that ridge of Ground, were almost past, that they might make way for our forlorn Hope of Musketiers, to play in the Front of their great Body of Pikes coming on. Captain <hi>Rob. King</hi> (an old Souldier) in executing of this, saw (by the badness of the Ground he march'd on, and by the Rebels haste to come up) that he should not, without disorder, get by the left Point of this Battalia, gave order to his Men to fire in flank all at once, when they should be close up with the Point of the Battalia, over one another's Horses Manes, which was a thing seldom heard of or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, yet was no new thing either to him or his, for he had taught them this, amongst other Points of War he had long nurtur'd them in, which they exactly perform'd, when he was come within two Pikes lengths of the Enemy, with their Carbines. At which time our forlorn Hope of Foot being come up, fired with excellent success on that part of the Front that lay to the right hand; so that by this unexpected way of firing by the Horse, (timely assisted by the Foot) the Enemy was soon put into disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with the loss of many Men; which breach Captain <hi>King</hi> soon appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending, and finding the Pikes of the fall'n Men to have intangled and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led others, he rush'd in with his Horse, and breaking the left corner of the Battalia, so amazed the Rebels, as they fell into disorder, who (quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Pikes all at once) made a great noise, and began to run; but before their running, (that was almost as soon as Captain <hi>King</hi> was got
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93738:61"/>
into their Front) Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Povey</hi> charg'd them in the Flank with their Troops, with which they had kept the upper Ground, on purpose to encounter with the 160 Horse of the Rebels; and to them was Captain <hi>Robert King</hi> drawing to second them, or to fall into the Flank of this Battalia, (which he had new broken) but the Rebels Horse fled before they were able to come near, and therefore they had leisure to fall into the Flank of the Foot. This Battalia of Pikes was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be 1200. They had 1000 Musketeers, which either by bad way, or staying longer than the other, for to receive Ammunition, were not come up to begin the Battel, but were within Musket-shot, who also ran for company. Our men pursued, and killed most of them, but were commanded not to come too near <hi>Balintober,</hi> where the Credulous were to believe, some had seen beyond the Castle another great Body of Men; so as not pursuing this Victory, we lost the benefit of it. In this Battel there was a young Gentleman on the <hi>Irish</hi> side, who very gallantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himself, after that his Party was fled, getting to the corner of a Ditch, where with his Pike he withstood the encounter of five Horse that had spent their shot, till an Agantick Soldier of the <hi>English</hi> getting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, slew him. And amongst the dead, one pulling a Mountero from the head of one, there fell down long Tresses of flaxen hair, who being further search'd, was found a Woman. After this, the President consider'd what was to be attempted; and it was resolv'd to go into the County of <hi>Galloway.</hi> But as in all other Designs, many Objections were alledg'd, and the Lord President with a few, accompani'd with the Marquis of <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickard,</hi> went to <hi>Galloway,</hi> before which the Lord <hi>Forbes</hi> (Lieutenant General under the Lord <hi>Brook</hi>) was come (the <hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> 1642.) to besiege the Town with a Fleet; and having taken possession of the Abbey near adjoyning, landed many of his Battering Guns. But before he attempted any thing (according to his Commission) he first advised with the present Governour, (the Lord of <hi>Clanrickard</hi>) affectionate to his Majesties Service. As the Town seem'd to be placing his Majesties Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours on the top of their Tower, charging Captain <hi>Willoughby</hi> (Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Fort) with the breach of Pacification, (an Agreement, it seems, assented to by the State) though in vindication of himself, he and Captain <hi>Ashley</hi> alledg'd much: Great straits he had been put to, though at length happily reliev'd by the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> when he was closely Beleaguer'd, together with the Archbishop of <hi>Tuam (Richard Boyle)</hi> and his Family, besides 36 Ministers, 26 of which serv'd as Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and did their Duty. After all, the Lord <hi>Forbes</hi> being by the Town, the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> and the President of <hi>Connaght</hi> (with whom he had had several ineffectual Conferences) daily delay'd in what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to give Captain <hi>Willoughby</hi> satisfaction in, prepar'd to make his approach to the Town; but not being strengthen'd by any supply he could get from the Lord President, or Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> and dishear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd by Captain <hi>Willoughby,</hi> in that every House in the Town was a Fort, he drew off, being perswaded to a Composition to be paid in Money within two months, which he never got. And at the Lord Presidents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Athlone,</hi> the Soldiers Mutini'd, both Officers and Soldiers offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go to <hi>Dublin;</hi> but the Common Soldiers being very weak, not able to draw into a considerable Body, (the <hi>Irish Kerns</hi> killing all sick and fainty persons, that could not accompany the Body of the Army) that intent for the present was deferr'd; though not long after they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd

with Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile,</hi> whose seasonable relief, and the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Raconnel,</hi> will be mention'd in its due place. Whilst the Lord <hi>Forbes</hi> sail'd up <hi>Limerick</hi> River, relieving some Places, and without much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition took in <hi>Fits-Geralds</hi> (the Knight of the Valley, or Glyn) Castle, furnish'd with all Utensils and Provisions for a Family.</p>
               <p>About the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 700 Foot, and two Troops of Horse, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Gibson,</hi> went into <hi>Wickloe,</hi> where the Rebels not daring to face them, they got much Prey, burnt many Villages, and return'd with success.</p>
               <p>The Kings affairs now growing every day more straitned in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> than other, Sir <hi>Lewis Kirk</hi> at Court withdrew Sir <hi>Henry Stradling</hi> and <hi>Kettleby</hi> from guarding the <hi>Irish</hi> Coast, whereby presently after there came in both Arms and Ammunition in great quantities to <hi>Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi> as also several <hi>Irish</hi> Commanders, as <hi>Preston, Cullen, Plunket,</hi> and others, who having been Colonels in <hi>France,</hi> were readily entertain'd there, much to the heartning of the Rebels.</p>
               <p>However, in <hi>Ulster,</hi> the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Stewart</hi> and Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>

                  <hi>Stewart</hi> (Persons deserving excellently well of the State) near <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoe,</hi> got a considerable Victory over the Rebels under Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neal,</hi> slaying near 2000 of them, though much inferiour in number, Arms, and Ammunition; whilst <hi>Monroe</hi> sought them towards the <hi>Newry,</hi> but had not so good luck to encounter them, as he had the <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, when he gave the <hi>Irish</hi> Committee of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> this account, That with 2000 Foot and 300 Horse, he beat <hi>Owen Mac-Art O-Neal,</hi> Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neal,</hi> and <hi>Owen Mac-Art</hi> the General's Son, being all joyn'd together with their Forces, and forced them to return upon <hi>Charlemont:</hi> after quitting the Generals house to be spoil'd and burnt by them, with the whole Houses in <hi>Louhgall,</hi> being the best Plantation in <hi>Ulster,</hi> and straightest for defence of the Rebels.</p>
               <p>Thus in some places whilst we find the War succeeded, the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices in the midst of <hi>August,</hi> suspecting <hi>Preston</hi>'s Forces should increase, and (according to the resolution of the Parliament at <hi>Kelkenny</hi>) should first gain the Out-Garrisons, and then besiege <hi>Dublin,</hi> were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> to come unto their aid with 3000 Foot, and all the Horse he could procure, to prosecute the War in <hi>Leimster:</hi> Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd an Answer, That their Companies were so weak, they could not draw them together; and that the Rebels (having then receiv'd new Supplies) were strong, and that he was engag'd to meet the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> (the <hi>Scots</hi> General) to encounter <hi>Owen O-Neal,</hi> with all the Forces he could<note place="margin">See the Article 6. of <hi>Aug.</hi> 1642.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93738:62"/>
1000 men, and two Troops of Horse, 60 to each Troop; which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (besides the supplies mention'd) were listed in his Majesties Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, with Pay accordingly. But the Design being general, <hi>Munster</hi> (at length) was as well disturb'd as the rest of the Kingdom; <hi>Cashel, Clon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, Dungarvan,</hi> and <hi>Featherd,</hi> with other Places, were all (on an easie summons) soon yielded to the Rebels, raging through the Countrey; which the Lord President endeavour'd to suppress, as far as those small Forces he had with him would admit, resolving near <hi>Redsheard</hi> to have given them Battle, having (at that time) in his company the Earl of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymore,</hi> the Lord <hi>Dungarvan,</hi> the Lord <hi>Broghil,</hi> Sir <hi>Hardress Waller,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Denny,</hi> Serjeant Major <hi>Searl,</hi> Sir <hi>John Brown,</hi> Captain <hi>William Kingsmil,</hi> with 600 Foot, and 300 Horse. But the Rebels on the other side the Mountain privately avoided them, though four to one; and getting to <hi>Cashel,</hi> held there a general Rendezvous; from whence <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garret</hi> went with his Forces to <hi>Kilmallock,</hi> a Town treacherously surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the Rebels (a little before) on demand, situated on the Frontiers of the County of <hi>Limmerick</hi> towards <hi>Cork,</hi> environ'd with a strong Wall, which held out Loyally for the Crown all <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s Wars, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times strongly besieged, and highly distressed. And the <hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1641. he went to <hi>Butavant,</hi> where the Gentry from all parts appear'd. It is an antient Town, belonging to the Earl of <hi>Barrimore,</hi> in the Barony of <hi>Orrory,</hi> an old Nest of Abbots, Friers, and Priests.

               <p>And now having shewed you the effects of the <hi>English</hi> Courage strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reviv'd, and managed against the Rebels; it will be seasonable to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you by what means the Forces there have been animated to so eminent a Service.</p>
               <p>You have already read the generous resolutions of the Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> upon the first discovery of the Rebellion, as the encouragement his Majesty gave them upon his first and second appearance in the House of Lords, after his return from <hi>Scotland.</hi> And you have read (if it would have been admitted) how he would have adventured his Royal Person thither, and have rais'd 10000 <hi>English</hi> Volunteers speedily for that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if so the House of Commons would have declared that they would pay them; which would not be accepted, but instead thereof, the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> following, the Town and Castle of <hi>Carickfergus</hi> were advised<note place="margin">

setled at <hi>Windsor</hi> the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1641. But what service the <hi>Scots</hi> did in those Parts, more than subsist by <hi>English</hi> Pay, deserves an enquiry.</p>
               <p>It will now be convenient to acquaint you, that after many necessary Propositions to the <hi>King</hi> from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> (passionately affected with the miseries of <hi>Ireland</hi>) it was, in the Petition of the House of Commons, <hi>December</hi> the first, mov'd, <hi>That his Majesty would be pleas'd to forbear to alienate any of the Forfeited or Escheated Lands in</hi> Ireland, <hi>which shall accrue to the Crown, by reason of this Rebellion, that out of these, the Crown may be the better supported, and some satisfaction made to his Subjects of this Kingdom</hi> (England) <hi>for the great Expences they were like to undergo in this War.</hi> To which his Majesty answer'd, <hi>That concerning</hi> Ireland, <hi>he understood their desire, of not alienating the forfeited Lands thereof, to proceed from their much care and love, and likewise that it might be a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution very fit for him to take: But whether it be seasonable to declare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions of that nature before the event of a War be seen, that he much doubted. Howsoever, we cannot</hi> (repli'd his Majesty) <hi>but thank you for this care, and your chearful Engagement for the suppression of that Rebellion, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the speedy effecting whereof, the Glory of God in the Protestant Profession, the safety of the</hi> British <hi>there, our Honour, and that of the Nation so much depends; all the Interests of this Kingdom being so involv'd in that business.

               <p>And because his Majesty's removal to <hi>York</hi> from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> should not hinder the Supplies for <hi>Ireland,</hi> he, from <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> the 15th. of <hi>March,</hi> 1642. declares, <hi>That he doth very earnestly desire, that they will use all possible industry, in expediting the Business of</hi> Ireland, <hi>in which they shall find so chearful a concurrence by his</hi> Majesty, <hi>that no inconvenience shall happen to that Service by his absence, he having all that passion for the reducing of that Kingdom, which he hath expressed in his former Messages, and being unable by words to manifest more affection to it, than he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to do by those Messages, (having likewise done all such Acts, as he hath been mov'd unto by his</hi> Parliament;) <hi>therefore if the misfortunes and calamities of his poor Protestant Subjects shall grow upon them, (though his Majesty shall be deeply concern'd in, and sensible of their sufferings) he shall wash his hands before all the World, from the least imputation of slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in that most necessary and pious Work.</hi>

               <p>Thus both the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> interessed in the great Concern of <hi>Ireland,</hi> were passionately affected with her sad condition, whilst the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions and jealousies at home so dis-cemented their Forces, as the <hi>Irish</hi> Harp hung on the Willows, and those noble Souls (which even now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with Laurels) droopt betwixt the living and the dead.</p>

To which the Parliament adds, The calling away of Sir <hi>Charles Lloyd,</hi> Captain <hi>Green,</hi> and others, in actual imployment against the Rebels, attesting, that the 100000 <hi>l.</hi> borrowed of the Subscription-Money for <hi>Ireland,</hi> they soon re-paid with advantage, being then forc'd to make use of it, to prepare a competent Army for the defence of the King and Kingdom, without any prejudice to the Affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whose subsistence depends on the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of this. In Answer to which it was replied, That that Kingdom (were the Money restored) in the mean time suffered by that Diversion; and that had the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi>'s Forces been approved of, there was no further security, (that those should have been sent for <hi>Ireland</hi>) than other Forces that were rais'd for that purpose, and yet imployed against his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty at <hi>Edge-hill;</hi> the other Exceptions of the Parliament (in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Papers) being also answer'd, which begot a Reply, not altogether pertinent in this place to pursue.</p>
               <p>However, the <hi>Parliaments</hi> imploying the 100000 <hi>l.</hi> (contrary to the Interest of the foremention'd Act, in the 17th. year of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. with his Majesties full consent before he left the Parliament,) was the cause that it produced so little good effect for <hi>Ireland;</hi> many of the Subscribers taking that occasion (as others before had done upon his Majesties mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to go for <hi>Ireland</hi>) to withdraw their subscriptions, and others not to pay in their Money, which was with so much Caution provided for, and guarded with so many advantagious Circumstances for all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, as if it had been carried on, and seasonably applied, with that Care and Sincerity it ought to have been, <hi>it would in a little time have reduc'd that whole Kingdom, and have eas'd that poor People of many of those Calamities, they have since endur'd.</hi> The want of which put the <hi>Lords Justices</hi> and <hi>State</hi> on many difficulties.</p>
               <p>Yet that something might seem to be done, there was an Order of the Commons House of Parliament, the 3d. of <hi>August,</hi> 1642. <hi>That the Ministers about the City of</hi> London, <hi>should be desired to exhort the People, to bestow old Garments and Apparel, upon the distressed Protestants in</hi> Ireland; in reference to which, the 19th. of <hi>September</hi> following, the <hi>Lord Mayor of London</hi> ordered, that those Cloaths should be brought to <hi>Yorkshire-hall</hi> in <hi>Blackwel-hall,</hi> to be ready for shipping them for <hi>Ireland;</hi> and a vast Supply was brought in, Charity never so much manifested its compassion as in that Cause; which afterwards was entrusted to a Reverend Person, who discharged his trust with singular Prudence and Integrity; though as to the Army these Cloaths never reach'd or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>And now the Rebels finding their Strength much augmented by the unhappy differences in <hi>England,</hi> their chief Contrivers of the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

               <p>And as to Civils, they had their Officers of State, Justices of <hi>Oyer and Terminer,</hi> and of the Peace, with their Courts of Judicature in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kinds, and Councils Supreme, County, Provincial, and (on occasion) National; this being as Parliamentary called their <hi>General Assembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had their Negotiations also abroad, and from abroad, and by Envoys, Agents, and publick Ministers, Extraordinary and Resident; they receiv'd the sense of other Princes, and return'd their own, being also by those Princes treated at home, in like manner as if they had been some State absolute, or more considerable; of which, read the <note n="*" place="margin">Appendix 8.</note>

               <p>By what I have mention'd you may see, how the Rebels endeavour'd to get credit abroad, and repute at home, managing their Concerns with so much subtilty, as having them anvil'd in every <hi>Covent:</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was omitted to mature their designs, or colour what they had now begun with the fairest pretence; whilst the <hi>State</hi> in the interim (through the distractions in <hi>England</hi> daily increasing, which gave fresh fuel to the Rebels presumption) were so straitned for want of Supplies, that the <hi>Lords Justices</hi> having (by all the ways imaginable) represented (as well to his Majesty as to the Parliament) the miserable condition they were in; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring them, that without further Supplies of all kinds, (the Soldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so unruly, as the Lieutenant General, the <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1642. was forc'd to publish a sharp Proclamation against their exorbitancies) it was not possible for them to carry on the War, or to hinder the Incursions of the Rebels, even into those parts which they had recovered out of their hands; thought fit to take another course for the present: And that the<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Custodiums</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to the Soldiers.</note> Forces they had in <hi>Ireland</hi> might be ready for action, and in the mean time not wholely unserviceable, they allotted (after no little opposition to the contrary) to several Captains and other Officers of the Army, such convenient Houses and Villages, as they had taken from the Rebels, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them leave to carry their several Troops and Companies under their Command to Quarter in them; by which means they freed themselves from the present Charge of providing Victuals for them, forcing them to live upon the spoils of their Enemies; which they quickly found the way to do, and made themselves Masters of all the Cattel and other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of those that lived within reasonable distance of them. By which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93738:70"/>
means, all the considerable Places belonging to the Rebels (within twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles of <hi>Dublin</hi>) came to be in the hands of the Soldiers, as having them granted by way of <hi>Custodium</hi> for the present unto them: an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient acceptable to the Officers, and extremely prejudicial to the Rebels.</p>
               <p>The <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> the Lords Justices and Council finding themselves much prejudic'd by their Protections they had given to many, who under pretext of labouring at the Plow, had their Weapons hidden near them, to cut off stragling Soldiers and Protestants, as they passed by them single. The State, to prevent such inconveniencies, withdrew their former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections by a Proclamation of that Date. A circumstance much insisted on by the Rebels; but the Reasons of the State will best appear by their Proclamation, no Protection being ever violated by the State with their<note place="margin">Appendix 9.</note> privity, or revoked, but on time given.</p>
               <p>And now that the State of <hi>Ireland</hi> might have the less charge upon<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Mac-Guire</hi> and <hi>Mac-Mahon</hi> sent into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> them, they thought it convenient to send the Lord <hi>Mac-Guire</hi> and <hi>Mac-Mahon</hi> into <hi>England;</hi> whose Fates I shall here give you a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, though they suffered not till some years after.</p>

which he desir'd respite for the summoning of his Witnesses; which, in consideration that his Lordship had had long time to expect his Trial, and that no Witnesses could say any thing against what the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses (on the Kings side) could prove, was deni'd. Afterwards he made a general Challenge against 23 that were Empannel'd for the first Jury; which peremptory Challenge was accepted, the Law allowing it: And the Prisoner (for that time) was discharg'd, with a Command to be brought again the next day; which was done accordingly. Then he mov'd, that his Plea of Peerage might be referr'd to another Court, or to the Lords; but that was deni'd, for that he had put himself on the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: besides, the Lords and Commons had order'd his Trial. Then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Jury was nam'd, which his Lordship accepted against, for that <hi>he conceiv'd it not fit, that those who had bought his Land, should pass upon his Trial.</hi> To clear which (after some heats in arguing betwixt the Kings Council and the Defendant) the Judge consented, that the Jury should be required upon Oath to answer, whether any of them had any Adventure, or share of the Rebels Lands in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Which being answer'd in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, the Court proceeded; and he being in several Circumstances (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his Confession) found Guilty, the Judge demanded, why Sentence should not pass against him, his Lordship (amongst other things, too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and of little concern to mention) desir'd to know by what Seal the Judge proceeded against him? Who answer'd, By the Old, and Order of Parliament. To which the Lord <hi>Mac-Guire</hi> repli'd, That (under favour) he conceiv'd, that the Ordinance of Parliament for a new Great Seal, made the old invalid. To which the Judge repli'd, That he acted by the old Seal, being made a Judge at that time. Besides, there is nothing (saith he) done in this Court by the new Seal; the Sheriffs are hereby a Charter that comes in from year to year, and there is no other Seal in order of Execution. After which, the Judge proceeded to Sentence, which he heard patiently, having doubtless long the Sentence of death in himself; and<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Mac-Guire</hi>'s end.</note> accordingly he was Drawn, Hang'd, and Quarter'd, at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1644.</p>
               <p>But to return to the <hi>State,</hi> who, in the manner before mention'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd the Army Quarter'd in several <hi>Custodiums,</hi> not being able (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the want of Money, Provisions, and other necessaries) otherwise to furnish any part of it out in such manner, as might put them in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture to undertake any great Action abroad; some in the interim im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the present necessities to the advantage of a Design then in the womb.</p>
               <p>However we find, that though the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> wonder'd (as one in eminent Place then heard) that the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> did little, <hi>Yet it was to be admired</hi> (writes he <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> 1642.</note>) <hi>they did so much, considering the small means they had to effect so great things: They did then abound onely in sickness, and hurt men, which made the Regiments and Companies very weak; Monies came not in at all, and for Cloathes and Shoes few or none: notwithstanding they had hearts manifested by their works; for no Enemy, but as soon as they looked on them, instead of using their Arms, exercis'd their Heels; no Fort or Castle which they offer'd to keep, which they ever deserted, or any that they attempted, but yielded to them.</hi> In as much as that <hi>Noble Person</hi> (which observ'd this) in some passion could not but take notice, That if all this were nothing, let it be so esteem'd! The Enemy in the interim having supplies of Men and Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:93738:71"/>Indeed that Affairs proceeded with no currenter a pace, (this year) many obstacles contributed thereunto. The Government was in the hands of <hi>Two,</hi> though in the main entirely faithful and knowing, yet<note place="margin">Causes why Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs prospered no better.</note> vastly differing in their tempers; <hi>one</hi> being of a sedentary, the <hi>other</hi> of an active life; <hi>He</hi> allied to most of the leading Men of the Council, the other onely prevalent as his Reason and Gallantry, wrought on the generous. Besides, <hi>some</hi> had such interest else-where, as all was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented with such integrity as was meant; That, in the management of Affairs at the Helm, Authority it self was often Eclipsed; nor could <hi>any</hi> (who was necessitated to hold the Reins with others) possibly evade the inconveniences they were then frequently inforced upon, how well soever they had been vers'd in the Art of Government; <hi>some</hi> will have it, that there was much artifice used to lengthen out the War: For at that time, whether by the Governours of the City of <hi>Dublin</hi>'s omission, or some other Fate upon the Army, hard for me to determine, the Rebels on one side came often to the Gates, giving frequent Alarms, and took away the Cattle from under the Walls. And in <hi>Lowth, the most considerable Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> was almost destroyed through <hi>those Persons,</hi> who (having the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the County) protected their Tenants; nor would <hi>those</hi> that had Power to force a Supply improve their interest, being better able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse an Enemy, than disoblige a Neighbour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> General (the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi>) in the North, who with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and veterate Soldiers made up 20000, did little, desirous rather it seems to keep themselves safe in <hi>Knockfergus,</hi> and the Frontiers, than ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture much abroad, as appear'd by their repulse at <hi>Charlemont,</hi> whence they retir'd with no Honour, and admitted <hi>Dunganon</hi> to be re-taken by the <hi>Irish,</hi> after it had been bravely recovered by the vertue of an <hi>English</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. Indeed the <hi>English-Scots,</hi> who joyn'd with the <hi>English</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, did excellent service; and that the other fail'd, may be imputed to the rawness of their Men, the want of Victuals, (of which they stood in great need) and some hardship they endur'd, happily not incident to their tenderness.</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>Connaght,</hi> such was the carriage of <hi>some</hi> there, that two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Regiments, consisting of full 2000 Men, were in six months reduc'd, through want, (though the Countrey thereabouts was stored with all manner of Provisions, not having been harrass'd by an Enemy) to 600. Upon which, several Articles were preferr'd by Persons of Honour, against <hi>those,</hi> who were charg'd with that misfortune, and the business, referr'd to the <hi>Council of War;</hi> which wav'd their Censure; and the main Parties concern'd therein voluntarily undergoing (afterwards) a private Duel, (producing no ill to either Party) no more was urg'd thereupon: Though as to the carriage of that business (in reference to the Soldiers Clothes and Necessaries) it could not easily be wip'd of, nor the desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Government without Orders, where there was more store of Ammunition, Arms, and other Necessaries, than Soldiers to use them.</p>
               <p>However, in <hi>August</hi> this year, 1642. the Lord <hi>Moor,</hi> Sir <hi>John Borlase</hi> jun. and Colonel <hi>Gibson,</hi> with 500 Men apiece, went into the Counties of <hi>Lowth</hi> and <hi>Meath,</hi> with two Pieces of Battery, and two Field-Pieces, with which they assaulted the Castle of <hi>Sedan,</hi> obstinately defended thirty hours by Captain <hi>Flemming,</hi> thrice stormed, who at last fought with them out of the Ruines. At which time the Lords of the Pale were not so reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, the Lord <hi>Gormanston</hi> flying from the Fort of the <hi>Nabar,</hi> and the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93738:72"/>
Lord <hi>Slane,</hi> from the Castle of <hi>Newtown,</hi> thereby leaving <hi>Lowth</hi> and <hi>Meath</hi> clear'd of the Enemy; who finding good heels lost 500 onely at <hi>Sedan,</hi> whilst Captain <hi>Burrows, Pigot,</hi> and <hi>Grimes,</hi> with some others, defeated 800 of the Rebels near <hi>Athy,</hi> and slew about 200.</p>
               <p>And now in respect that the State found great inconveniencies by the Protections, the Commissioners (they had formerly given authority to,) gave, the State of the Countrey being now far different from the Condition wherein it stood, 27 of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. at the granting of the said Protections; and that the Rebels of all Degrees and Conditions, had since with hateful and bloody obstinacy declared their Purpose, to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the <hi>British</hi> throughout the whole Kingdom, without hope of reconcilement, other then by the strength of his Majesties Forces; They did the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> 1642. revoke, repeal, make void, and annul all such Protections, from and after ten days from the date thereof, more at large to be seen in the Instrument it self in the Appendix, carrying weighty reasons for that Act.</p>
               <p>The <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> the Lords, in a Letter to Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> sent a Copy of the Rebels Petition, together with the Rebels of the <hi>Pales</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> in the answer to which, exceptions were taken, that they had not sent the Original, and with all took notice, that as his Majesty would be ready to punish the Rebels, so he would not shut up his mercy against those who did unfeignedly repent; upon which the Original was sent, and his Majesties Pardon beg'd.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Lord <hi>Lisle,</hi> with the men under his Command, marched<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Lisle</hi>'s Expedition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Westmeath,</hi> &amp;c.</note> towards the Counties of <hi>Westmeath,</hi> and <hi>Cavan,</hi> where they arriv'd about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> having destroyed all where they had pass'd, without striking a stroak; the Rebels being (according to their usual Custom) retired to Places of strength, (confiding more in their Walls then Valour) wherefore passing into the County of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> he sate down before <hi>Carrickmacross,</hi> a house of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s, very well Fortified, where the Rebels having endured the battery of two small Pieces of Cannon for one day, fled away the next night (the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Guards of the Besiegers, being remisly attended) leaving their Provisions of all sorts behind them: The Lord <hi>Lisle,</hi> after this success, better much then he could expect, with so small Forces, having put a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison in the Place, returned to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About one month after my Lord <hi>Lisle</hi>'s return to <hi>Dublin,</hi> the <hi>State</hi> was inform'd by the Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> that <hi>Carrickmacross</hi> was besieged by near 2000 Rebels, and that if it were not suddainly relieved, not onely the Place would be taken, but our men lost; whereupon it was resolv'd to send away presently 1000 Foot, with some Troops of Horse, under the Command of Sir <hi>Henry Tichborn</hi> and my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> to raise the Siege; And it fell into debate what should be done with the Place, and upon a due consideration of all Circumstances, and an impossibility on our part, to Man and Victual the Place; from hence an Act of Council was made <hi>for the demolishing of the house, and bringing of our men back:</hi> before this was put in execution, Letters came from Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. <hi>Vaughan</hi>'s Resolution.</note> from <hi>Dundalk,</hi> to acquaint the <hi>State,</hi> that with 100 Foot and 50 Horse, he had been to see in what state <hi>Carrick</hi> was; that he found the men well, Victualled for 14 days, and that the Siege was raised; that there came upon him in his return 2000 of the Rebels, who charged him, and (as Captain <hi>Martin</hi> said) shot near 5000 shot at his men, who thereupon
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93738:72"/>
began to be somewhat in disorder, so as he saw they could not well retire; Whereupon he charged them with his Horse, routed them, killing 30 or 40 of them, and got some Arms: Yet the resolution taken to demolish <hi>Carick</hi> was not alter'd.</p>
               <p>The Summer being thus spent, the Winter apace drew on, and the Provisions of the County failing, where the Souldiers lay in Garrison in the <hi>Custodiums,</hi> the greatest part of them return'd to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where they took up their Quarters, to the great grievance of the Inhabitants: And now the differences between the King and his Parliament in <hi>England</hi> were grown so high, and their preparations (to encounter one another in a set Battle) so considerable, as upon that fatal day, the 23. of <hi>October,</hi> 1642. They came to an Engagement at <hi>Edge-Hill,</hi> where the encounter was so fiercely maintain'd on both sides, with so much courage and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, (headed by the Earl of <hi>Lindsey</hi> for the King, and the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> for the Parliament, manfully discharging the parts both of Generals and Souldiers) as the loss being (in a manner) equal, both reported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Conquerors, but neither were thenceforth in a condition, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister sufficient relief, to the distressed Estate of the poor Protestants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereby the Army (though but lately sent over out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) was wholly neglected, which made many of the Commanders take up thoughts of quitting that service, and repairing to the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> having (as it was said) secret invitations thereunto: which being understood by the Parliament, and finding that (from the Battle of <hi>Kilrush,</hi> which was fought in <hi>April</hi> 1642. till <hi>October</hi> following) the Army in <hi>Leimster</hi> had not been so active, as reasonably might have been expected. The Parliament to quicken the War, to inform themselves of the wants and defects of the Army, and of all other things, that might enable them the better to send thither and dispose of there, such Forces, Moneys, Ammunition, and necessaries for that service (according to the Statute which enabled the Lords and Commons in Parliament, from time to time to direct) thought it very expedient, (though by Secretary <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> from his Majesty, expresly commanded <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>October,</hi> 14th.</note> to the contrary) to send into <hi>Ireland</hi> a Committy for that purpose (in the depth of Winter, Members of the House of Commons, Mr. <hi>Robert Goodwin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Reynolds,</hi> authorized from both Houses, called (by his Majesty <note n="*" place="margin">In Declar. 22. <hi>Octob.</hi> 1642.</note>) <hi>their Ambassadors,</hi> to which the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> joyn'd one Captain <hi>Tucker,</hi> who carried with them 20000 <hi>l.</hi> in ready money, besides 300 Barrels of Powder, ten Tun of Match, and other Ammunition.

                  <hi>November,</hi> presented them to the <hi>State,</hi> producing the Ordinance of <hi>Parliament,</hi> together with their instructions to be read. The Lords <hi>Justices</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> ordered their Reception with respect, which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd to the voluntary putting on of their Hats, sitting behind the Council on a Form; nor could this their carriage be reproved, though resented, Affairs at that time having brought on those Exigencies, which their coming could onely relieve, during whose abode there (having Votes onely in Military Affairs) they saw that Parties were continually sent forth to encounter the Rebels, and when there was a failing either in Money or Provisions, they engaged their own particular Credits to make up the defect: Yet in respect of their being admitted, as they were (consequently were thought to be spies on his Majesties Ministers there) His Majesty much disliked their Address, and in a Letter (deliver'd
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93738:73"/>
to the Lords Justices and Council, the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi>) Order'd their removal, which was done with much content by the Board, but some regreets to the Commissioners; who resolv'd presently to quit <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and to speak truth, it soon appear'd (by the Index of some mens spirits) what hazard they might have run, should they have been obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate therein: though many suspected (as it fell out) their return would certainly slacken the relief of the Protestant Army against the <hi>Irish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were three main things principally intended by this Committee, during their stay in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. They used their utmost endeavours to satisfie the Officers of the Army, of the great care the Parliament took to provide their Pay, and to send over money, and in the mean time to furnish the Army with all manner of Provisions and Ammunitions, that should be thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for the carrying on the War against the Rebels.</p>
               <p>2. They made a Book, wherein they desired, that all the Officers of the Civil List, as well as the Army, should subscribe, and declare their free consent, that some part of their Pay and Arrear, due to them for their service there, should be satisfied out of the Rebels Lands, when they were declared to be subdued: Upon which many great sums were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written; (but upon information of his Majesties dislike thereof) the Commissioners (being sharply threatned) returned the Book, so that<note place="margin">See <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>b.</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. <hi>fol.</hi> 248.</note> most struck out their Names, frustrating thereby a Design, which would infinitely have obliged others to have subscribed: In reference to which, the Kings Commissioners at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> ascertain'd, <hi>That his Majesty never sent any such Letter, to divert the course of the Officers subscribing, but the Souldiers were meerly discouraged from the same, by discerning that for want of Supplies, they should not be able to go on with that War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. They finding that most of the Officers of the Army had lodg'd their Troops and Companies in their <hi>Custodiums,</hi> which were most of them Places of strength, enough at least to keep them from being surprized sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly by the Rebels, and that there were 7 or 8000 of the Army quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Dublin,</hi> who consumed all the Provisions sent over for their supply, lying idle there, and oppressing the poor <hi>English</hi> Inhabitants, and such <hi>English</hi> as had taken sanctuary there; Or else making but small expeditions abroad, wasting not the Enemy so much as they did their own Provisions: It was moved therefore, and furthered by <hi>this Committee,</hi> that a considerable Force should be sent forth; Whereupon it was resolved, 4000 men should be sent out to take <hi>Ross,</hi> or some other Town thereabouts, where they might Winter, and live in part upon what they could take from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; whereupon many difficulties being found in the Design, the Lord <hi>Lisle,</hi> General of the Horse, accepted of it, with Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> and others, who made ready to go; the <hi>Lieutenant General of the Army,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> being then much indisposed: But as soon as his Lordship reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, he came to the Council Board, and there declared, <hi>that he could not in Honour permit such a considerable part of the Army, to go out upon such an important Service, under any other Command then his own;</hi> and so undertook the leading out of the Army himself, and carried it to <hi>Ross,</hi> of which you shall hear more in its due place. The Parliaments Committee<note place="margin">They leave <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> imbarked for <hi>London</hi> by long Sea, the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1642. the difference of whose Carriage was observable; so much Integrity, Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Humility appear'd in the one, and so much Pride, Arrogancy,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93738:73"/>
and Intemperancy in the other; as the one went away highly valued, and well esteem'd, and the other extreamly hated and despised. As for <hi>Tucker,</hi> he was the City's property, which every one improved to their own humour.</p>
               <p>During their continuance in repute, hearing that <hi>Balanokil</hi> was Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged by <hi>Preston,</hi> the most reputed Captain amongst the Rebels, Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> was sent forth with 600 Foot, and two Troops of Horse, the <hi>5th.</hi>

                  </note> of <hi>December,</hi> 1642. to relieve it, which he soon did, the Enemy raising the Siege upon his reproach; but in his return he met <hi>Preston</hi> with 3000 men, in a disadvantagious Place; and though he saw evident danger in so unequal a Fight, yet he thought there would be more in a Retreat. Wherefore having intrench'd himself, so as to fear no attack but in the Front, he resolved to receive them bravely; and taking care that his Musketiers should not spend their shot in vain, he saluted the Rebels, in their approach, with such a shower of Bullets, as killed the boldest of them, and made the rest begin to give way, which the <hi>English</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, came hotly upon them. But the Fight was soon ended, by the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardliness of the <hi>Irish,</hi> who with much more shame than slaughter, losing not above 60 Men there, betook themselves to the next strong Place, and Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> without the loss of one Man, return'd to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Committee of Parliament (whilst they remain'd at the Council) interpos'd in many things: Amongst the rest, it being desired by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army, that Major <hi>Wodowes</hi> might repair to his Majesty, to express their service; the Committee demonstrated, that the Parliament would certainly withdraw their Supplies, on notice of such an Address: Upon which the Ships were stayed; yet the Business was so argued, as the Major had licence to proceed in his Journey.</p>
               <p>And now the Committee being discharg'd the Council, <hi>where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the War was to be managed,</hi> the Parliament took it ill, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the want of all things afterwards was exceeding great, and the<note place="margin">Necessity of all things in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> upon the withdrawing of the Parliaments Committee.</note> main part of the remaining Army was quarter'd within the City and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of <hi>Dublin,</hi> upon the poor Inhabitants, altogether unable to bear the Necessities of their Families, much less support 7 or 8000 Men. In alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation of which, the Lords Justices and Council, the 31st. of <hi>December,</hi> 1642. publisht a Proclamation, That all <hi>Custodiums</hi> should send to his Majesty's Granaries, or Stores of Corn, half the Wheat gather'd there, at 10 <hi>s.</hi> the Barrel, in ready Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Relief of that and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Garrisons. Yet small Supplies coming in thereupon, the Lords Justices and Council order'd by another Proclamation, the 15th. of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> That all Corn-Masters, and others, should sell their Corn at a lower rate, than was propos'd the 28th. of <hi>December,</hi> 1641. and that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers accordingly should size their Bread.</p>

The <hi>Irish</hi> thought much of this Victory; for that there was an old Prophesie, That who got the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Raconnel,</hi> should conquer all <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Army return'd to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> the 10th. of <hi>February,</hi> with the remnant of Sir <hi>Michael Earnley</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,

               <p>The Lords Justices being driven to great strait, and left without hopes of Relief from <hi>England,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Dublin</hi> being no longer able to support the Necessity of their Families, and relieve the Souldiers, their Insolencies being high, the State entertain'd a Design of sending the greatest part of the Army (then quarter'd in <hi>Dublin</hi>) into some Parts distant from that City, where they might live upon the Rebels; and for this end, coin'd their own Plate, encouraging others to the same Advance<note place="margin">The Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices coin Plate with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Stamp.</note> of the State's service, whereupon (at first) they order'd Pieces of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney marked to their Weight.</p>
               <p>Many brought in freely; those indeed who (considering their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what was expected from them) had least reason to do it, whilst others issued only out their Warrants and Receipts, never yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged: Yet by the help of what came in, and some supplies out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (which had not wholly deserted <hi>Ireland</hi>) the Army march'd out 2500 Foot and 500 Horse, under the Command of the Marquess of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> whose carriage in that Business, and his success at the Battle of <hi>Ross,</hi> we shall leave to the Lords Justices and Council's Letter, to the Speaker of the House of Commons in <hi>England,</hi> the 4th. of <hi>April,</hi> 1643. where (besides the Account of that Battle) they present a true state of their Affairs, Civil and Military.

                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>OUr very good Lord, the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> having in his March,<note place="margin">The Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices Letter to the Speaker of the House of Commons in England touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ross, &amp;c.</note> in his last Expedition, consulted several times with the Commanders and Officers of the Army, in a Councel of War, and so finding that subsistence could not be had abroad, for the Men and Horses he had with him, or for any considerable part of them, it was resolved by them, that his Lordship with those Forces should return hither, which he did on the 26th. of <hi>March.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In his return from <hi>Ross,</hi> (which in the case our Forces stood, he found diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be taken in, as though our Ordnance made a breach in their Walls, it was found necessary to desert the Siege) he was encountred by an Army of the Rebels, consisting of about 6000 Foot and 650 Horse, well arm'd and horsed; yet it pleas'd God so to disappoint their Councels and strength, as with those small Forces which the Lord Marquess had with him, being of fighting Men 2500. and 500 Horse, not well armed, and for the most part weakly horsed, (and those, as well Men as Horse, much weakned, by lying in the Fields several nights in much Cold and Rain, and by want of Man's Meat and Horse Meat) the Lord Marquess obtain'd a happy and glorious deliverance and victory against those Rebels, wherein were slain about 300 of them, and many of their Commanders, and others of Quality, and divers taken Prisoners; and amongst those Prisoners, Colonel <hi>Cullen,</hi> a Native of this City, who being a Colonel in <hi>France,</hi> departed from thence, and came hither to assist the Rebels, and was Lieutenant General of their Army, in the Province of <hi>Leimster;</hi> and the Rebel's Army was totally routed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93738:74"/>
and their Baggage and Ammunition seized on by his Majesty's Forces, who lodged that night where they had gain'd the Victory, and on our side about 20 slain in the Fight, and divers wounded.</p>
                        <p>We have great cause to praise God, for magnifying his Goodness and Mercy to his Majesty, and this his Kingdom, so manifestly, and indeed wonderfully, in that Victory.</p>
                        <p>However, the joy (due from us upon so happy an occasion) is, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, mingled with very great distraction here, in the apprehension of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness to be such, as although the Rebels are not able to overcome his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Army, and devour his other good Subjects, as they desire, yet both his Army and good Subjects are in danger to be devoured, by the wants of needful Supplies forth of <hi>England:</hi> For as we formerly signified thither, Those Forces were of necessity sent abroad, to try what might be done for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining them in the Countrey, so as to keep them alive till Supplies should get to us. But that Design now failing, those our hopes are converted into asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, to behold the unspeakable Miseries of the Officers and Souldiers for want of all things, and all those wants made the more insupportable in the want of Food, whilst the City (being all the help we have) is now too apparently found to be unable to help us, as it hath hitherto done. And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Commanders and Officers in the Army, do now so far express the sense of their Sufferings, (which indeed are very great and grievous) as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That they have little hope to be supplied by the Parliament, and press with great importunity to be permitted to depart this Kingdom, as it will be extream difficult to keep them here.</p>
                        <p>By our Letters of the 23d. of <hi>March,</hi> we signified thither the unsupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burthen laid on this City, for victualling those of the Army left here, when the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> with the Forces he took with him, marched hence; which burthen is found every day more heavy than other, in regard of the many House-keepers thereby daily breaking up House, and scattering their Families, leaving still fewer to bear the burthen. We also by those Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by our Letters of the 25th. of <hi>February,</hi> advertised thither the high danger this Kingdom would incur, if the Army so sent abroad, should by any distress, or through want, be forced back hither again, before our Relief of Victuals should arrive forth of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When we found that those Men were returning back hither, although we were (and are still) full of distraction, considering the dismal consequences threatned thereby in respect of our Wants: Yet we consulted what we could yet imagine feasible, that we had not formerly done, to gain some Food for those Men; and found, that to send them or others abroad into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey we cannot, in regard we are not able to advance Money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for procuring the many Requisits incident to such an Expedition. In the end therefore, we were inforced to fix on our former way, and to see who had yet any thing left him untaken from him, to help us; and although there were but few such, and some of them poor Merchants, whom we have now by the Law of Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity utterly undone, and disabled from being hereafter helpful to us, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in Victuals, and other needful Commodities, yet were we forc'd to wrest their Commodities from them. And certainly there are few here of our selves and others, that have not felt their Parts in the inforced rigour of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, towards preserving the Army; so as what with such hard dealing, not less grievous to us to do, than it is heavy to others to suffer, and by our descending (against our hearts) far below the Honour and Dignity of that Power we represent here, under his Royal Majesty, we have with unspeakable
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93738:75"/>
difficulty prevail'd, so as to be able to find Bread for the Souldiers for the space of one Month.</p>
                        <p>We are now expelling hence all Strangers, and must instantly send away for <hi>England,</hi> thousands of poor dispoil'd <hi>English,</hi> whose very eating is now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable to this Place.</p>
                        <p>And now again, and finally, We earnesty desire, (for our Confusions will not now admit the writing of many more Letters, if any) That his Majesty, and the <hi>English</hi> Nation, may not suffer so great, if not irrecoverable, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and dishonour, as must unavoidably be the consequence of our not being reliev'd suddenly; but that yet (although it be even now at the point to be too late) Supplies of Victuals and Munition in present to be hastned hither, to keep life until the rest may follow, there being no Victual in the Store, nor will there be a 100 Barrels of Powder left in store, when the out-Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (as they must be instantly) are supplied, and that remainder, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the usual necessary expence, besides extraordinary accidents, will not last above a month. And the residue of our Provisions must also come speedily after, or otherwise <hi>England</hi> cannot hope to secure <hi>Ireland,</hi> or secure themselves against <hi>Ireland,</hi> but in the loss of it, must look for such Enemies from hence, as will perpetually disturb the Peace of his Majesty, and his Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and annoy them by Sea and Land, as we often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly represented thither; which Mischiefs may yet be prevented, if we be yet forthwith enabled from thence with means to overcome this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
                        <p>We hope that a course is taken there, for hastning thither the Provisions of Arms and Munition, mention'd in the Docquet, sent in our Letter of the 20th. of <hi>January,</hi> and the 600 Horses, which we then moved might be sent hither for recruits, and that the 7893 l. 3 s. for Arms to be provided in <hi>Holland,</hi> (besides those we expect in <hi>London</hi>) hath been paid to <hi>Anthony Tierens</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> or to <hi>Daniel Wibrants</hi> in <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> and if that Sum had been paid, as we at first desired, we might well have had those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions arriv'd here by the 10th. of <hi>March,</hi> as we agreed. However, we now desire, that that Money, if it be not already paid, may be yet paid to Mr. <hi>Anthony Tierens</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Wibrants</hi> in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> that so those Provisions may arrive here speedily, which (considering that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is now near at hand) will be very necessary, that when our Supplies of Victuals, Munition, Cloaths, Money, and other Provisions, shall arrive, we may not, in the publick Service, here lose the benefit and advantage of that Season. And so we remain.</p>

                  </note> however, in brief, it gives you a faithful Account: Yet that a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular one may also be committed to Posterity, accept of the following, from the Pen of a chief Officer in that Expedition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> the 2d. 1642. the <hi>English</hi> Army march'd forth from <hi>Dublin</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> consisting of about 2500 Foot and 500 Horse, together with two Pieces of Battery, and four small brass Pieces, the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> being Lieutenant General of the Army, and my Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Horse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:93738:75"/>The 3d. the Army being come nigh <hi>Castlemartin,</hi> the Rebels then pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing it, gave it up to the Lieutenant General, upon his promise of fair Quarter, which they accordingly had, to march away thence with the safety of their Lives, they being in number above 400 Men and Women; and the same day 3 Divisions of Foot were sent to <hi>Kildare,</hi> and a Castle called <hi>Tully,</hi> which the Rebels then quitted, and left unto us.</p>
               <p>The 4th. the Army came to <hi>Tymolin,</hi> where finding two Castles pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest by some Rebels, our Cannon compell'd them to submit to mercy, very few of them escaping with their Lives, there being about 100 of them slain; and also of the <hi>English</hi> Army was slain Lieutenant <hi>Oliver,</hi> and about 12 Souldiers.</p>
               <p>The 11th. my Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> march'd from the Army at <hi>Temple-soul</hi> before day towards <hi>Ross,</hi> having with him Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas,</hi> and about 400 Horse, and also Sir <hi>Foulk Huncks,</hi> with about 600 Foot. Being come within two miles of <hi>Ross,</hi> our Horse took 4 Horsemen of the Rebels, Prisoners, who inform'd us, that the Army of the Rebels lay then about 3 miles distant thence, being near 4000 Men. Shortly after my Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> came before the Town of <hi>Ross,</hi> and by a Trumpeter he sent to the Town, to have some one of Quality therein to come to treat with him, concerning the surrender of the same to the King's use, which they refused to do. Then Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas,</hi> fearing the safety of the Army, (by reason he understood that the Rebel's Army lay the last night within 2 miles of the <hi>English</hi> Army) importuned my Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> to march back with all his Horse, to secure the Army, leaving Sir <hi>Foulk Hunks</hi> with his Division of Foot, to guard a Pass in that way. And then after a few miles riding further, the <hi>English</hi> Army appear'd at hand, which march'd on towards <hi>Ross,</hi> nigh before which that night a great part of our Horse and Foot lodged. And the next morning our Cannon were drawn and planted against the Town, and continued bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering with two Pieces, on a part of the Town-Walls, about two days together, which made a fair breach therein, which Sir <hi>Foulk Huncks</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to assault with his Men, and attempted it, but were beaten back with some loss, which so much dis-heartned the Souldiers, that they would not be drawn on again; and finding that the besieged had both daily and nightly very many Men, and much Ammunition, and other Recruits, conveyed by Boats into the Town, and understanding that the Rebel's Army was grown very strong within few miles of ours, and our Lieutenant General finding Bread to be grown scarce in our Army, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to leave <hi>Ross</hi> as it was, and gain Honour by a Battle with the <hi>Irish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 18th. our Army being march'd away, about 2 miles distant from <hi>Ross,</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> Army appear'd fairly in view, who hastned their Forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Battalia, on a Ground of some advantage, nigh the way our Army was to pass. Whereupon our Commanders endeavour'd with all diligence to draw their Forces into Battalia, to confront the Rebels within the distance of Cannon-shot, our Cannon being plac'd at the Front of our Infantry, which was winged by our Horse-Troops, and advanc'd forwards before our Army, within Musket-shot of the Enemy's fore-Troops; Sir <hi>Richard</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ross</hi> Battle.</note> 
                  <hi>Greenvile</hi> (having that day the Vauntguard of the Horse) had his Division for the right Wing of the Army; likewise my Lord <hi>Lisle</hi>'s Division (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Battle) had the left Wing of the Army; Sir <hi>Thomas Luca</hi>'s Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision (having the Rearguard of the Horse) had the one half of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93738:76"/>
appointed to stand for Reserves for both the Wings of Horse. Both Armies being order'd against one another, Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile</hi> sent forth towards the Rebels a forelorn Hope of 60 Horse, commanded by Lieutenant <hi>White,</hi> which advancing towards 2 Troops of the Rebels, they seem'd to shrink from. Then (our Cannon beginning to play) Captain <hi>Atkins,</hi> commanding a forelorn Hope of about 100 Musketiers, march'd forwards directly before our Foot-Army towards the Rebels, who had mann'd a Ditch in a High-way, lying right before their Army, with a great number of Musketiers; during which time, certain other Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>English</hi> Foot followed orderly their forelorn Hope, Captain <hi>Atkins</hi> with his shot excellently performing his part, by exchanging shot with the Rebels that lay in ambush. Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile,</hi> with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision on the right Wing, advanced to begin the Battle; in the interim whereof, Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas</hi> (being Major General of the Horse) came and took upon him the chief Command thereof; and so leading those Troops on towards the Enemy, being come past a deep High-way, that lay between both Armies, presently (at hand) advanc'd towards those Horse, a Division of Horse and Foot of the Rebels. Sir <hi>Richard Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> being then in the head of his own Troop, (which had the right hand of that Division) commanded his Men to keep together and charge home without wheeling; which was no sooner spoken, but immediately Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas</hi> call'd aloud to our Troop, to wheel to the left hand, which they presently performing, were gotten into a Lane in some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and before they could get out of the same, and come into any good order again, a Troop of above 100 of the Rebel's Horse, all Gentlemen of Quality, and Commanders, led by <hi>Cullen,</hi> their Lieutenant General, charg'd our Horse on the left Flank. Whereupon Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile</hi> encouraged several of his Troops, by his example, to charge the Enemy, where meeting with Colonel <hi>Cullen</hi> in the head of his Troops, divers blows pass'd betwixt them; mean while my Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> with his Troops, gallantly charg'd <hi>Cullen</hi>'s Troop, on his Flank and Rear, whereby they were so routed, that the Troops were all intermixed one with another, and the execution of both Parties continued violent, until about 20 of the Rebel's Horse escaped away together, leaving the rest of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to be killed and taken Prisoners, (as they were;) during which time, the Foot and Cannon performing well their parts, drove the Enemy to shift away to save themselves, which Captain <hi>Hermon</hi> seeing, pursued their Rear with some Horse, with which he did notable good execution; and, to say the truth, it is probable that most of the Rebels had that day been cut off, had not the un-passable deep High-way betwixt both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, hindred our left Wing of Horse from giving on upon their side, and also the disorder that hapned to the right Wing of the Horse, by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy wheeling to the left hand. But so soon as the Officers of those Troops could reduce their Men again into order, my Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile</hi> presently pursued the Enemy with 2 Troops, and sent Sir <hi>William Vaughan</hi> with 2 Troops more to pursue others, flying away to the right hand. And having followed the chase of them about 2 or 3 miles distant from the Army, (the Rebels having made their escape over Bogs, and un-passable Grounds for Horse) our Horse were fain to leave them, and return to the rest of the Army, where the Cannon stood. In which service were 300 of the Rebels slain, amongst which were a great number of their best Gentry and Commanders: There were of the Rebels
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93738:76"/>
taken Prisoners, Colonel <hi>Cullen</hi> their Lieutenant General, Major <hi>Butler,</hi> besides divers other Captains, and some of their Ensigns; of the <hi>English</hi> Forces were slain not full 20 Men: in which service, Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas</hi> unhappily received a very sore wound in his head. That night, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Army lodged at <hi>Ballybeggan.</hi> After which time, the Army march'd without molestation of any Enemy, until they return'd to <hi>Dublin,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Rear of the Army came safe on <hi>Munday</hi> the <hi>27th.</hi> of the same month, 1643.</p>
               <p>Where they were again Quarter'd, even to the undoing and great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation<note place="margin">The Army from <hi>Ross</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Dublin,</hi> to the further burthen of that City.</note> of that poor City, which had now suffered so much, and so long, under the burden and insolencies of unpaid, wanting Soldiers, as they were unable to bear it longer, and with loud cries and complaints made known their Grievances to the Lords Justices and Council, wholely unable to relieve them. And indeed, such was the posture of the present affairs at that time, as every thing tended to bring on a Cessation; yet for the present, the Lieutenant General (that the Soldiers might be quieted) publish'd a strict Edict, <hi>Prohibiting all Soldiers to offer the least violence to any who brought Provision to the Market, or any Inhabitants of the Town, under the severest Penalties of the Marshals Court; which, for a time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat an obedience.</hi> But the Army being ill Cloath'd, meanly Victuall'd, worse Paid, and seldom employ'd in service, necessity enforc'd them to those outrages Humanity could not take notice of, many of them being the effects of a very pinching want; though the Lords Justices and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil (to the great dislike of the Army) pursued some of the Offenders with exemplary Justice: A sense of which, with the Meagre return which Serjeant Major <hi>Warren</hi> brought out of <hi>England,</hi> on his sollicitation for the Soldiers Pay, and the dissatisfaction that thence arose; some of the Officers, not all, (there was a Party that presum'd they might have gone through with the work, had there not been another in the Loom) after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards presented the State, the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1643. with a Paper, in such a stile, threatning so much danger, as the Lords Justices and Council re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Copy of it to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> which here follows.

                        <p>AT our first entrance into this unhappy Kingdom, we had no other design,<note place="margin">The Armies Remonstrance.</note> than by our Swords to assert and vindicate the Right of his Majesty, which was here most highly abused, to redress the wrongs of his poor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to advance our own Particulars in the prosecution of so honest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. And for the rest of these, we do believe they have, since our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, succeeded pretty well; but for the last, which concerns our selves, that hath fall'n out so contrary to our expectations, that instead of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, we have been prejudic'd; instead of getting a Fortune, we have spent part of one: And though we behave our selves never so well abroad, and perform the actions of honest men, yet we have the Reward of Rogues and Rebels, which is Misery and Want, when we come home. Now (my Lords) although we be brought to so great an Exigence, that we are ready to rob and spoil one another; yet to prevent such outrages, we thought it better to try all honest means for our subsistence, before we take such indirect

Therefore if your Lordships will be pleased to take us timely into your considerations, before our urgent wants make us desperate, we will, as we have done hitherto, serve your Lordships readily and faithfully. But if your Lordships will not find a way for our preservations here, we humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, we may have leave to go where we may have a better being: And if your Lordships shall refuse to grant that, we must then take leave to have our recourse to that first and primary Law, which God hath endued all men with, we mean, the Law of Nature, which teacheth all men to preserve themselves.</p>

               <p>Hence (with what countenance some gave it) it was thought, the Rebels (as to the bringing in of the Cessation, and their further Aims) prevail'd more, than in all their Battels, Treacheries, and Surprizals.</p>

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> (a Contriver of the Rebellion) to the amazement of All not acquainted with the Plot.

It is indeed, to speak plainly, a most infamous Pamphlet, full fraught with scandalous aspersions cast upon the present Government, and his Majesties Principal Officers of State within this Kingdom: it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly framed with most virulent intentions, not to present their condition and present sufferings to his Majesty, but that it might be dispers'd to gain belief amongst Foreign States abroad, as well as discontented Persons at

home, and so draw assistance and aid to foment and strengthen their Rebellious Party in Ireland.</hi> Of which, if any desire to be more fully satisfi'd, each Particular is clearly answer'd (by a Person then at the Helm, very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, though not with that vigour the truth requir'd) in a Book, entituled, <hi>The false and scandalous Remonstrance of the Inhumane and Bloody Rebels of Ireland</hi>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93738:79"/>
under the Conduct of Sir <hi>Charles Vavasor,</hi> with select Numbers, respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively gathered from the Garrisons of <hi>Toughall, Talloe, Castle Lions, Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Mogily,</hi> and <hi>Cappaquin;</hi> the whole number consisting of about 1200 Musketeers, and 200 Horse, besides Volunteers and Pillagers. In which Expedition, Major <hi>Appleyard, May</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> near the Castle of <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> was assign'd to fall on <hi>Ballykeroge,</hi> (Sir <hi>Nicholas Walsh</hi>'s Town and Lands) that he might burn and spoil them: And Sir <hi>Charles Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> undertook the Passage to the <hi>Comroe;</hi> upon the left hand whereof there stands an exceeding high Mountain, and under the brow a large Wood, through which the Army was necessitated to pass, an unpassable Bog being on the right hand. The Enemy (never wanting intelligence) against Sir <hi>Charles</hi> came, had cast up a Trench breast high, with spike holes along the side of the Wood, from the Mountain to the Bog, with a strong Barricado, and two Courts of Guards for Musketeers to lodge in, more artificially done than they were accustomed to: But by the help of a Fog (our Guide proving faithful) the Rebels were not aware of us till our Horse were upon them, at which they shot, and we retreated lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely (our Foot not being come up) through Providence, without harm; and Sir <hi>Charles</hi> commanded some Dragooners, of Captain <hi>Pynes</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to alight, which they did, soon entring the Enemies Trenches, and, before the Foot came, gain'd the Pass; and the Horse and Foot march'd within Musket-shot of <hi>Dermod O Brian</hi>'s (Lord of the Countrey) Castle, where they made a stand, till the Soldiers had fir'd the Countrey, and took away their Cattle, the Enemy not daring to rescue them, firing (as they march'd away) by <hi>Comroe</hi>-Castle, a good House of <hi>Peter Anthony</hi>'s, an <hi>English</hi> Papist, with many other Thatch'd Houses thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> strongly fortifi'd by <hi>John Fitz-Gerald,</hi> Son and Heir to <hi>Mac-Thomas;</hi> the Warders and the rest being on Terms also convey'd to <hi>Ballykeroge:</hi> And so facing <hi>Clonea</hi> (belonging to <hi>Tibbot Fitz-Gerrard</hi>) and <hi>Cosgrave</hi> Castles, and passing by <hi>Dungarvan,</hi> some of the Rebels issued out of Town; but the <hi>English</hi> Forces draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a Body to oppose them, they retired without the least Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, our Forces marching to their own Garrisons.</p>
               <p>About the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> compleats an Army of 4000 Foot, and 400 Horse, which Rendevouz'd at <hi>Buttevant;</hi> out of which he sent 200 Horse, under the Command of Captain <hi>Bridges,</hi> (a

resolute active man) and 1200 Foot, under the Conduct of Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Story,</hi> (no ways backward of the Employment) into the County of <hi>Kerry;</hi> a dangerous Journey, considering the length of the way, and scarcity of Provision they had with them, the Enemy having wasted and fired <hi>Trally,</hi> (a Place as well accommodated with good Land for Corn and Cattle, as any other Place in <hi>Munster</hi>) lest the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> should quarter there. Whereupon the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> (considering the danger of the Journey) to divert the Enemy, laid a pretended Siege to the Town of <hi>Kilmallock,</hi> (a Place of great consequence, and a Key to <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>) whereby, the Rebels eyes being fixed on <hi>Kilmallock</hi>'s relief, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition was much facilitated; <hi>Bridges</hi> and <hi>Story</hi> bringing away a great Prey of Cattle, some Prisoners, and fetch'd off many <hi>English</hi> from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Ballybeggan</hi> without any resistance, save a loose Skirmish, wherein the Enemy lost four men, and were routed.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Inchequin,</hi> the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> having sent Colonel <hi>Myn</hi> to <hi>Patrick Purcel</hi> of <hi>Croe,</hi> Governour of <hi>Kilmallock,</hi> to acquaint him, he came forth onely to meet an Enemy in the Field, not to Besiege the Town. He released the Lady <hi>Humes</hi> and her Son, Prisoners at <hi>Kilmallock,</hi> for one <hi>Burget,</hi> a Prisoner at <hi>Cork,</hi> whether the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> march'd, whilst Sir <hi>Charles Vavasor,</hi> after a well regulated Dispute (stoutly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the Rebels) took in <hi>Cloghleigh,</hi> commanded by one <hi>Condon,</hi> wherein was 20 Men, 11 Women, and about 7 Children, some of which the Soldiers stript, in readiness to kill them; but Major <hi>Howel</hi> drawing out his Sword, defended them; and whilst he went to Colonel <hi>Vavasor,</hi> (then at <hi>Ballyhindon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Roche</hi>'s House, where he was invited that day to Dine) committed them to Captain <hi>Wind,</hi> who leaving them to a Guard of Horse, they stripped them again, and afterwards fell upon them with Carbines, Pistols, and Swords: a cruelty so resented by Sir <hi>Charles Vavasor,</hi> that he vowed to hang him that commanded the Guard; and had certainly done it, had not the next days action prevented it, which was the most considerable loss the <hi>English</hi> ever received from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, a mischief they might have avoided had they been less confident, and given greater credence to their Intelligence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> being <hi>Sunday,</hi> early in the morning, before break of day quarter, Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> with a Squadron of Horse, was sent to Scout about <hi>Cloghline</hi> and <hi>Castlegrace,</hi> in the County of <hi>Tipperary;</hi> and before day-light he was encompassed by the Enemies Horse; so that he, with his Company, with great difficulty escap'd, and bringing word to the Leaguer at <hi>Cloghleigh,</hi> the Alarm was up, and presently our Foot drew themselves into two Divisions in a Field next the Mountain, where the Enemy came down, when presently two or three Bodies of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horse appear'd on the side of a Hill, (a mile and a half from us.) In the mean time Sir <hi>Charles Vavasor</hi> (lying the night before at Castle <hi>Logons</hi>) was sent for, and he (without delay) came away as fast as his Horse could carry him: but before he came, a Party of Musketeers, to the number of 200, under the Command of Captain <hi>Philip Hutton,</hi> and a Troop of Horse commanded by Captain <hi>Freek,</hi> drew up nearer to the Enemy by half a mile, and there stood for the space of two hours; some of the Horse in the interim advanc'd further, founding their Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets on both sides. At length, <hi>Christopher Brian</hi> (the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi>'s Brother) desir'd to Parle with Quartermaster <hi>Page,</hi> and after some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements and Discourses past, they parted; as did afterwards Captain

                  <hi>Richard Fitz-Morris</hi> (the Lord of <hi>Kirries</hi> Brother) with the said <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher Bryan.</hi> Presently after notice was given, that the Enemy was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing; but we could discover no Foot all this while, (their manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this business being very close.) Whereupon Sir <hi>Charles Vavasor</hi> demurr'd upon it, and took order for what was needful, and called back the said <hi>Hutton</hi> and the Horse from the Mountain. In the interim, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>George Butler</hi> (a Native of this Kingdom, a man of undanted spirit, and well experienc'd in Martial Discipline) came to Sir <hi>Charles</hi> from the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> with a Letter, importing, That the said <hi>Butler</hi>'s Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Sir <hi>John Brown</hi>'s were marching from <hi>Moyalloe</hi> towards him, and now within a mile and half to him, were at his disposal. Upon that, Sir <hi>Charles</hi> and the rest of the Officers consulted what was best to be done, and concluded, such a Body of Horse could not be without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Body of Foot, and therefore fully resolv'd to make good a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, giving order, that all the Carriages with the Artillery (that were now at a stop on the <hi>Manning Water</hi>) should hast away, till they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the <hi>Black Water</hi> at the Ford of <hi>Farmoy,</hi> to help to make good that Pass, in case he should be hard put to it. After this, Sir <hi>Charles</hi> staid a while, so long as he might well conceive the said two Companies, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and Ordnance to be at the Ford, and then presently marched on to Castle <hi>Lyons,</hi> the Front led by Lieutenant <hi>King,</hi> the Body by Major <hi>Howel,</hi> and the Rear by Sir <hi>Charles</hi> himself, a Forlorn-hope of about 160 Musketeers in the Rear was commanded by Captain <hi>Pierce Lacy,</hi> Captain <hi>Hutton,</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Stardbury,</hi> and all our Horse in the Rear likewise; who no sooner came over the <hi>Manning Water,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the top of the Hill, but the Enemies Horse were at our heels: From this Hill to the Ford there is a dangerous Passage of a Narrow Lane, which the Enemy knew full well, and so did our Men too: And the Enemy perceiving that most of our Men were marching within this Lane, (excepting the Forlorn-hope and the Horse) charged us in the Rear, coming on as the <hi>Moorish</hi> and <hi>Getulian</hi> Horse, mention'd by <hi>Salust</hi> in <hi>Jugarth</hi>'s War, not in Order and Warlike manner, but by Troops and scattering Companies at adventure, that the Fight rather resembled an Incursion than a Battel; and so hemm'd in and prest on our Horse, (being but 120) that they were able to move no way, but fall into that Lane amongst the Foot, which they did, thereby routing our whole Foot.

               <p>In <hi>Connaght,</hi> after the Battle of <hi>Raconnel,</hi> till Midsummer, there was not any considerable service done by our Souldiers; and the Enemy either kept close in Garrisons, or was drawn off to the Siege of <hi>Galloway</hi>'s Fort; And now the Enemies finding that without the Command of some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd General, and the uniting of their Forces, they were able to do little, yea, not to defend themselves; they got for Commander <hi>John Bourk</hi> (or as they more commonly called him, <hi>Shane O-Tlevij</hi>) descended from the <hi>Bourks</hi> of Castle <hi>Barr,</hi> or if you please of the <hi>Mac Williams:</hi> His first exploit was against the Fort of <hi>Galloway,</hi> to the taking and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molishing of which, the Townsmen contributed both with Bodies and Purse very largely; they wanted good battering Guns, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to take it by <hi>Famine,</hi> it being but poorly provided by such as the Parliament appointed to bring timely supplies by Sea, knowing that in it they should get battering Guns, to take in the rest of the <hi>English</hi> Garrisons in that Province. To this end, they made a Chain of Masts, Casks, and Iron, across that part of the Harbour next to the Fort, and planted strong Guards at each end of it; They prepared some few Ship-Guns, and a Morter-Piece, which was well cast by a Runnagate out of the Lord <hi>Forbes</hi> Ships, which afterwards they made use of at the Siege of Castle <hi>Coot;</hi> so that with much Industry rather then Gallantry, they at length got the Fort by Composition, its Relief coming too late into the Harbour; The event of which so much struck the Governour, as he did not many months after survive the loss.</p>
               <p>Upon the taking of the Fort, the <hi>Irish</hi> were overjoy'd to be Masters of so many brave Guns, and thought that the Reputation of this and the help of the Guns, would reduce suddainly all <hi>Connaght;</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd first to fall on Castle <hi>Coot,</hi> the most painant thorn in their side,<note place="margin">Castle <hi>Coot</hi> Besieged.</note> being confident that upon their success there, they might in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility expect to have the rest, not because it had any great strength in its Walls, but was well mann'd, and vigilantly attended; though with 4000 Horse and Foot, and answerable Accommodations of War, they question'd not but to Master it soon, having <hi>Preston</hi>'s Engineer, Monsieur <hi>La Loo</hi>

(an expert <hi>Low-Countrey</hi> Souldier) to manage their Works, who upon the knowledge of the situation of the Place, question'd not its surrender, <hi>Galloway</hi> having (for Fireworks, and fitting expedients for that service) furnished him with 300 <hi>l.</hi> However, though they had made as regular and handsom a Fortification about the Castle, as ever was attempted in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet the Garrison so nobly attack'd each Redoubt, that thence ensued many brave Attempts, much certainly to the prejudice of the Besieged; the Garrison maintaining their own against all the Attempts the Besiegers ever adventur'd, which in truth were many, not without Skill as well as Courage maintain'd; in as much as the Governour Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Richard Coot,</hi> since Lord Baron of <hi>Coloony,</hi> having sent forth a private Messenger to Major <hi>Ormsby,</hi> (who before with the help of the <hi>English</hi> Garrisons, had very successfully beaten <hi>Owen Roe-O-Neal</hi> out of the Province with great loss, coming to set upon <hi>Boyle, Jamestown, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickdrumzoosh,</hi> and <hi>Elphin,</hi>) at <hi>Tulsol,</hi> to inform him of his wants, very carefully consulted with <hi>Boyle</hi> and <hi>Roscommon,</hi> who joyntly agreed (upon a private Sign) to relieve them of Castle <hi>Coot;</hi> which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my having notice of by one, whom the Garrison had familiarly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, the Treachery (on the Enemies side) was carried on, as they set forth two parties, as if <hi>one</hi> had made to the Castles Relief, whilst the <hi>other</hi> oppos'd it; to the countenance of which, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour being (from the Walls) encouraged by the Souldiers (though against his own suspicions) adventured forth with 60 Musketiers, but soon found the deceit of the business; The Enemy all this while having skirmish with themselves as two Parties, who now joyntly fall upon the Governour with those he drew out, who so gallantly oppos'd them, though (in compute) not less then 700 Men, as they retired to their Camp, and he secured his Retreat (with much Honour) to his Castle; The Enemy in the Interim, making a bold assault on the other part of the Castle, which he came time enough to relieve, beating off the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with a considerable loss, and having slain many of their men, caus'd them decently to be laid out (not beheaded as the <hi>Irish</hi> barbarously are accustomed to do) for which their General sent him a Present of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, (then very acceptable;) However, afterwards he beat them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible Places, in Bogs and Woods (their usual Refuge) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd at that time store of Tobacco, Cloaths, and 11 weeks Pay, newly come, to satisfie their Souldiers; Yet they hearing of the Cessation, but not yet having an Express from the Marquiss of <hi>Ormond,</hi> more violently (then ever) shot at the Castle; and having now a Messenger of the Cessation, they so far suspected him as a spy, as they imprison'd him,<note place="margin">The <hi>Irish</hi> break the Cessation.</note> endeavouring still to gain the Castle; but finding their attempts vain, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from <hi>Boyle, Roscommon,</hi> &amp;c. faithfully having relieved the Castle, all joyntly gallantly set on the Rebels, which their General perceiving, grew so much enraged against his Souldiers, as to profess he had rather be Captain of the 200 in the Garrison, then General of the 3000 he had; so as at length the Governour as well as <hi>Bourk,</hi> having an Express from the Marquiss of <hi>Ormond,</hi> both acquiess'd therein.</p>
               <p>Thus his Majesties Forces (where they were unanimous) vigorously proceeded; nay should I adventure to recount all their actions, time would fail, we are obliged to be brief, though in omitting any, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may be done excellent Persons, whose pardons I beg, whilst they had no better supplies then other Places.</p>

                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:93738:83"/>And having (as before) presented you with the Lords Justices Letter to his Majesty, we should now give you <hi>the Declaration of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament the</hi> 16th. <hi>of</hi> June, 1643. <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the present lamentable estate and miserable condition of</hi> Ireland; In answer to what, the Lords Justices and Council had faithfully acquainted them withall, that it may appear how sensible they were of the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation they had receiv'd of the straights and exigencies of the Protestant Forces in <hi>Ireland;</hi> which certainly is very Emphatical, resenting (with a just aggravation) the miserable condition of that Kingdom; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing legible in <hi>Husbands</hi> Collections, <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. 216.</note> we shall refer you thither, not busing our selves how far it prevail'd. Certainly the Exigencies of the Souldiers, and State of <hi>Ireland</hi> were then very considerable, in as much as his Majesty not being able (by any other expedient) to remedy (as he was perswaded) their complaints, then by a Cessation, he (to that end) sends this Letter to the Lords Justices.

That <hi>although we conceive this Treaty to be of the greatest consequence of any Service, to be effected for his Majesty within this Kingdom, yet we are not apt to give an ill construction to the laying of it by for the present, until we do know of that Service that taketh place of it, which (being for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Majesty's Interests) we heartily wish may have good success: Yet your Lordship will give us leave to take notice, that we meet in these, as in all other Proceedings, (whereby we may have any expectation to enjoy the benefit of his Majesty's Grace and Favour) some interruption and slackness, in conveying any part of his good Intentions, to his</hi> faithful Subjects the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks of Ireland, <hi>which we add to our other Grievances, and will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour (in discharge of the many harms which may ensue by reason of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction) to have it rightly presented to his Majesty.</hi> In Answer to which, the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> replyed, the 21st. of <hi>July,</hi> That <hi>whereas they had no pretence of unaptness, to give an ill construction to the laying by of the Treaty, until they could know of what Service took place,</hi> he acquainted them, <hi>That he was not accountable to them, with the knowledge of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Services, wherewith he had the Honour to be intrusted, or to any but to his Majesty, and to those to whom he had intrusted the government of the Kingdom.</hi> And for what they said, <hi>They would endeavour to have rightly presented to his Majesty, he doubted not but to acquit himself as became him, as in other Commands, so in this Particular; and that they should find, when the other Occasions of his Majesty were over, the deferring of the Treaty at present, was not such a laying aside of the Matter, as their Letters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus at present, (more than by Letters, and the private Actings of some Men) there was nothing further attempted in the Treaty, till the 26th. of <hi>August</hi> following: In the interim, we must take notice of the Insolence of these Men, then expecting his Majesty's Favour.

               <p>During the respite of the Treaty for the Cessation, (<hi>viz.</hi> the 29th. of <hi>July</hi>) 7 or 800 of the Rebels gave us at mid-night, (by whose neglect I know not) an Alarm, even in the streets of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who were gallantly repulsed by Colonel <hi>Crafford</hi>'s Men, killing 20 of them, the Rebels by that means doing no more hurt, than plundering and firing some few thatcht Houses.</p>
               <p>All things tending to a Cessation, the State held it their best policy not to retain their Forces wholly in their Garrisons; and therefore (though they had slender Provisions, and less Treasure to encourage the Souldiers abroad) the 27th. of <hi>June,</hi> 1643. Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> with 1300 Foot, and 140 Horse, was sent against <hi>Preston,</hi> strengthned by <hi>Owen O Neal,</hi> whom<note place="margin">Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> against <hi>Preston.</hi>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93738:85"/>
(if not twice) grazed, he, with other Gentlemen, (who were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out of what might ensue, and intimated their suspicions) still tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd the Ground, till most unfortunately the Bullet forc'd its passage<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Moor</hi> killed.</note> through his Armour into his Body, but was not of strength sufficient to go through, however it there slew him; upon whose Fall, one readier to shew some sallies of Wit, than Skill, obtrudes this Distich:

Besides, several Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of both Houses of Parliament, who by the Broad Seal,</hi> (the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith of the State) <hi>were intrusted with the</hi> Irish <hi>Affairs, would by the Cessation be further dis-enabled to Act; and the Adventurers (who had so many Acts for their Security) would by a Cessation be disappointed, as the exiled Protestants (turn'd out of their Habitations) be thereby continued in misery and want.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst these things were thought on in <hi>England,</hi> the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> (who took a liberty at the uncertainty of Affairs) were strangely divided, whether the Cessation should be concluded or no. Some (who were sensibly touch'd with the Injuries and Cruelties of the Rebels) could not brook it; others (hoping for their advantage by the Change) daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it, whilst the City (in general) being burthen'd with Taxes, quartering of Souldiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> having no hopes of Relief from abroad, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly hearkned to their Freedom: so as now the strong Affections which had been commonly born against the Rebels, began to wither into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, and the course which had been then took to weather out the resolute, either for despair or terrour humbled many, and as Interest lay, several resolv'd what Party to take in <hi>England,</hi> upon the conclusion of the Cessation. And that the Cessation might be put forward, his Majesty

writ to the Lords Justices, and the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> from his Court at <hi>Matson,</hi> the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> the <hi>19th.</hi> year of his Reign, which came not to them till the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> eleven days after the Cessation was concluded; <hi>Authorizing them, or any two of them, to treat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for him, and in his name, with his Subjects then in Arms in that his Kingdom, for a Cessation of Arms for one whole year.</hi> But before this Letter arriv'd, the Treaty at <hi>Sigginstown</hi> began with the Confederates Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, by vertue of the Letter the Marquis had formerly received from his Majesty, dated at <hi>Oxford</hi> the 31. of <hi>July,</hi> 1643. who to that purpose order'd a Commission, dated at <hi>Dublin</hi> under the Broad Seal, the last of <hi>August,</hi> 1643, in the <hi>19th.</hi> year of his Majesties Reign, to conclude the Cessation with the <hi>Irish</hi> Commissioners; who, the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> 1643. having met the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> (Lieutenant General of his Majesties Army) there, where insisting upon the Name, Title, and Protestation which at first they had assum'd (not permitted of by the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi>) they proceeded: The Enemy, in the interim, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging<note place="margin">The Rebels ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry audacious and active up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very point of the conclusion of the Cessation.</note> 
                  <hi>Tully,</hi> and afterwards taking it, even whilst his Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Grace was not far thence in execution; and in all places they shewed themselves most active, endeavouring either to surprize, force, or gain by allurements what they could, exceedingly animated with hopes of a Cessation, that upon its conclusion, what was in their power might be peaceably possess'd. During which Treaty, many difficulties arose; one (whether in this or the former Treaty, I am not certain) was much insisted on, (<hi>viz.</hi>) How the several Indictments and Outlawries against the <hi>Irish</hi> might be repealed? After some dispute, at length <hi>Plunket</hi> (one of the <hi>Irish</hi> Agents) told them, He had found a Remedy; the Judges before whom they were Indicted might be summon'd to the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and there be Fined. And there replied one (who is seldom found to sign any Act of State till the Cessation was concluded) all that are concern'd may be confident to find reparation. This the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Shurley</hi> thought reflected upon him, who thereupon express'd much courage and integrity. And the Dispute fell: And the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1643. the<note place="margin">The Cessation concluded.</note> Cessation was concluded by the Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> who for his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Affection, and Loyalty, his Majesty had made his Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of his Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and who (having gotten so many notable<note place="margin">His Majesties Motives to the Cessation, <hi>fol.</hi> 355. <hi>Octob.</hi> 19. 1643.</note> Victories over the Rebels) was very well approv'd of by the two Houses of Parliament in <hi>England.</hi> The publication of which, with the Articles, and his Majesties Motives thereunto, you may read in his Majesties Works, from <hi>fol.</hi> 353. to 365. In confirmation of which, the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices and Council issued out a Warrant to the Lord Chancellor, to draw Letters of Confirmation under the Great Seal of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly bore date the <hi>26th.</hi> day of <hi>Septemb.</hi> in the <hi>19th.</hi> year of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Reign: And to express the necessity thereof, many Persons of Quality sign'd, the said <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1643. a Writing, <hi>therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding it necessary for his Majesties Honour and Service, that the Lord Marquis of Ormond should assent to a Cessation of Arms;</hi> though <hi>some</hi> of these afterwards (joyning with the Parliaments Forces) resolved to die a thousand deaths, rather than to descend to any Peace with the perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rebels; but stuck not at length to that <hi>Protestation,</hi> altering as the Scene chang'd.</p>

Wherefore that the State might still steer by the same Compass they had hitherto done, they committed the Case to the Judges; who unanimously agreed upon the following Reasons for its continuance.<floatingText type="letter">

                        <p>ACcording to your Lordships Order of the xi. of <hi>September, 1643.</hi> we<note place="margin">Reasons given in by the Judges for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of this Parliament, against a free one sought by the Rebels, Sept. 13. 1643.</note> have considered of such inconveniencies, as we conceive may arise to his Majesty, and his Service, as Affairs now stand, if this present Parliament should be determin'd, and have reduc'd the same to writing, which we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly present to your Lordships further consideration.</p>
                        <p>The greatest part of the Free-holders of this Kingdom are now in actual Rebellion, whereby his Majesty ought to be justly entituled to all their Estates, both Real and Personal; this cannot be done but by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Attainder, either by course of Common Law, or by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By course of Common Law it will be very difficult to be effected, for these Reasons following.</p>
                        <p>First, Those who are indicted in most of the Counties of this Kingdom can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Attainted by Outlawry, by reason that the Sheriffs of those Counties, by occasion of the present Rebellion, cannot keep their County-Courts, to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, and make due Return of the Exigence: Nor can they be Attainted by Verdict for want of Jurors, most of all the Free-holders in the Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in Rebellion.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Those that are not Indicted, or those that are already Indicted, and in Prison, or upon Bonds, cannot be proceeded against Legally at the Common Law for want of Jurors; because, as aforesaid, most of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders are in Rebellion.</p>
                        <p>Therefore of necessity, those Persons must either not be Attainted at all, or onely by Act of Parliament, which is scarce possible to be effected, if this present Parliament be Dissolved, or Discontinued; for that upon a new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to be Summon'd, the Knights and Burgesses must be Elected by the Free-holders and Inhabitants respectively, most whereof are in Rebellion. And yet the present Parliament will be discontinued, unless a Commission under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> to the now Lords Justices, or other the Chief Governour or Governours for the time being, be here before the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> next, being the day of Prorogation, for the beginning of the next Session of Parliament, to enable them to continue this present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the last Commission for the continuance thereof being onely to the Lords Justices, one whereof is since remov'd.</p>
                        <p>Unless the Parties now in Rebellion, being Legally Attainted, which cannot be here, as is aforesaid, as the case now stands, but by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Majesty cannot have power to dispose of their Estates, as in his wisdom he shall think fit, either for the increasing of his Revenues, or for the

               <p>The Cessation as yet not being known to his Majesty, the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices and Council received a Letter from him at the Camp at <hi>Matson</hi> near <hi>Gloucester,</hi> of the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>Septemb.</hi> passionately resenting the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and complaints of the Officers, who (upon all occasions) had a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection in his breast.

Whereas not onely the great neglect of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of that Our Kingdom, by the remaining part of our Houses of Parliament, who pretended so great care of it, but their impious preventing all Supplies destin'd to their Relief by Our Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, (which did ever most readily concur to any Levy of Men, Money, or any other Work, in order to the Assistance of Our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Subjects there) and employing the same in an unnatural War against Us their Liege Lord and Sovereign, hath reduc'd our Army in that our Kingdom into so heavy straits, that out of Our Care of the preservation of them, who so faithfully ventur'd their Lives for Our Service, We were brought to condescend to a Treaty for a Cessation of Arms: Our Will and Pleasure is, and We do hereby Charge and Command you, that in case, according unto the Authority given unto you by Us, you have agreed upon a Cessation, or as soon as you shall agree thereupon, you, or any two of you do immediately consider of, and put in execution these Our following Commands.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="1">
                                 <pb n="133" facs="tcp:93738:87"/>
1. That you agree upon what number of Our Army will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be kept in Garrison there, for the maintenance of the same during the time of the Cessation, and what Soldiers they shall be, and what Persons shall command the same; and that you settle them accordingly in that Command, as shall appear to your discretion to be most conducing to our Service.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. That you do consider and advise of the best means of Transporting the rest of Our Army in that Our Province of <hi>Leimster,</hi> (excepting such as are to be kept in Garrison in Our Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi>) and to that end We do hereby give you, or any one of you, full Power and Authority, to hire all Ships, Barques, or Vessels whatsoever, and to treat with any Persons whatsoever for the Loan, Hire, or Sale of any Ships, Barques, or Vessels, upon such Conditions as you, or any one of you, shall agree upon with them.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. That in such time and manner as to you shall seem meet, you communicate to the Officers and Soldiers of that Our Army this Our intention, to make use of their known Courage and Fidelity in the defence of Our Person and Crown, against the unnatural Rebellion rais'd against us in this Our Kingdom, and against the like labour'd by the Rebels here, to be rais'd against Us out of Our Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="4">4. That you signifie unto them, that We are the more mov'd and necessitated unto this course, for as much as it is resolv'd by some ill affected Persons in that Our Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to call over the Army of Our <hi>British</hi> Subjects out of Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the end to make use of them for the Invasion of Us, and of Our Good Subjects of <hi>England.</hi> And for as much as this Rebellion against Us, under colour of the humility of Our two Houses of Parliament, hath exhausted the Means appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the concurrence of Our Royal Authority, for the sustenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Our Army there, and by force hath stai'd and taken from Us all those Our Revenues, which might have enabled Us to have supplied them in that Our Kingdom, so that we ought in reason (besides the Bond of their Allegiance) to expect their ready concurrence against those Persons, who are as well the Causers of all the Miseries they have endured, as of all the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries We have suffered.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. That you assure them, both Officers and Soldiers, that upon their Landing here, they shall immediately receive Our Pay, in the same proportion and manner with the rest of our Army
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93738:88"/>
here. And you are to assure the Soldiers, that all care shall be taken, that Cloathes, Shoes, and other Necessaries be forthwith provided for them, after they are Landed here; and that care shall be taken for the Provision of such as shall happen to be maim'd here in Our Service; and for the payment of all their Arrears that shall be due to any of them that shall happen to be kill'd in the same, to their Wives, Children, or nearest Friends. And you are to assure both Officers and Soldiers, that we will take special care to reward all such according to their Merit and Quality, that shall do us any eminent Service in this Our War, against this odious and most unnatural Rebellion.</p>

We will and require you, and do hereby authorize you, to use your utmost Interest and Industry, for the speedy Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this forementioned part of Our Army, with their Arms, Horses, and such Ammunition, and the like, as you shall think fit, into Our Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> and particularly, if it may be, to our Fort of the City of <hi>Chester,</hi> or to the most commodious Haven in <hi>North-Wales.</hi> And for Our obedience in this, and every other of these Our Commands, this shall be to you, and every of you, sufficient Warrant.</p>

               <p>To what Party the Cessation was happy, will be hard to determine; that thereby the Rebels had an opportunity (which they improv'd) to provide themselves of Arms and Ammunition, may easily be conceiv'd; in as much as the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> concluded, the Cessation in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was of advantage to none, but to the bloody Rebels of that Kingdom: Agreeable to what <hi>Camd.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Annals Eliz.

Certain it is the Parliament improv'd the Cessation to a very specious pretence, in as much as <hi>no estate</hi> (say they) <hi>of the Rebels was to be disposed of (consequently no Cessation or Peace to be made) till the Lords and Commons of the Realm of</hi> England
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93738:88"/>
                  <hi>should, in Parliament, by order, declare, that the said Rebels were subdued, and this present Rebellion appeas'd and ended.</hi> But on the contrary, his Majesty shew'd the necessity of his good Protestant Subjects, and the Army (being not longer able to subsist for want of Supplies) enforced that Cessation; though he is told again, That many (since the Cessation) have, and do subsist: And that one end for which the Cessation was made, was, that the Forces might be brought out of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and employ'd against the two Houses: Which, in Answer, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty shews the reason of, when the <hi>Scots</hi> Army before was made use of against him. The whole Scene is excellently stated in his Majesties An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the two Papers concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> at the Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge:</hi> How passionately soever the Parliaments Commissioners conclude, <hi>That whatsoever becomes of us,</hi> (say they) <hi>if we must perish, yet let us go to our graves with that comfort, that we have not made Peace with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Christ, yea, even Enemies of Mankind, declared and unreconciled Enemies to our Religion and Nation.</hi> And (indeed, to give the Parliament their due) when they had reduc'd the Affairs of <hi>England</hi> to their own Module, the Rebels of <hi>Ireland</hi> were frequently chastised, and so affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately pursued, that neither Men, Money, or Courage was wanting to that service. Of the first part of which Paragraph, his Majesty seems most sensible, expressing (in his Answer before-mention'd) <hi>That he would be glad, that either a Peace in</hi> England, <hi>or any other Expedient, might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him with Means and Power to do Justice upon them; if this cannot be, we must not desperately expose our good Subjects there to Butchery, without means or possibility of Protection: God will, in his due time, avenge his own quarrel. In the mean time, his Gospel gives us leave, in case of War, to sit down and cast up the cost, and estimate our power to go through with it; and in such case, where Prudence adviseth, it is lawful to propose Conditions of Peace, though the War otherwise might justly be pursued.</hi> This wrought much on many. But the Parliament (who persisted resolutely to have his Majesty disclaim the Cessation) would not allow any necessity for it, alledging, that though some of great estimation with the Parliament (whom his Majesties Commissioners produc'd as principally interessed in the managing of Affairs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the War there) had prest for Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, as in all likelihood to perish speedily without them; yet they were assur'd (even by some who were at the Council at that time when those Letters were written) that the same was done onely to press for Supplies out of <hi>England,</hi> without the least intention in them of inducing a Cessation; which is granted. But as the necessities were there laid open, so they were considered by his Majesty, and no other Expedient remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Protestants safety, save a Cessation, thereupon it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded<note n="*" place="margin">His Majesties Answer to the Commissioners last Paper at <hi>Uxbridge, fol.</hi> 557.</note>; though to this day some will have it, that his Majesties expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be supplied thence, and the preservation of the <hi>Irish,</hi> almost swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by his Forces, were the principal Motives to that Cessation. And it must be acknowledged, from the series of Affairs since, that the <hi>Irish</hi> (in concluding the Cessation) had a respect to their greater security and designs, <hi>those</hi> being thereby withdrawn to his Majesties service in <hi>England,</hi> which otherwise would certainly have oppos'd them.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but observe, that the <hi>Irish</hi> afterwards acquired much confidence, by a Bull of <hi>Pope Urban</hi>'s the <hi>8th.</hi> dated at <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1643. commending their forwardness against the Protestant Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, which they publish'd even after the Cessation of Arms was agreed
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93738:89"/>
on; to what intent may be easily conceiv'd, considering their subsequent frequent violation of Compacts and Agreements with the State. Though the bleeding <hi>Iphigenia</hi> (who, in pleading their Cause, grosly betrays it) would not have it thought, that this charitable Bull cherish'd the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks in Rebellion, but was onely an Indulgence to so good and just a Quarrel, not any dis-respect to the King, to whom (saith he) his Holiness advised them, by their Agents, to be Loyal; as if that, and the breach of his Majesties Commands to lay down Arms, could rationally agree. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which Bull, an Indulgence had been sent, <hi>Dilecto filio Eugenio Onello,</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1642, in the <hi>20th.</hi> year of his Papacy.</p>
               <p>The Cessation now concluded, Obedience was expected from all parts; but instead of an absolute compliance from the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ulster,</hi> their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in Chief return'd this Letter.

This kind of usage and contempt would constrain good Servants, though his <hi>Majesties Loyal Subjects,</hi> to think upon some course which may be satisfactory to them, being driven almost to despair, and threaten'd to be persecuted by the <hi>Roman Catholick Subjects, as they are now called.</hi> Nevertheless, of the foresaid Contempt (for obedience to his Majesties Command) I have mov'd the Army for the time to cease any hostile Act against our Enemies, till such time as your Lordships will be pleased to consider better of our present condition, and grant us time to acquaint the General, who has onely Commission over the Army, to advise us how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our selves in this Exigency; since I (as Governour of <hi>Carigfergus</hi>) can give your Lordships no positive Answer to this Cessation in the name of our Army, having not absolute Power over them: And immediately after receiving the General's resolution, your Lordships shall be acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; which is the least favour your Lordships can vouchsafe upon us, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of our <hi>Bygan Service.</hi> And so I remain,</p>

               <p>Upon which (as you see) many came over into <hi>England,</hi> and at <hi>Hawerden</hi> Castle, <hi>Beeston</hi> Castle, <hi>Bartomley</hi> Church, <hi>Dedington</hi> House, <hi>Acton</hi> Church, and <hi>Durtwich,</hi> improved their time; but the main body, the 25. of <hi>January,</hi> 1643. was utterly defeated by Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> raising the Siege of <hi>Namptwich,</hi> 1500 common Souldiers besides Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers being there taken Prisoners, besides those that were slain; so that what advantage accrewed to the Regal Army by their coming over, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny believ'd was not very considerable, unless those, who came out of <hi>Munster,</hi> were more successful. The general (if not all those who came to his Majesties assistance out of <hi>Ireland</hi>) were his own Forces, which he <note n="*" place="margin">See his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Message from <hi>Oxford,</hi> the 24. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1645. <hi>Fol.</hi> 227.</note> had sent against the Rebels, from whom I cannot yet learn (after all their professions of having no one hollow thought, or subtile practice to serve two Masters, or standing Neuters, whilst their King was Party <note n="*" place="margin">View their Letter again of the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1643.</note>) that any formed Regiment, or considerable, Party reach'd <hi>England,</hi> no! it will hereafter appear, how shamefully they deserted his Majesties Affairs, even in <hi>Ireland</hi> it self, when their Interest might have united them in Loyalty and Obedience.</p>
               <p>Some months after the arrival of these and other Forces out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> made an Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">Octob. 24. 1644.</note>, against the giving of any Quarter to any <hi>Irish</hi> man, or to any Papist born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> taken in Hostility against the Parliament, by Sea or Land, which his Majesty thought very severe, they being called to the service of their Natural Prince.</p>
               <p>The coming over of the <hi>English</hi> made several (that were not so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) suspected in their Loyalty; though (in truth) never any Prince had an Army more intirely affecting his Person, then the generality of his Militia of <hi>Ireland;</hi> who being sent thither, or rais'd there, were not yet wean'd from the Justice of that Cause, hardly matchable in any example, the War being (said, long since, a great Instrument of State) not an ambitious War of Foraigns, but a recovery of Subjects (and that after Lenity of Conditions often tried) not onely to obedience, but to Humanity and Policy, from more then <hi>Indian</hi> Barbarism: whereas the Affairs of <hi>England</hi> imbrued Relations in one anothers blood, and the Concerns of <hi>Ireland</hi> were as much his Majesties as the other; and the Cause undoubtedly Gods.</p>
               <p>The Lords Justices and Council (this while) had a great task, and not so much as straw to the Work, the Confederates paying in the Money, (<hi>viz.</hi> 30800 <hi>l.</hi> they promised the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> towards the maintenance of his Majesties Army, this Cessation) very uncertain,<note place="margin">The <hi>Irish</hi> break the Cessation.</note> as their Cows and Cattle of the worst, taking within three days after the Cessation, near 369 head of choice <hi>English</hi> Cattle from the suburbs of <hi>Dublin,</hi> acting besides many other violencies on divers Castles, Forts, and Houses; so as this agreement with the Rebels seemed rather a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, then a Cessation, of Acts of Hostility: That in this extremity the Lords Justices Providence and Care (how great soever) could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy little, being their business now was to proceed in another course then formerly they had: the Election of which grew hourly the heavier upon them, by reason of the discontents which constantly arose from the Inhabitants, and the Protestants (now, more then ever, sensible of their Condition, the <hi>Irish</hi> Agents making all the speed they could to repair

(with their Propositions) to his Majesty then at <hi>Oxford,</hi> according to an Article in the Cessation, and his Majesties Proclamation thereupon, by which they were allowed to send Agents to his Majesty; of which, the Protestants in and about <hi>Dublin</hi> being very apprehensive, lest his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty should be pre-possessed of the Rebels sence, they thought it most convenient to dispatch Agents presently to his Majesty; and to that end<note place="margin">Agents being to go from the Rebels to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the State, that they might have some to attend (at the same time) his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Pleasure.</note> about the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1643. they meeting at the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi>'s house, fram'd a Petition to the Lords Justices and Council, humbly beseeching their Lordships for their License unto such, as they should appoint to attend his Majesty in their behalf, whereunto the Lords Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Council, the 12. of the same month, expressed their forwardness, declaring how his Majesty, had been graciously pleas'd to put them in mind, <hi>that thence</hi> they should send some of his Majesties Ministers to assist in the Treaty, when the <hi>Irish</hi> should repair to him; and when they had acquainted his Majesty with the Petitioners request, they should be certified of his Pleasure with convenient speed: But the Petitioners (not conceiving this a satisfactory answer) again Petitioned the Lords Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Council, the 14. of the same month, sending them therewithall a Copy of their Petition they had agreed on to his Majesty; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Lord Justices and Council, the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> returned an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; <hi>That</hi> such was their care of the Petitioners, that the same day they had given them an Answer to their former Petition; they inclosed in their Letters to Secretary <hi>Nicholas</hi> their first Petition to them, request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majesties gracious Pleasure thereupon, and further they could not now proceed, though if they would repair to his Majesty, they would not hinder them, but could not accompany them with their recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, till they knew his Majesties Pleasure to have them come over; much artifice there was used, to have had some protested against the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had framed to his Majesty, but none of those who had signed it (save Major <hi>Morris</hi>) was wrought upon; and the 17. of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1643. the Petition was so well approved of in the House of Commons in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as it had their concurrence: And about the beginning of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> a Letter of his Majesties to the Lords Justices, and Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Army (dated the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1643.) arrived at <hi>Dublin,</hi> Licencing the Protestant Agents to repair to <hi>Oxford;</hi> of whose further Proceedings with the management of that business, you shall have speedily.<note place="margin">Motions made upon the Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, that some of the Confederates should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto their dwellings.</note>

               <p>Not long after the Cessation, one mov'd at the Council Board by way of Petition, <hi>That such of the</hi> Irish <hi>(as would constantly pay contribution to the Army) might have freedom to return to their Castles:</hi> and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion took with some, but was strongly oppos'd by others, considering how many gallant men (as Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt,</hi> and others) had been lost in the regaining of those Castles; and that (it being uncertain on what terms there might be Peace,) it might be taken ill by the King, that those Castles (the price of so much blood) should be surrendred without his Privity, upon which the motion was laid aside; I will not say, all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections afterwards on them that oppos'd it: Nor indeed was the event of this motion so supprest, but that in a short time after, some (through the Importunity of the <hi>Irish</hi> Agents) were restored to their Estates, who had from the beginning been in Rebellion; notwithstanding their Estates had been given in Custodium, and those who had them (not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mean and sinister proffers) had little else to subsist by, or pay the Arrears of their Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:93738:91"/>So as Affairs of different natures hourly encreasing, subject to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, beyond the management of the Prudentest and most Loyal thoughts, it could not but be a great ease to be free'd of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which an Illustrious Person (whose Interest was Principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in the present Intrigues) had a Regal Call thereunto; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon these Lords Justices were remov'd, not without considerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, difficulties daily flowing in upon them, remediless by any but his Excellency <hi>James</hi> Marquiss of <hi>Ormond,</hi> who the 21. of <hi>January,</hi>

                  </note> were authorized to present to his Majesty the Grievances, of his Protestant Subjects in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that nothing might be granted in that Treaty, to the prejudice of their Interest and security.</p>
               <p>Each Party arrived at <hi>Oxford</hi> near the midst of <hi>April;</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Agents got thither soonest, having less Remora's in their dispatch.</p>
               <p>The Confederates, as men who thought themselves possessed of the whole strength and Power of the Kingdom, and the Kings condition in <hi>England</hi> so weak, as he would buy their assistance at any rates, demanded upon the Matter, the total alteration of Government, both in Church and State, the very form of making and enacting Laws, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Government, and which had been practis'd, ever since the Reign of King <hi>H.</hi> 7. must be abolished; and instead of Liberty or To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration for the exercise of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, they insisted on such Priviledges, Immunities, and Power, as would have amounted at best, but to a Toleration of the Protestant Religion, and that no longer then they should think fit to consent to it.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the Committee of Parliament (as men who too much felt the smart and anguish of their late sufferings, undervalued and condemned the <hi>Irish,</hi> as inferior to them in Courage and Conduct, and as possessed of much greater Power by the Cessation, then they could retain in War,) very earnestly prest the execution of the Laws in force, Reparation for the dammages they had sustain'd, disarming the <hi>Irish</hi> in such manner, and to such a degree, as it might not be hereafter in their Power to do more mischief, and such other Conditions, as People (who are able to contend) are not usually perswaded to submit unto, which the Committee <note n="*" place="margin">The Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> Earl of <hi>Bristol, Portland,</hi> Lord <hi>George Digby,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Nicholas,</hi> Sir <hi>John Culpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> &amp;c. These of the Council much troubled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests of the Rebels and Protestants.</note> at <hi>Oxford</hi> for <hi>Irish</hi> Affairs, insisted on with powerful Reasons and Arguments.</p>
               <p>In these so different and distant Applications, they who were sent as moderate Men from the Council, knew not how to behave themselves, but enough discovered, that they had not the confidence in the <hi>Irish,</hi> as to be willing that they should be so far trusted, that the performance of their Duty should depend onely on their Affection and Allegiance; But that there should be a greater Restraint upon them, then they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to submit to; otherwise that the Protestant Religion, and <hi>English</hi> Interest, would be sooner rooted out by the Peace they proposed, then it could be by the War.</p>
               <p>It is very true, that the <hi>Irish</hi> Agents demean'd themselves to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,<note place="margin">The <hi>Irish</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mov'd, at what they were from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to stand upon.</note> with great shew of Modesty and Duty, (they were Men that lack'd neither Art nor Behaviour) and confessed, that they believ'd that the Demands they were enjoyn'd to insist upon, were such as his Majesty could not consent unto; and that the present condition of his Affairs was not so well understood by them, or by those who sent them, before their coming out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as it now was; which if it had been, they were
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93738:92"/>
confident they should have had such Instructions, as would better have complied with their own Desires, and his Majesty's Occasions; and therefore frankly offer'd to return and use their utmost Endeavours, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Confederate Council, (whose Deputies they were, and who then exercised the supream Power over the Confederate Catholicks of that Kingdom) to more Moderation, and to return their full submission and obedience to his Majesty, upon such Conditions as his Goodness would consent unto for their security. But how little of this was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, you shall find in the sequel of the Story; however, the King sent his Command the 16th. of <hi>Feb.</hi> 164. to the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and renew their Cessation for another year; and likewise a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to make a full Peace with his Catholick Subjects, upon such Conditions he found agreeable to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good and Welfare, and might produce such a Peace and Union in that Kingdom, as might vindicate his Regal Power and Authority, and suppress the Rebels in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> And so his Majesty dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Catholick Agents, with demonstration of much Grace and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with this good Council, which he most pathetically poured out to them at their departure. <hi>That they should not forget, the preservation of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the <hi>Irish</hi> Agents at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> 
                  <hi>the Nation, and Religion which they professed, and were so zealous for in</hi> Ireland, <hi>depended upon the preservation of his just Rights and Authority in</hi> England: <hi>That they saw his Subjects of</hi> Scotland, <hi>contrary to all Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had invaded</hi> England, <hi>and joyned with those Rebels against him, who without that assistance would have been speedily reduced to their obedience. And therefore if his Catholick Subjects of</hi> Ireland <hi>made haste, upon such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as he might then grant without prejudice to himself, and which should be amply sufficient for the security of their Fortunes, Lives, and Exercise of their Religion, to assist him, whereby he might be enabled by God's Blessing to suppress that Rebellion, they might confidently believe, he would never forget to whose Merit he owed his Preservation and Restauration, and it would then be in his absolute Power to vouchsafe Graces to them, to compleat their happiness, and which (he gave them his Royal Word) he would then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in such manner, as should not leave them disappointed of any of their just and full Expectations. But if (by insisting on such Particulars, as he could not in Conscience consent to, and their Consciences obliged them not to ask, or on such, as though he could himself be content to yield to, yet in that Juncture of Time, would bring such great damage to him, that all the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies they could give or send to him, could not countervail, and might be as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficially granted to them hereafter, when he might better do it) they should delay their joyning with him, and so look on, till the Rebel's Power prevail'd against him in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland, <hi>and suppress'd his Party in those Kingdoms, it would then be too late for them to give him help, and they would quickly find their Strength in</hi> Ireland, <hi>but an imaginary Support for his or their own Interest, and that they who with much difficulty had destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, would without any considerable Opposition, ruine their Interest, and root out their Religion with their Nation, from all the Dominions which should be subject to their exorbitant Jurisdiction.</hi> How much of this prov'd a Prophesie, their sad Experience knows, and the World cannot but take notice of.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Confederate's Agents were dismissed, the Protestant's Committee of Parliament (who had managed their Scene with much Courage and Integrity) drew off, with the King's Favour and Promise <hi>to do the utmost he could for them.</hi>

                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:93738:93"/>In the managing of which Affairs, if they had not been very resolute, arm'd with much Truth, they would certainly have fall'n under many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies: For, besides what they met with at <hi>Oxford,</hi> they had still Correspondence, and accordingly acted, as they were animated by a Party of the Protestant Committee of the Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> then resident in <hi>Dublin,</hi> who (that they might decline the height of what those at <hi>Oxford</hi> proposed) were tempted by an Order of the Council-Board to certifie, Whether the 24 Propositions <note n="*" place="margin">Appendix 13.</note> of his Majesty's Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Agents of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (presented to his Majesty the 18th. of <hi>April,</hi> 1644.) <hi>did agree with their sence, in order to the present condition of the Kingdom:</hi> Whereby it's thought, that if it had been said, that the 24 Propositions had been agreed to by <hi>the Protestants in general,</hi> there would have been an Endeavour, to have got <hi>some</hi> to have signed an Instrument against the Agent's Proceedings; and therefore their Proceeding was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be according to their Instructions, and their Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent's Advice in Town: As in the Answer.

When the <hi>Irish</hi> Confederates Agents return'd into <hi>Ireland,</hi> most of them (as far as acted in view) perform'd their Promise and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the King, so as many of the Nobility and Gentry, and most of<note place="margin">The <hi>Irish</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our on their Return into <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </note> the Persons of considerable Fortune, together with the moderate Clergy, (who are easie to be number'd) were convinc'd of the necessity of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themselves entirely to the King, till he was able to grant them more, that they might not be glad to accept of less. But the evil Genius of that People, (condemn'd to wilful ruine and misfortune) soon evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc'd how unripe they were for mercy, and that it was not so easie to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the Spirits they had conjur'd up, as to foment and irritate them. The Nobility, and Men of known Fortune, (whom self-Interest (by this time) had taught Loyalty) found that they had lost their Power, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence they had parted with to the Clergy, had much Influence on he common People, who, devoting themselves solely to their Clergy's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate, oppos'd all Conclusions, which (according to Wisdom and true Policy) were to be the Ingredients of a happy and lasting Peace. And so above 2 years were spent, (after these Agent's departure from the King) in fruitless and in-effectual Treaties, the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> in the interim,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi>'s unjust Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King's Affairs in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Legible in his Message, dated at <hi>Oxford,</hi> 29. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1645.</note> treating in that wilde order with the Rebels, as under a pretended suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Authority from the King, (utterly disown'd) he blew them up to such a pernicious Expectation, by the feigned Articles he sign'd to them, the 25th. of <hi>August,</hi> 1645. so destructive both to Church and State, and so repugnant to his Majesty's publick Professions, and known Resolutions, as the Treaty of Peace (proceeding on more agreeable Terms by the Lord Lieutenant) found many rubbs and impediments. Whilst the Strength and Power of the Parliament's Forces in <hi>England</hi> exceedingly increased, and his Majesty's Forces were defeated, and himself (for want of Succours promis'd out of <hi>Ireland</hi>) was compelled to deliver up himself to his <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Subjects, and was shortly after by them given into the hands of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> who being (at last) split into several Factions, so varied Councils, as (in conclusion) he was betrayed, and suffer'd, to the astonishment of the World.</p>
               <p>But that I may not o're-slip the Series of this Story, which, through a conflux of Matter, will sometimes unavoidably be disturbed, I must take notice, that the first Cessation being near determin'd, the 5th. of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1644. there was a new Cessation agreed on by the Lord Lieutenant, and the <hi>Irish</hi> Commissioners, to begin on the 15th. of <hi>September,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue till the 1st. of <hi>December</hi> following. And in respect that the Treaty of Peace had several Matters of weight and consequence, which necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required further time to be prepared, and drawn into writing, it was agreed on at the Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the 2d. of <hi>Octob. anno praedict.</hi> that the Treaty should be adjourn'd to the 4th. of <hi>November</hi> ensuing, the <hi>Irish</hi> Agents, in the interim, to have liberty to continue in, or come to <hi>Dublin,</hi> as often as they should think fit; which time they improved, and Affairs were so managed, as there was never any other Cessation till the Peace.</p>
               <p>About which time, the Earls of <hi>Thomond, Clanrickard,</hi> and St. <hi>Albans,</hi> the Lord <hi>Rannelagh, Fitz-williams, Taaff,</hi> and <hi>Dillon,</hi> who had never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded from his Majesty's Commands, writ to him, That betwixt two Parties, one, if they were disposed to make Invasion upon them, and the other, who sticking to the Covenant, dis-obey'd the Cessation, they were like to be ruin'd; and therefore implor'd his Majesty, to reconcile

the Difference betwixt those, who were too high, either of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates or Protestants, in their Demands, and declare against the <hi>Scots,</hi> who would make little distinction (were it in their power) between them, and those whom they now assaulted.</p>
               <p>In treating of Peace, we must not forget, that the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been easily wrought on to agree to the Cessation) carried over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his <hi>Munster</hi> Forces to the King, who in memory of his service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on him a noble Wardship, and would have made him an Earl: But the Presidency of <hi>Munster</hi> (pre-dispos'd of to the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi>) being his aim, he returns again into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and from <hi>Cork,</hi> the 17th. of <hi>July,</hi> 1644. he and other Officers there writes to his Majesty, <hi>That no Peace could be concluded with the</hi> Irish <hi>Rebels, which would not bring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majesty, and the</hi> English <hi>in general, a far greater prejudice, than the shew of a Peace there would bring them an advantage,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thereupon besought him, that he would not so much regard so inconsiderable a handful of People as they were, as to purchase but a seeming security, by leaving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Protestant Religion in all likelihood to be extirpated, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty obnoxious to the loss of that Kingdom: Further beseeching his Majesty, that he would be pleas'd</hi> to Proclaim again the <hi>Irish</hi> to be Rebels, <hi>and not to pardon those who have committed so many barbarous Crimes that they are as far above description, as they are short of honesty, professing they had his Majesties Commission for what they did; the true sense of which devillish aspersion cast upon his Majesty, with other reasons, made them resolve to die a thousand deaths, rather than condescend to any Peace; referring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in other things to their Declaration.</hi>

palliated and disguised it, that many are fully perswaded, they had reason for what they did: But we believe, all men of Judgment will change that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, when they shall know, <hi>That though they were a Conquer'd People,</hi> yet the Laws were administred unto them with as much equity, as to the <hi>English;</hi> That they enjoyed their Religion, though not by Tolleration, yet by Connivance; That their Lords (though Papists) sate in Parliament; And that the Election of the Knights of the Shire, and Burgesses, was free, and though of a contrary Religion, were admitted into the House of Commons. yet for all <hi>these,</hi> and many other vast Favours and Priviledges, when every one was sitting under his Vine and Fig-tree, without any provocation, they resolve upon a general extirpation, both of the Protestants and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which, without doubt, they had effected, had not God been more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful than they were wicked, and by a Miracle discovered this devillish De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; whereof, though we had notice just time enough to secure our main Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine at <hi>Dublin,</hi> yet we could not prevent the butchery of multitudes of innocent Souls, which suffered at the first in the Province of <hi>Ulster;</hi> and since they have continued this Rebellion with such perfidiousness and bloodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that though we had been as guilty as we are innocent, yet the prosecuting of the War with that barbarousness, had rather been a sin than justice. But by Gods great providence, when the Rebellion brake out first, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was sitting, unto whom his Majesty communicated so much of his Power over this Kingdom, as we shall hereafter mention, and gave them great encouragement to prosecute the War against the Rebels, by granting Lands unto such as should adventure Money for the maintenance of the War. Whereupon the Parliament (who were most willing to advance so good a Cause) sent us at first large Supplies, which had so good success, that the Divine as well as Humane Justice did proclaim them Rebels; for indeed God Almighty (since the deliverance of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> from the <hi>Egyptians</hi>) never appeared so visibly as in this War. But the unhappy mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding between the King and Parliament did so hinder the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of those Supplies for this Kingdom, that all we received in nineteen months, amounted not to five weeks entertainment; so that the Army which was sent to relieve us, lived upon us. And truly we may with Justice profess, that the Forces of this Province did feed as miraculously as fight, being never able to prescribe any certain way of subsistance for one month together; but when the poor Inhabitants were almost beggar'd, and no means for the Forces to subsist on left, a Cessation of Arms was made for a twelvemonth with the Rebels, which our necessity (not inclination) compelled us to bear with; and the rather out of a firm hope, that the Almighty, out of his infinite goodness, would, within that year, settle a right understanding between the King and Parliament, that then they would unanimously revenge the crying blood of so many thousands of innocent Souls; and until God blessed us with the sight of that happy Union, we might keep our Garrisons (which otherwise we could not) the better to enable them to prosecute so just and honourable a design. But this Cessation was as fatal to us, during the time of Treaty, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it was ill observed; for they (knowing what agreement they would enforce us to condescend unto) did privately send one or two persons to every Castle that we had demolished, which under pretence of being by that means in their possession, they ever since detain, though it be contrary to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. And which is more injurious, they have at all times since entred upon what Lands they have thought fit, and detained them also; and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villish malice having no bounds, they did place Guards upon the High-ways
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93738:95"/>
to interrupt our Markets, and punished divers of their own Party for coming with Provisions to us, thereby to deter all from bringing any relief to our Garrisons, that so they might starve us out of those Places, that neither their fraud or force could get from us; which that they might the better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish, they murthered divers of the poor <hi>English,</hi> that presuming on the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of free Commerce, went abroad to buy Victuals; which certainly would have caused them to have declined that course of seeking Food, if hunger, threatning them with more certain death, had not forced them thereunto. And whereas we trusted, that these notorious infidelities in them, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite sufferings in us, would have been so visible to his Majesty, that nothing could have induc'd him to make a Peace with so perfidious a People, who through their fawning and insinuating with his Majesty, and by <hi>the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of some,</hi> who represent, that there is no way left for the securing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of <hi>English,</hi> but by a Peace. We find his Majesty (being deluded by the first, and believing the last to be conducing to the preservation of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Protestant Subjects) is concluding of a Peace, which will again admit those <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels to be Members of Parliament; so that that Court which should afford relief for our Grievances, will, by their over-swaying Votes, be our greatest Grievance.</p>
                              <p>Moreover, we are too truly informed by divers of their own Party, (whose names if we should publish, would be as great an ingratitude as folly; the first, in betraying those that obliged us; the last, in depriving our selves of all future Intelligence by them) that they have vowed never to submit to an <hi>English</hi> or Protestant Government, except they have liberty to exercise their Religion in Churches; That the Forces of the Kingdom may be Train'd-Bands of their Men; and that likewise those of their own Religion may be admitted to Places of Trust in the Common-wealth, which they call modest and moderate demands; though we hope they cannot seem so to any but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their Clergy, who, we find, do not think them enough, being they may not have all their Church-Livings. For we have certain intelligence, that they have made a strong Faction, as well among my Lord of <hi>Castle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven's</hi> Soldiers, as in all other parts of the Kingdom, so that they are five parts of six who will fly out into a new action, when they see a convenient time to execute their design, which as yet they determine to forbear, until they see a Peace concluded; supposing, that then the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> will intermix <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>English</hi> without distinction, to oppose the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that by that means there will be a sufficient number of their Party in our Garrisons to master them, which, when they find an opportunity for, they will certainly seize into their own hands; upon notice whereof, the Faction abroad will, with all expedition, apprehend the <hi>English</hi> in all parts; and having accomplished this part of their design, they will manifest that they are weary of the King of <hi>England's</hi> Government, and that they will trust none of his Protestant Subjects among them; for we are certainly informed, that they will invite a Forreign Prince to take them into his protection, unto whom they will deliver possession of what he pleases, and will become his Subjects.</p>
                              <p>And lest that Princes Treasure should be exhausted by Wars in other places, the Clergy have, with the Pope's assistance, raised amongst those of their own Calling, and divers of the Gentry in <hi>Italy,</hi> one hundred thousand pounds in money, and a quantity of Arms and Ammunition, that are now ready to be sent hither; and they have employed one Doctor <hi>Duyer</hi> to go forthwith thither for it; as also to get his Holiness to settle a course for
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93738:95"/>
the raising of more Money, to be employed for the advancement of that which they call the Catholick Cause.</p>
                              <p>Therefore out of a true sense of our injuries already suffered, and un-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed, with a right apprehension of inevitable ruine, not onely to our Lives and Estates, but likewise to the <hi>English</hi> Nation and Protestant Religion, we have re-assum'd our Arms, according to our Duty to God, our King and Countrey, with inviolable resolution to die, or frustrate this devillish design.</p>
                              <p>And since those that die acting for the Gospel, are as perfect Martyrs, as those that die suffering for it; we cannot but with joy embrace any effect, that proceeds from so glorious a Cause.</p>
                              <p>Neither can this act be esteemed a crime in us, since his Majesty, upon the Rebels first Insurrection, his Treasure being exhausted, gave his Royal assent for the passing of an Act of Parliament, wherein he granted (to all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that would adventure money towards reducing of the Rebels) Lands proportionable to the sum adventured, which would fall to the Crown, when the Conquest should be finished. And the better to secure the Adventurers, his Majesty obliged himself to make no Peace with the Rebels, but with the advice and approbation of the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> and by that Act, communicated to the Parliament that Power, which before was solely in himself. So that they not condescending to this Peace, our imploying of their Aids, and re-assuming of those Arms put into our hands by King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment joyntly, cannot be esteemed contradictory to his Majesty, in regard that their joynt Act is so absolutely binding, that neither of them severally can annull it, as is evident in the Laws of the Realm.</p>
                              <p>Therefore if this War were onely Offensive, yet even slander it self must acknowledge us innocent, having so just a Cause, so pious an Intention, and so lawful an Authority; much more it being Defensive, and the Law both of God and Nature allowing every one to defend himself from violence and wrong.</p>
                              <p>Moreover, the King must never expect any obedience from the <hi>Irish,</hi> but what proceeds either from their Interest, or Fear. Through the first of these, neither his Majesty or we can hope for assurance; for not granting them all their desires, their Interest (which is more powerful with them than their Loyalty) will make them throw off their subjection, and to become absolute, not scruple to destroy us: Then to expect any security by their fears, were frivolous; for though <hi>we have found their Hearts as ill as their Cause,</hi> yet they cannot be apprehensive of 2 or 3000 ill armed and unprovided men, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things necessary, and so numerous a People at their devotion.</p>
                              <p>And lest our Enemies should scandalize us with breach of Faith, in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the pretended Cessation; or with Cruelty, in expelling the <hi>Irish</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists from our Garrisons, who hitherto seemed adhering to us.</p>
                              <p>Concerning the first, we declare, That although our necessities did induce us to submit, supposing the Cessation would have produced other effects, as is before mentioned; yet we had no power (without Authority from King and Parliament joyntly) to treat or yield to it; or if it had been in our powers, yet by the Rebels daily breaches of it, we are disengaged from it.</p>
                              <p>Concerning the second, we declare, That our Garrison cannot be secured, whilst so powerful and perfidious Enemies are in our bosomes; Powerful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four to one in number more than the <hi>English;</hi> Perfidious, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant designs to betray us, some whereof we will instance, to convince their own Consciences, and satisfie the World of our just proceedings.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="150" facs="tcp:93738:96"/>One <hi>Francis Matthews,</hi> a <hi>Franciscan Frier,</hi> (being wonderfully disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in an Enigmatical Letter, and as justly executed) before his death confessed, that he had agreed to betray the City of <hi>Cork</hi> to the Lord of <hi>Muskery;</hi> which must necessarily infer, that the chiefest and greatest part of that City were engaged in this Conspiracy, for otherwise he could not so much as hope the accomplishment: And if this had taken effect, it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently ruin'd all the Protestants in the Province of <hi>Munster,</hi> that being our chief Magazine, and greatest Garrison. Besides, upon this occasion, other Friers being examin'd upon Oath, confessed, that in their daily Masses with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Town, and all other of our Garrisons, (where Papists did inhabit) they prayed for the advancement of the Catholick Cause, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Rebels fought for.</p>
                              <p>And lastly, we have lately discovered, that the now Major and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration had combined with the Rebels to betray the Town to them; and for that purpose an Army was drawn to all the parts adjoyning to our Garrisons; in the three chiefest whereof, we are confident, the Rebels had their Party; but by Divine Providence, before the Plot could be executed, the Major presuming on his speedy success, contemned the Lord of <hi>Inche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin's</hi> Authority, by opposing the levying of the Moneys granted by the <hi>English,</hi> for the maintenance of the Soldiers, just about the nick of time that the Treachery was to be effected.</p>
                              <p>And he being committed upon this occasion, the Rebels apprehending their design to be discovered, with-drew their Forces. And lest this should be judged as an act of the Major onely, as a private person, we desire the World to take notice, that as soon as our Army, which forced their obedience, was removed into <hi>England,</hi> the Papists generally resisted what ever could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for our security, and would have dis-enabled us to continue our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, had not the poor stript <hi>English</hi> taken all that burthen upon themselves.</p>
                              <p>Nay, they were so insolent, that they laboured to get Arms into their hands, and to cause us to disband our Soldiers, which they affirmed to be kept as an unnecessary charge upon the King, that so they might with more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility receive the <hi>Irish,</hi> and ruine us.</p>
                              <p>In a word, since they pretend the ground of this War to be for Religion, and that this is confessed by those who seem'd to adhere to us; what faith can be expected from such a People, whose Religion permits them to hold none with us?</p>
                              <p>By this preceding Relation, it is evidently seen, that unless we re-assume our Arms, we betray the trust committed to us by God, the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and become slaves both of bodies and souls. And therefore we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to perform our duty, though with apparent hazard of our lives; and likewise maintain that, which is a thousand times more dear unto us, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and also defend our Garrisons for the Kings just use.</p>
                              <p>These, we take God to witness, are our intentions, and we beseech him to punish us as strangely, as hitherto he hath preserv'd us, if we decline at all from these Loyal and Religious resolutions; and we firmly hope, that the World will, by this Declaration, be as fully satisfi'd of the justness of our proceedings, as we our selves are; then though we all lose our lives in this Cause, we shall give our Friends occasion to rejoyce, and our Enemies to envy at so blessed an end.</p>

This return of the <hi>Munster</hi> Forces to the Parliament, was not so wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to them, as it was strange to the Lord Lieutenant, who thereupon expostulated the business with the Lord <hi>Inchequin,</hi> who the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>August</hi> writ to his Excellency, That on suspitions of another intended surprisal by the <hi>Irish,</hi> and out of a care to protect the <hi>English,</hi> he had clear'd <hi>Cork, Toughall,</hi> and <hi>Kinsale,</hi> of the <hi>Irish,</hi> and put himself into a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of safety, which, with his return from <hi>England,</hi> was the worse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, <hi>for that he was the first man who mov'd the King to send for the</hi>

In the interim, <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cannon</hi> (one of the strongest Forts in <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the Command of the Lord <hi>Esmond</hi>) submitted not to the Cessation; but, being strongly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged by <hi>Preston,</hi> was surrendred about <hi>March,</hi> 1644. before Sir <hi>Arthur Loftus</hi> (who was to have been Governour of the Fort under his Lordship) arrived there with a competent Supply, who (finding himself disappointed thereof) carried his Provisions into <hi>Munster,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Esmond</hi> soon after died.

               <p>And that Affairs (more probably) might succeed, a general Assembly of the Confederate Catholicks, (which consisted of all the Peers of that Party, and of all the Gentlemen and Burgesses of Corporation Towns, which was as lively a Representation of the whole Nation, as they could make) towards the end of the year, <hi>viz.</hi> the 6th. of <hi>March,</hi> 1645. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and authorized a select number of that Body, (of the Persons of eminent Quality, and most eminent Ability, and such, as through all the Troubles had been imployed and intrusted by them, in Places and Offices of highest Trust and Concernment) to treat and conclude with the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> his Majesty's Lieutenant of that Kingdom, a firm and full Peace. For the expediting of which, his Excellency had had many and serious Invitations from his Majesty, as the most visible means then left to revive the Hopes he was reduced to: To which end, in <hi>June,</hi> before he had sent Mr. <hi>Daniel O Neal</hi> (Groom of his Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) into <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Person by reason of his Relations there much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in; who, amongst other things intrusted to his charge, had it in his Instructions, the 27th. of <hi>June,</hi> to acquaint the Marquess of <hi>Ormond, That his Majesty would be glad he could frame such a Body there to send over, as might be worthy of his own coming to command it.</hi> And in a Letter from an Honourable Person then at <hi>Denbigh,</hi> the 26th. of <hi>September,</hi> 1645. his Excellency was again acquainted, <hi>That his Majesty persists in his earnest desire to have him in</hi> England, <hi>for that, without flattery, they were likely to be in more want of such a General, than of an Army;</hi> so as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting to value his Fidelity and Courage.

The Nuncio having thus fortifi'd himself, made great preparations to march with two Armies to <hi>Dublin,</hi> which (consisting of 16000 Foot, and as many hundred Horse) he believ'd, or seem'd to believe, would take the Town by Assault as soon as he should appear before it; and in this confidence (that we may not interrupt the series of this Discourse by any intervening action) when the Armies were within a days march of the City, the two Generals sent this Letter, with the Propositions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, to the Lord Lieutenant.

               <p>Let all dis-passionate men now consider what could the Marquis do,<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in great straits at the approach of the <hi>Nuncio</hi> to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </note> his Quarters were so strait and narrow, that they could yield no support to the few Forces he had left; all his Garrisons besieg'd; without, an Enemy; being destitute of all Provisions within: all the Army he had for the Field and Garrisons amounted not to 5000 Foot and 1100 Horse; without Cloathes, Money, or Fixed Arms; and with so inconsiderable a Store of Ammunition, that when the <hi>Nuncio</hi> was upon his march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Dublin,</hi> he had not in that most important City (the Metropolis of the Kingdom) more than 14 Barrels of Powder: So that not onely the Inhabitants, but the Soldiers themselves, grew impatient of the distresses they were in, and which inevitably they saw must fall upon them; and they who had before presum'd in corners and whispers, <hi>to tax the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of not being zealous enough of the</hi> English <hi>Interest, and too credulous of what was promised and undertaken by the</hi> Irish, had now the boldness to murmur aloud at him, as if he had combined with the <hi>Irish</hi> to put all into their hands: They who from the beginning of the Troubles had been firm and unshaken in their Duty and Loyalty to the King, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully suffered great losses, and undergone great hazards for being so, and been of the most constant affection to, and confidence in, the Marquis, and resolved to obey him in whatsoever he should order for the King's Service, for the conducting whereof, he was solely and entirely trusted by his Majesty, could not yet endure to think of being put into, or falling under the power of the <hi>Irish,</hi> who, by this new breach of Faith, had made themselves utterly uncapable of any future Trust; for what secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity could they publickly give for performance of the Contract, which<note place="margin">Upon the <hi>Irish</hi> breach of faith, the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant made a shew of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering all into the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hands.</note> they had not lately given for the observation of that, which so infamously they had receded from? Whereupon he found it absolutely necessary to make a shew of inclining to the <hi>English;</hi> and sent to the Ships then riding in the Bay of <hi>Dublin,</hi> that they would transport some Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners from him to the Parliament, to treat about the surrender of the City, and the other Garrisons under his Command. Which Proposition was embrac'd by them, and the Persons deputed <note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Gerr. Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Lord Chief Baron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir <hi>Francis Willoughby,</hi> Sir <hi>Paul Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> Knights.</note> accordingly conveyed into <hi>England:</hi> By this means the Marquis was forthwith supplied with 20 Barrels of Powder, which the Captain of those Ships delivered to him the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> by the permission of the Lord <hi>Lisle,</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Lord Lieutenant, without which, he could have made no defence against the <hi>Nuncio:</hi> whereby the <hi>Irish</hi> had a fair warning to bethink themselves (in time) of returning to their Duty, since they might discern, that if they would not suffer <hi>Dublin, &amp;c.</hi> to continue in the Kings obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, it should be delivered to them who would deal less graciously with them, and had power enough to punish those indignities which had been offered. And the Marquis was still without other Engagement, than to do what he should judge most conducing to his Majesties Service.

However, the Rebels persisted in their intentions against <hi>Dublin,</hi> where for a while we must leave them, and see what course the Parliament took to infest their Quarters: much they were concern'd, that affairs went not on so successfully there as they expected, where that they might have one Governour (answerable to the exigencies of that Kingdom) they<note place="margin">The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> Voted <hi>Philip</hi> Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

And shortly after such animosities arose betwixt the Parliaments Commissioners and the Lord <hi>Inchequin,</hi> as doubtless (if some Privy Counsellors had not interpos'd) great inconveniencies would certainly thence have risen. The Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> (accompani'd with the Lord <hi>Broghil</hi> and Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi>) went present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for <hi>England,</hi> and arriv'd at <hi>London</hi> about the beginning of <hi>May</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, taking the first occasion to give the House an account <note n="*" place="margin">

The Lord <hi>Broghil</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Loftus,</hi> at the same time preferr'd Articles against the Lord <hi>Inchequin:</hi> But the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was so imbroil'd about the Disbanding the Independent Army, (then mutinous) and <hi>Inchequin</hi> had so many (to favour themselves) coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd him, as little, if any thing, became of the Impeachment.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Confederates, who (when they saw the Ships re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd<note place="margin">The Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates (upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits out of <hi>England</hi>) piece again with the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> from <hi>England</hi> with Supplies of Soldiers, Money, and great store of Provisions, and the Commissioners to treat with the Marquis for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all into the Parliaments hands) rais'd the Siege, seeming less united amongst themselves, and desirous to make Conditions with the Lord Lieutenant; whilst General <hi>Preston</hi> and his Officers frankly entred into a Treaty with the Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> whom the Lord Lieutenant au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd to that end, and with deep and solemn Oaths undertook and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93738:106"/>
to stand to the Peace, and from thenceforth to be obedient to his Majesties Authority, and to joyn with the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> against all those who should refuse to submit unto them. On the other side, the Commissioners from the two Houses of Parliament <note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Thomas Wharton,</hi> Sir <hi>Rob.

And how the Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> then in being, might be continued, which, by the delivering of the Sword, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Majesties pleasure imparted, could not be secured from being dissolved; and without which, he then resolved not to proceed to any conjunction with them, and so had privately dispatched several Expresses to the King (as soon as he discerned clearly, that the <hi>Irish</hi> were so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd by the <hi>Nuncio</hi> and his Excommunication, that there was little hope of good from them) with full information of the state of Affairs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected every day a return of some of the said Messengers, with significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Majesties Pleasure.</p>
               <p>Thus the Treaty with the Marquis not succeeding, the Commissioners from the Two Houses of Parliament return'd again to their Ships, about the end of <hi>November,</hi> and carried all the Supplies they had brought to the Parliaments Garrisons in the Province of <hi>Ulster,</hi> being much incens'd against the Lord Lieutenant for declining an entire union with them, and inclining (as they said he did) to a new confidence in the <hi>Irish:</hi> Yet they found but cold entertainment amongst the <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At which time, Dr. <hi>John Maxwel,</hi> formerly Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> now Archbishop of <hi>Tuam</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> hearing of Commissioners from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> grew so envenom'd thereat, (suspecting the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which he had ever abhorr'd, should be imposed) as sicercely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precating it; and being broken with the calamities of the Times, he di'd the <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1646. and was buried in <hi>Trinity Church, Dublin,</hi> at the munificence of the Marquis of <hi>Ormond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this time the Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> had an entire trust (answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to what he had begun to treat of with General <hi>Preston</hi>) from the Lord Lieutenant, as a Person superiour to all temptations, which might endeavour to lessen or divert his Affection and Integrity to the King, or<note place="margin">The Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard</hi>'s fidelity.</note> his Zeal to the <hi>Romish Catholick</hi> Religion, in which he had been bred, and to which he had most constantly adher'd; he had taken great pains to render the Peace, which had been so long in consultation, effectual to the Nation, and had both by Discourse and Writing endeavour'd to disswade the <hi>Nuncio</hi> from prosecuting those rough ways, which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw were like to undo the Nation, and dishonour the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: He found General <hi>Preston</hi> and the Officers of his Army less tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported with passion, and a blind submission to the Authority of the <hi>Nuncio</hi> than the other, and that they professed greater duty and obedience to the King, and that they seem'd to be wrought on by two Conclusions, which had been speciously infus'd into them: The <hi>first</hi> was, that the Lord
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93738:107"/>
Lieutenant was so great an Enemy to their Religion, that though they should obtain any Conditions from the King to their advantage in that particular, he would oppose, and not consent unto the same. The <hi>other,</hi> that the King was now in the hand of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were not like to approve that Peace had been made, all that Nation in <hi>Ulster</hi> refusing to submit to it. And if they should be able to procure any Order from his Majesty to disavow it, the Lord Lieutenant would undoubtedly obey it.

conven'd at</hi> Kilkenny, <hi>where he doubted not but that Things would be set right by the Consent of the whole Kingdom, which he said would be much better for his Majesty's Service, than to attempt forcing the Peace upon those who were averse to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this new violation of Faith, the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd (after some weeks stay in his Quarters) to return again to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the Commissioners, who had been lately there from the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant returns to <hi>Dublin,</hi> which being not able to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they were forced to be quarter'd on the Countrey, where nothing but Victuals were taken by them.</note> of Parliament, had sowed such seeds of Jealousie and Discontent, as the Inhabitants refused to contribute further to the payment and support of the Army, (being in truth so far exhausted by what they had paid, and impoverished by their total want and decay of Traffick and Commerce, as they were not able much longer to contribute) so that the Marquess was forced in the cold and wet Winter, to draw out his half starved and half naked Troops, only to lye in the Enemy's Quarters, where yet he would suffer no Act of Hostility to be committed, or any thing else to be taken, but Victuals for the subsistence of his Men. And in this un-easie posture, he resolv'd to expect the result of the next General Assembly, which he suppos'd could not be so constituted, but that it would abhor the violation of the former Contracts and Agreements, and the in-excusable Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Proceedings of the Congregation of the Clergy at <hi>Waterford;</hi> and that it would vindicate the Honour and Faith of the Nation, from the Reproaches it lay under, and from the exorbitant and extravagant Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which the Nuncio had assumed. But he quickly found himself again disappointed; and, to the universal wonder of all, the new Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly publish'd a Declaration of a very new Nature: For whereas the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio and his Party had committed to Prison those Noblemen and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had been Commissioners in treating and concluding the Peace, and had given out threats and menaces, that they should lose their Heads for their Transgression; the Assembly presently set them at liberty, and<note place="margin">The Assembly at <hi>Kilkenny</hi> justifie the Commissioners, yet agreed with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation at <hi>Waterford.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>declared, That the Commissioners and Council had faithfully and sincerely carried and demean'd themselves in the said Negotiation, pursuant, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Trust reposed in them:</hi> And yet, in the same Declaration, <hi>declared, That they might not accept of, or submit unto the said Peace, and did thereby protest against it, and did declare the same invalid, and of no force to all intents and purposes.</hi> And did farther <hi>declare, That the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would not accept of any Peace, not containing a sufficient satisfactory Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the Religion, Lives, Estates and Liberties of the said Confederate Catholicks.</hi> And what they understood to be sufficient and satisfactory for Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> appears by the Propositions published before by the Congregation at <hi>Waterford,</hi> which they had caused the People to swear that they would insist upon; and which, instead of providing a Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Romish Catholick</hi> Religion, had, <hi>in truth, prov'd for the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Protestant, when they should think fit to put the same in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Nor was the only Argument and Excuse, which they published for these Proceedings, more reasonable, than the Proceedings themselves, which was, <hi>That the Concessions and Promises made unto them, by the Earl of</hi> Glamorgan, <hi>were much larger, and greater security for their Religion, than those consented to by the Marquess:</hi> Whereas, in truth, those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions and Promises made by the Earl, (as we have took notice) were dis-avowed and dis-own'd by the Lord Lieutenant, before the Peace was concluded, and the Earl committed to Prison for his Presumption; which though it produced some interruption in the Treaty, yet was the same
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93738:108"/>
after resumed, and the Peace concluded, and proclaimed upon the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles formerly mention'd; so that the Allegation, of what had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> can be no excuse, for their violating the Agreement afterwards concluded with the Marquess. Whereby it appears, (let the most favourable <hi>Fucus</hi> imaginable be put upon it) that though they released the Commissioners for the Treaty, as justifiable, yet <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> were then made Friends, each Party consenting to dam the Peace.</p>
               <p>This last wonderful Act put a period to all Hopes of the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> which Charity and Compassion to the Kingdom and Nation, and his discerning Spirit, would fain have cherisht, in that in-evitable ruine and destruction <hi>both</hi> must undergo, from that distemper of mind that possessed them, and had so long boy'd them up, against his experience and judgement. And now those whose Natures, Dispositions, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, made them most averse to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> grew more<note place="margin">The <hi>Irish</hi> being in all things sound treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, those who were most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to the Parliament, yet now wished the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant might conclude with them.</note> affrighted at the thoughts of falling under the Power of the <hi>Irish;</hi> so that all Persons of all humours and inclinations, who lived under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and had dislikes and jealousies enough against each other, were yet united and reconciled in their opinions against the <hi>Irish.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State besought the Lord Lieutenant to consider, whether it were possible to have any better security from them, for the performance of any other Agreement he should make, than he had for the performance of that, which they now receded from, and disclaimed. And since the Spring was now coming on, (whereby the number, power, and strength of their Enemy would be increas'd on all sides, and their hopes of Succours was desperate, and so it would be only in his election into whose power he would put those, who had deserved as well from his Majesty by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and suffering as Subjects could do) whether into the hands of the <hi>English, who</hi> could not deny them protection and justice, or of the <hi>Irish, who</hi> had not only dispoil'd them of all their Fortunes, and prosecuted them with all animosity and cruelty, but declared by their late carriage, that they were not capable of security under them) <hi>they</hi> therefore entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to send again to the two Houses of Parliament, and make some agreement with <hi>them,</hi> which would probably be for their preservation; whereas, with the other, what-ever could be done, it was evident it would be for their destruction. That which amongst other things of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance made a deep impression in the Marquess, was the knowledge, that there had been from the beginning of these Troubles, <hi>a Design, in the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that the <hi>Irish</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

               <p>Upon these, and other considerations, ever in his view, the Marquess thought it much more prudent and agreeable to the Trust reposed in him, to deposite the Kings Interest, and Right of the Crown of <hi>Ireland,</hi> into the hands of the Lords and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> who still made great profession of Duty and Submission to his Majesty, from whom it would

We hold it un-necessary to particularize our present Wants, and Miseries, and Imposibilities of further subsistance of

our selves, since they are too well known, even to our Enemies, in so much as it may be feared, that the benefit which we confidently expect, by the great diligence and Wisdom of the most Honourable, the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> may not arrive timely, for our Relief and Preservation; nor can we so misdoubt the Wisdom, Justice, and Piety, of those Honourable Houses (whereof we have had heretofore, very real and great experience, which we do here with all thankfulness acknowledge) as to fear that they will suffer the Protestant Religion, the Interest of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and of the Protestants in these important Garrisons, and Quarters, to be sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed unto the fury of the merciless Rebels; But on the contrary, as we do earnestly desire, so are we most confident, that the Goodness and Wisdom of the most Honourable, the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> will so seasonably send over a sufficient Power, as well to subdue and suppress these merciless and bloody Rebels, as to maintain these places, accompanied with an assurance from the most Honourable, the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> for enjoying those Conditions of Honour, subsistance and safety, which have been lately offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Commissioners, for, and in the name of the most Honourable, the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to those who have hitherto govern'd and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servd them, and to his Majesties Protestant Subjects, and those who have faithfully and constantly adhered unto them, unto which they may be pleased to joyn such further additions of Grace and Bounty, as to their Wisdoms and Goodness, shall be thought fit, as that they, and all the Protestants, and such others, as have faithfully and constantly adhered unto them, may find Security and Preservation therein, whereby we may heartily joyn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those, whom the said most Honourable, the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> shall appoint, in prosecuting so Pious a War, and being Gods Instruments, for the bringing just Vengeance upon such Perfidious Rebels, and in resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Protestant Religion, and Interest of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> in this Kingdom, to its due and former Lustre, which we will ever strive (with the hazard of our Lives and Fortunes) to maintain.</p>

               <p>While the Marquess was in this deliberation (being privy to the Parliaments actions) he receiv'd information, that the King was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the <hi>Scots,</hi> to the Commissioners of the two Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who were then treating with him, for the settling of Peace in all his Dominions; and at the same time, several Persons of Quality, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Dublin,</hi> having been privately dispatch'd by his Majesty, with signification of his Majesties Pleasure, upon the advertisement he had receiv'd of the Condition of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to this purpose; <hi>That if it were</hi>

                  <hi>possible for the</hi> Marquess <hi>to keep</hi> Dublin, <hi>and the other Garrisons, under the same intire Obedience to his Majesty, they were then in, it would be acceptable to his Majesty; But if there were, or should be, a necessity of giving them up to any other Power, he would rather put them into the hands of the</hi> English, <hi>then of the</hi> Irish; which was the Rule, the Marquess was to guide himself by, who had likewise his other very important conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which, if all the rest had been away, had been enough to have inclin'd him to that resolution. The King was now in the Power, and hands of those, who rais'd a War against him, principally, upon the credit of those reproaches and scandals, that had perswaded the People to a belief of his inclinations to Popery; and of his contriving, or, at least, countenancing the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which so
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93738:112"/>
much Protestant Blood, had been so wantonly and cruelly let out: The Cessation formerly made, and continued with those Rebels, though prudently, charitably, and necessarily entred into, had been the most un-popular Act the King had ever done, and had wonderfully contributed to the Reputation of the two Houses of Parliament, if, according to the general opinion then currant, there should a Peace ensue, between the King and them; so that his Majesty would lose nothing by the Parliament being possessed of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and those other Towns, then in the disposal of the Lord Lieutenant: On the contrary, if they intended to pursue his Majesty, with continued and new reproaches, and thereby to make him so odious to his Subjects, that they might with more facility and applause, execute their horrible Conspiracy against his Life, there could<note place="margin">The Lord Lieutenant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers <hi>Dublin</hi> to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, though upon his inclination, the <hi>Irish</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to delude him.</note> be nothing so disadvantagious to his Majesty, as the surrender of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> to the <hi>Irish</hi> Confederates; which being done by the Kings Lord Lieutenant, would easily be interpreted, to be by his Majesties direction, and so make a confirmation of all they had published of that kind; and, amongst the ignorant seduced People, might have been a countenance to, though nothing could be a justification of their unparalell'd Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Marquess took a Resolution, since he could not possibly keep it himself, to deliver it into the hands of the <hi>English;</hi> and to that purpose sent again to the two Houses of Parliament at <hi>Westminster,</hi> that he would surrender <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the other Garrisons to them, upon the same condition they had before offered; who quickly dispatcht their Ships with Commissioners, <note n="*" place="margin">

The Confederate Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks were no sooner inform'd of this, but they sent again to the Lord Lieutenant an overture of Accommodation (as they call it) yet the Messengers intrusted by them, were so wary, lest indeed by accepting what they proposed, they might be obliged to a Conjunction, that they refused to give their Propositions in Writing; And when, upon their Discourse, the Lord Lieutenant had writ what they had propounded, and shewed it to them, albeit they could not deny but that it was the same, yet they refused to Sign it: whereby it was very natural to conclude, that the Overture was made by them, onely to lay some imputation upon the Marquess, of not being necessitated to agree with the two Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, rather then with any purpose of submitting to the Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. At last (being so far pressed, they found it necessary to let the Marquess know in plain terms what he was to trust to) they sent him a Message in Writing, in which they declared, <hi>That they must insist upon the Propositions of the Clergy, formerly mention'd to be agreed at</hi> Waterford, <hi>and to which they had sworn; and that if he would have a Cessation with them, he must promise not to receive any Forces from the two Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in</hi> 6 <hi>or</hi> 7 <hi>months:</hi> Not proposing in the mean time any way how his Majesties Army should be maintain'd, but by a full submission unto all their unreasonable Demands: Notwithstanding all which, the Parliament failing to make that speedy performance of what they had promised, and their Commissioners not having (as it was agreed on) brought Bills sufficiently drawn to be accepted of, for 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and the Marquess having it thereby in his Power, fairly to comply with the <hi>Irish,</hi> if they had yet recovered the temper and discretion that might justifie him; He sent again to them, as well an Answer to their Overtures of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93738:112"/>
as an offer not to receive any Forces from the two Houses, for the space of three weeks, if they would, during that time, consent to a Ceassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a full Peace might be treated, and agreed upon. To which Motion, they never vouchsafed to return any Answer; about the same time <hi>Owen O Neil</hi> (wisely foreseeing, that the Nuncio, or the Supream Council, did not enough consider, or foresee the evil consequences, that would undoubtedly attend the Lord Lieutenant's being compelled to leave the Kingdom, and to put <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the other Garrisons into the possession of the <hi>English</hi> Rebels) sent his Nephew <hi>Daniel O Neil,</hi> to the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> that if the Marquess would accept of a Cessation for two months, which he believ'd, the Assembly, or Supream Council, would propose (with what mind soever) he would promise, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, to continue it for a Twelvemonth; and in the mean time, he would use his utmost power, to procure a Peace. <hi>Owen O Neil</hi> was a man of an haughty, and positive humour, and rather hard to be inclined to submit to reasonable Conditions, then easie to decline them, or break his word, when he had consented; therefore the Lord Lieutenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd this Answer; that if he would give him his word, to continue the Cessation for a full year, he would accept it, when proposed from the Supream Council, for two months; and he would in the mean time, wave any further Treaty with the Parliament; yet sent him word, he would not hold himself by this promise, longer then fourteen days engaged, if he did not in that time receive such a positive effect of his Overture, as he expected. <hi>Owen O Neil</hi> accepted of the Condition, and with all possible speed, dispatched his Nephew <hi>Daniel,</hi> to the Supream Council at <hi>Clonmel,</hi> with a Letter containing his Advice, and another to the Bishop of <hi>Clogher,</hi> his chief Confident; to whom he sent Reasons at large, which ought to induce the Nation to desire such a Cessation. When the Council receiv'd the Letter, and knew that the Lord Lieutenant expected an Answer within 14 days, they resolved to return no Answer, till those days were expired, and during that time, committed <hi>Daniel O Neil</hi> to Prison, that he might not return to his Unkle; and when the time was passed, they releas'd him, on condition that he should come no more into their Quarters.</p>
               <p>In the interim, the Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> then sitting at <hi>Dublin,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into what straights the Kingdom was brought, and how his Excellency had strugled with the greatest difficulties imaginable, for his Majesties and their Interest; they, the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> sent this Remonstrance, in acknowledgment of great Care and Indulgence.

               <p>But to return. In conclusion, the Commissioners from the two Houses of Parliament having performed all that on their part was expected, the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> delivered up <hi>Dublin</hi> and the other Garrisons into their hands the <hi>17th.</hi> some write the <hi>18th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1647. on condition<note place="margin">1647<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

However, he delivered not up the <hi>Regalia</hi> till the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> at which time he was transported (with his Family) into <hi>England;</hi> where they admitted him to wait on the King, and to give his Majesty an account of his Transactions: who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him most graciously, as a Servant who had merited highly from him, and fully approved all that he had done. The straits his Excellency
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93738:114"/>
was then put to, were great, and (in consideration into whose hands the Government might fall) his surrender of <hi>Dublin</hi> to the Parliament seem'd extreme hazardous: yet Providence so steer'd his Resolution in that act, as doubtless the ground of his Majesties Sovereignty, and the <hi>English</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation (how many Channels soever it past through first) proceeded thence. Before <hi>He</hi> came away, the Soldiers had receiv'd such a tincture of Mutiny, as Mr. <hi>Annesly</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert King,</hi> for fear of violence, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately quitted the Kingdom, before which, they (with Sir <hi>Robert Mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith,</hi> Colonel <hi>Michael Jones,</hi> and Colonel <hi>John Moore</hi>) took notice of the insolency of the Soldiers, to exact Contribution and free Quarters at their pleasure, forbidding them so to do, &amp;c. by a Proclamation at <hi>Dublin</hi> the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1647.</p>

               <p>The time that the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> agreed with the Parliaments Commissioners, was near the time that the Army had gotten the King into their hands, having taken him from <hi>Holmbey,</hi> out of the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Commissioners, to whom the <hi>Scots</hi> had delivered him: And the Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> at his arrival in <hi>England,</hi> found so many specious pretences and professions publish'd by that Party, which then had the whole Power of the Army, and consequently of the Kingdom, that very many believ'd his Majesties Affairs to be in no ill condition; more seeming respect was paid to his Person, and less restraint upon the resort of his faithful Servants to him, than had been from the time that he first put himself into the <hi>Scots</hi> power. The Army took upon them the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Kingdom, having solemnly declared, <hi>That there could be no reasonable hope of a firm and lasting Peace, if there were not an equal care to preserve the Interest of the King, Queen, and Prince, as of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the People, and that both should be with equal care provided for together.</hi> In this time of freedom, and hypocritical compliance, the Marquis had free liberty of repairing to the King, where he gave him an account of all his actions, and of the course he had taken for the reviving and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving<note place="margin">The Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free access to the King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints him of the Impression he had made in many for his Service.</note> his Majesties Interest in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by setling a Correspondence with many Persons of Honour there, who would keep the two Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (how great an advantage soever he had given them, by the delivery up of <hi>Dublin,</hi> &amp;c. into their power) if they refus'd to return to his Majesties obedience, from obtaining any absolute Dominion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that Countrey; and who were most like to reduce the Nation from the Distemper with which they were transported, and to incline them to that submission that was due from them to the King; with all which, his Majesty was very graciously and abundantly satisfied, and gave the Marquis directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in case the Independent Army should proceed otherwise than they pretended, how he should behave himself, and comply with the <hi>Irish,</hi> if he could reduce and dispose them to be instrumental towards his or their own delivery. And when his Majesty discovered (by the double dealing,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93738:114"/>
and hypocritical demeanour of the Officers of the Army, of whom he had earlier jealousie than other men, as seeing farther into their dark Design the little good they meant him, he found it fit to receive some Overtures from the <hi>Scottish</hi> Commissioners, who were still admitted to reside at <hi>London,</hi> and to bear a part in the Managery of the Publick Affairs; and now plainly saw, that the Independent Army, which they had so much despised, was grown superiour to them, and meant to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form nothing less, than what they had so Religiously promised before the King was delivered up at <hi>Newcastle.</hi> The King hereupon commands the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> to confer with the principal Persons of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, who seem'd very sensible of the dishonour their Nation had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd, and resolved, by uniting the power of that Kingdom for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Service, to undo some of the mischief they had wrought: And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, that the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> would likewise transport himself into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to try once more if he could compose the humours of that<note place="margin">Some of the <hi>Scots</hi> being convinc'd of what they had done amiss in his Majesties Service, better resolve, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Marquis of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> to return into <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </note> People to his Majesties obedience; that so those two Kingdoms, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely reduc'd to their duty, might, with that assistance they were like to find in <hi>England,</hi> perswade the violent Party to comply with those mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and just Conclusions, which would establish the Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of the whole in a full happiness to Prince and People. And from hence was that first Engagement design'd, which was afterwards so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately conducted by the elder Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and concluded with the ruine of himself, and of many Worthy and Noble Persons.</p>
               <p>When the Army had by their civil and specious carriage and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions disposed the Kings Party to wish well to them, at least better than<note place="margin">The subtilty of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Army.</note> to the Presbyterians, (who seem'd to have erected a Model of a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid and insupportable Tyranny, and were less endu'd with the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Humanity and good Nature) and had (by shuffling themselves into new shapes of Government, and admitting Persons of all Conditions to assemble, and make Propositions to them in order to the publick Peace) given encouragement to most men to believe, that <hi>all Interests</hi> would, in some degree, <hi>be provided for;</hi> and so had brought themselves into an absolute Power over all Interests, they began to lessen their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Respects and Reverence to the King, to inhibit some of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants absolutely to resort to him; and more to restain the frequent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of the People, who out of their innate Duty and Affection, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to see his Majesty, they caused reports to be raised and scattered abroad of some intentions, in desperate persons, of violence upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Person; and upon this pretence doubled their Guards, and put Officers of stricter vigilance and more surly disposition about him; so that whatsoever he said or did, or was said unto him, was more punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally observed. The Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> was look'd upon with a very<note place="margin">The Marquis now suspected by the Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> jealous eye, and was forbid to continue his attendance on him, or to come within 25 miles of <hi>London;</hi> and that Article in the Agreement at the delivery of <hi>Dublin,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> That he should engage his Honour not to act any thing to the prejudice of the Parliament in a twelvemonth) there was an intention to put him in mind of, by a Letter from the Committee at <hi>Derby-house;</hi> but before the Messenger came where he had been near <hi>Bristol,</hi> he (knowing of the King's being close Prisoner in <hi>Carisbrook-Castle,</hi> and that it would be to little purpose to contest his Articles with the Parliament) privately shipt himself away for <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:93738:115"/>
where he arrived safely about the end of the year 1647. having spent in <hi>England</hi> little more than six months.</p>
               <p>For a time we must leave the Marquis in <hi>France,</hi> and return to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Jones</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> who (with those Forces that were left there by the Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and such as he brought and received out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> amounting in all to 3000) marched against Colonel <hi>Preston,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching with his <hi>Leimster</hi> Forces to infest <hi>Dublin,</hi> and met him about<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>Preston</hi> routs Colonel <hi>Jones.</hi>
                  </note> 12 miles from <hi>Dublin;</hi> who having gotten great advantage of ground, routed <hi>Jones,</hi> killed many of his men, and took not a few Prisoners, <hi>Jones</hi> himself escaping with much difficulty to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether upon this accident, or otherwise, I cannot determine; but great divisions then arose betwixt the old <hi>English,</hi> who had <hi>Preston</hi> for their General, and the old <hi>Irish,</hi> who had <hi>Owen Roe O Neal</hi> for theirs: The old <hi>English</hi> had a gallant Army, consisting of near 10000 Foot and Horse, well Arm'd, and well Disciplin'd, who thought, that if they would offer themselves Instruments to destroy the old <hi>Irish,</hi> they might at any time have good Conditions from <hi>England;</hi> therefore under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence thereof, they went on with great resolution, determining to do what they could to make themselves Masters of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and of all the <hi>English</hi> Quarters thereabouts, the easier afterwards to facilitate their design against <hi>Owen Roe</hi> and his Confidents. <hi>Preston</hi> thus flesh'd with his late Victory, brought up his Army, possess'd himself of most of the Out-Garrisons, even within eight miles of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and thence went with<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Preston</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance on a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </note> a resolution to take in <hi>Trim,</hi> a Garrison of some strength, under Colonel <hi>Fenwick,</hi> wherein there lay a Regiment of Foot, and some Troops of Horse. Upon which, <hi>Jones</hi> seeing himself in this condition, march'd about the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> with 1000 Foot and 400 Horse, to <hi>Sigginstown,</hi> burning by the way, Castle <hi>Martin,</hi> taking good Prey from Castle <hi>Bawn,</hi> and was over-took by the Enemy near <hi>Johns-town,</hi> who falling on his Rear, cut off many; where Captain <hi>Adam Meredith</hi> gallantly maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pass, was kill'd: a Gentleman of clear valour, and greater hope.</p>
               <p>In the interim, the distractions of the Soldiers (daily mutinous) were very great, the Soldiers threatning to deliver up the Town to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, if they were not speedily and better suppli'd with money and other necessaries. However, in this high distemper, Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> drew out, the first of <hi>August,</hi> 3800 Foot, and two Regiments of Horse, besides Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, to the relief of <hi>Trim,</hi> besieged by <hi>Preston;</hi> who upon his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach quitted the Siege, intending to follow the advice of a Person <note n="*" place="margin">The Lord <hi>Digby.</hi>

32 Captains, 23 Lieutenants, 27 Ensigns, 2 Cornets, 22 Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, 2 Quarter-Masters, 2 Gunners, the Clerk of the Store, 13 Troop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and 228 common Souldiers: <hi>Preston</hi> hardly escaped with the Horse; he lost his Carriages and Cannon, being 4 demi-Culverings, each carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 12 pound Bullet, and 64 fair Oxen, attending the Train, which were of very great use. Of ours some were wounded, but not above 20 slain: Of Note, we lost only 2 Cornets, and one Captain <hi>Gibbs,</hi> who, over-heated in the Service, died in drinking Ditch-Water. After this Victory the Enemy quit and burnt the <hi>Naas Sigginstown, Harristown, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanstown, Castlewarding,</hi> and <hi>Moyglare.</hi> Nor had the effect of this Victory ended thus, but that Pay and Provision for the Army were so scant, as necessity inforced them to return to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where they were met with the News of 1500 <hi>l.</hi> newly arrived, a Supply incompetent to furnish them forth immediately, though it satisfied them there was some care taken for their Relief. And upon the certainty of this great Victory in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> considerable Supplies were hastned, and 1000 <hi>l.</hi> sent Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> for his good Service. A little after which the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> took in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hir</hi> Castle, the Town and Castle of <hi>Cashel,</hi> and 11 other Castles, in the County of <hi>Tipperary,</hi> which was exceeding well taken by the Parliament, no small Causes of Defection, having (a little before) been insinuated to them, of his Fidelity.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of <hi>October</hi> Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> took the Field again, and<note place="margin">

                              <p>IT is not without an un-answerable proportion of Reluctancy, to so heavy an Inconvenience, that we are thus frequently put upon the asserting of our own Fidelities, to the Services of the Honourable Houses; whereunto, as we have by several Evidences (the mention whereof we make without vain-glory) manifested our selves sincerely faithful, so hath it pleased the divine Providence, to prosper our Endeavours with very many improbable Successes; to the attainment whereof, though we have strugled through all the difficulties, and contended with all the sufferances, that a People, un-sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with all necessaries and secondary means, could undergo, yet have we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred nothing of that dis-affection, or dis-couragement, as we find admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred unto us, by a constant observation, that it is as well in the power, as it is in the practice, of our malicious and indefatigable Enemies, to place and foment Differences upon us, not only to our extream scandal and disgrace, (which we should the less resent, if their malice could terminate in us) but to the obstructing of the Supplies order'd and design'd for publick Service, and to the irreparable prejudice thereof, which our Enemies can value at so low a rate, as to put it into that bargain, they are in hand to make for our destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It being very approvable by us, that several Persons in power there, do interpose their endeavours, to continue us (by the impeding of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies) in a desperate, languishing, and perishable condition upon the Place, and in a despicable and doubtful esteem with the Honourable Houses. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there will need no other Instances, than that, after the several promises made by Letters, from the Honourable Committee at <hi>Darby-house,</hi> and Votes pass'd for transmitting Supplies unto us, especially in case of Major General <hi>Starling,</hi> his being sent to attend the Pleasure of the Houses, the only Remora then alledged to make stay of 7000 Suits of Cloaths, and 10000 l. in Money, being before design'd for our relief, there is no more than 2700 l. sent unto us in Money, and thereof but 1500 l. designed for the feeding of us, and the Souldiers under our Command. And that notwithstanding the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Testimony given of our real intentions and affections, to that Cause and Service, in a late Engagement against the Rebels at <hi>Knockness,</hi> which we touch at, without any affection of vain-glory, the Votes then renew'd for our Relief, and the Order for our Indempnity, (which was conceived would not have found so much hesitation, with those whose Service we had only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest) are laid aside, and nothing effectual or advantagious done in order thereto, for our avane, save the transmittal of 2700 l. but on the contrary, new jealousies and distrust of us are re-embrac'd and fomented.</p>
                              <p>It is not therefore so insupportable a dis-comfort to us, to observe our own Lives exposed a sacrifice, to the malice of our now potent publick Enemies, who by the conjunction of three several Armies, are not more encouraged to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93738:116"/>
confront us in the Field, than we, by the art and practice used to with-hold those just and necessary Supplies from us, dis-abled to joyn Battle with them, as to observe our honourable Reputation and Integrity, (dearer to us than our Lives) brought into such frequent question, and unworthily mangled, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and slaughtered, by the calumnious aspersions of our powerful and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Adversaries, in despight of all our zealous and cordial Endeavours, to give indubitable testimony and evidence of our Fidelities. What if we be beyond any common measure afflicted and dismayed? We are confident, that all Persons of Honour will acknowledge, that we have much more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cause.</p>
                              <p>And now that our Adversaries have prevailed to deprive us, not only of all hopes of subsisting here in your Service, but have proceeded for to provide, that we may not live hereafter but out of your Favour. So having intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perverted the comfort, we well hoped to have received from other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of our sincerity, they have only left us this Expedient, to testifie our mindfulness of our duty by, which is, to give humble intimation to that Honourable House, that we are involved in so great and extream exigencies of distress and universal want, with the pressure of three joynt Armies, upon our weak and naked Forces, that there remains no humane means discernable amongst us, to subsist by any longer in this Service, unless it shall stand with the pleasure and piety of those, in whose Service we have exhausted both our blood and livelihoods, to send us some seasonable and considerable Supplies, or that we should be inforced to entertain such terms, as the Rebels will give us, which of all things we abominate, as knowing our necessities will render them such, as must be both obstructive and dishonourable, and therefore shall resolve of making that the last Expedient, to preserve our own and many thousands of poor Protestants Lives by, or that it shall please the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houses to send Shipping to fetch us off. And so in discharge of our duties both to God and Man, we humbly offer to consideration, and remain.</p>

               <p>This Remonstrance begat some Heats: Upon which many of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers were sent for over, and committed; but upon submission, soon releas'd, and an Ordinance for their Indempnity publish'd.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> whom, not long since, we left in <hi>France;</hi> where finding himself at liberty, and out of the reach of his Enemy, he then projected again to visit <hi>Ireland,</hi> having made the<note place="margin">The Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides to return into <hi>Ireland,</hi> pre-possessing the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Taaff,</hi> with the Design.</note> Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Taaff,</hi> who (without any pause) had preserv'd their Allegiance entire, privy to what might best advance his Majesty's Interest, amongst those, who, opposing the Nuncio, seem'd resolute for his Majesty. And they (one in <hi>Connaght,</hi> the other in <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>) accordingly disposed the People to a ready complyance, whilst the Forces under the Nuncio were much weakned, partly by the defeat of General <hi>Preston,</hi> whose Army was routed and destroyed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's Forces, within less than a month after they had compelled the Marquess to leave the Kingdom, and partly by the dislike the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Confederate Catholicks had, of the demeanour of the Nuncio, and the experience they now had of his ill conduct, and the miseries he had brought them into, by forcing them to decline the Peace, which
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93738:117"/>
would have been so advantagious to them, and against which, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> the 2d. of <hi>March,</hi> 1647. published a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiquin,</hi> of the same Party.</note> conformable to what the Congregation of the Clergy before had pass'd at <hi>Waterford</hi> the 12th. of <hi>August,</hi> 1646.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> had likewise held correspondence with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> while he was in <hi>England;</hi> and as soon as the Marquess came into <hi>France,</hi> desired him to make what haste he could into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he should find the Army, and all the important Towns of that Province, under his Command, ready to submit to him, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by him in the King's Service, any way he should command. And in the mean time he made an <hi>Agreement</hi> with the <hi>Irish,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Taaff,</hi> with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the supream Council of the Confederate Catholicks, from <hi>May,</hi> 1648. to <hi>November</hi> following, and sent them 500 Horse, under<note place="margin">1648.</note> the Command of Major <hi>Doily,</hi> to assist them in an Expedition they were then entred upon against the Nuncio, and <hi>Owen Roe O Neal,</hi> in which they prevail'd so far, that <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> found it necessary to retire to the great Towns, and they drove the Nuncio himself into the Town of <hi>Gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> where he summoned a National Synod the 15th. of <hi>July,</hi> and they besieged him so close, that they compelled the Town (after near two<note place="margin">The <hi>Nuncio</hi> pursued close, and then quits the Kingdom.</note> months siege) to pay a good sum of Money, to be distributed amongst the Souldiers, and to disclaim any further subjection or submission to the <hi>Nuncio's</hi> unlimited Jurisdiction, which, in effect, had put all <hi>Ireland</hi> in confusion. And when he had (with less success than formerly) issued his Excommunication, the 27th. of <hi>May,</hi> 1648. against all those, who complied with the Cessation with the Lord <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> he was compelled in the end (after so much mischief done to the Religion he was obliged<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Viz.</hi> 23. of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1648/9.</note> to protect) in an obscure manner, to fly out of the Kingdom; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Rome,</hi> had an ill Reception of the Pope, <hi>Temerariè te gessisti,</hi> said he; with which, and the Fate of <hi>Fermo,</hi> in his absence, he soon after died. Nor indeed had any of those Apostolick <hi>Nuncios</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> much better Fate: <hi>Nicholas Sanders,</hi> an English-man, <hi>An.</hi> 1579. was sent <hi>Nuncio</hi> by <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13th. who wander'd in the Mountains of <hi>Kerry,</hi> and was there starv'd under a Tree. <hi>Owen Mac Egan,</hi> alias <hi>Eugenius O He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> of <hi>Irish</hi> Birth, <hi>Vicarius Apostolicus</hi> under <hi>Clement</hi> the 8th. was slain, leading a Troop of 100 Horse against the Loyalists, <hi>An.</hi> 1602/3.</p>
               <p>And because the impudent Injustice, and Imprudence of the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and the lame Subjection of the People, to his immoderate Pride and Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness, was, in truth, the real Cause, or rather Fountain, from whence this torrent of Calamities flowed, which hath since over-whelmed that miserable Nation; and because that exorbitant Power of his, was reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely opposed by the Catholicks, of the most eminent Parts and Interests, and in the end (though too late) expelled by them; it will be but Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to the Memories of those noble Persons, briefly to collect the sum of that unhappy Person's Carriage and Behaviour, from the time that he was first design'd to that Imployment. And in doing hereof, no other Language shall be used, than what was part of a Memorial, delivered by an honourable and zealous Catholick, who was intrusted to complain of the in-sufferable Behaviour of the <hi>Nuncio</hi> to the Pope himself, which runs in these very words, speaking of the <hi>Nuncio.</hi>

                              <p>He declar'd before he left <hi>Rome,</hi> That he would not admit either in his Company or Family; any Person of the <hi>English</hi> Nation. In his Voyage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">An Express of the Nuncio's Behaviour.</note> he arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> he writ to his Friends in <hi>Rome,</hi> with great joy, the News, (though it prov'd after false) that the <hi>Irish</hi> Confederates had treacherously surprized the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> while they were in truce with the Royal Party, and treating about an Accommodation and Peace. Arriving at <hi>Paris,</hi> (where he shut himself up for many months) he never vouchsafed (I will not say) to participate with the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> any thing touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nunciature, or in the least degree to reverence or visit her Majesty, save only one time upon the score of Courtesie, as if he had been sent to her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, not Subjects. Being arrived in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he imployed all his Power to dissolve the Treaty of Peace with the King, which was then almost brought to perfection; and his diligence succeeded, of which he valued himself, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, and insulted beyond measure. In his Letters he writ to <hi>Paris,</hi> which were after shewed to the Queen, and he may truely say, that in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he hath rather managed the Royal Scepter, than the Pastoral Staff, and that he aim'd more to be held the Minister of the supream Prince of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in Temporalibus,</hi> than a <hi>Nuncio</hi> from the Pope, <hi>in Spiritualibus;</hi> making himself President of the Council, he hath managed the Affairs of the supream Council of State; he hath, by his own Arbitrement, excluded from it those, who did not second him, though by Nobleness of Birth, Allegiance; Prudence, and Zeal to Religion, they were the most honourable; of these he caused many to be imprisoned, with great scandal, and danger of sedition; and, in short, he assumed a distributive Power both in Civil and Military Affairs, giving out Orders, Commissions, and Powers, under his own Name, subscribed by his own Hand, and made Authentick with his Seal, for the government of the Armies, and of the State, and Commissions for Reprizals at Sea. He stroke in presently after his Arrival in <hi>Ireland,</hi> with that Party of the Natives, who are esteemed irreconcilable, not only to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> but to the greatest and best part of the <hi>Irish</hi> Nobility, and of the same People, to the most civil and most considerable of that Island. And the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to support that Party and Faction, he hath procured the Church to be furnished with a Clergy and Bishops of the same temper, excluding those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who are recommended by the Queen, who, for Doctrine and Vertue, were above all exceptions, all which is contrary to what your Holiness was pleas'd to promise. The Queen was not yet discouraged, but so labour'd to renew the Treaty of Peace already once broke, and disorder'd by Monsieur <hi>Rinuccini,</hi> that by means of her Majesty, it was not only re-assumed, but, in the end, after great disputes and oppositions on his part, the Peace was concluded between the Royal Party and the Confederate Catholicks, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted not only by the King's Word, but also by the retention of Arms, Castles and Forts; and of the Civil Magistrates, with the possession of Churches, and of Ecclesiastical Benefices, and with the free exercise of the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And all this would have been exhibited by a publick Decree, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Laws, made by the three Estates assembled in a free Parliament: By this Peace and Confederacy they would have rescued themselves, from the damages of a ruinous War, have purchased security to their Consciences, and of their temporal Estates, honoured the Royal Party, and the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> with a certain restitution and liberty of the King, whereon depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed absolutely the welfare of the Catholicks in all his Kingdoms, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chair had quitted it self of all Engagements and Expence, with Honour and Glory. This Treaty of Peace on all sides so desirable, Monsieur <hi>Rinuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cini</hi>
                                 <pb n="192" facs="tcp:93738:118"/>
broke with such violence, that he forced the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Vice-Roy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to precipitate himself (contrary to his inclination and affection) into the arms of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to the unspeakable damage of the King, and of the Catholicks, not only of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but also of <hi>England.</hi> He incensed the greatest and best part of the Catholick Nobility, and rendred the venerable Name of the holy Apostolick Chair, odious to the Hereticks, with small satisfaction to the Catholick Princes themselves of <hi>Europe,</hi> as though it sought not the spiritual good of Souls, but a temporal Interest, by making it self Lord over <hi>Ireland.</hi> And when the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> and the Lord <hi>Byron</hi> endeavour'd, on the Marquess of <hi>Ormond's</hi> part, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him to a new Treaty of Peace, he did not only disdain to admit them, or to accept the Overture, but understanding, that the Lord <hi>Byron,</hi> with great danger and fatigue, came to Town, in the County of <hi>Westmeath,</hi> where he was to speak with him, he forced the Earl that was the Lord of it, to send him away (contrary to all Laws of Courtesie and Humanity) in the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, exposed to extraordinary inconveniencies and dangers amongst those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions, protesting, that otherwise he himself would immediately depart the Town. By this Proceeding, Monsieur <hi>Rinuccini</hi> hath given the World an occasion to believe, that he had private and secret Commission to change the Government of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to separate that Island from the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> And this Opinion is the more confirmed, since that one <hi>Mahony,</hi> a <hi>Jesuit,</hi> hath printed a Book in <hi>Portugal,</hi> wherein he endeavours to prove, that all the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> have been either Tyrants or Usurpers of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and so fallen from the dominion of it; exhorting all its Natives to get thither, and to use all Cruelty against the <hi>English,</hi> (with expressions full of Villany and Reproach) and to chuse a new King of their own Countrey. And this Book, so barbarous and bloody, dispersed through <hi>Ireland,</hi> is yet credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Catholick and Apostolick Chair: And the Continuation of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> was published at the same time, under the Name of <hi>Olderico Raynaldo,</hi> in which he endeavours to establish the supream Right and Dominion in the Apostolick Chair, even <hi>in Temporalibus,</hi> over <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> I leave to every Man to consider, whether all these Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not apt enough to beget Jealousies, and naughty Blood, and whether I ought not, out of great respect to the publick Good, to represent, with some ardency to your Holiness, the Actions of Monsieur <hi>Rinuccini,</hi> so unpleasant, and directly contrary to those Ends, for which, it was supposed, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. And I beseech your Holiness, if any King, not only Protestant but Catholick, had seen an Apostolick <hi>Nuncio</hi> to lord it in his Dominions, in such a manner as Monsieur <hi>Rinuccini</hi> hath done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> what Jealousies, what Complaints, and how many Inconveniencies would thereby follow? <hi>Thus as to the</hi> Nuncio, <hi>from</hi> the Confederates themselves.</p>

               <p>Though he gives this account of himself: For the better understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, (saith he) Recourse must be had to the first rising of the <hi>Irish,</hi> which was upon this occasion: The Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enter'd into an Agreement with the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland, called the large Treaty;</hi> in which there was a clause to joyn against the common Enemy, wherein the Catholicks of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well as others (if not chiefly) did apprehend themselves comprehended; to ballance which, or to prevent the misery that might fall upon them thereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sensible of the Earl of <hi>Stafford</hi>'s death, which purported some to be

sent as Governour, that was not like to carry so fair to them, as he had done, the same being to be approv'd (at least) by the Parliament then sitting. For better security, they endeavoured the supplanting all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants within that Kingdom, and though (at that time) without Arms or Ammunition, <hi>got possession of most part of the Kingdom;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was established a Council of 24, part of Civil, and part Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Persons, of which 12 were to reside in <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> or other place; as occasion and need called, with this Resolution, agreed to hold a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament every year, by, or in which, the said Council should be chang'd or continu'd. By this it was resolv'd, and after sworn by all the Catholicks, <hi>never to lay down Arms, until the</hi> Roman <hi>Church was settled, as of old in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and the King secur'd in all his Priviledges, that of calling, and putting period to Parliaments at pleasure, with a Negative voice, being chiefly meant, and then in great hazard to be lost.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and <hi>Inchequin,</hi> Protestants, fearing the issue of this League, and fore-seeing the in-ability to oppose it, treated with the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> Lord <hi>Muskery,</hi> and other Lords Catholicks, that possessed many Church-Benefices; a way erected by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> thereby to extinguish the Catholicks; and advertised them, that the Restitution of the Catholick Discipline, would out them of all the said Profits, gain'd them to the other side; though they continued still of the Council, in which they were a prevalent party, taking to them such (when any went out) as were of <hi>Ormond's</hi> mind and design: by which means a Peace was suddainly concluded, upon supposition, <hi>that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Catholicks requir'd it,</hi> although there was no mention of the Interest of that Church in the Accord. About that time, the King sent to this Council, the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> with full power to accord to the Catholicks, as they desired, if they should send him 10000 Men, as they had offered, <hi>Ormond</hi> then at <hi>Dublin</hi> (under pretext of Treating) drew <hi>Glamorgan</hi> thither, took from him his Commission, and made him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and certified the King, that himself could make a far better and more advantagious Peace, with the Catholicks, which he did in 30 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. <hi>This breach of Oath,</hi> made by the Council, gave occasion to the Nuncio, <hi>John Baptist Rinuccini,</hi> Archbishop and Prince of <hi>Firmo,</hi> who had brought some succours of Money and Arms into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to assemble the Clergy in <hi>Waterford,</hi> and Excommunicate all such as should adhere to the Peace: Which notwithstanding, the said Marquiss advanc'd to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to execute the same; but <hi>O Neil</hi> returning victorious from the defeat of 20000 <hi>Scots,</hi> in two Battles at <hi>Benburgh,</hi> and <hi>Tirconnel, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> goes back without doing of any thing; whereupon were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison'd the 7 that signed the Peace. <hi>Ormond</hi> seeing himself out with the Catholicks, both because he had ill treated them, and by the violence exercised by his Army, no sooner return'd to <hi>Dublin,</hi> but he treated with the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> for the delivery of the Towns he held; which was done accordingly. Coming after to <hi>London,</hi> where he expected to be gratified by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> proportionable to the service done them; but finding there no such disposition, he went secretly to the Queen at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> to justifie himself, and perswade her, <hi>That his rendring</hi> Dublin, <hi>and other Towns, were serviceable to the King her Husband, then Prisoner to the Parliament, because</hi> (said he) <hi>it is better that they have them, then the Catholicks, whom he affirm'd to have fail'd in their Fidelity to their King,</hi> although they renew'd the abovemention'd
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93738:119"/>

About this time, another Assembly of Catholicks, sent to the Queen, and the Princes her Children, to desire <hi>certain concessions</hi> in the absence; and because of the Detention of the King her Husband, deputing others to <hi>Rome,</hi> with Instructions to the former Deputies, to act jointly with these; but contrary, those to the Queen (not waiting the Resolution, or Concurrence of them at <hi>Rome</hi>) <hi>Muskery,</hi> and <hi>Brown,</hi> two of those Deputies, (notwithstanding the opposition of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss of <hi>Antrim,</hi> who was chief) proposed, and obtain'd of the Queen, that she send into <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> as formerly to be Lord Deputy, or Vice-Roy: Who being brought into that Kingdom, <hi>by the support of the said Supream Council,</hi> of which 7 always favour'd him, they again concluded a Cessation of Arms with <hi>Inchequin,</hi> then reduced to such necessities, that he was ready to fly into <hi>Holland,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he had dispatch'd part of his Goods, with good store of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, pick'd up there; The Suspension not to be hindred by the Nuncio, notwithstanding the offers of Money, to satisfie the pressing necessities, declar'd by the Council, together with <hi>Owen Roe O Neal's</hi> offer, to drive <hi>Inchequin</hi> quite out of <hi>Munster,</hi> at his own charge, and at the charge he would force out of those parts, by his Souldiers: But at this time <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequin</hi> was in a deeper Correspondence with the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation, which way, <hi>Ormond</hi> was also to biass his Designs. The Nuncio thus disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, called a new assembly of his Clergy, compos'd of <hi>Hugh O Rely,</hi> Primate of <hi>Ireland, Thomas Fleming,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Dublin, Thomas Welsh,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Cassel, John de Bourk,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> and ten Bishops, who unanimously declared, <hi>That this Cessation of Arms, was much prejudicial to the Catholick Religion, and could not be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced in Conscience, and so Excommunicated all that adher'd thereto.</hi> Hitherto the Council had born it self with some respect toward the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, remembring the Clemency us'd by the Nuncio, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering some of them from Prison; but upon this last Excommunication, they so threatned him, that he was forced to go privately from <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to a Castle, where <hi>Preston</hi> (by order of the Council) following, he fled to <hi>Gallway,</hi> and called there a National Council, to pacifie the Troubles of the Kingdom, which the aforesaid Council endeavour'd to hinder, forbidding the appearance of the Clergy, taking hold of divers Ecclesiastical Persons of his houshold, imprisoning them: So that the Nuncio despairing of re-establishing of the Affairs of the Catholicks, and having information, <hi>That</hi> Ormond <hi>had resolv'd (with all his Forces) to advance the Protestant Religion, and to destroy all opposers,</hi> and that the Supream Council of Catholicks, had declar'd their departure from the League, with their Confederates; he departed, arriving in <hi>France.</hi> In the interim, <hi>Owen Roe,</hi> judging, that he could not in conscience, joyn his Armies any longer with a Party, <hi>that called it self Catholick, and yet chas'd away the Nuncio,</hi> declar'd his separation from them, until they recal the Nuncio, and endeavour to obtain a Catholick Vice-Roy, and execute (in all other points) the Oath they had taken. This was taken very ill by the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and his Council, who charg'd <hi>O Neal</hi> with a Design (under colour thereof) to oppose the Affairs of the King, which occasion'd him to object to them, not the aforesaid Oath, but a particular Declaration, which he had published; where he, with all his Officers profess, <hi>That they intend onely to re-establish the Catholick Religion, the Liberties of the Kingdom, and the Prerogatives

He planted Garrisons upon the Frontiers of <hi>Ulster,</hi> to hinder the incursions of the Rebels, and he gave the Quarters the <hi>Scots</hi> had, to such of the <hi>British</hi> as he found faithful to the service. This was about <hi>September,</hi> 1648. a Service very acceptable in <hi>England;</hi> in manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, the Parliament sent him 500 <hi>l.</hi> and made him Governor of <hi>Carigfergus,</hi> by an Order of the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> and sent over Cloaths for some of those <hi>Scottish</hi> Regiments which came into him, and 5000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, for the two Provinces, of <hi>Ulster</hi> and <hi>Connaght,</hi> to be equally divided. Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> there being very active, not long after took in the strong Fort of <hi>Culmore,</hi> near <hi>Londonderry,</hi> seizing on (at the same time) Sir <hi>Robert Stewart,</hi> whom he sent Prisoner to the Parliament; upon which, the <hi>Scots</hi> Mutinied; but by a Letter from Sir <hi>Robert Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art,</hi> they were pacified, and all the Affairs of that Province, managed by Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Stewart</hi> being at Liberty upon his Parole.</p>
               <p>Before this, <hi>Townsend,</hi> and <hi>Doily,</hi> two Colonels under <hi>Inchequin</hi> in <hi>Munster,</hi> sent over to the Committee at <hi>Derby-House,</hi> some Propositions, for the surrender of the Towns in <hi>Munster,</hi> upon Condition of indempni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and receiving part of the Arrears for the whole Army; this was pretended to be acted by the consent of <hi>Inchequin,</hi> and that he with his own hand, had approved and interlin'd them in several Places. Hereupon, the Committee at <hi>Derby-House,</hi> sent back Colonel <hi>Edmond Temple,</hi> with an<note place="margin">Some suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that the Lord <hi>Inche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> would have submitted to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

But before his arrival there, Sir <hi>Richard Fanshaw,</hi> the Princes Secretary, was come from the Prince to <hi>Inchequin,</hi> with a Declaration of the Princes Design, to send the Duke of <hi>York</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> with such of the revolted Ships as remain'd in <hi>Holland,</hi> and to let him know the hopes he had, that by his assistance, and the Army under his Command, both he and his Father might be restored: This so puft up <hi>Inchequin,</hi> as that he would hear of no Overtures, and made him absolutely dis-avow to have had any knowledge of the Propositions sent over, and thereupon imprisoned <hi>Townsend,</hi> and <hi>Doily,</hi> thereby putting an issue to that Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation: Fortifying, besides all the Harbours against the Parliaments Forces, placing and displacing their Officers, as he thought most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, to introduce the Kings keeping a Correspondence with the West of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as yet free to all Trade, and holding frequent intelligence with <hi>Jarsey,</hi> where the Prince, was said, would keep his Court; Thus the Interest of the Parliament was wholly lost in <hi>Munster,</hi> where Sir <hi>William Fenton,</hi> Colonel <hi>Fair,</hi> Captain <hi>Fenton,</hi> and other Officers (for their affections to the Parliament) being imprison'd, were exchang'd in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> for the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi>'s Son, imprison'd in the Tower, about <hi>October,</hi> 1648.</p>
               <p>Near this time <hi>Owen Roe</hi> attempted to rescue <hi>Fort-Falkland,</hi> besieged by the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> and Colonel <hi>Preston</hi> joyn'd; but he was repulsed with the loss of many men, as his Lieutenant General <hi>Rice Mac-Guire,</hi> and <hi>Lewis More,</hi> dangerously hurt; which put <hi>Owen</hi> to such straits, as he made an Overture to Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> by his Vicar-General <hi>O Rely,</hi> to surrender

                              <p>TO prevent the too frequent prejudices, incident through jealousies, distrusts, and mis-constructions to all undertakings, We account it not the least worthy our labour, upon the instant of our arrival, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this People, whose welfare we contend for, with a right understanding of those intentions in us, which, in order to his Majesties Service, we desire may terminate in their good.</p>
                              <p>To enumerate the several Reasons by which we were induc'd (for preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Protestant Religion, and the <hi>English</hi> Interest) to leave the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and other his Majesties Garrisons then under our Power in this Kingdom, in the hands of those intrusted by his two Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, were to set forth a Narrative in place of a Manifest. It may suffice to be known, that those Transactions had for one main ground this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, That by being under the Power of the Houses, they would upon a happy expected composure of Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> revert unto, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested in his Majesty as his proper right.</p>
                              <p>But having found how contrary to the inclinations of the well-affected to his Majesties restauration in <hi>England,</hi> the Power of that Kingdom hath unhappily devolv'd to hands, imployed onely in the art and labour of pulling down, and subverting the Fundamentals of Monarchy, (with whom a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Party in this Kingdom do equally sympathize and co-operate.) And

being filled with a deep sense of the Duty and obligations that are upon us, strictly to embrace all opportunities of employing our endeavours, towards the recovery of his Majesties just Rights, in any part of his Dominions. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing observed the Protestant Army in the Province of <hi>Munster</hi> (by special providence discovering the Arts and practises used to intangle the Members thereof, in engagements as directly contrary to their Duties towards God and Man, as to their intentions and resolutions) to have found means to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest the Candor and Integrity thereof, in a disclaimer of any obedience to, or concurrence with those Powers or Persons, which have so grosly vari'd even their own professed Principles of preserving his Majesties Person and Rights, by confining him under a most strict Imprisonment, his Majesty also vouchsafing graciously to accept the Declaration of the said Army, as an eminent and seasonable expression of their fidelity toward him, and in testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof, having laid his Commands upon us to make our repair unto this Province, to discharge the duties of our Place.</p>
                              <p>We have as well in obedience thereunto, as in pursuance of our own duty, and desire to advance his Majesties Service, resolved to evidence our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and esteem of the proceedings of the said Army, by publishing unto the World our like determination in the same ensuing particulars. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we profess and declare,</p>
                              <p>First, to improve our utmost endeavours for the settlement of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion, according to the example of the best Reformed Churches.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, to defend the King in his Prerogatives.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly, to maintain the Priviledges and Freedom of Parliament, and the Liberty of the Subjects; that in order hereunto we shall oppose, to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of our lives, those Rebels of this Kingdom, who shall refuse their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Majesty, upon such terms as he hath thought fit by us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it; and we shall endeavour to the utmost, the suppressing of that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent-Party,</hi> who have thus fiercely laboured the extirpation of the true Protestant Religion, the ruine of our Prince, the dishonour of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Vassalage of our Fellow-Subjects, against all those who shall depend upon them, or adhere unto them. And that this our undertaking might not appear obnoxious to the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> but that we desire a firm Union and Agreement be preserved betwixt us, we do likewise declare, that we will continue free Traffick and Commerce with all his Majesties good Subjects of <hi>England;</hi> and that we will not in the least manner prejudice any of them that shall have recourse to our Harbours, either in their Bodies, Ships, or Goods; nor shall we take any thing from them, without payment of ready money for the same. And now that by his Majesties said Command, we have proceeded to re-enter upon the work of his Service in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, We conceive no higher testimony can be given of his Majesties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, or of the estimation we bear about us towards their Proceedings, than by resorting unto them in Person with his Majesties Authority, and exhibiting unto them the incouragement and satisfaction they may receive in this assurance, That as we bear an especial regard to their present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings and performances, accompanied with a real sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of their former sufferings; so lest there should any advantage be derived unto those, who endeavour to improve all opportunities of sowing sedition and distrust by this suggestion, that the former differences in Judgment and Opinion, which have induced persons to serve diversly under his Majesty, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will occasion prejudice, or ill resentments to arise towards such Persons, as have not formerly concurred in Judgment with others in his Majesties

Service. We do declare, that we are qualifi'd with special Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from his Majesty, to assure them, that no distinction shall be made in any such Consideration, but that all Persons now interested and engaged in this Cause, shall be reflected upon with equal fervour and regard; and that we shall make it our endeavours so to improve and confirm his Majesties Gracious disposure towards them, as that we will never call to memory any past difference in Opinion, Judgment, Action, or Profession, to the prejudice of any Member of this Army, or any Person relating to it; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, shall be very ready to attest our good affections towards them, in the discharge of such good Offices as shall be in our power; in return whereof, we shall onely expect their perseverance in their present Ingagements for his Majesties Service, with such alacrity, constancy, and affection, as may suit with their late publick Declaration and Professions. To whom we desire this assurance also may be inculcated, That as we shall in the future use our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most care and diligence to provide for their preservation from the like hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, to those they have formerly undergone; so we have already employ'd our best industry and endeavours for the settlement of such a course, as we may (with most reason) hope, will, in these uncertain times, produce a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and competent Subsistance for them, enabling them to make such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in their present undertakings, as may, with the accomplishment of the great ends thereof, establish their own Honour and Content. Thus much we have thought fit to publish unto the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to furnish it with an evidence of strong conviction against us, if we ever swerve (to the best of our power) from the just ways of maintaining the true Protestant Religion, the Honour and Interest of his Sacred Majesty, the just Rights of Parliament, the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Subjects, and the safety, quiet, and welfare of the People intrusted to our Care.</p>

Freedoms and Bounties conveyed to you and your Posterity by those Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, there is a door, and that a large one, not left, but purposely set open to give you entrance, by your future Merit, to whatsoever of Honour and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage you can reasonably wish: So that you have in present fruition what may abundantly satisfie, and yet there are no bounds set to your hopes; but you are rather invited, or (to use a new phrase, but to another and better end) you seem to <hi>have a Call from Heaven</hi> to exercise your Arms and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Fortitude, in the Noblest and Justest Cause the World hath seen; for let all the Circumstances incident to a great and good Cause be examined, and they will be found comprehended in that which you are now warrantably call'd to defend, Religion, not in the narrow circumscribed definition of it, by this or that late found out name, but Christian Religion is our Quarrel, which certainly is as much and fatally struck at (I may say more) by the blasphemous License of this Age, than ever it was by the rudest Incursions of the most barbarous and avowed Enemy to Christianity; the Venerable Laws and Fundamental Constitutions of our Ancestors are trodden under Impious, and, for the most part, Mechanick feet.</p>
                              <p>The Sacred Person of our King (the Life of those Laws, and Head of those Constitutions) is under an ignominious Imprisonment, and his Life threaten'd to be taken away by the Sacrilegious hands of the basest of the People, that owed him obedience; and (to endear the Quarrel to you) the Fountain of all the benefits you have but now acknowledg'd, and which you may further hope for by this Peace, and your own Merit, is endangered to be obstructed by the execrable murther of the worthiest Prince that ever Ruled these Islands.</p>
                              <p>In short, Hell cannot add any thing to the desperate Mischiefs now openly projected: and now judge if a greater and more glorious Field was ever set open to Action, and then prepare your selves to enter into it, receiving these few advices from him, that is throughly Embarqu'd with you in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.</p>
                              <p>First, let me recommend to you, that to this, as unto all holy Actions, (as certainly this is) you will prepare your selves with perfect Charity, a Charity that may obliterate what-ever Rancor the long continued War may have contracted in you, against any that shall now co-operate with you in so blessed a Work; and let his Engagement with you in this, whoever he is, be (as it ought to be) a Bond of Unity, of Love, of Concord, stronger than the nearest <hi>Tyes</hi> of Nature.</p>
                              <p>In the next place, mark and beware of those, who shall go about to renew jealousies in you, under what pretence soever, and account such as the infernal Ministers, imploy'd to promote the black design on foot, to subvert Monarchy, and to make us all slaves to their own avaritious lusts. Away (as soon and as much as possible may be) with distinction of Nation and Parties, which are the fields wherein the seeds of those Rancour-weeds are sown by the great Enemy of our Peace.</p>
                              <p>In the last place, let us all divest our selves of that preposterous and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous ambition and self-interest, which rather leads to our own threatned general ruine, than to the enjoyment of advantages unreasonably desired.</p>
                              <p>And if at any time you think your selves pinch'd too near the bone by those Taxes and Levies that may be imposed for your defence, consider then how vain, how foolish a thing it will be to starve a righteous Cause for want of a necessary support, to preserve your selves fat and gilded Sacrifices to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine of a merciless Enemy.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="204" facs="tcp:93738:124"/>And if we come thus well prepared to a Contention so just on our Parts, God will bless our Endeavours with success and victory, or will crown our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings with honour and patience; for what honour will it not be, if God hath so determin'd of us, to perish with a long glorious Monarchy? and who can want patience to suffer with an oppressed Prince? But as our Endeavours, so let our Prayers be vigorous, that he may be delivered from a more unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rebellion, than is mention'd by any Story, now raised to the highest pitch of Success against him.</p>
                              <p>I should now say something to you as to my self, in Retribution to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious mention made of me and my Endeavours, to the bringing this Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement to pass: But, I confess, my thoughts were taken up with those much greater Concernments. Let it suffice, that as I wish to be continued in your good Esteem and Affection, so I shall freely adventure upon any hazard, and esteem no trouble or difficulty too great to encounter, if I may manifest any Zeal to this Cause, and discharge some part of the Obligations that are upon me, to serve this Kingdom.</p>

               <p>Upon which Peace, the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Lord <hi>Taaff,</hi> and that Party, engag'd to raise for <hi>Munster,</hi> 4000 Foot and 800 Horse; the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Council and <hi>Preston</hi> for <hi>Leimster,</hi> 4000 Foot and 800 Horse; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiquin,</hi> 3000 Foot and 600 Horse; the Lord of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght,</hi> proportionable to the first: In all, 15000 Foot and 3000 Horse, besides what <hi>Owen Roe</hi> (upon his uniting afterwards) might bring in, computed to be 5000 Foot and 500 Horse, that in the whole, a gallanter Army (had they been unanimous) could scarce have been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall'd.</p>
               <p>With what Consent and Unity soever this Peace was made, by those who had any pretence to Trust, or to whom there was the least Deputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Authority and Power by the Nation, yet <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> (with whom<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> and <hi>Antrim</hi> refuse to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Peace</note> the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi> joyn'd) had the greatest Influence upon the Humours and Inclinations of the old <hi>Irish,</hi> who had given themselves up to the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and who indeed had a better disciplin'd, and consequently a stronger Army at his Command, than the Confederates thought he could have gain'd to his Devotion, still refused to submit to it. So that the Lord Lieutenant, (as soon as the Peace was concluded) was as well to provide against him, to remove some Garrisons he held, which infested those who obeyed the Acts of the Assembly, and to prevent his Incursion, as to raise an Army against the Spring, to march against the <hi>English,</hi> who were possessed of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and all the Countrey, and important Places of that Circuit, and who, he was sure, would be supplied with all assistance of Shipping, Men, Money, Victuals and Ammunition, which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> (who had now murthered their Sovereign, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated themselves under the Name and Title of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi>) could send them. And he was in a worse condition to prevail against <hi>both these,</hi> by the unhappy Temper and Constitution of the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ulster,</hi> who, being very numerous, and possessed of the strong Towns, (though in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession they abhorred the Regicides, and were not reconcilable to <hi>Owen O</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> not yet willing to joyn in the Peace.</note> 
                  <hi>Neal</hi> and his Party) were (as yet) as un-inclined to the Peace made with the Confederates, and far from paying an obedience and full submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93738:125"/>
to the Orders and Government of the Lord Lieutenant, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the same time, the Presbyterian Form in their Church, and an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Independency in the State, and out of those contradictory Ingredients, compounding such a peevish and wayward Affection and Duty to the King, as could not be applied to the bearing any part, in the great Work the Marquess was incumbent to.</p>
               <p>As soon as he heard of the Murther of the King, he proclaim'd our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Sovereign, <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d. King of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> at <hi>Carrick,</hi> the 16th. of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1648.</p>
               <p>And being (by a Clause in his late Commission from his Majesty) qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with special Power and Authority, to make no distinction (in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Judgement) betwixt any who should subject their Assistance to his Majesty's Service, he soon won the <hi>Scots</hi> to a compliance, though under the shackles of their Covenant, who immediately us'd the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Arguments they could, to win Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> to their Party. And to that end, (from the Congregation of the Presbytery at <hi>Belfast,</hi> the 15th. of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1648.) they tempt him (by several Representations) with their Sence: To which, the 7th. of <hi>March</hi> ensuing, Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> and the Council of War, (held at <hi>London-derry</hi>) return'd these Reasons, for their Dis-agreement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We find no part of God's Word authorizing us, being but a Branch of a subordinate Kingdom, to declare against the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> under whom we serve, who are the visible Authority of both Kingdoms, and against an Army, acting by their Power, before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from themselves a Declaration, and Grounds of those Proceedings, wherewith they are aspers'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Covenant we have taken, on which your Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations seem to be grounded, we cannot find, we have sworn to act, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principles you now declare: For, in some things, if we admit of your Representation, we shall be necessitated to act, against what we have sworn unto in the Covenant. For,</p>
               <p>The first Article, wherein we are bound to a preservation of the present Discipline in <hi>Scotland;</hi> we are in the same Article obliged, to a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> according to the Word of God, and the Example of the best Reformed Churches, which (no doubt) the Parliament will in due time establish: In the interim, we are un-satisfied with any Power, that acts in this Case, without their Direction.</p>
               <p>For what you speak in relation to the King's Person, we have yet no certainty out of <hi>England,</hi> concerning that Matter, and it is an action of so transcendent degree, that till we receive some positive Resolution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it from <hi>England,</hi> we ought not to proceed in giving our Sence of it.</p>
               <p>In the 5th. Article of the Covenant, we are sworn to endeavour the continuing the Kingdoms in Union, in which we desire your selves to be Judges, if the publishing of your Representations, be a probable way to observe the Oath.</p>
               <p>In the 6th. Article, we are sworn to defend those joyn'd with us in this Covenant, and not to suffer our selves directly or indirectly to combine against them: Now, till we receive a full Declaration of their falling from those Principles of this Covenant, how can we with safety to our own
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93738:126"/>
Consciences, declare a War against them, without breaking the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in this Particular?</p>
               <p>In the next place, We find some things in your Representations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (as we conceive) you are not rightly informed.</p>
               <p>First, In that you say, <hi>The Parliament hath broken the Covenant, in opposing the Presbyterial Government;</hi> which can no ways appear, since the same Government, by their appointment, is observ'd throughout <hi>England,</hi> and that the Covenant obligeth them to establish the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no further, than is agreeable to God's Word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You say, <hi>That you have deeply sworn in the first Article, to maintain the Church-Government, as it is in the Church of</hi> Scotland; which they have not sworn, the part of the Oath, for preservation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, relating only to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion, to the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, 'Tis affirmed, <hi>That the Power now governing in</hi> England, <hi>doth labour to establish by Law an universal toleration of all Religions;</hi> which yet was never done by them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The sad Consequences which will un-avoidably follow, if we pursue the Intention of the Representations, are these:</p>
               <p>First, By declaring such an open War against the Parliament, we should deprive our selves of all Succours and Supplies out of <hi>England,</hi> which have been hitherto a great part of our subsistence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The pursuing of such a War, will un-avoidably sow such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions amongst us, who, in these Parts, are of such different Principles and Practices, that we shall soon become instruments of our own ruine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It will compel us, for our own preservation, to joyn with the Rebels, or desert this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And lastly, It will, without any lawful Call, engage us in a War against an Army, who have, under God, been the instruments of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>England</hi> out of thraldom, and was not long since acknowledged to have been so instrumental, in setling <hi>Scotland</hi> in the Peace and Quietness it now enjoyeth, and this at the Charge of <hi>England,</hi> as the Declaration of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> doth thankfully witness.</p>
               <p>These things therefore being duely weighed, we desire you, in the fear of God, seriously to take this our Answer into your Considerations, and to remember on whom the guilt of innocent blood will fall, if you inforce a War; and to set before your eyes, the punishment from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which hath still attended the Endeavours of all, who have deserted the Quarrel in this Kingdom, to engage against the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> From visible Judgements, we are resolv'd, by God's assistance, to take so good warning, as we will not be guilty of destroying the Cause, we have so long labour'd into countenance for your Representations, till we be better satisfied in our Consciences, though we will not directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly countenance any Sectaries or Schismaticks, who-ever is truely so called, contrary to our Solemn League and Covenant; but we will, to the utmost of our Endeavours, continue faithful in the prosecution of the Rebels in this Kingdom, and their Abettors, wherein we shall not doubt of the Blessing and Protection of the Almighty, upon our lawful and just Endeavours. And for furtherance hereof, we desire, in the last place,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93738:126"/>
that we should all declare against the Peace last made by the Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> as that which will (if not protested against) ruine and destroy your Service of this Kingdom, against the Rebels.</p>
               <p>Here it's evident, that Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> could by no ways be brought on; yet the Peace being settled, his Excellency endeavour'd to work over Lieutenant General <hi>Jones</hi> to his Party; to which end his Excellency vouchsafed to write to him many Letters from <hi>Thurles,</hi> the 27. of <hi>March,</hi> 1649. all answer'd without the least compliance on <hi>Jones</hi>'s side. He, by his Reply the 31. of <hi>March,</hi> 1649. charging the fatal and inhumane Act<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant treats with <hi>Jones</hi> to come in.</note> (perpetrated on his Majesty) to his Excellency's arrival in <hi>Ireland,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Treaty at <hi>Carisbrook, whereby the sincerity of that Treaty was question'd,</hi> occasionally (writes he) producing what thereupon followed; so as in conclusion he professed, <hi>That were there neither King or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1649.</note> 
                  <hi>he should yet stand firm to his Principles, to preserve the</hi> English <hi>Interest in</hi> Ireland, <hi>that being a Cause alien from what was acted in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>Foraign to his Work and Trust, which if he should not perform; would not easily be expiated by a slender or lean Manifest:</hi> upon which no more Letters pass'd betwixt them; though the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> in <hi>June,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inchequin</hi> does the like, but in-effectually.</note> from the Camp at <hi>Finglass,</hi> 1649. renewed the Attempt, and was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd with the like Resolution, and some Reflections on his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>About which time, <hi>Ireland</hi> came again to be seriously thought of by the Parliament, though hitherto it was (in some respects) made a Stale for several Designs then on foot. <hi>Jones</hi> was much confided in; but it was thought requisite, the weight of that Business should lye on other shoulders, not his; <hi>Cromwel</hi> therefore (about the 28 of <hi>March</hi>) was voted General of <hi>Ireland, Skippon</hi> (under the Title of Martial General) having refused the Command; and these ensuing <hi>Votes</hi> passed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>

                  <item>9. That the Pay of the Officers and Souldiers, should be according to the <hi>Irish</hi> Establishment, onely the Officers to receive for the present, the same Pay as here.</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>11. That the Parliaments Forces already in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and those then ready to go over, should be in one Army, and one Establishment.</item>

               </list>
               <p>Thus provided, <hi>Cromwel</hi> prepares for his Journey; though to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate him with an Army of 8000 Foot, and 4000 Horse, no small difference arose betwixt the Presbyterian and Independent at that time, undermining each other, the Levellers being pragmatick; He, however, carried over some of the discontented Persons on each side, finding them there work enough against a common Enemy: And so prepared for his Journey, 120000 <hi>l.</hi> being borrowed of the City, upon the Credit of the Ordinance of 90000 <hi>l.</hi> a month. In the interim, he gets Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones,</hi> (who was sent to the Parliament from his Brother) dispatch'd for <hi>Ireland</hi> with 1500 Quarters of Corn, and 10000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, little enough to hearten the Souldiers, frequently then deserting the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and flying to the Marquess of <hi>Ormond;</hi> yea, the Regiment the Parliament (sent under Colonel <hi>Tuthil,</hi> being made up of Voluntiers, most of those engaged in <hi>Colchester</hi> Design) mutinied, being sent over without Money, Provisions, or Cloaths, thereby indangering the City more then the Marquess.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> in the interim, in a <hi>Remonstrance and Declaration,</hi> (to which, on the least Motive, they are naturally inclin'd) <hi>of the general Assembly of the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>concerning present and eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the</hi> 13th. <hi>of</hi> Febr. 1649. declared, amongst other things, as Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, <hi>That the standing Armies in</hi> Ireland, <hi>under the Marquess of</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, <hi>the Lord</hi> Inchequin, <hi>and the Lords of</hi> Ards, <hi>and</hi> George Monro, <hi>forgetting all the horrible cruelty that was exercised by the</hi> Irish <hi>Rebels, upon many thousands of the</hi> English <hi>and</hi> Scottish <hi>Nations in that Land, have enter'd into a Peace and Association with them, that they may the more easily carry on the old Designs of the Popish, Prelatical, and Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Party; and the Lords of</hi> Ards, <hi>and</hi> George Monro, <hi>have by treachery and oppression, brought the Province of</hi> Ulster, <hi>and Garrisons therein, under their Power and Commands;</hi> which urging (with much violence) afterwards produced a Declaration from the King, in dislike of the Peace, 1648. much insisted on by the <hi>Irish,</hi> and indeed (as you will hear) begat the grounds of a future distast.</p>
               <p>So that whosoever will wisely revolve and consider this wilde Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of Affairs, and that to the subduing the Power, Strength, and Wealth, of the Parliament, and the equal malice and headiness of <hi>Owen O Neal,</hi> and his Party (as much, or in truth, more contracted against the Confederate <hi>Irish,</hi> then the Kings Authority) and the forming and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the useless, and unprofitable pretences of affection in the <hi>Scots,</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:93738:127"/>
and reducing them to obedience, the Marquess brought over with him neither Men nor Money, considerable, nor any advantage, but that of his own Person, Wisdom, and Reputation, and was now (upon the Peace) to constitute an Army, not only of several Nations, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of such Passion, and Superciliousness in these Opinions, which flowed from their several Religions, but of such men, who had for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the space of eight years, prosecuted a sharp War against each other, with all the Circumstances of Animosities, Rapine, and Revenge; and who were now brought into this Reconciliation and Conjunction, rather by the wonderful Wisdom, and Dexterity of the Principal Commanders, then by their own Charity and Inclination; And that in the forming of this Army, he had not above 6 or 7 Officers, upon whose skill in Martial Affairs, and affection to him, he could with any confidence depend; but was to make use of very many, who were utterly unknown to him, and such who either had no experience in the War, or who had been alway in the War against him; I say, whosoever without passion considers all this, will rather wonder, that the Marquess did not sink under the weight<note place="margin">The difficulty the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Army.</note> of the first Attempt, nay, that he could proceed with success, in any one Enterprize, then that an Army so made up, should upon the first mis-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture be dissolv'd into jealousies and prejudices, amongst themselves; and that all confusions should follow, which naturally attend such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
               <p>As soon as the Peace was thus concluded, proclaim'd and accepted, the Lord Lieutenant took a survey of the Stores of Arms, Ammunition, and other Provisions necessary for the Army, which was to be brought together in the Spring, and found all very short of what he expected, and<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant finds Arms and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney no ways answerable to his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> what was absolutely necessary to the Work, and ways for raising of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, with which all the rest was to be supplied, in no degree to be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon; The Cities, and Incorporate Towns, where, upon the matter all the Wealth was, having never submitted further to the General Assembly, then by declaring themselves to be of their Party; but like so many Common-Wealths, order'd all Contributions, and payments of Money, by their own Acts and Determinations; nor would upon the most Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occasions, suffer any Money to be rais'd in any other proportion, or in any other manner, then best agreed with their Humours and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies. So that the Commissioners, advised and besought the Lord Lieutenant, to make a Journey in Person, to such of those Corporations, as were best able to assist him, and by his own Presence, Assistance, and Interest, endeavour to perswade them, to express that affection to the Peace, they had professed; And thereupon he went with a Competent number of the Commissioners, to <hi>Waterford,</hi> which gave 8000 <hi>l.</hi> and 3000 Barrels of Corn; and from thence he went to <hi>Limerick,</hi> and then to <hi>Gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> from which several Places, he procured the Loan of more Money, Corn, and Ammunition, then the General Assembly had ever been able to do, for most of which last, he was forced to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with <hi>Patrick Archer,</hi> and other Merchants, for a Supply thereof, engaging the Kings Customs, and the tenths of Prizes, for payment; and by this means, which cost him much labour and time, he found himself in a condition, to draw several Forces together; which he did about the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> having made the Lord <hi>Inchequin,</hi> Lieutenant-General of the Army; the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> Lieutenant-General of the Horse; and the Lord <hi>Taaff,</hi> Master of the Ordnance, at the General Randezvouz

at <hi>Cashol,</hi> whilst the <hi>Scots</hi> reduc'd <hi>Ulster,</hi> and <hi>Connaght;</hi> and it being thought fit, to lose as little time as might be, in marching towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> as soon as any considerable number of men were once together;<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to march against <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </note> he sent the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi> with some Forces, to take in several Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, which were possessed by <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> in the <hi>Queen</hi>'s County, which was the way he intended to march, and so would have no Enemy in his Rear; And the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> accordingly took the Fort of <hi>Maryborrough,</hi> and other Places in that County, and <hi>Athy,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> in the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> whereby their passage was open for the further March.</p>
               <p>Having thus began the Campania, the Lord Lieutenant appointed a<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant begins the Campaign in <hi>May,</hi> but was forced to use his own Credit to begin the service, some write but with 8000 Foot, and 2000 Horse.</note> General Randezvouz for the whole Army, at <hi>Cloghgrenan,</hi> alias <hi>Glaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenan,</hi> an house of his upon the River <hi>Barrow,</hi> near the Castle of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaugh,</hi> where he made a Conjunction of all the Forces, Protestant and <hi>Irish;</hi> Who by the Wisdom and Temper of the Principal Officers, mingled well enough, and together about the end of <hi>May,</hi> made a Body, as (it's generally reported) of 3700 Horse, and 14500 Foot, with a Train of Artillery, consisting of four Pieces of Cannon; But when they were thus met, all the Money which could be rais'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, or which had been rais'd by the Corporate Towns, was so near spent in drawing the Forces out of their Quarters, and in those short Expeditions into the <hi>Queen</hi>'s County, and County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> that they could not have advanced in their March, if the Lord Lieutenant had not upon his own Private Credit, borrowed 800 <hi>l.</hi> of Sir <hi>James Preston,</hi> by means whereof, he gave the Common Souldiers four days Pay; and so about the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> marched from <hi>Cloghgrenan,</hi> and the same Evening, appear'd before <hi>Talbots</hi> Town, a strong Garrison of the Enemies, which together with Castle <hi>Talbot,</hi> two miles distant from the other, was within 3 days surrendred to the Marquess, upon promise of Quarter, which they had; and then he march'd to <hi>Kildare,</hi> which Town was likewise surrendred unto him; as were Castle <hi>Sallogh,</hi> and Castle <hi>Carby,</hi> at <hi>Kildare;</hi> He was compelled to stay 3 or 4 days, both for want of Provision, and for a Recruit of 2000 Foot, which by the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi>'s Care and Diligence, was then upon their March, and being join'd, he was in hope by a suddain and speedy Motion, to have engaged <hi>Jones,</hi> (who at that time, <hi>viz.</hi> 12. of <hi>June,</hi> was march'd from <hi>Dublin,</hi> as far as <hi>Johnstown,</hi> with his Army, consisting of 1000 Horse, and 3000 Foot,) and so having encouraged his Souldiers with 3 days Pay, (which he was likewise compelled to borrow on his Credit, out of the Pockets of Persons of Quality, attending on him, and of the Officers of the Army) he passed the River of <hi>Lifly;</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> having upon intelligence of his Motion, in great disorder rais'd his Camp, and retir'd into <hi>Dublin;</hi> after that Major <hi>Cadogan,</hi> by his Command, had done notable and severe Service about <hi>Tecroghan,</hi> burning the Countrey, not in 5 years before Visited, and had beaten a part of the Marquess's Forces, though he got not so much by his Victory (though considerable) as <hi>Jones</hi> afterwards lost by Treachery, the Garrison of <hi>Allan</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up for 200 <hi>l.</hi> The Marquess encamped his whole Army at the <hi>Naas,</hi> twelve miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> that he might maturely deliberate what was next to be undertaken, being now the middle of <hi>June.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which appeared worthy of debate was, whether the Army should first make an Attempt upon <hi>Dublin,</hi> in which it was believ'd
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93738:128"/>
there were very many both Officers and Souldiers, and other Persons of Quality, well affected to the Kings service, and who had formerly served under the Marquess, and esteem'd him accordingly, who might make that work more easy; Or whether the Army should be first imployed in the taking in of <hi>Trim, Tredagh,</hi> and other out-Garrisons, from whence the City receiv'd much Provisions of all kinds, and from whence Provisions to the Army would be cut off, and much other prejudice might arise. But upon full consideration, the Council of War, which consisted of the General Officers, inclined to the former; concluding,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dublin</hi> resolv'd to be first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted.</note> that if they could take <hi>Dublin,</hi> all other places would quickly fall into their hands; and if they should delay it, and waste their Provisions in those lesser Attempts, there might probably arrive out of <hi>England,</hi> such supplies of Men, Money, and other necessaries to <hi>Jones,</hi> which were daily expected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as might render that important work almost impossible: Hereupon, the Lord Lieutenant marched the very next morning toward <hi>Dublin,</hi> and that afternoon, re-passed the whole over the River of <hi>Liffy,</hi> by the Bridge of <hi>Lucan,</hi> and encamped near that place, to rest his men a few hours: He marched very early in the morning, being the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> and appear'd by nine of the Clock at a place called <hi>Castleknock,</hi> in view of the City; and hearing that <hi>Jones</hi> had drawn out all his Horse into the Green, not far from the Walls, he sent a Party of Horse and Musketiers to face them, while he drew his whole Body, within less then Cannon-shot of their Gates, hoping thereby to give some countenance to those in the Town, to raise some Commotion therein;<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant appears before <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </note> and having spent some part of the day in this posture and expectation, after some slight skirmishes between the Horse, writes one; others say considerable, where the Earl of <hi>Clanrickards</hi> Regiment of Horse was sorely beaten, though they ralli'd twice; He found it necessary to draw off, and encamped that night at a place two miles from the Town, called <hi>Finglas,</hi> whither great multitudes of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> whereof most were aged Men, Women, and Children, whom <hi>Jones</hi> had turned out of the City, repair'd to him, whom he sent with all due Order, for their Reception, into Quarters adjacent.</p>
               <p>The Marquess was no sooner in his Quarters, then he receiv'd sure intelligence, that <hi>Jones</hi> had sent his Horse to <hi>Tredagh,</hi> from whence they would have been able to have distressed his Army several ways, and to have interrupted Provision which came out of the Countrey, out of the Magazines, which were at least 30 miles distant; And several Officers were of opinion; upon the view they had taken that day of the Enemy, and the countenance they had observed of their own men, that they were not presently provided for a formal Siege, and as ill to attack the Town by a brisk attempt; and therefore he resolv'd to remain encamp'd at that place for some time, whereby he might take the advantage of any opportunity, that within the Town would administer unto him: and presently sent the Lord <hi>Inchequin,</hi> Lieutenant-General of the Army, with a strong Party of Horse, to pursue <hi>Jones</hi> his Horse, which were sent for<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequin</hi> defeats a Party of <hi>Jones</hi>'s Horse sent to <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagh.</hi>

                  <hi>Tredagh;</hi> which he did so successfully, that he surprized one whole Troop, and afterwards encountred Colonel <hi>Chidley Coot,</hi> in the head of 300 Horse, whereof he slew many, and routed the rest, who in great disorder fled to <hi>Tredagh.</hi> The Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> presently sent advertisement of this success, and that he had reason to believe, that if he pursued this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and attempt the Town, while this terror possessed that

               </p>
               <p>There was now very reasonable ground for hope, that the Parliaments Party would quickly find themselves in notable streights and distresses, when it was on a suddain discover'd, how very active and dexterous, the spirit of Rebellion is to reconcile and unite those, who were possessed by it, and how contrary soever their Principles and Ends seem to be, and contribute jointly to the opposing and oppressing that Lawful Power, they had both equally injured and provoked. The Parliament Party, who had heap'd so many Reproaches and Calumnies upon the King, for his Clemency to the <hi>Irish,</hi> who had founded their own Authority and Strength upon such foundations, as were inconsistent with any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion, and some write (so bitter are their Pens) even with Humanity to the <hi>Irish</hi> Nation, and more especially to those of the old Native Extraction, the whole Race whereof they had (upon the matter) sworn to an utter extirpation; And <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> himself was of the most antient Sept, and whose Army consisted onely of such, who avowed no other cause for their first entrance into Rebellion, <hi>but Matter of Religion;</hi> and that the Power of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was like to be so great and prevalent, that the King himself would not be able to extend his Favours and Mercy towards them, which they seem'd to be confident, he was (in his gracious disposition) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to express; and therefore professed to take up Arms against the exorbitant Power onely of them, and to retain hearts full of Devotion and Duty to his Majesty; and who at present, by the under-hand and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Treaties with the Lord Lieutenant, seem'd more irreconcilable to the Proceedings of the General Assembly, and to the Persons of those whom he thought govern'd there, then to make any scruple of submitting to the Kings Authority, in the Person of the Marquess, to which and to whom, he protested all Duty and Reverence. These two so contrary and dis-agreeing Elements, had, I say, by the subtile and volatile spirit of Hypocrisy and Rebellion (the Arts of the time) found a way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate together; and <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> had promised and contracted with<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Owen O Neal,</hi> and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Party agree.</note> the other, that he would compel the Lord Lieutenant to retire, and draw off his Army from about <hi>Dublin,</hi> by his invading those Parts of <hi>Leim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and <hi>Munster,</hi> with his Army, which yielded most, yea, all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and subsistance to the Marquess, and which he presumed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess

would not suffer to be spoil'd and desolated by his Incursions: for the better doing whereof, and enabling him for this Expedition, Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> Governor of <hi>Dundalk,</hi> (who was the second Person in Command, amongst the Parliaments Forces) had promised to deliver to him, out of the stores of that Garrison, a good quantity of Powder, Bullet, and Match, proportionable; for the fetching whereof, <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> had sent <hi>Farral</hi> (Lieutenant General of his Army) with a Party of 500 Foot, and 300 Horse. At that time <hi>Tredagh</hi> was taken by the Lord <hi>Inchequin;</hi> who, being there advertised of that new contracted friendship, resolved to give some interruption to it, and made so good hast, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few hours after <hi>Farral</hi> had receiv'd the Ammunition at <hi>Dundalk,</hi> he<note place="margin">

                  </note> to the whole Kingdom, as it was ill resented (<hi>Owen Roe</hi> and his Party having been first engaged in those horrid Massacres) and presently rejected: And though Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> was not censur'd, because it was presum'd he did it out of necessity; yet several Votes passed against him as to that Cessation, though he was continued in his Imployment; and having received the pleasure of the Parliament concerning the Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by him with <hi>Owen Roe,</hi> presently acquainted him therewith, who, according to Articles betwixt them, did soon retire, and, as we shall see afterwards, came to an agreement with the Marquis of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> finding he could not by any means (he could use) draw himself or his Party to be accepted of by the Parliament, an attempt he earnestly solicited, engaging to maintain their Interest with the hazard of his Life and Fortune against all opposers whatsoever; with whom joyn'd the Lords, Gentry, and Commons of the Confederate Catholicks of <hi>Ulster:</hi> though many were of opinion, that all that was done both by Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> and Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> was transacted by the privity (if not consent) of the Grandees in <hi>England;</hi> but the Grounds to fasten this upon them could never be found, though the business hath been narrowly search'd

into: Known it was, that there was a Person sent over, and many Overtures made by a Priest <hi>O Rely</hi> to the Committee of <hi>Derby-house,</hi> but with whatreception, the certainty yet remains in the Clouds. However, Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> having by this means delivered himself from the strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Siege, and having received some new supplies of Men and Provisionsout of <hi>England,</hi> (Colonel <hi>Hunks</hi> being sent from <hi>Cromwel</hi> with Forces to his Relief) presently marched out, and clear'd the Countrey about him; and afterwards in <hi>October</hi> got such a strength together, as he went to <hi>Colerain,</hi> and took in that Town by <hi>Anslat,</hi> and so went on to the Siege of <hi>Carigfergus.</hi> However, he so resents the Parliaments slow supplies, as (in <hi>June</hi> this year) there is exhibited his complaint, truly a sad one, in reference to their neglect, and in conclusion desires either to be suppli'd answerable to his condition, or to be discharg'd from his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
               <p>But to look backwards. All the Places of Moment near <hi>Dublin</hi> being (as we have shew'd) reduc'd by the Marquis <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Party, who on the<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, upon the view of his Army, found it considerable ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Block up the City, than make a Regular Siege.</note> 
                  <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> took a view of his whole Army, and found it to consist of no less than 7000 Foot and about 4000 Horse, others write more; which though a good Force, was not equal to the work of forming a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Siege of so large and populous a City as <hi>Dublin,</hi> and as unfit to storm it; therefore it was resolv'd still to continue the former design of strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, until the necessities within abated the obstinacy of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for the better doing whereof, the Lord Viscount <hi>Dillon</hi> of <hi>Costiloe,</hi> was appointed to remain still on the North-side of the Town, with a Body of 2000 Foot and 500 Horse, to block it up, having two or three small Places of strength to retire to upon occasion; and that the Sea (as far as his Power might extend) might not be unprovided, his Excellency granted Letters of Mart, the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> signed by Secretary <hi>Lane,</hi> to Captain <hi>Joseph Containe</hi> of <hi>Waterford,</hi> and others. And then the Lord Lieutenant march'd with the remainder of the Army over the River of <hi>Liffy</hi> to the South-side, to a Place called <hi>Rathmines,</hi> where he resolved to Incamp, and from whence, by reason of the narrowness of the River, he might discourage an attempt of sending Relief into the Town by Sea from <hi>England.</hi> And in truth, if he had come time enough to have rais'd a Work upon the Point, some interruption might have been given to that Enterprise; but it pleased God, that that very same day (the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi>) the Marquis marched thither, in sight of his Army; a strong gale of Wind from the East brought into <hi>Dublin</hi> Harbour Colonel <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Colonel <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, Hunks,</hi> and <hi>Venables,</hi> arrive at <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</hi>
                  </note> Colonel <hi>Hunks,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Venables,</hi> with a good supply of Horse, <hi>viz.</hi> 600, and 1500 Foot, Money, and all other necessaries where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Garrison stood in need, which marvellously exalted the spirits of those, who were devoted to the obedience of the Parliament, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the minds of them, who watched all opportunities of doing ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the King. There were then in <hi>Dublin</hi> 5000 Soldiers, besides In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. However, the Marquis pursued his resolution, and encamped that night at <hi>Rathmines,</hi> and the next day made himself strong there, till, upon information, he was sure to receive an account of the state and condition of the Enemy, that he might better conclude what was next to be done.</p>
               <p>There were many men within the City who found means to send the Marquis still advertisement of what was necessary for him to know, &amp; some Ships (which brought Supplies for the Parliaments Forces there) brought
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93738:131"/>
likewise intelligence from those that wished well to the Kings service, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord Lieutenant, and unto other Persons of Honour that were with him, and from several Persons of known Integrity, and who were like enough to know what was transacted in the Councils of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Party: It was informed, that this Supply, which was already land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Dublin,</hi> was all that was intended for that Place, and believed it to be sufficient to defend it against any Army the Marquis could bring to attaque it; and that <hi>Cromwel</hi> (who was known to be ready in <hi>England</hi> to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque with a great Army) meant to land in <hi>Munster,</hi> a Countrey but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall'n from their Devotion, and where there were still many inclined<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cromwel</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Lieutenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note> to him, and thereby to compel the Lord Lieutenant to rise from <hi>Dublin.</hi> And it is very true, that at that time <hi>Cromwel</hi> was resolv'd to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in that manner, after he had with much seeming difficulty been brought to accept of the Place, the Presbyterians laying Wagers he would never come, and the Independents sought to divert him from it by their unexpected Mutinies, on a Tenent, <hi>That all were to enjoy their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi> Yet upon this joynt intelligence of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s advance (for it came from some Persons to the Lord Lieutenant, and from others to the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi>) it was, upon consultation with the General Officers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded absolutely necessary, that the Lord <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> being Lord President<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequin</hi> (sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> might land in <hi>Munster</hi>) went thither.</note> of <hi>Munster,</hi> should immediately, with a strong Party of Horse, repair into that Province, whereby at least the Garrisons there might be supported against any sudden attempt of the Enemy, if they should land there; and that, the Army being thus weakned by the Quality, as well as the Number of this Party, who were the best Horse of the Body, the Lord Lieutenant should retire to <hi>Drumnagh,</hi> being a Quarter of greater strength and security than that of <hi>Rathmines</hi> was, or could be made, and was at such distance, as might as well block up the Enemy as the other; and from thence, an interrupted Communication might be held with that Party, which encamp'd on the North side of the River. And upon this Conclusion, the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> departed towards <hi>Munster.</hi> When it was known that his Excellency was to retire, the Officers and Soldiers expressed much trouble, and seem'd to believe the reducing of the Town not to be a matter of that difficulty as was pretended, if they could hinder the Parliamentarians Horse from grasing in the Meadows near the Walls, (which was the onely Place they were possessed of to that purpose) they could not be able to subsist five days; and it would be in their power to take that benefit from them, if they possess'd themselves of the Castle of <hi>Baggatrath,</hi> very near adjoyning to that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, which was already so strong, that in one night it might be made sufficiently fortifi'd. And this discourse (which was not indeed unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable) got so much credit, that the Council of War intreated the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis to decline his former resolution of retiring to <hi>Drumnagh,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> General <hi>Preston,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Aston,</hi> and Major General <hi>Purcel,</hi> having viewed <hi>Baggatrath,</hi> and assured the Lord Lieutenant, that it might be possess'd and sufficiently fortifi'd in one night.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder that in an Army thus constituted and composed, the Marquis thought not fit, by his Authority, to restrain it from pursuing an Enterprise of so much Gallantry, and which had so much possibility of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess: and indeed, he still retain'd some hope of advantage by the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that City, and that (even in these last Supplies that were sent over) there were many that laid hold of that opportunity to transport
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93738:132"/>
themselves, for the advancement of the Kings service, and with purpose quickly to change their Masters, so that he was contented to recede from his former resolution, and on the first of <hi>August</hi> at night sent a strong Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>viz.</hi> 1500 Foot, under Major General <hi>Purcel,</hi> to possess themselves<note place="margin">A Party sent to fortifie <hi>Bagga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trath</hi> under <hi>Purcel.</hi>
                  </note> of <hi>Baggatrath,</hi> with Engineers, and such other Materials as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to fortifie it: and because he concluded, that the Enemy would immediately discover what they were doing, and would use their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeavours to prevent the execution of a Design, which would bring such irreparable damage to them, he gave strict order for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Army in Battalia, and commanded, that they should stand in Arms all that night, himself continuing in the Field on Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back till morning; as soon as it was day, he went to visit the Place that was to be fortifi'd, which he found not in that condition he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; the Officer <note n="*" place="margin">Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Parcel.</hi>
                  </note> excusing himself, by having been misguided in the night, so that it was very late before he arrived there, though it was not an <hi>English</hi> mile distant from the Camp; wherewith the Marquis being unsatisfi'd, displac'd the Officer who commanded the Party, and put an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of good Name and Reputation into the Charge, and appointed him to make his men to work hard, since it appear'd, that in four or five hours it might be so well fortifi'd, that they need fear no attempt from the Town; and that they might be sure to enjoy so much time, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Army to remain in the same posture they had been all night; and about 9 of the Clock, seeing no appearance of any Sally from the Town, which he had so long expected, he went to his Tent to refresh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with a little rest, which he had not obtain'd for the space of an hour, when he was awaken'd by an Alarm from the Enemy, and putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self immediately upon his Horse, quickly found, that his Officers and Lieutenant General <hi>Preston</hi> had not been so punctual in their Duty as they ought to have been, but had quitted their Posts (out of an unhappy<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's Forces routed at <hi>Rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines.</hi>
                  </note> confidence, that the Besieged would not adventure, at that time of the day, to make any Sally) as soon as the Marquis went to repose himself; so that a strong Party out of the Town, about 10 of the clock in the morning, the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> 1649. march'd directly to <hi>Baggatrath,</hi> and (with less opposition than ought to have been made) beat, roated, and dispers'd the Party that possess'd it; who, finding their Horse not so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to assist them as they expected, quitted the Place with all imaginable confusion; which encourag'd <hi>Jones</hi>'s Party (who were seconded imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by the whole Power in <hi>Dublin</hi>) to advance further towards the Army (which they discern'd to be in high disorder) than at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out they intended. The Lord Lieutenant used all means to put the Horse in order, sending the Lord <hi>Taaff</hi> to command the Foot: But Sir <hi>William Vaughan</hi> (Commissary General of the Horse) being in the first Charge killed, they who followed him were immediately routed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that the Forces from <hi>Dublin</hi> march'd onely in single Troops and Companies, having not time to draw together in Battalia; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon so great a consternation seiz'd upon the spirits of all the rest, that the Marquis could prevail with none to stand with him, but the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Brother, Colonel <hi>Butler</hi> and Colonel <hi>Grady,</hi> some write <hi>Miles Reylye,</hi> with which he charged the Enemy, wherein (Colonel <hi>Grady</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slain, and his Brother sore wounded and taken Prisoner) that Body was entirely broken; and from that time, it was not in his power, by all the means he could use, to rally any Party of Horse, and to make them
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93738:132"/>
so much as stand by him; so that (when he was environ'd by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, attended with very few of his own Servants, and two or three Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen) he was forced to make his way through them, and to quit the Field; when a small Body of Foot, under Colonel <hi>Gifford</hi> (which still kept the ground, and valiantly defended themselves) finding that they were deserted by their Horse, were compelled to surrender their Arms to <hi>Jones;</hi> the Lord <hi>Taaff</hi> making his own way so prosperously, that he got to the North-side, where he found that Body (composed of the Lord <hi>Dillons,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrongs,</hi> the Lord <hi>Moores,</hi> and Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Purdons</hi> Regiments of Horse; Colonel <hi>Warrens,</hi> Colonel <hi>Walles;</hi> and Colonel <hi>Mich. Byrns</hi> Regiments of Foot) which had been left at <hi>Finglass</hi> in Arms, and which had not seen the Enemy that day; upon which, the Lord <hi>Taaff</hi> us'd all possible endeavours to perswade them to attempt a Recovery of what was lost, which, in so great disorder of the Enemy (which such success usually produceth) was not reasonably to be despaired of: But the apprehension, jealousies, fright and terrour, was so universal, that he could not incline them to it, nor to do more than (and that in great confusion) to provide for their own security: Whilst the Marquis directed his Letters to them, ordering therein the one half of them to go to <hi>Tredath,</hi> and the other half to <hi>Trym,</hi> for the security of those Places, whilst himself went to <hi>Kilkenny</hi> to rally what he could of the Army, and to raise what new Forces he should be able. This was the unhappy, and indeed fatal Defeat at <hi>Rathmines,</hi> by the Bishops at <hi>Jamestown,</hi> 1650, thought so improvident and unfortunate, as nothing happen'd in Christianity more shameful. Yet in his Excellencies Letter from <hi>Kilcolgan</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1650. to the Assembly at <hi>Loghreogh</hi> so Answer'd, as hitherto no Reply hath been attempted. The news of which, and the consequences thereof, was receiv'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd (writes <hi>Walsh, fol.</hi> 583.) with much gladness and excess of ioy in <hi>Rome,</hi> as that which made for the <hi>Nuncio's</hi> Party. It was the first and onely loss that fell upon any Army or Party of which the Marquis had the Name and Title, (and here he had no more than the name) of the Supreme Commander, and these the whole Circumstances of it. In this Battel were slain on the place, and in the Chace, about 4000. and 2517 taken Prisoners, and two whole Cannon, three Demi-cannon, one long square Gun carrying a Ball of 12 Pound, one Saker-drake, one Mortar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, all these Brass; besides 200 Draught-Oxen for the Train, and the richest Camp of Commodities an Enemy could well be Master of. But not to speak further of the sad misfortune of this great Commander, than whom, no man was more justly magnified for his Courage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in for his Loyalty, relyed on for his Wisdom, trusted in for his Care to prevent ill Accidents, and Dexterity to take advantages; he was indeed looked upon as the Restaurator of his Countrey, and as the onely Person, by whose management of the <hi>Irish</hi> War, the injur'd King was like to arise out of his Fathers ruines to the Glory and Greatness he was born to; though upon this Defeat, those (whose Crimes were no otherwise to be veil'd than by this misfortune) cast the miscarriage thereof solely upon him; a Fate incident to great Men, to be extremely magnifi'd on Success, and upon any notable Disaster to be as much depress'd, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure neither justly.</p>

               <p>When the Marquis (as we have said before) found the Consternation<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant from <hi>Rathmines</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires to <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny.</hi>

as in so short a time could be done, and got as much Provision into the Town as was possible; and then with a full approbation of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, he made choice of Sir <hi>Arthur Aston,</hi> a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and a Soldier of very great Experience and Reputation, (one at <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> formerly confided in by his Majesty, a Gentleman of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and yet flourishing Family in <hi>Cheshire</hi>) to be Governour thereof, and put a Garrison into it of 2000 Foot, and a good Regiment of Horse, all choice Men, and good Soldiers, with very many Gentlemen and Officers of good Name and Account, and supplied it with Ammunition and all other Provisions, as well as the Governour himself desired; and having done so, he marched with his Horse and small remainder of Foot to <hi>Trim,</hi> from whence he had sent to the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> to bring up as many Men to <hi>Tecroghan</hi> the Rendezvous as he could out of <hi>Munster;</hi> now the apprehension of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Landing there was over, and endeavour'd from all parts to recruit his Army, hoping (that before the Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians could be able to reduce any of his Garrisons) he might be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to take the Field.</p>
               <p>The <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> 1649. the Commons assembled in Parliament set forth a Declaration, declaring all Persons who had served the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had betrayed their Trust, or adhered to, or aided and assisted his late Majesty, or his Son, to be <hi>Traitors</hi> and <hi>Rebels,</hi> and accordingly to be proceeded against by a Court-Marshal; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by some were Sentenc'd, others sent into <hi>England,</hi> some Imprison'd there, and many disbanded, though they had serv'd against the Rebels from the first Discovery.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>August, Cromwel</hi> marched out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> (having setled the Affairs of that City, Civil and Military, instituting Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones</hi> Governour in his absence) with an Army of 9 or 10000 Men, (chosen out of the General Muster, where appear'd a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Body of 15000 Horse and Foot) came before <hi>Tredath, Monday</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>September;</hi> of which the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> was no sooner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiz'd, than he came to <hi>Trim,</hi> to watch all opportunities to infest the Enemies Quarters; and having full confidence in the Town, and in the Experience of Sir <hi>Arthur Aston,</hi> (who had sent him several Advices to precipitate nothing, for that he doubted not to find <hi>Cromwel</hi> play a while) the goodness and number of the Garrison being such, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> would not be able to get the Town by any Assault: But here again he found his expectations disappointed, for the Enemy resolv'd not to lose their time in a Siege; and therefore as soon as they had sent their Summons the <hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> and it was rejected, they made a Breach the next day with their Cannon, and storm'd the Place; and though they were for some time stoutly resisted, and twice beaten off, yet at the third Onset<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cromwel</hi> gains <hi>Tredath</hi> by Storm, &amp;c.</note> (led by <hi>Cromwel</hi>) they enter'd, and pursu'd their Victory with so much cruelty, that they put the whole Garrison in Arms to the Sword, not sparing those upon second thoughts, to whom (in the heat of the Action) some of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s under-Officers promised and gave Quarter; a crime, writes one (then in the Action) themselves were most guilty of, they again resuming Arms when they had engaged to lay them down: So that, except some few who (during the time of the Assault) escaped at the other side of the Town, and others, who mingling with the Rebels as their own men, disguised themselves, that they were not discovered, there was not an Officer, Soldier, or Religious Person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93738:134"/>
to that Garrison left alive, besides those (after Decimation) sent to <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> and all this within the space of nine days after the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my appear'd before the Walls; and when very many Royalists as well as <hi>Irish</hi> were glad that they were engaged before the Place, that was likely to be so well defended, and to stop their further progress for that season of the year.</p>
               <p>This indeed was a much greater Blow than that at <hi>Rathmines,</hi> and totally destroy'd and massacred a Body of near 3000 Men, with which, in respect of Experience, and Courage of the Officers, and Goodness and Fidelity of the common Men, the Marquis would have been glad to have found himself engaged in the Field with the Enemy, though upon some disadvantages: And he had not now left with him above 700 Horse and 1500 Foot, whereof some were of suspected Faith, and many new rais'd men: And though the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> was ready to march towards him with a good Party of Horse and Foot, and the Lord Viscount of <hi>Ardes</hi> with the like of <hi>Scots;</hi> yet he had neither Money to give them one days Pay, or Provision to keep them together for 24 hours: The Commissioners were either dispersed, or their Orders for collecting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney not executed or regarded; and when in those straits the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant issued out Warrants for raising of Men and Money, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of the breach of Articles of the Treaty, and talk'd amongst themselves of Treating with the Enemy. That which was most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliable, and which all men saw was fittest to be practised, was, to put all their Men into Garrisons, and thereby secure the most considerable Places, and therewithall (Winter now approaching) to have prosecuted their Levies, and by good Discipline and Exercise of their Men, recover their Spirits against the Spring: But this was not at all in the Marquis's power to do, he was restrained by the Articles of the Treaty from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any new Garrison, and from changing any old Governours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the approbation of the Commissioners; and he and the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners together had not credit and power enough with the Chief Cities and Incorporate Towns, which were most worth keeping, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently most like to be attempted by the Rebels, to force or perswade them to receive Garrisons. So <hi>Wexford, Waterford, Limerick</hi> and <hi>Gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> the most considerable Ports of the Kingdom, declared, they would admit of no Soldiers; nor indeed did they further obey any other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which were sent to them than they thought fit themselves. If this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal distemper and discomposure had not been discovered to be amongst them, it is not to be believed that <hi>Cromwel</hi> (what success soever he had met with) would have engaged his Army, which with being long at Sea, change of Air, and long Duty, was much weaken'd, and had contracted great sicknesses in the Sieges after the beginning of <hi>October;</hi> yet being encourag'd, and, in truth, drawn on by the knowledge of this humour and obstinacy of the <hi>Irish,</hi> against all Remedies that could preserve them, he withdrew his Forces from <hi>Tredagh,</hi> (having taken in first <hi>Trim, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalk, Carlingford, Newry,</hi> and other smaller Garrisons thereabouts) and return'd to <hi>Dublin,</hi> having sent Colonel <hi>Venables</hi> down with some Forces to oppose <hi>George Monro,</hi> (who had a good Strength with him) and to relieve <hi>London-derry,</hi> but was not able to keep the Field: In his March, he was set upon in his Quarters by Colonel <hi>Trevor,</hi> who had 5 or 600 Horse with him, and gave him a desperate Attack; but the morning appearing, he was beaten out by Captain <hi>Meredith</hi> and his Troop, who
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93738:134"/>
was appointed by Colonel <hi>Venables</hi> to charge him; this was upon his march towards <hi>Belfast,</hi> which was surrendred unto him upon Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the <hi>Scots:</hi> And while he was here, he sent out a Party under Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Conally,</hi> who was encountred as he march'd to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim</hi> by <hi>George Monro,</hi> and a good strength of Horse, and routed; <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> was there slain by Colonel <hi>John Hamilton.</hi> Such are the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Almighty, as he did not live to receive the fruit of so great service as he had done to that Kingdom, in discovering the Plot. <hi>Moses</hi> saw the good Land, but never entred.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Dublin Cromwel</hi> refresh'd his Soldiers a few days, and (intending to fish in troubled Waters) resolv'd presently to appear before <hi>Wexford;</hi> which the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> suspecting, (upon <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s return from <hi>Tredagh</hi> to <hi>Dublin</hi>) removed his Army from <hi>Castle Jordan</hi> down towards the Counties of <hi>Wexford</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> there not onely to lie secure till <hi>Owen O Neil</hi>'s Army should come up to him, (according to agreement, as you shall hereafter hear) but also ready to be drawn into either <hi>Wexford</hi> or <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> as there should be occasion. <hi>Cromwel</hi> (according to his resolution) the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> march'd from <hi>Dublin;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he march'd thence, (or presently after) he Cashiers the seven <hi>old Regiments</hi> which <hi>Jones</hi> had continued at <hi>Dublin,</hi> allowing the Colonels (for a little time) a small Pension, which he soon took off; though they were the first who (to that instant) had serv'd against the Rebels. And then he march'd towards <hi>Wexford</hi> through the County of <hi>Wickloe,</hi> (taking the People into protection, and not suffering the Soldiers in his Army to commit any spoil as he went, but to pay for all Provisions) in his march he took in several Castles and Garrisons, as <hi>Killingkerick, Arcklo, Little Limerick, Iniscorphen,</hi> alias <hi>Eniscorvy, Ferns Castle,</hi> and the Fort of <hi>Wexford</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Near <hi>Enis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corfy</hi> there was a Monastery of <hi>Franciscans,</hi> which, upon the approach of the Army, quitted the Place, and their Provisions very considerable.</note>; and the first of <hi>October</hi> with his Army he sate down before <hi>Wexford,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof appear'd willing (under Colonel <hi>David Synnot</hi> their Governour) to make defence, albeit they had too long neglected the means thereof, and were at last (when part of the Enemies Army was lodged within half-Musquet-shot of their Walls) contented to receive an assistance of Men from the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which (upon the first intimation) his Excellency hastned to them, of the choicest of those he had left, all Catholicks, (for that was still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon) under the Command of his Cousin Sir <hi>Edmond Butler,</hi> with near 1500 Men) who with some difficulty pass'd the River into<note place="margin">

                  </note> that part of the Town which the Parliaments Army could not infest; but he had not been two hours in the Town, before Captain <hi>James Stafford,</hi> Governour of the Castle (whom the Lord Lieutenant would have remov'd from that Charge, not as being unfit for it, but because he was a Catholick, and had exercised that Charge during the time that the Confederates were in Arms against the King) gave up that Place to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and took Conditions under him: <hi>Cromwel</hi> having thus gain'd the Castle, advanc'd his Flag upon the Castle, and turn'd the Guns against the Town; which the Townsmen perceiving, their hearts fail'd them, and the Soldiers in confusion quitted the Walls, not expecting the return of their Commissioners, who treating with <hi>Cromwel,</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the safety of the Inhabitants of the Town, and the preservation of it from Plunder, as leave for the Soldiers to depart every one to their own homes, (they engaging not to bear Arms any more against the State of <hi>England</hi>) and lastly, of life to the Officers. Yet in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93738:135"/>
(fear having surprized the Townsmen and Soldiers before their Commissioners return) they endeavour'd to pass over the Water for the safety of their lives: Which <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Soldiers perceiving, about 14. of <hi>October,</hi> presently clapt Scaling Ladders to the Walls, and entred the Town without any resistance, wherein all found in Arms were put to the Sword, to the number of 2000, amongst which was Sir <hi>Edmond Butler,</hi> endeavouring (when he discovered their Treachery) to escape, was killed, before he had been two hours in that City: <hi>Cromwel,</hi> in the interim not losing 20 men in the whole Siege, though (as you may see) Colonel <hi>David Synot,</hi> Governour of the Town and Castle of <hi>Wexford,</hi> had confidence by the Propositions he sent, (1.) That the Inhabitants of the Town should exercise (without disturbance) the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. (2.) Their Religious Orders and Priests should enjoy their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries and Churches. (3.) The Bishop <hi>Nicolus Ferns,</hi> and his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors should have their undisturb'd Jurisdiction of their Diocess. (4.)

Whosoever of the Inhabitants here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after should desire to depart the Town, should have what-ever was theirs with them. (6.) That all Free-men should have their Immunities and Liberties hitherto enjoyed, they adhering to the State of <hi>England.</hi> (7.) None to be disturb'd in their Possession. (8.)

That no memory remain of any Hostility or distance betwixt the Parliament and those that kept the Town and Castle. All which, <hi>Cromwel</hi> account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impudent, had no effect.</p>
               <p>From this Torrent of Success and Corruption, no body will wonder, That <hi>Cromwel</hi> march'd thence without control, and took in <hi>Ross,</hi> a strong Town situate upon the <hi>Barrow,</hi> and far more considerable for Navigation than <hi>Wexford,</hi> the River admitting a Ship of 7 or 800 Tun to ride by the Walls; of this Place Major General <hi>Lucas Taaff</hi> was Governour, who had with him a strong Garrison, re-enforced by 1500 Men, even in the fight of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Army, who (when he came before it) to save Blood, sent a Summons to the Town; which was answer'd suitable to his mind by the Governour: but the Great Guns sending in the next Summons, the Town was surrendred on condition the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> That they within should march away with Bag and Baggage. Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating for which, <hi>Taaff</hi> demanded Liberty of Conscience for such as should stay. To which <hi>Cromwel</hi> repli'd, That he medled not with any mans Conscience; but if by Liberty of Conscience was meant a Liberty to exercise the Mass, he judged it best to use plain dealing, and to let him know, where the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> had power, that will not be allowed.</p>
               <p>The Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> out of a too deep sense of the stupidity, nay<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant sought all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to fight <hi>Cromwel.</hi>
                  </note> madness and ingratitude of that People, (for whose Protection and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence he had embarqu'd himself, his Fortunes, and his Honour) and whose jealousie and fond obstinacy, made the work of their own preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation more difficult and impossible, than the Power of their Enemy could do, about this time desired nothing so much as an opportunity to fight <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and either to give some check to his swelling Fortune, or to perish (gloriously) in the action; and to that purpose drew all his
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:93738:135"/>
Friends to him, then about the <hi>Graige</hi> and <hi>Thomastown,</hi> with an intention to fight him, his Excellency's Army being exceedingly increas'd, by the conjunction of <hi>Inchiquin</hi>'s and <hi>Owen Roe</hi>'s Armies, had he not been divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a false Alarm of the Enemy's, being gone as far as <hi>Bennets-bridge</hi> towards <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> whereby he was drawn thither for the defence of that City, otherwise he had engaged them before their getting to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ross</hi> being now in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s possession, he caus'd a Bridge of Boats to be made (under protection of the Town) over the River <hi>Barrow,</hi> and the Army to sit down before <hi>Duncannon,</hi> a strong Fort commanded by Colonel <hi>Wogan;</hi> but the Place being so well provided of all Necessaries, it was judged convenient not to lose time about it. And presently after Colonel <hi>Abbot</hi> reduced <hi>Enisteoge</hi> (a little wall'd Town, about 5 miles from <hi>Ross</hi>) to the Parliaments obedience. And about the same time, Colonel <hi>Reynolds,</hi> with 12 Troops of Horse, and 3 of Dragoons, march'd toward <hi>Carrick,</hi> having divided his Men into two parts; whilst the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Carrick</hi> taken in.</note> were amused with the one Party, he enter'd a Gate with the other, taking the Place, and about 100 Prisoners, without the loss of one Man. But to look back.</p>
               <p>From the time that the Peace was concluded at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> the Lord Lieutenant well discerned the mischief he should sustain, by being to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide<note place="margin">The Means the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant took to reduce O <hi>Neal.</hi>
                  </note> against the Attempts of General <hi>Owen O Neal,</hi> as well as against the <hi>English</hi> Forces, and that at least he could hope for no assistance from the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ulster,</hi> as long as they fear'd him. And therefore he sent <hi>Daniel O Neal,</hi> Nephew to the General, to perswade him to be included in the same Peace; but he was so un-satisfied with the Assembly, that he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he would have nothing to do with them, or be comprehended in any Peace they should make: But if the Marquess would consent to some Conditions he propos'd, he would willingly submit to the King's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in him. The Marquess was content to grant him his own Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, having indeed a great esteem of his Conduct, and knowing the Army under his Command to be better disciplined, than any other of the <hi>Irish.</hi> But the Commissioners of Trust would by no means consent to those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,<note place="margin">The Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of Trust dissent from the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> whereby it is evident, (though these would be thought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Marquess) that they had alien thoughts to his Majesty's Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and declared, if the Lord Lieutenant should proceed thereupon to an Agreement, it would be a direct breach of the Articles of Peace. And thereupon <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> made that Conjunction with <hi>Monk,</hi> as is before spoken of, and, about the very time of the Defeat at <hi>Rathmines,</hi> relieved Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> in <hi>London-derry,</hi> and thereby kept the King, from being entirely possessed of the Province of <hi>Ulster,</hi> which, but for that Action, would have been able to have sent strong Supplies of Men and Provisions, to the assistance of the Marquess. And it is well known, that while the Lord Lieutenant was in a hopeful condition to prevail against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Commissioners of Trust, and the principal Persons of Interest, had no mind to agree with General <hi>O Neal,</hi> out of animosity to his Person and Parts, and in confidence that the Work would be done without him: And others, who were of his Party, had as little mind that he should be drawn into a Conjunction with the Marquess, because they knew, if he was once engaged under him, they should no more be able to seduce him, to joyn with them in any Actions of Sedition. And upon these Reasons, the Persons, who were deputed by the Commissioners to treat with him,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93738:136"/>
and were known to have an Interest in him, on the one side perswaded <hi>Owen O Neal,</hi> that the Lord Lieutenant had broken the Articles of Peace, and that he could have no security, that what should be promised, should be performed to him; and on the other side informed the Marquess, that <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> insisted on such extravagant Propositions, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of Trust would never yield to them. But after the Arrival of <hi>Cromwel</hi> &amp; his success against <hi>Tredagh,</hi> the Commissioners of Trust thought it high time to unite to him: And <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> himself discerned, how unsafe he should be, by the prevailing of the <hi>English</hi> Party, who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the signal Service perform'd by him to them, had publickly dis-avowed the Agreement which their Officers had made with him. And thereupon, by the Interposition of Colonel <hi>Daniel O Neal,</hi> (at that time Governour of <hi>Trim</hi>) all Particulars were agreed betwixt the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and him, the 12th. of <hi>October,</hi> 1649. with the Consent of the Commissioners of Trust; the management of which was committed to Sir <hi>Nicholas Plunket</hi> Knight, and Sir <hi>Richard Barnwel</hi> Baronet, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd by the Lord Lieutenant, to conclude with General <hi>Owen O Neal,</hi> for whom there was the Bishop of <hi>Clogher,</hi> and <hi>Tirlagh O Boyle,</hi> who agreed in 18 Articles, about the time <hi>Cromwel</hi> was before <hi>Wexford:</hi> Insomuch that he promised to bring his Army within a few days, and joyn with the Lord Lieutenant, which (though himself lived not to accomplish, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Cloughoter</hi>-Castle, in the County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> about the beginning of<note place="margin">O <hi>Neal</hi> dies.</note> 
                  <hi>December</hi>) was shortly after performed. So that about the time that <hi>Wexford</hi> was taken, the Lord Lieutenant was not without hope, by the advantage of a Pass, and by cutting off his Provisions, to have made <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> return to <hi>Dublin</hi> very hard, without losing a good part of his Army; when on a sudden, and all together, all the considerable Places in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Munster,</hi> as <hi>Cork, Toughal, Kinsale, Bandonbridge, Moyallo,</hi> and other Garrisons, revolted to the Parliament, and thereby gave them a<note place="margin">The Garrisons in <hi>Munster</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> safe Retreat, and free Passage, and necessary Provisions of all that they wanted, and Harbours for Ships, to bring all to them that they could desire.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> being so totally betrayed by those Officers whom he trusted most, and had most obliged, and (that after he had in vain tryed to reduce them by force) he could not, without much difficulty, obtain the liberty and re-delivery of his Wife and Children to him, which when he had procur'd, he fled for safety into <hi>Thomond,</hi> to his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
               <p>This Defection, in so fatal a Juncture of time, (when the straits <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> was in, by the Winter, and want of Provisions, had rais'd the Spirits of all Men, and when they looked upon themselves, as like to have at<note place="margin">The Revolt of the <hi>Munster</hi> Garrisons begot a Jealousie in the <hi>Irish</hi> Army.</note> least some hopeful Encounter with him) was not a loss, or a blow, but a dissolution of the whole Frame of their Hopes and Designs, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a Spirit of Jealousie and Animosity in the Army, which no Dexterity or Interest of the Lord Lieutenant could extinguish or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.</p>
               <p>From the first hour of the Peace, the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> had not been without that prejudice towards each other, as gave the Marquess much trouble, and they were rather incorporated by their obedience and submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to the Authority and Pleasure of their chief Commander, than uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the same Inclinations and Affections, to any publick End. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as before the Defeat at <hi>Rathmines,</hi> there were many of the <hi>Irish,</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:93738:136"/>
who much fear'd the swift success of the Army, and apprehended, the Lord Lieutenant's speedy reducing of <hi>Dublin,</hi> would give him such Power, and make him more absolute, than they desired to see him, and therefore were not sorry for that Mischief. On the other side, the <hi>English</hi> were much troubled, to see the Authority and Jurisdiction of the Marquess so restrain'd and limited by the Articles, and that the Army was neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited, disciplined, nor provided, as it ought to be, solely by his want of Power; and they had a very low opinion of the Spirit and Courage of the <hi>Irish.</hi> But now upon this Defection in <hi>Munster,</hi> there was a Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all Confidence and Trust in each other; the <hi>Irish</hi> declaring, <hi>That they suspected all the</hi> English <hi>Nation, and made the Treachery of those, who so infamously had betrayed their Trust, an unreasonable Argument for jealousie, of those who remain'd in the Army, who being a handful of gallant Men, and of most un-shaken Fidelity to the King, were indeed, in respect of their Courage and Experience in the War, the Party to be principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon in any Action or Encounter, and of which the Enemy had only an apprehension.</hi>

However, since there was no other way to preserve them, the Lord Lieutenant was content to comply even with
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:93738:137"/>
that Humour; and so choosing a strong Party of near 1500 Men, and putting them under the Command of Lieutenant General <hi>Farral,</hi> who was the most acceptable to them, his Excellency himself march'd with them, and put them into the Town; which he had no sooner done, than <hi>Cromwel</hi> thought it convenient to raise his Siege, (having taken in <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage-Fort,</hi>

Whilst the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> (sensible of what might be the product of so un-controul'd a Success, having left <hi>Waterford,</hi> in his thoughts full of the sence of the late benefit and preservation, which, by his vigilance, that City had receiv'd) in <hi>December,</hi> (a season much colder than usually had been observ'd in that Countrey) cast all ways imaginable to hinder the Enemy's future Attempt upon that Place, and to reduce <hi>Passage, Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and other Places, weakly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mann'd and provided by <hi>Cromwel.</hi> And accordingly he drew his Forces together, and, leaving them on the other<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to impede <hi>Cromwel.</hi>
                  </note> side of the River <hi>Sure,</hi> himself with a Train only of 40 or 50 Horse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of his Friends and Servants, went into the Town, presuming he should be able to perswade them to submit to joyn, in whatsoever should manifestly appear for their own benefit or advantage. When he came into the Town, he found Lieutenant General <hi>Farral</hi> engaged in a Design to take <hi>Passage,</hi> a Place seized on by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> when he had retir'd from <hi>Waterford,</hi> and which was an in-convenient Neighbour to that City. Colonel <hi>Wogan</hi> (who had been seasonably sent by the Marquess into <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cannon,</hi> even when the first Governour placed thereby the Confederate Catholicks, was ready to deliver it up to the Enemy, and who had with notable courage defended it against <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and in the end, after the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93738:137"/>
loss of a great number of his Men, compell'd him to retire) had agreed to meet Lieutenant General <hi>Farral,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Ulster</hi> Forces, at a Place and House appointed, and together to fall on <hi>Passage.</hi> Though the Marquess had not been informed of the contrivance of the Design, yet he knew well enough, what interpretation would be made of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, or Command, or Wariness, should he declare against it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was very willing it should proceed: The Matter was well laid, and carried with secrecy, being hopeful enough. Lieutenant General <hi>Farral</hi> had not been march'd from the Town many hours, when the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess discovered (from some Place of prospect in the Town) a strong Party of Horse, marching in good order, the way that led to <hi>Passage,</hi> which belonging to the Enemy, made him conclude, that they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Design. Whereupon he presently sent for the Maior of the Town, and shewing him the in-evitable danger their whole Party was in, (which was the only Srength against any Enterprize of the Enemy) if they were not instantly reliev'd, required him presently to send some Body over the Water, for the transporting (from the other side of the River) of a Regiment or two of Horse, with which he would himself endeavour to rescue them. How apparent soever the danger and mischief was, and how visible and natural soever the remedy, all the Commands and Entreaties he could use, could not prevail to get one Body, or their Consent, that any of his Horse should be suffered to march through the Town, without which they could not go to their Relief. When he had in vain tryed all the means he could invent, to convince and perswade them to so natural an Action, he caused all his Friends and Servants afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd,<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's gallant Attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Party that went to take in <hi>Passage.</hi>
                  </note> to mount their Horses, and with all imaginable haste himself led them towards <hi>Passage,</hi> that he might at least discover (though he was not like to prevent) the loss that was to ensue. When he came within sight of the Town, he could discern a Party of Foot, marching in great haste and disorder towards him, being pursued by the Enemy's Horse, who had even over-taken them, having fallen upon the remainder, and either killed them upon the Place, or taken them Prisoners. Though the company which attended the Marquess, was too few to encounter the Enemy's Horse, with any considerable hope, yet he drew them up in that manner, on the side of an Hill, that the Enemy imagining their number to be more considerable, thought fit to lessen their pace, and to send small Parties to discover them; which being again entertain'd by the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in like skirmishes, the Foot as much improving their March, they were in the end (by the Marquess's frequent opposing of his own Person, to retard the Enemy's pursuit) preserv'd; and so brought back with him into the Town, about half of those who had march'd thence, (the rest being killed or taken Prisoners by Colonel <hi>Zanckey</hi>) which also had been infallibly destroyed, if the Marquess had not taken that desperate course to redeem them, as he might in hope have recovered all the others, who were made Prisoners, and defeated all that Body of the Enemy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently have taken <hi>Passage,</hi> if the City would have permitted his Horse to have been transported over the River, and to have march'd through it.<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and good Service done by Colonel <hi>Milo Power.</hi>
                  </note> His Excellency's Forces had not better success in their Attempt to re-take <hi>Carrick,</hi> (governed by Colonel <hi>Reynolds</hi>) meerly through the want of Pick-axes and Spaces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though his confidence of the Design, (built on the brittle assurance of his Commanders) had brought him almost thither, where (if it had not been for Colonel <hi>Milo Power,</hi> who acquainted him
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93738:138"/>
of his Armies being baffled, and of its removal thence) he had been sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by the Enemy. And the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi>'s, Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Trevor</hi>'s, Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi>'s Expeditions against <hi>Wexford</hi> and <hi>Ross,</hi> ended in the like loss and misfortune. The Marquess however leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing un-attempted to fortifie <hi>Waterford,</hi> what dis-couragements soever he had received by the Insolency of some Men, instigated by the Violence and Opiniastrise of the Clergy; In as much as he knew, <hi>Passage</hi> or the other Places could not be regain'd, without he might bring his Army over the River, which they would not admit of, nay! desiring that his Army might for a little time be but hutted under their Walls, where they should receive their Provisions and Pay, duely out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and so should be a Security and Benefit to the Town, without the least damage in any Degree. This Proposition also found no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard then the former, and instead of consulting, with what Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to comply with so just and necessary a Demand of the Kings<note place="margin">The Treachery of <hi>Waterford</hi> against the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> Lieutenant, it was proposed in the Council of the Town, <hi>To seize on his Person, and to fall on all who belonged to him, as an Enemy;</hi> Which Advice met with no other Reprehension, then that for the present, the major part did not consent unto it. Of all which, when the Marquess was fully informed, he thought it time to depart thence, and to leave them to their own Imaginations; and so marched away with his Army, which after this Indignity, it was a thing impossible to keep them together; And (because the Principal Towns refused to admit them in) he was fain in the depth of Winter, to scatter them over all the Kingdom. The greatest part of the <hi>Ulster</hi> Forces were sent into their own Province, there to chuse a new General, according as their Conditions allowed them; for <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> was dead; And <hi>Luke Taaff</hi> with his Men, were sent back into <hi>Connaght,</hi> to my Lord of <hi>Clanrickard;</hi> The Lord <hi>Inchequin,</hi> with the remainder of such as belonged unto him, went over into the County of <hi>Clare;</hi> The Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> with his, into <hi>Meath,</hi> and towards <hi>Athlone;</hi> all the rest were scattered several ways; Onely Major General <hi>Hugh O Neal,</hi> was admitted with 1600 <hi>Ulster</hi> Men into <hi>Clonmel,</hi> as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, whilst the Marquess went to his Castle of <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> From<note place="margin">His Account of the State of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the King.</note> thence he dispatch'd the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> an Account to the King, (who was then in the Isle of <hi>Jersey</hi>) of the true Estate of his Affairs in that Kingdom; By which his Majesty might see, how much <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Forces, who disclaimed any Subjection to him, prevail'd against his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; And how it was equally contemned, deluded, or dis-regarded by his Subjects, who made all the Professions of Obedience and Duty to him; which was a Method, these ill times had made his Majesty too well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. And from this time, which was towards the end of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> 1649. the Marquess never did, or could draw together into one Body, a number of 500. what endeavours he used to do it, will be mention'd in order hereafter.</p>
               <p>Assoon as the Lord Lieutenant came to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> he consulted with the Commissioners of Trust, without whose approbation and consent he could do no act, that was of importance; what remedy to apply to the disorder and confusion, which spread it self over all their Affairs; they had been still Witnesses of all his actions, of his unwearied pains and industry, and of the little fruit that was reaped by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how his Orders and Commands, and their own, had been neglected and dis-obeyed in all those Particulars, without which an Army could not be brought or kept together; how
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93738:138"/>
those places which the Rebels had possessed themselves of, had been for the most part lost by their own obstinate refusal, to receive such assistance from him, as was absolutely necessary for their preservation; and yet that they had rais'd most unreasonable Imputations and Reproaches on him, as if he had fail'd in their Defence and Relief. They had seen the wonderful, and even insupportable wants and necessities the Army had always undergone; and knew very well how all Warrants had been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed for the bringing in of Money and Provisions, for the supply thereof. And yet their Countrey was full of clamour and discontent, for the payment of Taxes, and being exhausted with Contribution; He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired them therefore, to examine where any mis-demeanors had in truth been, and that they might be punished; and from whence the Scandal and Calumnies proceeded, that the minds of the People might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and composed. The Commissioners for the most part had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the Trust reposed in them; yet there were some amongst them, (too able and dexterous in Business) who alway malign'd the Person of the Marquess, or rather his Religion, and the Authority he represented; And what professions soever, they made of respect to him, still main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a close Intelligence and Correspondence with those of the Clergy,<note place="margin">The Clergy, the Fomentors of all mis-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits against the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant.</note> who were the most dis-affected to his Majesties Interest; and who from the misfortune at <hi>Rathmines,</hi> had under-hand fomented and cherish'd all the ill humours and jealousies of the People. The Commissioners advised the Marquess, as the best expedient to satisfie the Countrey; that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders might be sent to them, to elect some few Persons amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to send to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> as Agents, to represent those Grievances which<note place="margin">His desire to clear their sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, being (by their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders onely) met at <hi>Kilkenny.</hi>
                  </note> were most heavy upon them, and to offer any desires which might promote their security, alledging, that they could by this means be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform'd, how groundless those jealousies were, and the Artifices would be discover'd, which had been used to corrupt their affections: though the Marquess well saw how tedious and inconvenient this course might prove, and rather advance all the scandalous and seditious Designs, then suppress them; Yet he fore-saw as well, that if it were declin'd by him, he should be un-avoidably reproach'd, with not being willing to be informed of the just Grievances of the People, and consequently not to remedy them; And therefore without giving countenance to any such irregular Convention, by any formal summons of his own, he gave way that the Commissioners should write their Letters to that purpose, and accordingly the Agents did come thither from the several Countreys, to communicate and present their Complaints and Desires together, in <hi>January</hi> following; And the Lord Lieutenant received them with good Countenance, and wished them freely to consult together as soon as they could, to present whatsomever they had to say to him; to which, they should be sure to receive a speedy Answer.</p>
               <p>About which time, Colonel <hi>Barry</hi> (who through the whole Scene had been intrusted by the Supream Council, to negotiate with the King, and was not ill thought of by the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi>) had then licence from <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to visit his Wife and Family at <hi>Castlelions,</hi> under the Parliaments obedience, where he transacted (through the Mediation of a noble Person) many Concerns, to the composing of Differencies with the greatest; though what tended to an Agreement with <hi>Inchequin,</hi> would never in the least be indulged; and the rest then spoke of had a fate, not seasonably to be composed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:93738:139"/>In the mean time, the Bishops and Clergy of themselves, and without any Authority, received or desired from the Lord Lieutenant, Assembled at <hi>Cloanmacnoise,</hi> upon the River <hi>Shannon,</hi> upon whose Councils and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,<note place="margin">The Clergies Assembly at <hi>Cloanmacnoise,</hi> whence they intitle their Merits.</note> all mens eyes were more fixed, then upon what the Agents should represent at <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> it being very evident, that many of the Catholick Noblity of the Kingdom, and some principal Persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Interest, formally concurred with the Marquess; And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of Trust, were for the most part, as zealous for the execution and observation of the Articles of Peace, and that the same might be rendred useful to the Nation: Yet the Clergy and Religious Persons, had found means to obstruct that Union, which was necessary for the carrying on the Work; and especially had that influence upon the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate Towns, that no Garrisons would be admitted therein, or such Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission paid to the Lord Lieutenant, or the Commissioners Orders, as were essential to their own defence, and to the making War against the Enemy; So that all men were in suspence, what would be the issue of that Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And it cannot be denied, but that those Bishops, and that part of the Clergy which were best affected, and knew the ways which were most conducing to the happiness of their Countrey, prevail'd so far, that the Conclusions which were made there, seem'd full of respect for the Kings Service, and wholsom Advice and Council to the People; <hi>They declared how vain a thing it was, to imagine that there would be any security for the exercise of their Religion, for the enjoying of their Fortunes, or for the preservation of their Lives, by any Treaty with, or Promise from the Parliament. That they abhorred all factious Animosities, and Divisions, which raged amongst themselves, to the hindrance of the Publick Service; And therefore enjoyn'd all the Clergy, of what Quality soever, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Persons, by Preaching, and all other means, to incline the People unto an union of Affection; and to the laying aside of all jealousies of each other, and unanimously to concur in opposing the Common Enemy; And ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Bishops and other Persons, to proceed with greater severity against those Religious and Spiritual Persons, who should under-hand cherish and foment those Jealousies and Divisions.</hi> In a word, they said so much, and so well, that when the Lord Lieutenant was informed of it, and when he saw the Extract of their Determinations, he conceiv'd some hope, that it might indeed make good Impression on the People, and produce a very good effect: The Particulars of which here follows.

them in that their ungrounded expectation, We do hereby Declare as a most certain Truth, that the Enemies Resolution is, to extirpate the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, out of all his Majesties Dominions, as by their several Covenants doth appear, and the Practice where-ever their Power doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, as is manifested by <hi>Cromwel's</hi> Letter of the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>Octob. 1649.</hi> to the then Governor of <hi>Ross.</hi> His words are: <hi>For that which you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning Liberty of Religion, I meddle not with any man's Conscience, but if by Liberty of Conscience, you mean a Liberty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the Mass, I judge it best to use plain dealing, and to let you know, where the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>have Power, that will not be allowed of.</hi> This Tyrannical Resolution they have put in execution in <hi>Wexford, Drogheda, Ross,</hi> and elsewhere. And it is notoriously known, that by Acts of Parliament, called, <hi>The Acts of Subscription,</hi> the Estates of the Inhabitants of this Kingdom are sold, so as there remaineth now <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>

                                 <p>And in effect this banishment, or other destructions of the common People, must follow the Resolution of extirpating the Catholick Religion, which is not to be effected, without the Massacring or Banishment of the Catholick Inhabitants.</p>
                                 <p>We cannot therefore in our Duty to God, and in discharge of the Care we are obliged to have, for the preservation of our Flocks, but admonish them, not to delude and lose themselves with the vain expectation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to be had from that merciless Enemy. And consequently we beseech the Gentry, and Inhabitants, for Gods glory, and their own safety, to the uttermost of their Power, to Contribute with patience, to the support of the War against that Enemy, in hope that by the blessing of God, they may be rescued from the threatned Evils, and in time be permitted to serve God in their Native Countrey, and enjoy their Estates, and fruits of their Labours, free from such heavy Levies, or any other such Taxes, as they bear at present: Admonishing also, those that are in-listed of the Army, to prosecute constantly according to each mans charge, the Trust reposed in them, the opposition of the Common Enemy, in so just a War, as is that they have undertaken for their Religion, King, and Countrey, as they expect the blessing of God to fall on their Actions. And that to avoid Gods heavy judgment, and the indignation of their Native Countrey, they neither plunder nor oppress the People, nor suffer any under their charge, to commit any extortion or oppression, so far as shall lye in their power to prevent.</p>

               <p>But the People weary of the War, the Plague encreasing, and ill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to endure those Extreamities, <hi>Cromwel</hi> forced daily upon them, they flocked from all Places unto him, and liv'd under Contribution, whilst the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> finding it in vain, to qualifie the Discontents at <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny,</hi> went about the end of <hi>Christmas</hi> to the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickards,</hi> in <hi>Connaght,</hi> who consulting together, found nothing effectual to compose the differences, the Clergy still irritated amongst them; whereupon his Excellency returned to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where the Agents spent some time in preparing Heads of such Grievances, as they thought fit to present to the Lord Lieutenant, who called still upon them to dispatch; But (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Conference with the gravest of the Commissioners) they found how groundless all those Slanders were, which they had believ'd before they came thither, and so could not agree of any Particular to complain of; Besides they met with some Disturbance there, for <hi>Cromwel</hi> (well knowing how the Marquess'<hi>s</hi> small Forces were scattered abroad) march'd with a strong Party towards that Town; with which the Agents were so alarm'd, that they would stay no longer there, but desired the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> to let them adjourn to <hi>Juni,</hi> in the County of <hi>Clare,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Deputies of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties adjourn to <hi>Juni.</hi>
                  </note> which they did; and though they met there, yet they never agreed of any draught of Grievances to be presented, though they made ill use of their Meeeting, to propagate the Scandals and Imputations which had been groundlessly rais'd, and to inflame the People with the same untruths; Notwithstanding this Alarm and Danger the Lord Lieutenants Person, and the City were really in, all the Power and Authority he had, could not in ten days draw 500 Men together, to resist the Enemy; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Townsmen appeared ready, and prepared for their defence, and the Marquess putting all his own Friends and Servants on Horseback, with which (making a Troop of about 100) he look'd with so good a Countenance upon the Enemy, that he retir'd; And shortly after the Lord Lieutenant committed the Charge of the Place, and the Countrey adjacent, to the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven;</hi> and went himself upon a more important Business to <hi>Limerick.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> (having continued in his Winter Quarters in <hi>Munster</hi> scarce two months) finding the Weather prove very favourable in the end of <hi>February,</hi> his Soldiers much recovered from the Distempers, which the change of Air had caused in them at their first coming over, marched out with a Body of 3000 Horse and Foot, and (having receiv'd all necessary Supplies from <hi>England</hi>) divided his Forces into two Parties, the one he led, the other was committed to <hi>Ireton</hi>'s care, who march'd away to <hi>Carrick,</hi> there to re-inforce himself by the conjunction of Colonel <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1650.</note> These Forces were to march into the Enemies Quarters two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways, (the better to amuse the Enemy) and to meet together at a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93738:142"/>
Rendezvous near <hi>Kilkenny. Cromwel</hi> in his March took in <hi>Cahir-Castle, Kiltenan, Goldenbridge, Clogheen,</hi> and <hi>Roghil</hi> Castles, and seating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self before <hi>Callan,</hi> joyn'd with the other part of the Army under <hi>Ireton,</hi> enforced by the addition of the Forces under Colonel <hi>Reynolds</hi> and Colonel <hi>Zanckey,</hi> which, in their way, had took in <hi>Arkenon, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drum, Knoctover, Bullinard,</hi> and other Castles. The Forces being joyn'd, <hi>Callan, Cashel, Featherd, Graige,</hi> and <hi>St. Thomastown,</hi> with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Garrisons thereabouts, were easily subdued: And <hi>Cromwel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to besiege <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> (knowing it was strong) sent for <hi>Huson</hi> (Governour of <hi>Dublin</hi>) to march speedily to him with all the Forces he could conveniently draw together; which he did, and (by the way ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in <hi>Ballisannon, Kildare, Leighlin,</hi> and other Places) joyns with <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Army near <hi>Goram,</hi> which was presently taken: From hence <hi>Cromwel</hi> with his Army, consisting of 16000 Foot and 6000 Horse, marches against <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> upon whose approach, the General Assembly fled to <hi>Athlon,</hi> and from whence the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi> was drawn out with his Forces, by reason the Sickness raged so, having left Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar Butler</hi> and Major <hi>Walsh,</hi> with about 50 Horse and 400 Foot to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Place; where a Breach being made, and assaulted by <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Soldiers, they were beaten back with the loss of some Men, and about 600 Arms; though he had it surrendred to him shortly after upon these terms: 1. To deliver up the City and Castle to him, (<hi>viz. Cromwel</hi>) with all the Arms, Ammunition, and publick Store. 2. That the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants should be protected in their Persons, Goods, and Estates, from the violence of the Soldiery, and they that would remove, to have three months after the date of the Articles. 3. That the Governours, Officers, and Soldiers might march away with their Bag and Baggage. 4. That the City should pay 2000 pounds to <hi>Cromwel.</hi> From hence <hi>Cromwel</hi> (having well refresh'd his Army after the Siege of <hi>Kilkenny</hi>) approaches <hi>Clonmel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Clonmel.</hi>
                  </note> Garrison'd by 2000 Foot and 120 Horse, under the Command of <hi>Hugh O Neal,</hi> who behav'd himself so discreetly and gallantly in its defence, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> lost near 2500 men before it, and had gone away without it, had not the Powder been spent, which forced the Governour and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the night to forsake the Town, and go to <hi>Waterford,</hi> leaving the Townsmen to make Conditions for themselves; which they did, as to the safeguard of their Lives and Estates. Whilst these things were agitating, the Lord Lieutenant, the Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard, Castlehaven,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Clougher,</hi> held a Council at <hi>Baltimore</hi> in <hi>West-Meath,</hi> to consult the security of the Nation; which <hi>Cromwel</hi> hearing of, sent Colonel <hi>Reynolds</hi> and Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones,</hi> with 2500 Horse, Foot, and Dragoons, against them, with which they dispersed them, and those Forces which the Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi> had brought out of <hi>Connaght</hi> to the Relief of <hi>Tecrogham,</hi> (within 20 miles of <hi>Dublin</hi>) and being joyn'd with the <hi>Dublin</hi> Forces, took in <hi>Trim, Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huse, Finagh,</hi> and other Places. In the time that <hi>Clonmel</hi> was Besieged, the Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> with 4000 Foot and 300 Horse endeavours its Relief, but is overcome by the Lord <hi>Broghil</hi> near <hi>Bandon-Bridge,</hi> and himself ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Prisoner, and hang'd in the sight of <hi>Caringdred;</hi> which Castle thereupon yielded to the Lord <hi>Broghil.</hi> In this Hurry, the Forces in <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> being (besides) much shaken by reason of several Interresses, the Nobility, Gentry, and Commanders for the King scattered a Declaration, that none who would submit to his Authority should suffer either in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93738:142"/>
Religion, or State; but it prevailed little. During the Leaguer of <hi>Clon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,</hi> absolute Orders were brought to <hi>Cromwel</hi> from the Parliament for his sudden return; as also two Expresses from the Council of State to that purpose, which (after the compleatment of that Siege) he fulfilled, leaving the Kingdom about the end of <hi>May,</hi> 1650. having made Colonel <hi>Ireton</hi> his Deputy.</p>
               <p>Here we cannot but take notice, that there were several Precepts by the Archbishop of <hi>Ardmagh</hi> and others, to pray for the success of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Forces; whilst <hi>Dominick Dempsy,</hi> a <hi>Franciscan,</hi> (esteem'd a grave and holy man, and therefore a leading Person) and <hi>Long</hi> the <hi>Jesuit,</hi> asserted, that (the King being out of the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Church) it was not lawful to pray for him particularly, or publickly in general on any other day than on <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> as comprehended amongst the Infidels, <hi>alias, Jews, Mahometans, Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and then for the Spiritual welfare of his Soul, not for his Temporal prosperity.</p>
               <p>Though the Parliamentarians, by the Faction and obstinacy of the <hi>Irish,</hi> who could not hitherto be induced to make reasonable provision for defence, had prevail'd far, and possessed themselves of many good Places without considerable opposition, yet there remain'd a good part of the Kingdom free from their Power; the whole Province of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght</hi> was still entire, and the Cities of <hi>Waterford, Limerick,</hi> and <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> in possession of the Catholicks, which might be made so strong, as not to fear any strength <hi>Ireton</hi> could bring before them, and are so situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for all advantages of Sea, that they might, being well supplied, maintain a War against the whole Kingdom: they had also the Forts of <hi>Duncannon</hi> and <hi>Sligo,</hi> as also the strong Castles of <hi>Caterlough, Athlone, Charlemont, Carlo,</hi> and <hi>Neanagh,</hi> from whence the Confederates might bring into the Field twice the number of Men which the Enemy had; so that there wanted onely Unity, Order, and Resolution to preserve themselves; to improve which, the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> resolved to begin with <hi>Limerick,</hi> and if he could have disposed that City unto a full obedience, and to receive a Garrison, he made no question not onely to fortifie it against any attempt of the Enemy, but under the countenance of it, and by the security of the River <hi>Shannon,</hi> to Quarter his Troops, raise Contribution for their support, Discipline his Men, and, in effect by the Spring so to recruit his Army, that he might not suspect to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against the Enemy where-ever he should engage: And to this purpose he went himself thither from <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> in <hi>January,</hi> hoping that the good resolution of the Bishops of <hi>Cloanmacnoise</hi> had well prepared the People to comply with him; but when he came thither, albeit he was receiv'd with outward demonstrations of respect, he found the temper not such as he desired, whatsoever the Bishops had declared; <hi>The Clergy had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served none of those Directions, nor were any in so much credit as they who behaved themselves quite contrary to those Determinations.</hi> And if no way could be found to allay this Spirit, all his endeavours he saw would be without any fruit: Hereupon he resolv'd to try, whether that part of the Clergy which wished well to the Kingdom, could use as efficacious means to preserve, as the other, who desired confusion, did to destroy it: And upon advice with the principal Persons of the Catholick Nobility, and with the Commissioners of Trust, he did by his Letters of the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>February,</hi> 1649. desire as many of the Catholick Bishops as were
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93738:143"/>
within convenient distance, to meet him at <hi>Limerick;</hi> which they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly did the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following.</p>

                  </gap>he Commissioners of Trust with all frankness, upon the distracted and disjoynted state of Affairs, and freely told them, <hi>That without the People would be brought to have a full confidence in him, and yield perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him; and without the City of</hi> Limerick <hi>might be perswaded to receive a Garrison, and obey his Orders, it was not to be hoped that he could be able to do any thing considerable against the Enemy: He desired them therefore, if they had a mist rust of him, or a dislike of his Government, that they would as clearly let him know it; assuring them, that such was his desire of the Peoples preservation, that there was nothing within his Power consistent with his Duty to the King, and agreeable with his Honour, that he would not do at their desires for that end: Withall letting them see, that his continuance with the Name, and not the Power of the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, could bring nothing but ruine upon the Nation, as well as dishonour on him.</hi> So that again he propounded to them in plain terms, <hi>Either that they would procure a due obedience to be yielded to him, or propose some other way by his quitting the Kingdom, how it might be preserved.</hi> After consultation together, they return'd with many expressions of respects and affection to his Person, and faithfully promis'd to endeavour all that obedience he desir'd; withall presenting (the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi>) to him <hi>a Paper of Advice, which contained,</hi> as they said, <hi>certain Remedies, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the discontents and disgusts of the People, and for the advancing of his Majesties Service:</hi> Amongst which they proposed, <hi>That a Privy Council might be framed by the Peers, and other of the Natives of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well Spiritual as Temporal, to sit daily with him, and determine all the weighty Affairs of the Countrey by their Council; and many other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, concerning the raising of Men, and conducting the War.</hi> To every one of which, his Excellency, from <hi>Limerick,</hi> gave them (sitting at <hi>Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reogh</hi>) an Answer in writing, amongst which he told them, <hi>That he could not understand how the present distresses of the Kingdom could proceed from the want of a Privy Council, or how the framing of such a Council could advantage the management of the War, which by the Articles of Peace was to be done by the Commissioners of Trust, with whom he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways communicate all matters of importance; and therefore he could not think it fit unnecessarily to presume upon doing a thing, for which he had neither Power nor President, the Nomination of all Persons to be of the Privy Council being always reserv'd by the King to himself: Yet rather than he should be wanting in any thing that was in his power to satisfie the People in, he wished, that the particular Acts which the Privy Council had heretofore done, and were now necessary to be done, might be instanced, and as far forth as should appear necessary and fit, he would qualifie Persons, free from just exceptions, with such.</hi> And so answer'd all their Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they seem'd to be well satisfi'd therewith; and thereupon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished a Declaration, (dated at <hi>Loghreogh</hi> the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1650.) in which they professed, <hi>That they did and would endeavour to root out of mens hearts all jealousies and finister opinions, conceiv'd either against his Excellency or the present Government; and that they intreated him to give them further Instructions, declaring that they were not deterr'd from the want of the expected Success in the Affairs of the Kingdom, but rather
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93738:143"/>
animated to give further Onsets, and to try all other possible ways; and did faithfully promise, that no Industry of Care should be wanting in them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and execute his Directions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Marquis first proposed to the Commissioners of Trust, that <hi>Limerick</hi> and other Places might be Garrison'd, he offer'd to them the names of three Persons of the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion, and of eminent Quality, Reputation, and Fortunes, that out of them they might choose one for the Command of <hi>Limerick:</hi> But resolving afterwards to call this Assembly of Bishops thither, and to be there himself in Person, he deferred the proceeding further in it, till then, that with their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice such a Person might be chosen for that important Charge, that should be beyond any possibility of a just exception from that Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now he took all imaginable pains, and descended to all the Arts of Perswasion to satisfie those Citizens, who, he perceived, were the most leading men, of the necessity of their speedy receiving a Governour and a Garrison, for the preservation of their Interest, and whatsoever could be of any value with any People: But he was so far from prevailing with them, <hi>That they perform'd not those outward Civilities and Respects</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Limerick</hi> so far from comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed not outward Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> 
                  <hi>to him, which had been in no other Place denied.</hi> The Officer who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the City Guards, neither came to him for Orders, or imparted them to him; no Officer of the Army, or any other Person, could, without special leave from the Mayor (which was often very hardly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd) be admitted to come to his presence, to receive his Commands and Directions for the resisting and opposing the Enemy, who at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time prevail'd in the County of <hi>Limerick:</hi> And to publish more the contempt they had of the Kings Authority, they committed to Prison the Lord Viscount <hi>Kilmallock,</hi> a Catholick Peer of the Realm, and an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the Army, (the Lord Lieutenant being on the Place) for no other reason than for Quartering, for one night, some few Horsemen under his Command (by the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Order) within the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that City: All this being done so contrary to the Injunction which the Bishops had published for the direction of the People, and at a time when they were assembled there. And when the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> despaired (their contempts being so high) of perswading them, to what absolutely concern'd their proper Interest, he thought it not agreeable to the Honour of his Master to remain any longer in the Place, where such affronts and contempts were put upon his Authority; and yet being willing still to expect some good effects from the observation and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Bishops, who could not but discern what ruine must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately<note place="margin">The Assembly appointed at <hi>Loghreogh.</hi>
                  </note> attend such license and disobedience, he appointed all the said Bishops, and as many more as could be perswaded to come thither, and the Commissioners, to meet him at <hi>Loghreogh;</hi> where, about the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> they attended him at <hi>Loghreogh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they appeared at <hi>Loghreogh,</hi> the Marquis represented to their memories what they had before been themselves witnesses of, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd at <hi>Limerick,</hi> and the neglects he had born there; <hi>Desired them to remove those causless distrusts, which being maliciously infused into the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds, did slacken, if not wholely withdraw their obedience from his Majesties Authority; and wished them to consider how impossible it was for him, with Honour, or any hope of success, to contend against a powerful, absolutely obey'd, and plentifully supplied Enemy; himself under such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick disadvantages of distrust and disobedience; and concluded, that if
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93738:144"/>
the consequence of the Service could not induce them to be all of one mind, in putting a Garrison into</hi> Limerick; <hi>or, if being all of one mind, they could not induce the City to obedience and submission to such their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he could no longer entertain a hope of giving any check to the Enemy, and would thereupon consider how otherwise to dispose of himself.</hi> Both the Bishops and Commissioners were really (or at least seem'd so) and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely convinc'd of the necessity of erecting that Garrison, and of putting that City into a better posture of defence than it then appear'd to be in: The Commissioners, in whom that Trust was reposed by the Articles of Peace, order'd it to be done, and sent two of their own Members (<hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Everard</hi> Baronet, and Dr. <hi>Fennel</hi>) with their Order to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi> and with a Letter to the Mayor <hi>to conform thereunto;</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops writ to the Archbishop of <hi>Cashel</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Limerick</hi> (both then at <hi>Limerick) desiring them to use their utmost endeavours to incline the City to submit to the direction of the Lord Lieutenant, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners.</hi> And having done this, they departed to those Places they thought fit to dispose the People (as they professed) to all acts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and obedience. But the Commissioners in short time return'd from <hi>Limerick,</hi> without having in any degree prevail'd with them to receive either a Governour or Garrison, or to conform themselves to any Orders the Lord Lieutenant, or the Commissioners should send to them, otherwise than as they agreed with their own inclinations: in stead of making choice of any of those three who were nominated to them for their Governour, they upon the matter declared, <hi>That they would keep that Power in their own hands;</hi> and for receiving of a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, they proposed some particulars, what men of the <hi>Irish Catholicks,</hi> and what they would not, what course should be taken for the support of them, and through what hand it should pass, and many other things, directly contrary to the Articles of Peace which had been with solemnity proclaimed in that City, and unto which they had professed all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
               <p>All this perversness, obstinacy, and ingratitude, could not yet extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the affections and compassion the Marquis had towards them; and he clearly discern'd, that it proceeded not from the Spirit that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and confined within the Walls, but that it was the same that was generally working in other places: He was well enough satisfied, that they who were most passionately possessed with it, had no correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Parliament, nor had a mind to be subjected to their Power; he was willing therefore to believe, that they had fancied and imagined to themselves some expedient for their own preservation, which could not fall within his comprehension; and that they might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a prejudice to his Person, or to his Religion, which might keep them from such an union and confidence as they might be reduc'd unto under some Catholick, who might be as zealous to preserve his Majesties Interest, and recover the Kingdom to his obedience; and he was the more confirmed in this his apprehension, by revolving the several passages which had hapned at his being at <hi>Limerick,</hi> during the time that they seem'd to pay him all respect when the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> had been then with him, towards whom they had observed the Marquis had a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence<note place="margin">The Citizens of <hi>Limericks</hi> animosity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord <hi>Inchiquin.</hi>
                  </note> and friendship, as he well deserved: at which time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Persons of the City, and with them some of the Bishops, had, under a shew of great confidence and trust, repaired to the Lord. Lieutenant,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93738:144"/>
and declared unto him, That all that indisposition and waywardness of the People, proceeded from the prejudice they had against the Lord <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequin,</hi> who had always (they said) prosecuted the War against them with the most rigour and animosity; and the Places and Persons which had been most at his devotion, having treacherously revolted to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the People were not confident of him, and jealous, that the Marquis had too great a confidence in him; so that if he would dismiss that Lord, and discharge the Troops that yet remained under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, of which, some frequently ran away to the Parliament, not onely that City, but the whole Nation would, as one man, be at his disposal. While these insinuations were thus proposed to the Lord Lieutenant, other Persons (and those as leading men) with an equal number of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, applied themselves to the Lord <hi>Inchequin,</hi> and told him, <hi>That</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Citizens of <hi>Limerick</hi> insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate to the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> as much against the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did against him.</note> 
                  <hi>whilst the affairs were conducted by the Marquis of</hi> Ormond, <hi>they expected no good fortune; that they looked upon him as not of their Nation, and one so solicitous for the</hi> English <hi>Interest, and all</hi> English-men, <hi>that he was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing regardful of them and theirs: But that his Lordship was of the most antient Extraction of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and under that notion look'd upon with great affection and reverence by the</hi> Irish; <hi>and if the Government and Command were exercis'd by him, there would be such an Obedience paid to him, that he would in short time grow strong enough to oppose the Enemy, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Countrey.</hi> When these two Lords had communicated each to other (as they quickly did) the excellent Addresses which had been made to them, and agreed together how to draw on, and encourage the Proposers, that they might discover as much of their purposes as was possible, they easily found <hi>their design was to be rid of them both:</hi> And when they perceived (by the continuance of the same Friendship) that they had communicated with each other, they less dissembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards both, but proceeded with those disrespects which are mention'd before.</p>
               <p>The Marquis having sadly considered all this, and that nothing might<note place="margin">The second As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly at <hi>Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reogh.</hi>
                  </note> remain unattempted by him, that he could possibly imagine might tend in any degree to the recovery or preservation of the Kingdom, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed another meeting to be at <hi>Loghreogh</hi> the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd thither all the Catholick Bishops, as many of the Nobility as could with any security come thither, the chief Gentlemen of Quality of the Parts adjacent, and several Officers of the Army; where being met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he gave them in the first place an Answer in writing to a Paper he had received from the Archbishop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> the first of <hi>April,</hi> intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Grievances presented by the Congregation of Prelates, assembled,</hi> propria motu, <hi>at</hi> Cloanmacnoise; in which he made it evident, how much they were mistaken in the matter of Fact, and that which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally amiss proceeded from themselves, and their not observing the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Rules they were bound by, and could not be prevented by him; and consented to all the good and practicable ways proposed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for remedying the like for the future. He remembred them of the pains he had taken, of the Propositions he had made, of the Orders he had given, and of the Neglects, Disobedience, and Affronts he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by which alone the Enemy made that progress in their Successes: He shewed them a Letter he had received lately from his Master the King, bearing date on the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> from <hi>Castle Elizabeth</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Jersey,</hi> in answer to one writ from <hi>Kilkenny</hi> in <hi>December,</hi> in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93738:145"/>
which his Majesty signified his gracious pleasure to him, <hi>That in case of the continuance of that disobedience in the People, and contempt of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he should withdraw himself and his Majesties Authority out of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense from the King (on the disobedience of the <hi>Irish</hi>) to withdraw.</note> 
                  <hi>that Kingdom.</hi> Whereupon he told them, (having received so little ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all the pains he had taken, and so ill returns for all the affection he had shewed to them) he was resolved to make use speedily of the liberty the King had given him, as to his own Person, which he found was rendred so unacceptable to the People; yet if they could propose to him any way how he might deposite the Kings Authority in such manner, as it might not be exposed to the same affronts it had received in him, and might be applied to the preservation of the People, and recovery of the Nation, he would gladly gratifie them, and would heartily wish, that they might receive that happiness by his absence, which they could not receive in his presence; and to that purpose desired them to consult se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously and maturely among themselves.</p>
               <p>Upon this, all the Bishops, Nobility, and Commissioners of Trust, with the principal Gentlemen, expressed very much trouble at the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution the Marquis had taken, and on the last day of <hi>April</hi> (from <hi>Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reogh</hi>) 1650, made an Address to him in writing under their several hands, in which, amongst other things, they told him, <hi>That they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd themselves in duty bound for his better information of the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Assembly at <hi>Loghreogh</hi> address to the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, upon his resolves to leave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> 
                  <hi>of that Nation, humbly to present to him, That however his Excellency might not have met with a ready concurrence to some Proposals made, for the advancing his Majesties Service, occasion'd through some misunderstanding in some few Persons and Places, yet the Country generally, and the Nation in it, as they had already (by expending their Substance in an extraordinary measure, and their Lives upon all occasions) abundantly testifi'd their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and irremovable affections, to preserve his Majesties Rights and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests intire to him; so they would for the future, and with like cheerfulness, endeavour to overcome all difficulties which the Enemies power and success had laid in their way, and that they who were there met (doubting not but the same was the general sense of the Nation) would with all care and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness endeavour, not onely to conserve in the People such their good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, but if any Person or Place should be refractory, or decline that obedience which is due to his Majesties Authority, they would contribute their best endeavours to reduce them, and make them conformable to the same.</hi> And after many other specious professions and protestations of their zeal to obey his Excellency, <hi>They humbly besought him to appoint Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in the several Provinces, to whom those of his Majesties Subjects (who by the excitement of the Clergy, ready with all alacrity to undergo, that care should be encouraged to take up Arms) might repair for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Power of the Rebels.</hi> How respective soever this Address was, and how solemnly soever it was represented (as neither the one or the other could be more formal) the Lord Lieutenant was resolved not to be longer satisfied with those general Declarations of their good desires and purposes; and therefore the very next day he sent them a Letter, containing what he would expect from them, which for the more clear manifestation of the whole Proceedings, shall be here faithfully inserted, and was in these words.

                     <body>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:93738:145"/>
                        <p>AFter our hearty Commendations, in Answer to your Letter of the last of <hi>April,</hi> we think fit to mind you, That upon our communicating unto you his Majesties Letter of the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>Febr.</hi> we then acquainted you at large with what had passed at <hi>Waterford,</hi> (which being by us represented to his Majesty, occasion'd his sending the said Letter) as also, that we found the City of <hi>Limerick</hi> had taken example thereby to affront and contemn his Majesties Authority placed in us, and from us, by consent of the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of the Confederate Catholicks at the conclusion of the Peace, derived to the Commissioners; both which you pass over with an extenuation of those disobediences, and by attributing them to some mis-understandings, you seem in a manner to excuse them: Whereas we had reason to expect, that (suitable to your general professions) you would have resented the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deportment of those Places, and proposed unto us how the Contrivers thereof might be brought to Justice, and the Places reduced to perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: For as for your professions of care, and earnestness to endeavour, not onely to conserve in the People the good inclinations you find in them; but that if any Person or Place shall be refractory, or decline that perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due to his Majesties Authority, you will contribute your best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to reduce them, and make them conformable to the same, cannot be evidenced or made good by you, but by applying those your endeavours, where we give you particular undeniable instances of refractoriness and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience; so there can be no instance thereof more pregnant, nor (if it be persisted in) more destructive to his Majesty and the Nation, than that of <hi>Limerick,</hi> to the immediate reducing whereof, we therefore thought, and do now expect you would effectually apply your selves. We are well satisfied, that the generality of the Countrey and Nation, who have given the proofs you mention of their sincere affections to preserve his Majesties Rights en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to him, will persevere therein, if those upon whose example and advice they very much fix their resolutions be active and industrious to lead and exhort them thereunto. But we must withall let you know, that we cannot hope that those their good affections, and alacrity in defence of his Majesty, and their own Interests, can be successful, if the City of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and all other Cities and Towns, be not in perfect obedience, and immediately be put under a Military Government for Military matters, and thereby into a condition of defence and offence: Which to conceal from the People, were, towards them as great a treachery, as it would be in us a vain rashness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such obedience first gain'd, to attempt the opposing the strength and power of the Rebels. And therefore we must, and do declare, that as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular refractoriness of the City of <hi>Waterford,</hi> hath more than any humane means contributed to all the successes of the Rebels in those parts, since our being at <hi>Waterford:</hi> And as the want of a strong Garrison in <hi>Limerick,</hi> (which we long since desired might be received there, but could not prevail) hath been the greatest visible means, whereby the said Rebels have with small or no resistance gain'd or destroy'd the County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and other parts adjacent; so the entire loss of the Kingdom to his Majesty, and the destruction of the Nation, (which we have no hope to prevent, but by strongly and presently Garrisoning and Fortifying the said City) must be imputed to the obstinacy of that City, if it shall perfist therein.</p>
                        <p>As to those Distrusts and Jealousies of the People, occasion'd (as you say) for want of success in Services, the sense of their sufferings, and their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions for want of redress of their Grievances: We answer, That both the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93738:146"/>
want of success, and the sense of their sufferings, whether from the Enemy, or the Souldier, cannot so reasonably be attributed to any humane Cause, as to the want of garrisoning the Army in principal Towns and Cities, wherein we cannot yet prevail, nor ever could, till by the Enemy's lying at one end of a Town, we were not, without articling and conditioning, permitted to put such Men as we could then get, in at the other end. For, for want of garrisoning the Army, and by being forced to quarter it at large, it was not possible to have them exercised, their Arms kept in order, nor they under ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary discipline; which, when they were to be brought together, rendred them worse than so many new rais'd Men, by how much they had contracted a licentious liberty, and habit of rapine and disobedience. Nor could we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Fraud in Muster, or reasonably exact a strict Account from Officers of Men so scatter'd, who, when they should be imployed upon Service, were forced (or pretending a necessity, wherein we could not disprove them) to range the Countrey, to get in the Means that should enable them to serve. As to their Apprehension, for want of redress to their Grievances, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not what Grievances are thereby meant, unless those delivered unto us by the Archbishop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> on the first of <hi>April.</hi> For other Grievances, (though we long expected and desired them) we never saw, save a Paper given unto us on the 13th. of <hi>March,</hi> at <hi>Limerick,</hi> which for the Forgery, false Calumny, and other mis-becoming Passages contain'd in it, was (as such) dis-avowed by the Clergy then met; and to those given us on the first of <hi>April,</hi> we return'd herewith such Answers, as (considering the generality of them) is possible for us to give.</p>
                        <p>We have already, with the Advice of the Commissioners, and (as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) with the Approbation of such of the Bishops as were present, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi> to command the Forces in <hi>Leimster;</hi> and in <hi>Munster,</hi> with like Advice and Approbation, we have imployed Colonel <hi>David Roch</hi> to command for a necessary Expedition; besides, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon the Place, one general Officer, that will readily receive and imploy any, that shall be prevail'd with to take Arms, as is promised; and in case we find fitting Obedience and Reception from the City of <hi>Limerick,</hi> we shall in Person be ready to receive and conduct such Forces in the said Province.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Ulster,</hi> we have, in pursuance to an Agreement made with that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, given Commission to the Bishop of <hi>Clogher;</hi> and in <hi>Connaght,</hi> the Lord Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> commands the Army.</p>
                        <p>We know no use to which any Money rais'd upon the People hath been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, but to the maintenance of the Forces; if you do, we shall desire to be therein informed, to the end, that any past mis-application thereof may be examined and punished, and the like prevented in future.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, We seriously recommend to your Consideration, the ways of procuring such Obedience to his Majesty, and his Authority in the general, and particularly from the City of <hi>Limerick,</hi> as may enable and encourage us with Honour, and hope of Success, according to our desire, to use our utmost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, and encounter all hazards, for the defence of this Kingdom and Nation, against the Tyranny that will certainly be exercised upon them, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable Slavery they will be subject unto, if the Rebels prevail. And so we bid you heartily farewel. For the Archbishops, Nobility, Bishops, the Commissioners authorized by us, in pursuance of the Articles of Peace, and others assembled at <hi>Loghreogh.</hi>

Upon the receipt of this Letter, they made another Address to the Marquess, (in writing) in which they said, <hi>They were very far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending by any expressions they had used, to excuse that Deportment of the City of</hi> Limerick; <hi>nor could any Man (they said) more feelingly than they, resent their personal Dis-respects towards his Excellency, while he was lately in that City, whereof they had in their Letters, then ready to be sent by a Committee, imployed by them to that Corporation, taken notice: And they did hope, that they would by their Deportment, hereafter merit to have it understood, that it proceeds from ignorance rather than malice; and that concerning the garrisoning of the City, the Clergy that had met lately there, and the Commissioners of Trust, had written very effectually to them, and imployed two of the Commissioners of Trust thither, to solicit their compliance to his Excellency, and to represent to them the danger and prejudice that would ensue their refractoriness: And though it had not taken that effect with them which was expected, yet they humbly offered his Excellency, that a second Essay was to be made, and his Excellency's further positive Commands to be sent thither, whereunto if they would not listen, they promised in as much as in them lay, that they would in their respective Degrees and Quality and according to their respective Powers, so far as should be thought fit and necessary, upon consideration had of what had been proposed hitherto between his Excellency, the Commissioners of Trust, and them, concerning the garrison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that City, co-operate to reclaim them, and bring them to a perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; humbly desiring, that what resolution soever should be taken by that City, yet that his Excellency would be pleas'd not to impute it to any Dis-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in them, or want of Zeal in the Nation, to advance his Majesty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And in regard the transacting of that Business might take up some time, it was humbly desired his Excellency would be pleas'd, to apply his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Care for the forwarding of the Service, and setling of Affairs in other Parts of the Kingdom, answerable unto the present dangers and condition wherein it was, that there might be some visible opposition to the growing Power of the Enemy.</hi> At the same time that they sent this Address to the Marquess, signed by the Names of the Bishops and Commissioners, which was the 2d. of <hi>May,</hi> 1650. they likewise sent the Archbishop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> and Sir <hi>Lucas Dillon,</hi> to <hi>Limerick,</hi> with as reasonable and pressing Letters to that Corporation, for receiving a Garrison, and obedience to the Marquess's Orders.</p>
               <p>This demeanour in the Assembly, and all the visible Results of their Consultation, together with so deep professions of Loyalty to the King, and of respect to his Lieutenant, prevail'd so far with the Marquess, that he again declined his purpose of quitting the Kingdom, and thereupon dismissed a Frigat, which he had bought and fitted for his own Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and though the Archbishop of <hi>Tuam</hi> and Sir <hi>Lucas Dillon</hi> return'd from <hi>Limerick,</hi> without that entire submission from the City which was expected, yet he was willing to make the best interpretation of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral professions of Duty, and to believe that they would by degrees be induced to do what they ought; and that he might be the nearer to them, to encourage any such inclination, he removed to <hi>Clare,</hi> 12 miles from <hi>Limerick,</hi> and gave Orders to the Troops, which for conveniency of Quarters were scattered at a greater distance, to be ready to draw to a Rendezvous. And he was shortly after very reasonably induced to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most confident, that the City was well disposed; for having one day (about the 11th. of <hi>June</hi>) visited some Troops, which he had assembled
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93738:147"/>

               <p>This Letter might very well have raised an expectation and assurance, that there would be no more scruples of receiving a Garrison; yet the Aldermen who brought it, made such pauses in answering some necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Questions, that the Marquess return'd them the same night with this Answer.

The Particulars he proposed to them were, (1.) To be receiv'd in like manner, and with such respect, as the Lord Lieutenants heretofore had always been. (2.) To have Command of the Guard, giving the Word and Orders in the City. (3.) That there might be Quarter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided within the City, for such Guards of Honse and Foot as he should carry in, which should be part of the Garrison, and whereof a List should be given at the Rendezvous. The next day when the Marquess came to the Rendezvous, two Aldermen met him there, and inform'd him, that the City had consented to all that he had proposed to them, except only the admittance of his Guards, which they were unwilling to do; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he sent Messengers back with this Answer, <hi>That he intended not the drawing in of his Guards, out of any mistrust he had of the loyalty of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates of that City to his Majesty, or of their affection to himself, but for the dignity of the Place he held, and to prevent any popular Tumult that might be raised by desperate interested Persons against him, or the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that City, whereunto he had cause to fear, some loose People might by false and frivolous suggestions be too easily instigated.</hi> And to take away all possibility of suspicion from the most jealous, he told them, <hi>The Guards he meant to take with him, should consist but of</hi> 100 <hi>Foot and</hi> 50 <hi>Horse, and even those too to be of their own Religion, and such as having been constantly of their Confederacy, were interessed in all the Benefits of the Articles of Peace.</hi> And so, not imagining that they could refuse so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable an Overture, he went towards the City; but when he came very near the Gates, the same Aldermen came again to him, to let him know, That there was a Tumult rais'd in the City by a <hi>Franciscan Frier,</hi> called Father <hi>Wolf,</hi> and some others, against his coming into the Town, and<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wolf</hi>'s Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> in opposition to the desires and intentions of the Maior, and the principal Citizens, and therefore disswaded his Excellency's going thither, until the Tumult should be quieted. So that the Lord Lieutenant was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd, with that Affront, to return, and rested that night at <hi>Shanbuoly,</hi> three miles from the City, from whence he writ to them the sense he had of the Indignity offer'd him, <hi>And wished them to consider, not only by what Power they had been made a Corporation first, and by whose Protection they had since flourished, but also what solid Foundation of safety (other than by receiving the defence he had offer'd them) was or could be proposed to them, by the present Disturbers of their Quiet: And desired their present Answer, That in case he might be encouraged to proceed in the way he had laid down, of serving the King, and preserving that City from the Tyranny of the Rebels, he might immediately apply himself thereunto, or failing in his Desires there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he might apply himself, and the Forces he had gathered for that purpose, to some other Service.</hi> But neither this, nor all he could do, upon subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Treaties and Overtures, moving from themselves, could not at all prevail with them, No! not his offer of putting himself into the City, and running the Fortune of it, when <hi>Ireton</hi> was encamp'd before it: But they<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Limerick</hi> still refractory and contemptious.</note> continually multiplied and repeated their Affronts towards him, with all imaginable Circumstances of Contempt; and in the end, (that we may have no more occasion of mentioning the seditious Carriage of this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate City) broke open his Trunks of Papers, which he had left there, seized upon the Stores of Corn laid up there for the supply of the Army, when he believed that Place would have been obedient to him, and some Corn belonging to himself, and dispos'd of all according to their own pleasure, and receiv'd some Troops of Horse into the City, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93738:148"/>
to the Marquess's Order left the Army, and with those Troops levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rais'd Contribution in the Countrey adjacent, upon those who had honestly paid the same for the use of the Army, according to those Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which they were to obey. And when the Marquess sent to the Maior, to deliver the Officer of the said Regiment as a Prisoner, to the Guard appointed to receive him, he could receive no other Answer, (and that not in a week) than that the Government of that City was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Major General <hi>Hugh O Neal,</hi> and therefore he the Maior would not meddle therein. And when the like Orders were sent by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess to <hi>Hugh O Neal,</hi> he return'd Answer, That he was only a Cypher, and not suffered to act any thing, but what the Maior and Council thought fit. So that, in truth, that City was no less in Rebellion to the King, than the Army under <hi>Ireton</hi> was, though it did for a time resist that Army, and could never have been subdued by it, if it had ever been in that obedience to the King, as by their obligation it ought to have been, and therefore must have less peace of Conscience to support them, in the Calamities they have since undergone.</p>
               <p>In the Letter formerly inserted from the Marquess, of the first of <hi>May,</hi> it is said, That in pursuance of a former Agreement, he had granted a Commission to the Bishop of <hi>Clogher,</hi> for the Command of the Province of <hi>Ulster;</hi> It will be therefore necessary to express what that Agreement was, and the Proceedings thereupon: Amongst the Articles which had been made with General <hi>Owen O Neal,</hi> it was provided, that in case of the said <hi>O Neal</hi>'s death, or removal by Advancement, or otherwise, before any settlement in Parliament, to which all the Articles of Peace related, that the Nobility and Gentry of the Province of <hi>Ulster,</hi> should have Power to name one to the Lord Lieutenant, or chief Governor for his Majesty, to Command in the place of the said <hi>O Neal;</hi> and the said Command, was to be conferred accordingly upon the Person so to be named, and according to his Power: <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> being dead, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Bishops, and Principal Gentry of that Province, made choice of the Bishop of <hi>Clogher</hi> to succeed him in the Charge, and having signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied such their Election under their hands to the Lord Lieutenant, the first of <hi>April,</hi> he granted such a Commission to him as he was obliged to do.</p>

               <p>In execution of which, the Bishop with great activity and courage proceeded, in infesting the <hi>English</hi> Garrisons and Army in that Province, as much as was in his Power; And having an Army, consisting of about 5000 Horse and Foot, about the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1650. (when the Lord Lieutenant himself could not draw 1000 men together, or keep them, if together the space of 48 hours) he encountred not far from <hi>London-derry,</hi> with Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> who Commanded the Parliaments Forces in Chief in that Quarter, and was then inferior in Foot to the Bishop, though otherwise he had a great advantage of him, by having near treble<note place="margin">The Bishop of <hi>Clogher</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. His Character.</note> the number of Horse; Notwithstanding which inequality, the <hi>Irish</hi> (for a while) behaved themselves handsomly, but in the end, were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally defeated; so that the Bishop was compelled after he saw the day was irrecoverably lost, to quit the Field with a small party of Horse; The next day in his flight, he had the misfortune near <hi>Eniskelin,</hi> to meet with the Governor, Major <hi>King</hi> of that Town, in the Head of a Party, too strong for him, against which however, the Bishop defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with notable courage, though after he had received many wounds, he was taken Prisoner, and soon after, by the positive Order of Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> (whom within less then a year, he had reliev'd, when in great extremity) hang'd. This was a most happy Victory for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that 3000 of the Rebels were there slain, all meer <hi>Irish,</hi> out of an opinion they could not prosper, as long as they had any <hi>English</hi> joyn'd with them, and for that end, had throughly purg'd their Army,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93738:149"/>
which (being stiled by them, the Confident Victorious Army of the North) had a full return of Gods Vengeance, they being the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries and Actors in those barbarous Cruelties, which ensued their Insurrection: This was the unfortunate end of that unhappy Prelate, of whom since he bore so great a Part in the Troubles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was much superior in Parts, to any man of that Party, it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent or uncharitable to mention some Passages of his Life, that thereby his nature and disposition may be the better collected, and indeed the spirit and temper of mind, which those kind of men were possessed with, who had the greatest abilities to do hurt. Some few years before the Rebellion, this <hi>Ever Mac Mahon,</hi> being then an Arch Priest, and residing for the most part, in or near <hi>Dublin,</hi> repair'd (as you have heard) to a Prime Instrument of State, and discovered to him the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances abroad, in reference to bring Troubles upon that Kingdom, who being thereupon Pardon'd, still (as any thing of that nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded) inform'd the State thereof: And though (according to the formality of Law) he should have sued out his Pardon, yet that he might still be confided in by the Confederates, (who knew not who the Discoverer was) he meerly trusted to the Kings Mercy and Clemency, and through the Government of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> he prov'd faithful to the Crown. From the beginning of this Rebellion, his Power was very great with those that were opposite to any Reconciliation, upon the first and 2 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of Peacy by the Confederate Catholicks, continuing firm to that Party which followed <hi>Owen O Neal,</hi> or rather Govern'd <hi>Owen O Neal,</hi> who commanded that Party; and over and above those demands which concern'd Religion, (to which they seem'd to adhere with more then ordinary zeal, and thereby drew a dependency of that Clergy to them,) they insisted upon the Restitution of the great Estates in <hi>Ulster,</hi> which was not in the Power of the Crown to make, without violation of several Acts of Parliament, and defeating many descents and purchases, which had passed without any interruption or claim for the space of 150 years. This impossible expectation kept both <hi>Owen O Neal,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Clogher,</hi> from concurring with the Confederate Catholicks, in the Peace they made with his Majesty, 1648. and the Animosity they contracted against the Confederates, inclined them to relieve <hi>London-derry,</hi> when (as is remembred before) it was even ready to be reduced by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Forces, rather then to submit to the Peace made by them with the Lord Lieutenant: To whose Divisions, the State of <hi>England</hi> (saith <hi>Rely</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Armagh</hi>) ows their present Possession of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore infers that that Party of the <hi>Irish</hi> Natives, ought to be not onely on that account Favour'd and Trusted, but because also, they never had affection for the King or his Family: Yet after they had found it necessary to make that agreement with the Marquess, in 1649. (being neglected by the Parliament) it must be acknowledged, that the Bishop per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and observ'd it very justly, (as he was punctual in what he promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and applied himself with all dexterity and industry to the advancement of his Majesties Interest; so that during his time, he restrain'd the Clergy from making any Acts, which might discourage the People from their Obedience to the Kings Authority. And the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that for these 20 years he had to do with the <hi>Irish</hi> Bishops, he never found any of them, either to speak the Truth, or to perform their Promise to him, onely the Bishop of <hi>Clogher</hi> excepted, who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:93738:149"/>
the little time he lived after his submission to the Peace, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission receiv'd from him, he could not charge.

In <hi>August,</hi> the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> (gathering Forces in <hi>Kerry</hi>) was disturb'd by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Phaer,</hi> who in his return thence, took in the Castle of <hi>Kilmurry,</hi> and thence went against the Lords, <hi>Roch</hi> and <hi>Muskery,</hi> who headed the Rebels in the West. The Army having refresht it self at <hi>Waterford, Ireton</hi> from thence intended for <hi>Limerick,</hi> yet wanting Provision for such a Siege, takes his Journey through the County of <hi>Wicklow,</hi> which afforded him 1600 Cows, besides Sheep, and other Provisions; From thence Sir <hi>Hardress Waller,</hi> with an equal share of the Booty, was sent with a considerable Force to straighten <hi>Limerick,</hi> (who in his way near <hi>Limerick,</hi> took in <hi>Bally-Glaughan, Bally-Cubbain,</hi> and <hi>Garrygaglain,</hi> three strong Castles) whilst <hi>Ireton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> (joyning Forces) appear'd before <hi>Athlone,</hi> to try if they could gain that Garrison; but finding the Bridge broke, and the Town on this side burnt, Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> staid there to straighten it, whilst <hi>Ireton</hi> taking two Castles in <hi>Mac Colcohe</hi>'s Country, and the <hi>Burr,</hi> (which the Enemy had left and burnt) presently seated himself before <hi>Limerick,</hi> where he had certain Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> (who upon notice of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being at <hi>Athlone,</hi> march'd with considerable Forces towards its Relief, if any thing should have been attempted) had retaken the two Castles, and laid Siege to the <hi>Burr,</hi> to whose Relief Colonel <hi>Axtell,</hi> Governor at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> (having made a conjunction at <hi>Rocrea,</hi> with the <hi>Wexford</hi> and <hi>Tipperary</hi> Forces) resolutely marched; whereupon the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard</hi>'s Forces under their chief Commander, (he being gone with the other part of his Army towards <hi>Limerick</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to <hi>Meleake</hi> Island, (a strong Fastness) but were beaten thence the 25. of <hi>October,</hi> with the loss of near 1500 Men, 200 Horse, Waggons, and Baggage: Upon this success, the <hi>Irish</hi> quitted all their adjacent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, and <hi>Ireton</hi> (the Winter coming hard on) drew off from <hi>Limerick,</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:93738:150"/>
(having settled the Garrisons round about it) with about 1200 Men, and took in <hi>Neanagh,</hi> (a strong Castle) in <hi>Low Ormond,</hi> upon whose surrender, <hi>Castleton</hi> and <hi>Dromaneer,</hi> yielded also, whence (endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to gain <hi>Killalough</hi> Pass, though without effect) he went to his Winter Quarters about the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> at <hi>Kilkenny.</hi> To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for whom, and the Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Parliament was at a great stand, (the Prosecution of the War in <hi>Scotland,</hi> having exercis'd the uttermost Force they could raise) so as they now began to cast about, which way might be most likely to disburthen themselves of some part of that Charge; And for this purpose, they appointed Commissioners to be sent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> which were four Members of Parliament, Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> Colonel <hi>Ludlow,</hi> Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weaver;</hi> The main Errant they went upon, was, to find out some means in that Kingdom, for the raising of certain sums of Money yearly, towards the maintenance of the Army; These were designed about the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> and were to be in readiness to imoark at <hi>Milford-Haven,</hi> by the midst of <hi>December,</hi> 1650.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> (whose endeavours could not work the Confederates to any reasonable resistance, though they saw their Cities and Towns won on every side,) who towards the end of <hi>July,</hi> receiv'd a Letter subscribed by two Persons, who Stiled themselves Archbishops of <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Tuam</hi> in these words.

                        <p>AFter our hearty Commendations, we received yours of the <hi>24th.</hi> of<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants Reply to the Clergies insolent Letter.</note> 
                           <hi>July,</hi> on the first of this month, and do, with much grief acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that this Nation is brought into a sad Condition, and that by such means, as when it shall be known abroad, and by story be delivered to Posterity, will indeed be thought a Fable; For it will seem incredible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that any Nation should so madly affect, and violently pursue the Ways lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own Destruction, as this People will appear to have done; And that, after the certain ruine they were running into, as evidently and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently discovered unto those, that in all times and upon all occasions, have had Power to compel or perswade them to what-ever they thought fit; and it will be less credible, when it shall be declared, as in truth it will be, that the Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal Interest, and Safety, even of those that had this Power, and that have been thus forewarn'd, did consist in making use of it to reclaim the People, and direct them into the ways of Preservation. To be plain, it cannot be denied, but the Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience we have met with, (which we at large declared unto many of you, who with divers others of the Nobility and Gentry, were assembled at <hi>Loghreogh,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> last) were the certain ready ways to the Destruction of this Nation, as by our Letters of the first of <hi>May,</hi> to that Assembly, we made apparent. Antient and late experience hath made evident, what Power those of your <hi>Function</hi> have had, to draw the People of this Nation to what they thought fit; whether your Lordships have been convinced that the Obedience which we desired, should be given to his Majesties Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in us, pursuant to the Articles of Peace, was the way to preserve the Nation, we know not; or whether your Lordships have made use of all the means at other times, and upon other occasions, exercised by you, to procure this necessary Obedience, we shall not now determine: Sure we are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that since the said Assembly, not onely <hi>Limerick</hi> hath persisted in the like Disobedience, for want of due Compliance from those Places, but principally from <hi>Limerick,</hi> it hath been impossible for us to raise or imploy an Army against the Rebels, for to attempt it any where on the other side of the <hi>Shannon;</hi> but near <hi>Limerick,</hi> and without the absolute command of that City to secure it, could be no other then the certain Ruine of the Design, in the very beginning of it, the Rebels Power being such, as to dissipate with ease, the foundation that should be laid there; and to have done it on the other side of the <hi>Shannon,</hi> was impossible, since the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of the Army must be raised and supported from thence, which while it was in forming, would have exhausted all the substance of those Parts, and not have effected the work, for want of such an Army, (which with Gods assistance) might certainly have been raised long since, if <hi>Limerick</hi> had obeyed our Orders. The Rebels have without any considerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance from abroad, taken in <hi>Clonmel, Tecroghan, Catherlagh,</hi> and reduced <hi>Waterford,</hi> and <hi>Duncannon,</hi> to great, and we fear irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:93738:151"/>
Distress; The loss of these Places, and the want of any visible Power to protect them, have doubtlesly induced many to contribute their Substance, and personal assistance to the Rebels; from which, whither they might have been with-held by Church censures, we know not, but have not heard of any such which issued against them; and lastly, for want of such an Army, the Rebels have taken to themselves the Contribution, which might considerably have assisted to support an Army, and preserve the Kingdom. If therefore the end of your <hi>Consultation at Jamestown,</hi> be to acquit your Consciencies in the eyes of God, the amendment of all Errors, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this afflicted People, as by the Letter, giving us notice of your Meeting, is professed, we have endeavoured briefly to shew, that the spring of our past losses, and approaching <hi>Ruine, ariseth from Disobediencies,</hi> and it will not be heard to shew, that the spring of those Disobediencies ariseth from the Forgeries invented, the Calumnies spread against the Government, and the incitement of the People to Rebellion, by very many of the Clergy. That these are Errors frequently practised, and fit for amendment, is no more to be doubted, than without they be amended, the affection of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will continue, and (as it is to be feared) end in their utter Destruction; which if prevented, by what your Consultation will produce, the happy effect of your Meeting will be acknowledged, without questioning the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by which you meet, or expect Proposals from us, which other then what we have formerly, and now by this our Letter made, we hold not necessary. And so we bid your Lordships heartily farewel. From <hi>Roscom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>August, 1650.</hi>

               <p>Though the Marquess did not expect, that the Meeting of the Bishops and Clergy in that manner at <hi>Jamestown,</hi> would have produced any better effect, than their former Meetings in other Places had done, yet he could not imagine, that their Presumption would have been so great, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd by this Message to be. And when he communicated it to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of Trust, they were no less seemingly scandalized at it, and believ'd, that upon serious Conference with the Bishops, they should be able to reform their Understandings and their Wills, and therefore desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Marquess, that instead of sending a particular Answer to the Matter of the Message, he would write to them, <hi>To give him a Meeting at</hi> Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reogh,<note place="margin">The Message from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops being justly resented by the Lord Lieutenant, he writes to them to meet him at <hi>Loghreoh,</hi> but they augment their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</note>

For these and other Reasons he told them, That unless he was forced by in-evita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble necessity, he was not willing to remove out of the Kingdom, and desired them to use all means within their Power, to dispose the People to that Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulness and Obedience that became them.</hi>

                  <hi>Loghreogh,</hi> at the time when the Parliamentarians were strong in the Field, and had then passed the <hi>Shannon,</hi> if they had not been restrained by<note place="margin">The Bishops of <hi>Jamestown</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of what might have been offered with Respect to the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant) inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</note> the few Troops the Marquess still kept on foot) they published an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication against all those, of what Quality soever, who should feed, help, or adhere unto the Lord Lieutenant; in which, this Circumstance is observable, That though they did not publish this Excommunication until the 15th. of <hi>September,</hi> it was enacted in their Assembly at <hi>James<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town</hi> the 12th. of <hi>August,</hi> which was within two days after they had sent the Bishop of <hi>Dromore,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Kelly,</hi> to perswade the Marquess to leave the Kingdom, and the day before they delivered their Message: So that they thought any thing that the Lord Lieutenant should return to them, would be impertinent to the Matter in hand; or if they were not so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with their own Proceedings, that they have themselves carefully published to the World in Print, would it be believ'd, that Persons, who in the least degree pretended the care of the Peoples welfare and security, could at such a time, when a potent Enemy was in the Field, set all Men loose from all Government, Civil and Martial, and not direct them whom they should follow and obey: For if it be said, That they were advised to return to their Association, and until a General Assembly of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could be conveniently called, unanimously to serve against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, since no Persons were named or appointed to conduct them, it must be acknowledged, that they were left without any direction at all, to the rage and fury of those, who intended nothing but their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
               <p>Together with their Excommunication, they published, in the head<note place="margin">A malicious Declaration from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>James<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town,</hi> with Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions thereupon.</note> of the Army, a Declaration, entituled, <hi>A Declaration of the Archibishops, Bishops, and other Prelates and Dignitaries of the Regular and Secular Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Kingdom of</hi> Ireland, <hi>against the continuance of his Majesty's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Marquess of</hi> Ormond, <hi>Lord Lieutenant of</hi> Ireland, <hi>for the mis-government of the Subjects, and the ill conduct of his Majesty's Army, and violation of the Articles of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Archbishops, Bishops, and Secular and Regular Clergy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> will take upon them to declare against the King's Authority, where his Majesty hath placed it, and will make themselves Judges of his supream Minister, for the government of the Subjects, and the ill conduct of his Majesty's Army, they assume an Authority to themselves, that no other Christian Clergy ever pretended, and sufficiently declare to the King, <hi>how far they are from being Subjects, or intending to pay him any Obedience, longer than they are govern'd in such Manner, and by such Persons, as they think fit to be pleas'd with.</hi> If the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> had mis-govern'd the People, and conducted his Majesty's Army amiss, the Clergy are not competent Judges of the one or the other. And for the violation of the Articles of Peace, the Commissioners, nominated and appointed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the due execution of them, were the only Persons who could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and remedy such Violation, and who well knew there was no cause for their complaint. But on the other hand, (as hath been before mention'd) these Men obstructed that concurrence and obedience in the People, without which those Articles could not be observed, or the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the People provided for.</p>
               <p>The Preface of that Declaration (according to their usual method) justified and magnified their Piety and Vertue, in the beginning and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the War, extolled their Duty and Affection to their King, in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93738:153"/>
submitting to him, and returning to their Allegiance, when they said, they could have better, or as good Conditions from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> intimated what a vast sum of Money they had provided, near half a Million of <hi>English</hi> pounds, besides several Magazines of Corn, with a fair Train of Artillery, great quantity of Powder, Match, Ammunition, with other Materials for carrying on the War, and many other Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of that nature, the monstrous untruths whereof doth sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in what hath been said before. The Marquess having been forced to borrow those little sums of Money, out of the Pockets of his Friends, (and to spend all that he raised upon the sail of a good quantity of his own Land; for the support of his Wife and Children) to enable the Army to march, which was not then (what-ever hath been since) re-paid to him. And the Magazines of Corn and Ammunition, and other Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for War, being so absolutely un-furnished, that it was not possible for him to reduce those small Forts of <hi>Maryburrough</hi> and <hi>Athy,</hi> held by <hi>Owen O Neal</hi>'s Party, till he had by his own Power and Interest, procured some Supplies before clearly mention'd, so far were these Men from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that Provision they brag of. What Conditions they might have had from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> may be concluded by the usage they have since found, (nor if they were put to it, would they be able to prove their Assertions) divine vengeance having made that Party more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less towards them, whose forwardness, obstinacy, and treachery against the King's Authority, contributed most to their Service, than those who worthily opposed them, and were most enemies to their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>They endeavour'd by all imaginable Reproaches and Calumnies, to lessen the Peoples Reverence towards the Lord Lieutenant, laying such Aspersions on him in the said Declaration, as might most alienate their Affections, though themselves knew them to be un-true, and without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. They complained that he had given Money, Commissions for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, and other Commands, unto Protestants, and upon them consumed the substance of the Kingdom, who most of them either betrayed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted the Service; whereas they knew well, that there was not one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Officer, to whom the Lord Lieutenant gave a Commission, who betrayed any Place committed to him, or otherwise treated in order to their support, than all the other Officers of the same condition in the Army; nor did they quit the Service, until many of them had gallantly lost their Lives, and that the Clergy had so far incensed the People against them, only for being Protestants, that the Marquess was compelled to give them leave to depart the Kingdom, or otherwise to dispose of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and the Parliament Commanders gave Passes to such as would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Kingdom, and gladly entertain'd such as went over to their Party.</p>
               <p>They accused him of Improvidence in conducting the Army, after the defeat at <hi>Rathmines,</hi> of not relieving <hi>Tredath,</hi> of permitting Play, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Licentiousness in the Camp, and as bold Aspersions, as, without Excommunication, might gain credit with the People, and reflect upon his Honour, where he was not enough known. Whereas the Action at <hi>Rathmines</hi> is before set down at large, and the taking of <hi>Tredath</hi> by a Storm, when it was scarce apprehended: And it is notoriously known, that in his Person he was so strict and vigilant, that he gave not himself freedom and liberty to enjoy those Pleasures, which might very well have
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:93738:153"/>
consisted with the Office and Duty of the most severe General; and that in above three months time, (which was from his first drawing the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Rendezvous, till after the misfortune at <hi>Rathmines</hi>) he never slept out of his Souldier's Habit. So that the malice and craft of those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable and sensless Calumnies, are easie enough to be discerned, and can only make an impression upon vulgar minds, not well informed of the Humour and Spirit of the Contrivers.</p>
               <p>They magnified exceedingly the Merit of the Prelates, the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had made at <hi>Cloanmacnoise,</hi> their frequent expressions of their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; and most blame the Marquess, for not making use of their Power and Diligence, toward the advancing the King's Interest; but rather, for suspecting and blaming them by his Letter to the Prelates at <hi>Jamestown,</hi> (before-mention'd) and they said, words were heard to fall from him, dangerous as to the Persons of some of the Prelates. To all which, little need be said, since there is before so just and full mention of their fair De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, Professions and Actions, which accompanied them: And for the danger the Persons of some Prelates were in, they will be ashamed to urge, when it is known, that their Bishop of <hi>Killalough</hi> was brought to him in custody, even after he had sign'd this Declaration and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and set at liberty by him, and whom the Bishops themselves, in their Letter (of the 12th. of <hi>September,</hi> 1650.) to the Earl of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meath,</hi> &amp;c. do acknowledge to be preserved by the Marquess; and for which many will rather expect an Apology, than for any Jealousie he could entertain of the Persons, who behaved themselves in that manner towards the King's Lord Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>They charge him with having represented to his Majesty, that some Parts of the Kingdom were dis-obedient, which absolutely deny any Dis-obedience by them committed; and that thereby, he had procured from his Majesty a Letter, to withdraw his own Person, and the Royal Authority, if such dis-obedience was multiplied, and so leave the People without the Benefit of Peace. This was the Reward his Excellency (out of his Envy to a Catholick Loyal Nation) prepared for their Loyalty and Obedience, seal'd by the shedding of their blood, and the loss of their substance. Whether the obstinate and Rebellious carriage of <hi>Waterford, Limerick,</hi> and other Places, (which brought destruction upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) did not deserve and require such a Representation to be made unto the King, may be judged by all men, upon what hath been before truly set down of those Particulars; and if the Places themselves had not acknowledged that dis-obedience, yet the Prelates seemed to lament those Acts of Dis-obedience, and most earnestly disswaded him from leaving the Kingdom, promising all their endeavours to reduce the People to Obedience, (which was onely in their Power to have done) else the Marquess would not so long have exposed Himself and his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to those Reproaches, or suffered his Person with the Impotent Title of Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to have remained in that Kingdom; and every day to hear of the rendring and betraying of Places to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which he could no more remedy, then he could infuse a Spirit of Obedience, Unity, and Understanding, into that unhappy infatuated Nation; Yet he was so far from wishing, that his Majesty should abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely withdraw his Royal Authority from them, (how unworthy so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they made themselves of it) that he offered to leave the Kings Power, in the Person of the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> as he afterwards
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93738:154"/>
did, hoping, that since their great exception was to him for being a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, they would with all Alacrity have complied with the other, who is known to be a most zealous <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> yet a great Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alist.</p>
               <p>They reproach'd him, That while he was an Enemy to the Catholicks, he had been very active in unnatural executions against them, and shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the blood of poor Priests and Churchmen: But since the Peace, he had shewed little of action, keeping himself in <hi>Connaght,</hi> and <hi>Thomond,</hi> where no danger was, or the Enemy appear'd not. Here you see, they would neither suffer him to have an Army to oppose the Enemy, nor be content that he should retire into those Places where the Enemy could least infest him, and from whence with those few Troops which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with him, he defended the <hi>Shannon,</hi> and kept the Enemy from getting over the River, while he staid there. And for the former activity and success against them, which they were content to impute to him, it was when he had a free election of Officers, an absolute Power over his Garrisons, where he caused the Soldiers continually to be exercised, their Arms kept in order, and from whence he could have drawn his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my together, and have march'd with it to what place he would: which advantages he was now without, and the Enemy possessed of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was no wonder, that they now obtain'd their Victories, as easily as he had done formerly; But since they were so disingenious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, (there being many amongst them, whose lives he had saved, not without suspicion of being favourable to them, when he should have been just) to charge him with being active in unnatural executions against them, and in shedding the blood of poor Priests and Church-men; and for the Improvement and Propagation of Calumny, it hath pleased some Persons, to cause that Declaration to be Translated in <hi>Latin,</hi> and Printed, thereby to make him odious to the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and have named two Priests, who they say were by his order Executed, and put to death in cold blood, and after his promise given to save their lives, whose names were Mr. <hi>Higgins,</hi> and Mr. <hi>White.</hi> It will not be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to set down at large the Case of these two Persons, that from thence, men who have no mind to be deceived and mislead, may judge of the Candor and Sincerity of those Persons, who would obtrude such Calumnies to the World.</p>
               <p>It must therefore be known, that when these two Priests were put to death, the War was conducted and carried on by the two Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; that the Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> was in the hands of the two Lords Justices, who upon the inhumane and barbarous Cruelties first practised by the <hi>Irish Catholicks,</hi> in the beginning of the Rebellion, had forbidden any quarter to be given to those whom they found in Arms, and principally against all Priests, known Incendaries of that Rebellion, and prime Actors in exemplary Cruelties; and the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> was then onely Lieutenant General of the Army, and received all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the Lords Justices and Council, who having intelligence that a Party of the Rebels intended to be at such a time at the <hi>Naas,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him to draw some Troops together, with hope to surprize them; And the Lieutenant General marching all night, came early in the morning into the Town, from whence the Rebels (upon notice) were newly fled; In this Town some of the Souldiers found Mr. <hi>Higgins,</hi> who might it's true have easily fled, if he had apprehended any danger in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:93738:154"/>
the stay; When he was brought before the Marquess, he voluntarily acknowledged that he was a Priest, and that his Residence was in the Town, from whence he refused to fly away with those that were guilty, because he not onely knew himself very innocent, but believ'd he should not be without ample Evidence of it, having by his sole Charity and Power, preserved very many of the <hi>English</hi> Protestants, from the rage and fury of the <hi>Irish,</hi> and therefore he onely besought the Marquess to preserve him from the violence of the Souldiers, and to put him securely into <hi>Dublin,</hi> to be tried for any Crime; which the Marquess promis'd to do, and perform'd it, though with so much hazard, that when it was spread abroad amongst the Souldiers, that he was a Priest, the Officer into whose Custody he was intrusted, was assaulted by them, and it was as much as the Marquess could do to relieve him, and compose the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny. When he came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> he informed the Lords Justices and Council of the Prisoner he had brought with him, of the good Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony he had receiv'd of his peaceable Carriage, of the pains he had taken to restrain those with whom he had Credit, from entring into Rebellion, and of very many charitable Offices he had perform'd, of which there wanted not Evidence enough, there being many then in <hi>Dublin,</hi> who own'd their Lives, and whatever of their Fortunes was left, purely to him, so that he doubted not, but that he would be worthy of their Protection: Within few days after, when the Marquess did not suspect the poor man to be in danger, he heard that Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> (who was Provost Martial General) had taken him out of Prison, and caused him to be put to death, in the morning before or assoon as it was light; of which Barbarity, the Marquess complained to the Lords Justices, but was so far from bringing the other to be question'd, that he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be upon some disadvantage, for thinking the proceeding to be otherwise then it ought to have been: This was the Case of Mr. <hi>Higgins,</hi> and this the Marquess's part in it; and the poor man was so far from complaining of his breach of Promise at his death, (how confidently soever it be aver'd) that he exceedingly acknowledged the Favour he had receiv'd from his Lordship, prayed for his Prosperity, and lamented his want of Power to do that, which the World saw his inclination prompted him to.</p>
               <p>The proceeding against Mr. <hi>White,</hi> was very different, and in this manner; The Marquess being upon his march with his Army, he quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd one night at <hi>Clonin,</hi> an house of the Earl of <hi>West-Meaths,</hi> who was residing there with his Wife and Family; when he was at Supper, (many of the Officers being at the Table) the Lady of the House (upon some whisper she receiv'd from a Servant) expressed some trouble in her Countenance, which the Marquess (who sate next her) perceiving, asked her what the matter was, she told him in his ear, that she was in great apprehension of an honest man who was in her house, and much fear'd the Souldiers, confessing he was a Priest; The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess replied, that if he was in the house, and kept himself there, he was in no danger; for, as the Souldiers would attempt nothing while the Marquess stai'd there, so he would leave a Guard at his departure, that should secure it against Straglers, or any Party that should stay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; which he did accordingly. In the morning when he was ready to march, he receiv'd information, that the Rebels were possessed of a Pass, by which he was to go; whereupon he sent some Troops to get
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:93738:155"/>
a Foard, three miles from the way the Army was to march, and by that means, to come upon the Rear of the Rebels by the time the Army should come to the Pass; which being done, after a short Encounter, in which many were killed, the Rebels were put to flight, and the Pass gain'd: In this action, Mr. <hi>White</hi> was taken on Horse-back with a Case of Pistols, who desired to be brought to the Marquess, which being done, he told him he was the Person, for whom the Countess of <hi>West-Meath</hi> had besought his favour the night before, and that his Lordship had promised that he should be safe; The Marquess told him, if he were the same Person? it was his own fault that he was not safe, if he had staid in the house he was in, this had not befaln him? that it was now out of his Power to preserve him, himself being bound to pursue those Orders which the Lords Justices had given him; Nevertheless, he did endeavour to have saved him, at least till he might be brought to <hi>Dublin:</hi> But the whole Army possessed with a bitter spirit against the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy, mutinied upon it, and in the end compelled the Marquess to leave him unto that Justice, which they were authoris'd to execute, and so put him to death. Who can now upon these two Instances, and no other can or have been given, reasonably and honestly say, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess hath had his hands defiled with the blood of Priests? And from the time that he had the chief Power committed to him, there was not one Priest (how Maliciously, Rebelliously, or Treacherously soever, they behaved themselves against the Kings Service, and the Person of the Lord Lieutenant) who suffered death, but also all other acts of Blood and Rage, which are not necessary, though hardly avoidable in the most just War, were declined and discountenanced by him; nay! for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to affairs of this nature, (that they might be evenly, and without passion carried on) did he not often undergo (even with his own Party) a suspicion of not being sufficiently faithful? The Consequences of which had many Censures: The truth is, the Rebellion was odious to him, yet his desire (often to reclaim the <hi>Irish</hi> by Mercy) palliated, what other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise might have finished (some thought) the War, sooner then it had its Determination.</p>
               <p>I shall pass over the many Tautologies, and impertinent Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the said Declaration, all which are sufficiently answer'd and clear'd, by what is already contain'd in this Narrative, and shall <note n="*" place="margin">In that <hi>Walsh</hi> is at large in his Append. of Instruments, <hi>Fol.</hi> 99.</note> onely insert their conclusion in their own words, as followeth.—For the prevention of these Evils, and that the Kingdom may not be utterly lost to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and his Catholick Subjects, this Congregation of Archbishops, Bishops, and other Prelates and Dignitaries of both Clergies of this Kingdom, found our selves bound in Conscience (after great delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to declare against the continuance of his Majesties Authority, in the Person of the Lord Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> having by his Misgovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ill Conduct of his Majesties Army, and breach of Publick Faith with the People, in several Particulars of the Articles of Peace, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himself incapable of continuing that great Trust any longer, being questionable before his Majesty, for the aforesaid Injuries and ill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to which effect, we will joyn with other Members of this Kingdom, in drawing a Charge against him: And we hereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to the People, that they are no longer obliged to obey the Orders and Commands of the said Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> but are, until a General Assembly of the Nation can be conveniently called together,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:93738:155"/>
unanimously to serve against the common Enemy, for the defence of the Catholick Religion, his Majesties Interest, their Liberties, Lives, and Fortunes, in pursuance of the Oath of Association, and to observe in the mean time the form of Government the said Congregation shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, until otherwise ordered by an Assembly, or until upon Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Majesty, he settle the same otherwise. And we do Fulminate the annexed Excommunication of one date, with this Declaration against all opposers of the said Declaration.</p>
               <p>Here we are arrived at one of the most fatal Conclusions of a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate<note place="margin">The obstinate obedience of the People to the Clergy, and the miserable result there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</note> People any History ever mention'd; yet (as the case stood) it was not possible for his Excellency to chastise their folly and madness; such a reverence and esteem this unhappy Nation hath ever had of their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, that a seditious Frier (and he happily none of their highest Order neither) could take the Colours in the head of a Regiment, and (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing damnation to those who should presume to march) contrary to the General's command, caused the Soldiers to throw down their Arms, and disband, as fell out in an Expedition at <hi>Kilkenny.</hi> Nor was it possible for the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> to procure Justice to be inflicted in a Civil or Martial way upon an Ecclesiastical Person, let his crime be what it would: since even they whose zeal and affection to his Majesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was unquestionable, and who were as highly offended at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable carriage and proceedings of the Bishops and Clergy as they ought to be, and whose duty was not in the least degree shaken by their Declaration and Excommunication, were yet so tender of those Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Priviledges which were said to belong to the Church, and so jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the behaviour of the People in any case, which should be declared a violation of those Priviledges, that they would by no means have an hand in inflicting capital punishment upon any Church-men, without the approbation and co-operation of the Bishops, who were not like to be so hard-hearted as to consent unto any judgment upon the Accessories in those crimes, in which themselves were the Principal: So that he must not onely have determined by his own single will and judgment, what was to be done in those Cases, but he must have executed those determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations with his own hand. And this consideration obliged the Marquis to all those condescensions and sufferings, and upon all occasions to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to dispose and perswade those Prelates from any obstinate and ruinous resolutions, rather than to declare them to be enemies, whom he could neither reform or punish.</p>
               <p>The Excommunication was no sooner published by the Congregation, and consented and approved by the other part of the Bishops and Clergy,<note place="margin">Upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, People (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing absolved from the Lord Lieutenant) think of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Parliamentari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> sitting at <hi>Galway,</hi> but they quickly discerned how imprudently, as well as unwarrantably they had proceeded in order to their own ends; and that they had taken care onely to dissolve and disband all their Forces, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any kind of provision for the opposition of the Parliaments Forces, who had quickly notice of their ridiculous madness, and were thereupon advancing with their whole Power upon them; the people generally, who foresaw what must be the issue of that confusion, thought of nothing but compounding with the Enemy upon any condition; the Nobility, prime Gentry, and the Commissioners of Trust, who saw their whole Power and Jurisdiction wrested from them, and assumed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised by the Congregation, continued their application to the Lord
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:93738:156"/>
Lieutenant, and desired him not to leave them exposed to the confusion which must attend his departure. The gravest and most pious Clergy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the unskilful spirit of the rest; and even some of the Bishops, and others, who were present at the Congregation, and subscrib'd to the Excommunication, disclaim'd their having consented to it, though they were oblig'd to sign it for conformity: So that they found it necessary within less than three days after the publishing it, to suspend that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sentence; and yet that it might appear how unwillingly they did those acts of sobriety and gentleness, it will not be amiss to set down the Letter it self, which the Titular Bishop of <hi>Clonfert,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Charles Kelly</hi> writ to the Officers of the Army, under the Command of the Lord Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> to that purpose, which was in these words.

                           <hi>Galway,</hi> bearing their sense to suspend the effect of the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication proclaimed by their Orders, till the service at <hi>Athlone</hi> be performed, fearing on the one side a dispersion of the Army, and on the other side have received certain intelligence of the Enemies approach unto that Place, with their full force and number of fighting men, and thereupon would have us concur with them in suspending the said Excommunication<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As for our part, we do judge that suspension to be unnecessary, and full of inconveniencies, which we apprehend may ensue, because the Excommunication may be obeyed, and the service not neglected, if the People were pleased to undertake the service in the Clergies name, without relation to the Lord of <hi>Ormond:</hi> Yet fearing the censure of singularity in a matter of so high a strain against us, or to be deem'd more forward in Excommunicating then others; also fearing the weakness of some (which we believ'd the Congregation fear'd) we are pleas'd to follow the major Vote, and against our own opinion concur with them, and do hereby suspend the said Censure as above; provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that after the Service perform'd, or the Service be thought unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary by the Clergy, or when the said Clergy shall renew it, it shall be presently incurred, as if the said Suspension had never been interposed.

               <p>If this Authentick Truth (of which there is not room for the least doubt) were not inserted, who could believe it possible, that men endu'd with common understanding, and professing the Doctrine of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Allegiance of Subjects, could, upon deliberation, publish such Decrees? And who can wonder that a People, enslaved to, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by such Spiritual Leaders, should become a Prey to any Enemy, though supplied with less power, vigilance, and dexterity, than the Parliaments Forces always were, who have prevailed against them, and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:93738:156"/>
who by all kind of reproaches, rigour, and tyranny, have made that froward and unhappy Congregation pay dear Interest, for the contempt and indignity with which they prosecuted their Sovereign and his Authority.</p>
               <p>His Majesty that now is, being about this time in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the recovery of his Kingdoms, was by the <hi>Kirk</hi> Party, which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd<note place="margin">His Majesties Declaration (beingthen in <hi>Scotland</hi>) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Peace of 1648<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concluded with the Rebels, they being infamous</note> the Power of that Kingdom forced to sign a Declaration, <hi>By which the Peace concluded with the</hi> Irish Catholicks <hi>in</hi> 1648. <hi>by Authority of the late King of ever glorious memory, and confirmed by himself, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and adjudged void, and that his Majesty was absolved from any observation of it:</hi> And this not grounded upon those particular Breaches, Violations, and Affronts, which had been offered to his Majesties Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and contrary to the express Articles, Proviso's, and Promises of that Treaty; but <hi>upon the supposed unlawfulness of concluding any Peace with those Persons, who were branded with many ignominious reproaches.</hi> And though this Declaration in point of time issued after the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication at <hi>James-town,</hi> yet the notice of it came so near the time of the<note place="margin">August 12.</note> publication of the other, that the Clergy inserted it in their Declaration, as if it had been one of the principal Causes of their Excommunication, thereby deluding the People, as if that expedient of their Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had been the onely foundation of security to the Nation, and their particular Fortunes.</p>
               <p>When the Marquis first heard of that Declaration in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he did really believe it a Forgery, contrived either by the Parliament, or the <hi>Irish</hi> Congregation, to seduce the People from their Affection and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to the King; but soon after, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> being assured of its authentickness, he immediately (with the advice of the Commissioners<note place="margin">The Lord Lieutenant (upon the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Kings Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly at <hi>Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reogh,</hi> to clear the doubts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising on the King's Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> of Trust) issued his Orders, (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi>) for the meeting of an Assembly at <hi>Loghreogh,</hi> on the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Novemb.</hi> and in the mean time, on the <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> for the better composing of the minds of men, and preventing those distempers and jealousies which might be infused, he writ from <hi>Enis</hi> to the Commissioners of Trust, and took notice of that Declaration which was published in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and told them, That however the affronts put upon his Majesty had been many, and were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately persisted in to that day, and in such Places, whereupon evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently depended the preservation or loss of the whole Kingdom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had several times given notice to them, and followed the ways ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised by them for the reclaiming the said Places without success; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Declaration gain'd from his Majesty, was without hearing what could be said by the Nation in their own defence, and such as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved it generally (without exception) <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n the guilt of Rebellion; he thought it fit to let them know, <hi>That (since the Declaration was by undue means obtain'd from his Majesty) he was resolved, by all the means it should please God to offer unto him, and through all hazards in the behalf of the Nation, to insist upon, and insert the lawfulness of the conclusion of the Peace, by vertue of the aforesaid Authority, and that the said Peace was still valid and of force, and binding unto his Majesty and all his Subjects: And herein he told them he was resolved, by the help of God, to persist, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til both himself, and such as should in that behalf be intrusted and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised by the Nation, should have free and safe access to his Majesty; and until, upon mature and unrestrained consideration of what might on all sides be said, his Majesty should have declared his Royal pleasure upon those Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:93738:157"/>
that had been put upon his Authority. Provided, that in the mean time, and immediately,</hi> First, <hi>That all the Acts, Declarations, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications issued by the Bishops (met at</hi> James-town <hi>in</hi> August <hi>last) against his Majesties Authority in him, and the Peoples giving obedience thereunto, should be by them revoked; and such assurance given, as should be agreed by him and the Commissioners of Trust, that they nor any of them should attempt the like for the future; and that they should contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves within the bounds prescribed by the Articles of Peace, whereof they are Parties.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That it should be immediately declared by the Commissioners of Trust, that the said Declaration, Excommunication, and other Proceedings of the said Bishops, was an unwarrantable usurpation upon his Majesties just Authority, and in them a violation of the Peace: And that in case the Bishops should not give the assurance before expressed, or having given it, should not observe the same, that they would endeavour to bring the offenders to condign punishment, pursuant unto, and as is prescribed by the Laws of the Kingdom, as disturbers of the Peace of the Kingdom, and obstructors of the means of preserving the same.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That the like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration should be made by all that derive Authority from his Majesty, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Martial, and by the respective Mayors, Aldermen, Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Burgesses, and other Magistrates in all the Corporations of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That the Lord Lieutenant should be permitted to make his free and safe Residence in any Place he should choose, within the Limits not possessed by the Parliament.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>That he should be immediately suffered to Garrison such Places, and in such manner, according to the Articles of Peace, as he should find necessary for the defence of the Kingdom. In the</hi> last place <hi>he wish'd them, That some present course might be taken for his support, in some proportion answerable to his Place, yet with regard to the Kingdom; which last, he said, he should not have proposed, but that he was deprived of all his own Fortune, whereupon he had wholely subsisted ever since his coming into the Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Commissioners of Trust received this Letter with all demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note place="margin">The Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners reply to the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Letter.</note> of respect and satisfaction, and the very next day return him an Answer, in which, after they had lamented the issuing out of that Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they said, <hi>It greatly comforted them to understand, that his Excellency was resolv'd through all hazards in behalf of the Nation to insist upon, and assert the Peace, and persist in so doing, until he, or such as should be intrusted and authorized by the Nation, should have free and safe access unto his Majesty: And as to those Proviso's which were expressed as necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions for the continuing amo<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>st them his Majesties Authority, which (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Declaration they said, they did still reverence and embrace (beside their general profession to act what lay within their power in the ways of his Majesties service) for his Excellencies satisfaction, they return'd these ensuing Answers. As to the</hi> first, <hi>concerning the revocation of those Acts, Declarations, and Excommunications issued by the Bishops, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance demanded, that nothing in that kind should be attempted for the future. They said, That his Excellency, to whom they had often express'd their resentment of their proceedings, might be confident, they would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as far as in them lay to see his Excellency satisfi'd in that particular; and to that end they would all, or some of them, with his allowance, and as he should think fit, repair to</hi> Galway <hi>to treat with the Prelates on that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:93738:157"/>
Subject. Unto the</hi> second, <hi>they answered, That albeit they knew by those Censures of the Bishops his Majesties Authority was invaded, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warranted Government set up, contrary to the Laws of the Kingdom, and that they were assured, no Subject could be justly warranted by that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, to deny Obedience to his Majesties Authority in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; yet being of opinion, that a publick Declaration of that kind in that conjuncture of Affairs, ought properly, and would with more countenance and Authority move from an Assembly than from them; and that by such a publick Declaration than from themselves, they should wholely obstruct the way to prevail with the Prelates to withdraw those Acts, which was desired by the former Proposition, and likewise endanger the Union that was necessary at present in opposing the common Enemy, and prejudice the hopes of a more perfect Union for the future, wherein the preservation of the Nation would principally consist. They did therefore humbly beseech his Excellency to call an Assembly of the Nation, from whom such a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as might be effectual in that behalf, and might settle those Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could onely proceed: Tet if in the mean time, and before the meeting of that Assembly, those Censures then suspended should be revived, they would endeavour to suppress their influence upon the People by such a Declaration as should become Loyal Subjects, and men entrusted to see all due obedience unto his Majesties Government over the whole Kingdom. To the</hi> third <hi>they answered, That they would, at all times, and in such manner as his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency should think fit to prescribe, invite all his Majesties</hi> Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Subjects to such a Declaration, which yet, until they should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Clergies sense upon the first Proviso, they said, they did humbly as fit for a time to forbear. To the</hi> fourth, <hi>they answered, That whatsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Excellency should find to be within their power, and would direct to be done concerning the Place of Residence for his Person, they would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily obey his Lordships command therein. To the</hi> fifth <hi>they answered, That upon conference with his Excellency of the Places fit to be Garrison'd, and the number of Men fit to be put in them, they would, according to the Articles of Peace, use their utmost endeavours to have such Garrisons, so agreed upon, admitted. And to the</hi> last <hi>they said, They had at all times been ready and willing, that his Excellencies Charge should be supported out of the Revenue of the Kingdom; and that they were now ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in assigning any of the Dues already accrued, or such as should grow due hereafter, or to impose any new Allotment upon the Subject towards his maintenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Lord Lieutenant perceived, that the temper and desire of the Commissioners of Trust was so different from that of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and that in truth they were afflicted and scandalized at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancy of the other; and that they thought they should be able to reduce them from the destructive Counsels they were engaged in: He would not, upon any experience or judgment of his own, restrain them from attempting what was not impossible to compass, and which many<note place="margin">The Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners of Trust go to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Congregation at <hi>Galway,</hi> but could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to reason.</note> would have concluded would be compassed if attempted, and which, what other effect soever it had, would make evident, that there was not a concurrence in the Nation in those Acts which were likely to destroy the Kingdom: And therefore he willingly consented, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners should go to <hi>Gallway,</hi> where the Committee of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation resided, whereof the Bishop of <hi>Ferns</hi> was one, to whom they
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:93738:158"/>
shewed the Letter they received from the Lord Lieutenant, and desired them to consider the state of the Kingdom, and to know from them what they conceiv'd remain'd, that might best tend to the preservation of the Nation, without keeping the Kings Authority amongst them; for that many of the most considerable would instantly make their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the Enemy, if the Kings Authority were taken away; and that there was no hope of keeping or leaving that Authority, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the Excommunication and Declaration: For the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant would not stay to keep it, nor would he leave it, nor the Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> undergo it, but on these terms: And hereupon they used all those Reasons and Arguments which cannot but occur to all men, who are not blinded with Passion and Prejudice, to induce them to such a Retraction, as could onely advance the happiness, or indeed the subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of the Nation.</p>
               <p>But the Bishops were inexorable, and instead of abating any of that<note place="margin">The Bishops grew high, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant had sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested the grounds for his Majesties late Declaration. Motions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their former Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy.</note> fury they had formerly express'd, (that added new contumelies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to all the Authority of the King they said, They observ'd by the Lord Lieutenants Letter, that he had informed his Majesty of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obediences and Affronts that had been put upon his Authority, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, that he had suggested matter unto his Majesty, for making that <hi>Declaration against the Peace:</hi> That they had perused the Declaration which had been published in <hi>Scotland,</hi> disavowing the Peace: And that they were of opinion, for ought appeared to them, <hi>That the King had withdrawn his Commission and Authority from the Lord Lieutenant:</hi> That in the said Declaration, <hi>the Irish Nation (as bloody Rebels) were cast from the protection of the Kings Laws and Regal Favours.</hi> And therefore it might be presum'd, that he would not have his Authority kept over such a Nation to govern them; whereas they had been of opinion, (and all their endeavours had been employ'd) to keep the Kings Authority over them: But when his Majesty throws away the Nation as Rebels from his protection, (withdrawing his own Authority) they could not understand the mystery of preserving the same with them, or over them, nor how it could be done: That they believed the best remedy (the Kings Authority being taken away by that Declaration) of meeting the Inconveniency, of the Peoples closing with the Parliament, is the returning to the Confederacy, as they said was intended by the Nation, in case of the breach of Peace on his Majesties part; that, they said, would keep an union amongst them, if men would not be precipitately guilty of the breach of their Oath of Association, which Oath, by two solemn Orders of two several Assemblies, was to continue binding, if any breach of the Articles of Peace should happen on his Majesties part: That the Kings Authority and the Lord Lieutenants Commission being recalled by that Declaration, they were of opinion, that the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant had no Authority to delegate his Authority to any other. And if they must expose their Lives and Fortunes to the hazard of fighting to the making good of that Peace, seeing the danger was alike to defend that, or get a better Peace, why should they bind themselves within the limits of those Articles so disowned? And so with several Tautologies, <hi>urged the Declaration in</hi> Scotland, <hi>as a ground and excuse for all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,</hi> when what they had done (as we have before took notice of) was before the issuing forth of that Declaration. In fine, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, they could not consent with safety of Conscience to the revoking
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:93738:158"/>
their Declaration and Excommunication demanded by the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, nor to give assurance to him, or the Commissioners of Trust, for not attempting the like for the future. And to manifest their inveterate malice against him, being in <hi>Galway</hi>) the Captain of the Guard of the Town, commonly called, <hi>The Captain of the Guard of the young men,</hi> did make search for him in the said Town as after a criminal person, or a fugitive, thereby endeavouring to bring contempt and scorn upon him, and his Majesties Authority placed in him.</p>
               <p>And now you must know, they would not make this Declaration in<note place="margin">The Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee's Reasons why they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord Lieutenant, &amp;c. and his reply.</note> case of Conscience of so vast an extent and importance, without (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) setting down their Reasons under their hands, which (for the Doctrine sake) I would not conceal from the world, that it may better judge of those Spiritual Guides, who made themselves guilty of that mass of mischief and ruine that flowed from thence.</p>
               <p>Their first Reason was, Because the Kings Authority was not in the Lord Lieutenant, nor was then (they said) power in them to confer a new Authority on him, which would be destructive to the Nation if it continued in him, and preservative in another; and that, they said, was their sense when they declared against the Kings Authority in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; so that though they had presumption enough to take the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority out of his Lieutenants hands by their Declaration and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and to inhibit all men to submit unto it, they had now mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty to confess, they had not power to confer any new Authority on, their Faculty of destroying being more prevalent than that of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving.</p>
               <p>Their second Reason was, They feared they should lose the few Churches remaining under his Government, as they had lost under him all the Churches in the Cities of <hi>Waterford, Kilkenny, Wexford, Ross, Clonmel, Cashel, Featherd, Kilmallock,</hi> and the rest; in which, they said, they agreed with the <hi>Maccabees, Maximus vero &amp; primus pro sanctitate timor erat Templi:</hi> By whose ill Government those Cities were lost, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what hath been said before, and how well the few that were then left were kept, after they had forced the Marquis to depart the Kingdom, is well known to the World.</p>
               <p>The third Reason they thought fit, was, Because the Lord Lieutenant had declared at <hi>Cork,</hi> that he would maintain, during his life, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, according to the example of the best Reformed Churches; which might be the same with the Covenant for ought they knew. They said, They could not expect from him the defence of the Catholick Religion, which was a strange objection against a Protestant Lieutenant of a Protestant King, under whose Government they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be desirous to live: And whatsoever had been declared by the Lord Lieutenant at <hi>Cork</hi> in that particular, before the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace, and Published and Printed the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1648. and well known to the Bishops, who after the same, and notwithstanding that Declaration, with all demonstrations of cheerfulness gave their consents to that Peace, which they now think fit to break, because of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</p>
               <p>The fourth Reason was cast in the same mould, The scandal over the World, to make choice of one of a different Religion, especially in <hi>Rome,</hi> where his Holiness expected, that a Catholick Governour should be placed over them, (according to his Agreement or Articles (as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported)
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93738:159"/>
with the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> which the Marquis knew to be an aspersion) and they said, They did fear the scourges of the War, and the Plague that had faln so heavy upon them, were some evidence of Gods anger for putting Gods Cause and the Churches under such an hand; whereas that trust might have been managed in a Catholicks hand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Kings Authority. Which Reason indeed had most ingenuity in it; and whensoever they digested their malice and their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in those Personal Reproaches and Calumnies, which they knew to be most untrue, if they had frankly declared and excepted against him for being a Protestant, they had more complied with the dictates and integrities of their hearts. And yet it might appear a very unskilful and imprudent suggestion, to make the humour of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Rule of obedience to their Sovereign, and to discourse of choosing a Person of what Religion they thought fit to be his Vice-gerent; as if they, not he, were to be consulted in it, which would administer much cause of jealousie unto a Protestant King, and to his Protestant Subjects, if it were not well known to them, that some of the Catholick Nobility and Gentry of the Nation were Enemies (at least seemingly) to those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, that unhappy part of the Catholick Bishops did broach and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate, which alone have reduced that Nation to the calamities it then and since underwent.</p>
               <p>The fifth Reason, that they should find no favour nor countenance, but reproach and disgrace from any Catholick Prince, Church, or Laity, while the Marquis Governed; when in truth, since that time, and that their proceedings have been taken notice of, the Catholick Princes have looked upon them as incapable of any succour or countenance, and have accordingly left them to the rage of their Persecutors. Their other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were more Vulgar, and too often before recited; exceptions to his Person, in respect of the ill success of his Conduct, and the prejudice the People had to him in regard of the same: And the too considerable Corporations remaining (which were <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Galway</hi>) were at so great distance with the Lord Lieutenant, that they were resolved to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear (as in their intentions and actions they conceiv'd they were) faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Crown, and obedient to the Kings Authority, if placed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Person. To which suggestions, nothing need to be added to what hath been said in this Discourse, of the demeanor of those particular Places; nor can the observation be avoided, <hi>That it was the natural practice of this Congregation, to use all their industry and artifice to infuse jealousie and sedition into the People, and distrust and obstinacy into the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations; and then to urge that jealousie, prejudice, and indisposition of the People and Corporations, to countenance any thing they thought fit to do or oppose.</hi> They concluded, that the event of War being uncertain, if the Nation should be reduced to a condition of agreeing with the Enemy, the Lord Lieutenant would not be a fit man to agree for the exercise of their Religion, for their Churches, Altars, or any thing concerning the same. And therefore they said, That the best way that occurred to them in this pressing exigency, for the union of the Nation, and keeping them from agreeing with the Enemy, was, <hi>That the Marquis of Clanrickard,</hi> (in whom, according to the sense of the Congregation at <hi>James-town,</hi> they desired the Kings Authority should be left) that he might Govern the Nation, with the consent of all Parties, and the Kings Authority be taken away from the Lord Lieutenant until an Assembly: And to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:93738:159"/>
that end, that a free and lawful Assembly might be made, to sit to judge upon the Peoples preservation, and to decree and order what should be best and safest for the defence of the Nation. Touching the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be kept over them, and the Peace to be asserted and made good, or to renew the Association, or any thing else they should find best and most expedient, and unto that they would willingly submit; for they said, they never intended to hinder an Assembly, or to give Laws to the People; all that they endeavour'd was, to defend the Altars, and Souls entrusted to them: And as they were of opinion, that the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would follow the Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> and the People obey him, so they would contribute their best endeavours to that effect. They further gave assurance, that if any free and lawful Assembly (upon due consideration of their own state and condition) should find it the best way, for their own safety and preservation, to make an Agreement with the Enemy, as they intended never<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the grace of God, to grant away from them by an Affirmative consent to the Churches and Altars, (if forced from them, they were blameless) so would they not hinder the People from compounding with the Enemy for the safety of their Lives and Estates, when no way of offence was appearing, though, upon such an Agreement, they saw, that they alone should probably be losers of Lives, States, Churches, Altars, Immunities, and Liberties: But in such Contracts with the Enemy, if any should happen (which they wished God would avert) they should pray and conjure the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> that that of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> might be recorded of them to future Ages, <hi>Erat pro uxoribus &amp; filiis pro fratribus &amp; cognatis minor solicitudo, maximus vero &amp; primus pro sanctitate erat timor Templi.</hi> And this was the Answer delivered to the Commissioners of Trust, upon the <hi>5th.</hi> day of <hi>November,</hi> 1650. at <hi>Galway,</hi> by the Bishops of <hi>Killala, Ferns, Kilmacduogh, Clonfert, Kilfinara,</hi> and <hi>Dromore,</hi> (after several and long Conferences, with the Commissioners of Trust, who were Authorised by the Nation) unto the Proposals presented by the Commissioners to the Committee of the Congregation, the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1650.</p>
               <p>Here we cannot avoid observing, by the express words of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, upon their Reasons in their Conference with the Commissioners, that though they seem'd to desire, that the Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> (whose zeal to the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> and Interest in the Nation, was so notorious and confessed, that they durst not publickly repine at his known affection and integrity to the King) might govern the Nation with the consent of all Parties, and that the Kings Authority in the Lord Lieutenant might be left in him; yet they declared, they meant it should onely be until an Assembly (which they well knew, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press terms of the Articles of Peace, could be onely lawfully conven'd by the Lord Lieutenant) and then that Assembly should judge of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples preservation, and to decree and order what should be the best and safest for the defence of the Nation; touching the Kings Authority to be<note place="margin">The Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates violent for an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that their Affairs might be ordered by them.</note> kept over them, the Peace to be asserted and made good, or to renew the Association, or any thing else they should find best and most expedient: So that they intended no other Honour to the Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> than that by his countenance and reputation they might perswade the Lord Lieutenant to leave the Kings Authority behind him, and that he should call an Assembly (which they would otherwise do themselves) which they were sure should be constituted, for the most part, of such
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:93738:160"/>
Men, as would follow their Dictates, by which himself should be divested of that Power, and the King deposed from any further Dominion over them, when they perswade any foreign Prince to take them into his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; which practice they quickly set on foot. And for the further manifestation of their Affection and Loyalty to the King, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure should be called yet in question, it is observable, that these Men, who had so often contradicted and controuled the express Acts of every Assembly, that had been convened since the beginning of these Troubles, and now commanded the People, under pain of damnation, not to yield any obedience to the King's Authority in his Lieutenant, and declared, that they could not (with the safety of their Consciences) consent to the Propositions which he had lately made, for the uniting the Nation in defence of the Peace, so advantagious to their Liberty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which the Commissioners, intrusted by and for the Nation, thought so reasonable: These Men, I say, made no scruple of professing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that if an Assembly, upon due consideration of their state and condition, should find it the best way for their safety and preservation, to make an Agreement with the Enemy, they would not hinder the People from compounding with them, for the safety of their Lives and States:<note place="margin">After all, the Confederates agree, that if compounding with the Enemy should be best for the People, that should be consented to.</note> Which being seriously considered, we cannot sufficiently wonder, at the strange stupid resignation of their Understandings, who believed (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the wonderful contempt of those Understandings, which would be perswaded to believe) that this Congregation had loyal Purposes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the King, or that they never intended to hinder the Assembly, or give Law to the People, when they cancell'd all fundamental Laws broke through all Acts of their own Assembly, and forbad the People to pay any obedience to the King's Vicegerent, who had only the lawful Power of Government over them.</p>
               <p>The more extravagant and unreasonable these Proceedings were of the Congregation and Clergy, the more confident many honest and wise Men were, that the Assembly of the Nation would regulate and controul that il-limited Power, and utterly dis-avow all that they had done; and therefore they who were exceedingly offended and enraged against the Congregation, were solicitous and importunate with the Lord Lieutenant to call an Assembly: And though he had too much experience of the Nature and Temper of the People, and of the transcendent Power the Clergy should still have over any Assembly, or at least over the People, when the Assembly had done what it could, to hope for any good effect from it: And though he saw, he should thereby the more expose his own Honour, and (which he considered more) the Dignity of his Master, to new Insolencies; yet since he resolved to leave the Kingdom himself, and was only un-resolved, whether he should leave the King's Authority behind him, liable to the same Indignities and Affronts, in the Person of the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> which it had been subject to in his own, and could have no kind of assurance that it should not, but by the Professions and Protestations of an Assembly, he did resolve to call one, and issued out his Letters for their meeting upon the 15th. of <hi>November,</hi> 1650. at <hi>Loghreogh,</hi> where they met accordingly. And the Bishops, for remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">The Assembly at <hi>Loghreogh,</hi> before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, meets: the Result there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</note> (as they said) of any Jealousies that any might apprehend of their Proceedings, declared and protested, <hi>That by their Excommunication and Declaration at</hi> James-town, <hi>they had no other aim, than the preservation of the Catholick Religion, and the People; and that they did not purpose to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:93738:160"/>
make any visible Usurpation on his Majesty's Authority, nor on the Liberty of the People, confessing, that it did not belong to their Jurisdiction so to do.</hi> With which Protestation (so contrary to what they had done, and which in truth they had so often made, even at the time they did all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it) the Assembly was satisfied, and did not so much as make another Protestation, that the Bishops had done what they ought not to do, nor exact a Promise from them, that they would not do the like in time to come. So that the Lord Lieutenant was resolv'd to look no more for satisfaction from them, nor expose the King's Authority any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by leaving any Deputy behind him, but prepared for his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>When the Assembly understood his Resolution, and saw plainly that he was even ready to depart, his Goods and many of his Servants being on Ship-board, they sent four Members, the Lord <hi>Dillon, Clanrickard,</hi> &amp;c. of their House, to him at <hi>Kilcogan,</hi> with an Instrument in writing, (bearing date from <hi>Loghreogh,</hi> the 7th. of <hi>December</hi>) in which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, (concerning the Excommunication and Declaration) what the Bishops had protested in that Assembly; and of his Excellency's Letter; dated the 16th. of <hi>November</hi> last, recommending to them, as the chief End for which that Assembly was called, the removing of all Divisions, as the best way to their Preservation. <hi>They the said Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Gentry met in that Assembly, conceiv'd, That there was not a better Foundation or Ground for their Union, than the holding to and obeying his Majesty's Authority, to which they owed and ought to pay all dutiful Obedience: And they did thereby declare and protest, That their Allegiance unto his Majesty's Authority was such, and so inherent in them, that they would not be withdrawn from the same, nor was there any Power in the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, Gentry or People, Clergy or Laity of the Kingdom, that could alter, change, or take away his Majesty's Authority, they holding that to be the chief Flower of the Crown, and the support of the Peoples Liberty, which they did thereby protest, declare and avow, and that they did esteem the same, and obedience thereunto, essentially, inviolably, and justly due from them, and the chiefest means under God, to uphold their Union and Preservation: And they said, They did unanimously beseech his Excellency, in his great affection to the advancement of his Majesty's Service, and his hearty desires of the Nations Preservation, to which, they said, he had Relations of the highest Concernment in Blood, Alliance, and Interest, to leave that Authority with them, in some Person faithful to his Majesty, and acceptable to the Nation: To which Person, when he should be made known to them, they would not only afford all due obedience, but would also offer</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Though the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant had been so used, as not to be confident of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he yet at their Request deputes the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> Deputy, at the same time charging their Crimes home.</note> 
                  <hi>and propose the best ways and means, that God would please to direct them to, for the preservation of his Majesties Rights, and the Peoples Interests and Liberties, and for the begetting a ready obedience in all Places and Persons, unto his Majesty's Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Advice (though it carried with it a particular Respect from the Assembly unto the Lord Lieutenant, and an acknowledgement of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and hearty Affections he had always had, for his Majesty's Interest and Service in that Kingdom, contrary to the scandalous Declaration) gave not the Marquess the least confidence, that his Majesty's Authority could find more respect in the Person of another, than it had met with in him: Therefore he writ to them by the same Messengers, <hi>That he had sent</hi> the Authority <hi>to the Lord Marquess of</hi> Clanrickard, <hi>to govern that

his Majesty's Kingdom and People, provided, that their Declaration might be so far explain'd, as to give the Marquess of</hi> Clanrickard <hi>full satisfaction, that the expressions they made, touching the obedience they owed and resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay unto his Majesty's Authority,</hi> was meant, the Authority placed in his Lordship, or any other Governour, deriving or holding his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from his Majesty: <hi>And that they esteem it not in the power of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Congregation, or Assembly whatsoever, to discharge or set the People free from obeying his Lordship, or any other such Governour, during the continuance of the said Authority in him; without which, he said, he could not (in Duty to his Majesty) leave his Authority, subject to be tossed to and fro, at the uncertain Fancies of any Man or Men, and without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of saving the Nation, which could be no otherwise effected, than by an absolute chearful obedience of the People, unto the Authority placed over them.</hi> And so having directed the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> (who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to that Charge out of pure obedience, and only that he might not decline the Service, which they would say would have preserv'd the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) not to assume the Charge, except the Assembly gave him full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the Particulars required by him, the Lord Lieutenant (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed<note place="margin">The Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant departs the Kingdom, Lord <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> &amp;c.</note> by the Lord <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> Colonel <hi>Vaughan,</hi> Colonel <hi>Wogan,</hi> Colonel <hi>Warren,</hi> and some 20 more Persons of Honour) about the middle of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> embarqued himself at <hi>Galway,</hi> (in a small Frigat called the <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> of 28 Tuns, and 4 Guns) for <hi>France,</hi> after he had refused to receive a Pass from <hi>Ireton,</hi> who offer'd it, choosing rather the Seas and Winds, in that rough and blusterous season of the year, than to receive an obligation from him, having upon the most abstracted Considerations of Honour and Conscience, faithfully adhered to his Majesty and the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> without any regard had to his own Estate and Fortune, as in the Act of Settlement, <hi>fol.</hi> 99. is at large exprest. And after being tossed at Sea for the space of some weeks, and his other Ships, in which his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Goods, and many other Passengers were lost, he arrived in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> at St. <hi>Malos</hi> in <hi>Britany;</hi> from whence he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and soon after into <hi>Flanders;</hi> thence he was imployed in a Service answerable to his Fidelity, touching the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> (then in the Talons of the Jesuits) whom with singular Prudence and Success he recovered: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he was imbarqued in many Concerns of the Crown, to the hazard of his Person; whilst the Lord <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> who had run the Gantlet on all sides, retired into <hi>Holland,</hi> a Person certainly of much Valour and good Conduct, shewing both in an exemplary manner, whilst he engaged for either Party: Nor can his change of Sides (to which some say he was too mutable) be so properly imputed to any defect of Judgement, as the unhappy Crisis of the Times; his own expressions making it clear, <hi>That had all things been the same they were pretended to be, he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as he was; but Impostures being discovered, he thought it ill to persist in their Fellowship.</hi> Afterwards indeed he chang'd his Religion, and thereby gave a suspicion, that though he fought against his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he had a reverence for their Idea. Certain it is, he affected much to be President of <hi>Munster,</hi> nor could any thing have barr'd him of it, since his Majesty's happy Return, wherein <hi>his Servants</hi> had the fruits of their Fidelity, but his change of Religion, which equally prejudiced the Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> in the Presidency of <hi>Connaght,</hi> truely observable in them both.</p>

                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:93738:161"/>We have before spoken of four Commissioners sent from the Parliament, who as soon as they arrived in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (it is necessary to tell you) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently applied themselves to the Work afore-mention'd; they set out some Proclamations, and travelled into the several Provinces of the Kingdom, using the best means they could to raise Moneys by Sequestrations, and other ways; but by reason of the multitudes of Rebels which infested all the Garrisons, and came up so continually about them, little was to be done in that way.</p>

               <p>There was then in the possession of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> the entire Province of <hi>Connaght,</hi> in which they had the strong Castle of <hi>Athlone,</hi> the strong and important Town and Harbour of <hi>Gallway, Sligo,</hi> and many other lesser Forts and Places of strength. They had also a good part of the Province of <hi>Munster,</hi> and in it the City of <hi>Limerick,</hi> which by the strong situation of it, and the advantages it might have from Sea, could alone (with the help of <hi>Gallway</hi>) have maintain'd War against all the Parliaments Forces in <hi>Ireland.</hi> They had many Parties of Horse and Foot in <hi>Leimster, Munster</hi> and <hi>Ulster,</hi> under <hi>Clanrickard, Castlehaven, Dillon, Muskery,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Westmeath, Hugh O Neal, Dungan, Moor, Preston,</hi> and others, which being drawn together, would have constituted a greater Army than the Enemies were Masters of. And the Marquess of <hi>Clanric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard</hi> had argument enough of hope, if he could have been confident of the union of the Nation; and that he might reasonably have promised himself, if he could have been confident of the Affection and Integrity of the Clergy, which at length they promised with that solemnity, that if he had not confided therein, the fault would have been imputed to him, for they could do no more (on their part) to create a belief in him. He was therefore content to take the Charge upon him, and obliged them presently to consider of the way to keep all the Forces together, when he should have drawn them together, and to secure the two Towns of <hi>Gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> and <hi>Limerick</hi> with strong Garrisons, which was the first Work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on all hands necessary to be performed.</p>
               <p>Very few days had passed, (after the Lord Deputy had upon such their<note place="margin">The Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the good Condition they were in, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to the Deputy, think of treating with <hi>Ireton.

And when the same was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with indignation, by the major part of the Assembly, the Bishop of <hi>Ferns</hi> himself who had so lately importuned the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> to assume the Charge of Lord Deputy, and made such ample promises in the Name of the Clergy) seem'd to concur with those who were against treating with the Enemy, but instead of it very earnestly pressed, <hi>That they might</hi> (in order to their better defence) <hi>return to their ancient Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:93738:162"/>
and so proceed in their Preservation, without any respect to the King's Authority.</hi> And this Motion found such concurrence in the Assembly, from the Bishops, Clergy, and many others, that many of the Officers<note place="margin">Others offer to return to their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, without respect to the King. Some yet seem'd affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the King.</note> of the Army, and some of the principalest of the Nobility and Gentry, found it necessary to express more than ordinary passion in their contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: <hi>They told them, They now manifested, that it was not their Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Marquess of</hi> Ormond, <hi>nor their Zeal to Religion, that had transported them, but their dislike of the King's Authority, and their reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to withdraw themselves from it: That they themselves would constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly submit to it, and defend it with their utmost hazard, as long as they should be able; and when they should be reduced to Extremity, (that treating with the Enemy could no longer be deferred) they would (in that Treaty) make no provision for them, but be contented that they should be excluded from any benefit thereof, who were so forward to exclude the King's Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon these bold though necessary Menaces, to which they had not been accustomed, the Clergy and their Party seem'd to acquiesce, and promised all concurrence; inasmuch as from this very time, all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Jealousies which had been before amongst them, seem'd (out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly) quieted, though the <hi>Irish</hi> (in all Quarters of which the Enemy were possessed) not only submitted and compounded, but very many of them enter'd into their Service, and marched with them in their Armies; and the Lord Deputy grew as much into their dis-favour, as the Lord Lieutenant had been; and his being a Friend to the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> destroyed all that Confidence, which his being a Papist had merited from them.</p>
               <p>The Lord Deputy hereupon, and in consideration of many resorting to the Parliaments Quarters, issued forth this Proclamation.

The Enemy being then within less then a Mile, with their main Body, and onely a narrow Pass between them, which the Lord Deputy doubted not to defend, until all his Forces should come up, and then resolved to sight them, which was the onely thing he desired, and thought himself to be in a very good posture to do it: But the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> before he would advance to the Lord Deputy, thought it convenient to secure a single Pass over the River <hi>Shannon,</hi> whereby the Enemy might possibly get over, that so the Enemy might be entirely engaged, where the Lord Deputy was without any danger in the Rear; But by the time the Earl had marched some miles, he heard the report of Muskets, and looking back, he saw the two Troops of Horse he had left to secure that Pass, and the 60 Foot, running, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persing, without being pursued; for the Enemy having Intelligence of the Earl's march, sent over 2 or 3 Boats with Musketiers from the other side of the River, and landed without opposition at the Castle scituate on the Pass. Upon which news (notwithstanding the Earl's Commands or Intreaties) his Army in that Consternation, (without the sight of an Enemy) fled and disbanded; insomuch, that of 4000 which in the morning the Body consisted of, the Earl brought not with him to the Place where the Lord Deputy was, above 40 Horse; whereupon the Lord Deputy saw he was in no case to engage the Enemy; that he should be quickly attacked in the Rear, by that part of the Army which had already, and speedily would pass the River; and that the same fright pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed his men, who had hitherto kept the Bridge, and who now began to yield ground; and that in truth, very many of his Souldiers had that night run away; And thereupon he drew off, and marched away, both Horse and Foot: (when they were gotten out of danger of the Enemies pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit,) And from this time, the Lord Deputy could never draw any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and firm Body into the Field, nor make any opposition to the Enemies Progress; The <hi>Irish</hi> in all Places submitting to, and compounding with

                  </note> Lord Viscount <hi>Taaff,</hi> who had been an Eye-Witness of all his Proceedings, and had in vain labour'd to compose and dispose the minds of the Clergy to the Kings Service, to give the King an Account of the Affairs of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and how impossible it would be to preserve his Authority in that Kingdom, without some more then ordinary Supplies from abroad; which joyning with the most considerable and Loyal Part of the <hi>Irish,</hi> might have kept the Refractory in awe. His Lordship landed in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> the King being then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and quickly understood how unlikely his Journey into that Kingdom was, to advance the Business upon which he came, or indeed that he should be admitted to the Presence of the King, from whom most were remov'd that attended him thither; and thereupon he staid in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and found an opportunity to present the Condition of the Papists of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in such manner, to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> (who being nearly Allied to the King always, professed singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affection to his Majesty and his Interest) as in the end, he prevail'd with him to send them some Relief; And assoon as it was known that the Lord Lieutenant was landed in <hi>France,</hi> the Duke sent a Person of Principal Trust about him (the Abbot of St. <hi>Katharines</hi>) into <hi>Ireland,</hi> with a Credential, as his Ambassador to the Clergy, and Catholick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry of that Kingdom, to treat with them, in order to their receiving Aid and Supplies from the Duke; and to the end, that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness might in truth understand in what Capacity they were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and how much they could themselves contribute thereunto; it being not then known that the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> had left the Kings Authority behind him, but rather conceiv'd, that upon those many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations and Affronts which had been offered to him, he had withdrawn (with his Person) the Countenance and Authority they had so much undervalued, and so little deserved.

                  <hi>he would consent to any thing that was reasonable for him to undertake.</hi> Hereupon, the Lord Deputy appointed a Committee of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of Trust, together with some Prelates, to confer with the Ambassador, to receive any Overtures from him, and to present them
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93738:165"/>
with their Advice thereupon unto him. They met accordingly, and receiv'd the Propositions from the Ambassador; but they were so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to the professions he had made of respect to the King, and indeed so inconsistent with the Kings Honour and Interest, as there was great reason to suspect, that they proceeded rather from the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Contrivance of the <hi>Irish,</hi> then from his own temper and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; and this was the more believ'd, when instead of returning the Propositions to the Lord Deputy, they kept the same in their own hands, put out some of those who were appointed by him to be of the Committee, and chose others in their Places, and proceeded in the Treaty, without giving the Deputy an Account of what was demanded by the Ambassador, or what they thought fit to offer unto him. Of all which the Deputy took notice, and thereupon forbade them to proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that way, and restrain'd them unto certain Articles which he sent them, which contain'd what he thought fit to offer to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, and gave them Power onely to Treat: Notwithstanding his positive Direction, they proceeded in that Treaty with the Ambassador, and sent an Advice to the Lord Deputy to consent unto the Articles propos'd by him, since they said he would not recede from what he had proposed, and that it was much better to submit to the same, then that the Treaty should be broken off. The Lord Deputy as positively declared, that what was demanded, was so derogatory to the Honour of the King his Master, and destructive to his Interest, as he would never agree to it, and resolved presently to leave the Town. And when the Ambassador sent to him to desire to see him, and take his leave of him, he absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refused, and sent him word, <hi>That he would never pay his Civility to,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>When the Prelates saw that no obstinacy in the Ambassador, nor Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity from them, could prevail with the Lord Deputy, to shew what influence they had upon that Treaty, they perswaded the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador to consent to the same Propositions he had formerly (no doubt by the same Advice) rejected; and thereupon to make the sum formerly disbursed by the Duke at his coming out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> full 20000 <hi>l.</hi> and the Lord Deputy sent a couple of Gentlemen <note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Nicholas Plunket, Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey Brown</hi> Esquires.</note> into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to Treat further with the Duke of <hi>Lorraign,</hi> according to such Commissions and Instructions as he gave them.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:93738:165"/>
and that the greatest Statesmen, Souldiers, Citizens, and People disobeying, and now obstinate, are and were delivered to Satan, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forsaken of God, and unworthy of Victory, and of his Holy Blessing; And thereupon he said, he did with all sincerity and charity offer his own humble opinion what was to be done by them, which was to the end, the Agreement they were making with his Highness the Duke of</hi> Lorraign, <hi>might become profitable to the Nation, and acceptable in the eyes of God, that they would immediately with humble hearts, make a Submission unto his Holiness in the name of the Nation, and beg the Apostolical Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the light of Wisdom, the Spirit of Fortitude, Vertue, Grace, Success, and the Blessing of God, might return again to them: He told them the necessity of doing this was the greater, for that the Person from whom they came with Authority, (the Marquess of</hi> Clanrickard <hi>the Lord Deputy) was for several causes Excommunicated,</hi> a jure &amp; Homine, <hi>and that he was at</hi> Rome <hi>reputed the great Contemner of the Authority and Dignity of Churchmen, and a Persecutor of the Lord Nuncio, and some Bishops, and other Churchmen; And after many rude and bitter reproaches against the Deputy, he used these words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Do you think God will prosper a Contract grounded upon the Authority of such a man? and shortly after, he said that if the Duke of</hi> Lorraign <hi>were rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Business, he would never enter upon a Bargain to preserve or rather restore Holy-Religion in the Kingdom, with Agents bringing their Authority from a withered cursed Hand: And then concluded for my part (upon the denial to hear my humble Prayers, which I hope will not happen) I will withdraw my self as a man dispairing of any fruit to come from an unfound Trunk, where there is no Sap of Grace: And am resolved to communicate no more with you in that Affair, but rather to let the Prince know, he was building his Resolutions of doing good upon an unhallowed foundation, and that God therefore (unless himself will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to obtain an Absolution for the Nation) will not give him the Grace to lay down the</hi> Lapis Angularis <hi>of his own house again, in that Kingdom.</hi> This Letter bare date at <hi>Bruxels</hi> the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1651. the Persons to whom it was directed, being then in the same Town.</p>
               <p>What the issue of that Treaty was, and what regard there was had therein to the King's Honour, we have (in the next Place) reason to mention; And the rather for that those, whom the Marquess of <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickard</hi> authorized to Treat with the Duke of <hi>Lorraign,</hi> had most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiously wav'd his Instructions, resuming to themselves a Deputation and Authority from the People and Kingdom of <hi>Ireland;</hi> An Insolency so great, as the Lord Deputy resents it with a just Indignation.

                              <head>An Agreement betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> the 4th. Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and <hi>Theobald</hi> Lord Viscount <hi>Taaff,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Plunket,</hi> and <hi>Jeffrey Brown,</hi> deputed and authorized by the People and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                              </head>
                              <p n="1">1. THe most Illustrious Duke is to be vested with Royal Power, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of Protector Royal of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="2">2. Because Religion is the prime End and Subject of the Treaty, all is to begin with an Imploring Application to the Pope, for his Paternal Benediction and Help, That he will not be wanting in things Spiritual or Temporal; in consideration whereof it is Protested, that constant perpetual Obsequiousness of Duty and Faithfulness, shall be paid to his Holiness, and the Apostolick See.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. In consideration of this Royal Protector's Power granted, the Duke is by War to prosecute the Kings Enemies, and afford him all possible Assistance.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. The said Duke is to do nothing in Derogation of the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Jurisdiction in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but rather to amplifie it: And having restored the Kingdom and Religion to its due pristine Estate, he is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign cheerfully the Kingdom to the King.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. Before Resignation as aforesaid, the Duke is to be re-imbursed all by him pre-impended in this Business; and for this Re-imbursment, a general and exact Obedience to the Duke, in Faith and Fidelity from the Kingdom and People, is made and to be observ'd, without reservation to any other Superiority whatsoever.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. The Duke is not to fail on his part, to expel out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Enemies to the King and his Religion, and to recover and defend all things belonging to the faithful Subjects of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="7">7. The Duke is Solely and Absolutely to exercise all Military Power for the present and future in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as to the nomination of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and guiding all Martial Proceedings at his own Pleasure, and in his own Person, unless he in his absence substitute some other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Person.</p>
                              <p n="8">8. The Duke is to introduce no Innovation in the Towns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to him assigned, repugnant to the Securities, Priviledges, Immunities, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, Lands, Estates, or antient Laws of the <hi>Irish,</hi> reserving onely to himself, Authority to apply Remedies to any thing accruing, wherein publick prejudice may be concern'd.</p>
                              <p n="9">9. The Duke is not to interpose in Administration of Judicial or Civil Affairs, but leave them to be proceeded in, according to the Fundamental Laws, and publick Form of the Kings chief Governor, and the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly instituted.</p>
                              <p n="10">10. The manner of calling Assemblies to be as formerly, unless com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint arise against their Government, or other extraordinary Emergencies hinder; And then according to the antient Laws, the cutting off the Assembly, is to be at the Pleasure of his Highness.</p>
                              <p n="11">
                                 <pb n="289" facs="tcp:93738:166"/>11. When the work is done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by consent of a General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the Duke promises to afford Agents to the King against Rebelling Adversaries in other Kingdoms.</p>
                              <p n="12">12. In case the Duke cannot go in Person into <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is free in his Choice and Pleasure to depute any other man of Catholick Piety, who shall be independent on the Militia, and in Civil Matters shall be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all manner of Councils, in the same right as any other Counsellor or Commissioner.</p>
                              <p n="13">13. All Cities, Castles, Lands, taken from the <hi>English,</hi> shall revert to the Owners, if Catholicks, who have constantly persevered in the Catholick Quarters under the Duke; Yet the Duke's Military Power shall be intire over the same, to Garrison and dispose of them for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Security, at his Pleasure.</p>
                              <p n="14">14. All Pay to the Souldiers, is to pass from the Duke, as well out of the publick Revenues, as the Duke's Coffers when that fails; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the Duke disburses of his proper Money for publick uses, for the future to be repaid him, as his former Disbursements.</p>
                              <p n="15">15. All Goods of Enemies and Dilinquents, are to be converted to the publick Military Charges, and towards rewarding great Merits by the Duke, with advice of the General Assembly.</p>
                              <p n="16">16. The Duke, besides 20000 <hi>l.</hi> already contributed, promises all further Accommodations and Supplements for War, together with his Power and Industry, what is not above the reach of his Faculties, and beneath the necessities of the War, towards the repayment whereof, as well principal as the annual provenue and use thereof, the whole Nation of <hi>Ireland</hi> is to be liable until the last penny be paid; And for Caution in the mean time, the Duke is to be seized and possessed in his own hands, of <hi>Galway, Limerick, Athenry,</hi> the Castle and Town of <hi>Athlone,</hi> and <hi>Waterford,</hi> and the Royal Fort of <hi>Duncannon,</hi> (when recovered from the Enemy) and these are to remain to him and his Heirs until full and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire satisfaction receiv'd, and to pay just Obedience, and be garrison'd and commanded at his Pleasure.</p>
                              <p n="17">17. In laying of publick Taxes, and levying the same for the Dukes satisfaction, the Duke do proceed by Advice of the General Assembly, and all aggrieved Parties in case of inequality, to seek Redress from the General Assembly.</p>
                              <p n="18">18. For liquidating and stateing the Dukes Disbursements, a certain Method shall be agreed on between the Duke and the said Transactors, but for the Persons to be intrusted in that Charge, the General Assembly is to alter them at their Pleasure.</p>
                              <p n="19">19 The Duke shall make no Peace nor Cessation, without the Lord Deputy or General Assembly.</p>
                              <p n="20">20. The Lord Deputy and General Assembly, shall make no Peace without the consent of the Duke.</p>

                           <hi>I</hi> Had the Honour on the <hi>12th.</hi> of this instant, to receive a Letter from your Highness, dated the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> wherein you are pleased to express your great zeal for the advancement of the Catholick Religion in this Kingdom, your great affection to the King my Master, and your good opinion of this Nation, and your compassion of their sufferings, and your great readiness to afford them aid and assistance, even equal with your own nearest concernments; and that your Highness received such satisfaction from the Queen and Duke of <hi>York,</hi> as did much strengthen those resolutions, so as they might sooner appear, but for the stay made here of Monsieur <hi>St. Catherin,</hi> and his long Northern Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age upon his return, and referred what concerned the agreement, to the relation of those Commissioners I had imployed to your Highness, to treat upon that subject of Assistance and Relief for this Kingdom. I with much alacrity congratulate your Highness pious intentions, for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> your great and Princely care to recover his Majesties Rights and Interests, from his Rebel Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and the high obligation you put upon this Nation, by your tender regard of them, and desire to redeem them from the great miseries and afflictions they have endured, and the eminent dangers they are in; And it shall be a principal part of my ambition, to be an useful instrument to serve your Highness, in so famous and glorious an enterprize. And that I may be the more capable to contribute somewhat to so religious and just ends; First, in discharge of my conscience toward God, my duty to the King my Master, and to dis-abuse your Highness, and give a clear and perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, so far as comes to my knowledge, I am obliged to represent unto your Highness, that by the title of the Agreement and Articles therein contained, made by those Commissioners I imployed to your Highness, and but lately come into my hands, <hi>They have violated the trust reposed in them, by having cast off, and declined the Commission and Instructions they had from me, in the King my Masters behalf, and all other Powers, that could by any other means be derived from him, and pretend to make an agreement with your Highness, in the name of the Kingdom and People of</hi> Ireland, <hi>for which they had not, nor could have any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Authority; and have abused your Highness, by a counterfeit shew of a private Instrument, fraudulently procured and signed (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) by some inconsiderable and factious Persons, ill-affected to his Majesties Authority, without any knowledge or consent of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Nation, or Persons of greatest Quality or Interest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and who under a seeming zeal and pretence of service to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, labour more to satisfie their private ambitions, then the advantage of Religion or the Nation, or the prosperous success of your Highness generous undertakings;</hi> And to manifest the clearness of mine own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93738:167"/>
and make such deceitful Practices more apparent, I send your Highness herewith an authentick Copy of my Instructions, which accompanied their Commission, when I imployed them to your Highness, as a sufficient evidence to convince them. And having thus fully manifested their breach of publick Trust, I am obliged in the King my Masters name, to protest against their unwarrantable proceedings, and to declare all the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Acts whatsoever concluded by those Commissioners, to be void, and illegal, being not derived from, or consonant to his Majesties Authority, being in duty bound thus far to vindicate the King my Masters Honour and Authority, and to preserve his just and undoubted Rights from such deceitful and rebellious Practices; as likewise with an humble and respective care, to prevent those prejudices that might befal your Highness, in being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by counterfeit shews, in doing you greater Honour; where it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that any undertaking laid upon such false and ill-grounded Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as have been smoothly digested and fixed upon that Nation, as their desire and request, must overthrow all those Heroick and Prince-like Acts, your Highness hath proposed to your self, for Gods glory and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the restauration of oppressed Majesty, and the relief of his distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Kingdom, which would at length fall into intestine broils and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, if not forceably driven into desperation; I shall now with a hopeful and chearful importunity upon a clear score, free from those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, propose to your Highness, that for the advancement of all those great ends you aim at, and in the King my Masters behalf, and in the name of all the Loyal Catholick Subjects of this Nation, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of those important cautionary Places, that are security for your Highness past and present disbursements, you will be pleased to quicken and hasten those aids and assistances, you intended for the relief of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and I have with my whole power, and through the greatest hazards, striven to defend them for you, and to preserve all other Ports, that may be at all times of advantage and safeguard to your Fleets, and Men of War, having yet many good Harbours left; but also engage in the King my Masters name, that whatsoever may prove to your satisfaction, that is any way consistent with his Honour and Authority, and have made my humble applications to the Queens Majesty, and my Lord Lieutenant, (the King being in <hi>Scotland</hi>) further to agree, confirm, and secure, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever may be of advantage to your Highness; and if the last Galliot had but brought 10000 l. for this instant time, it would have contributed more to the recovery of this Kingdom, then far greater sums delayed, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling our Forces to meet together, for the relief of <hi>Limerick,</hi> which cannot but be in great distress after so long a Siege, and which if lost, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I shall endeavour to prevent it) will cost much treasure to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained. And if your Highness will be pleased to go on chearfully, freely, and seasonably, with this great work, I make no question, but God will give so great a blessing thereto, as that my self, and all the Loyal Subjects of this Kingdom, may soon and justly proclaim, and leave recorded to posterity, that your Highness was the great and glorious restorer of our Religion, Monarch, and Nation; and that your Highness may not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged or diverted, from this generous enterprize, by the malice or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives of any ill affected, it is a necessary duty in me, to represent unto your Highness, that the Bishop of <hi>Ferns</hi> (who as I am informed, hath gained some interest in your favour) is a Person, that hath ever been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent against, and malicious to his Majesty's Authority and Government,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:93738:168"/>
and a fatal Instrument in contriving and fomenting all those divisions and differences that have rent asunder this Kingdom, the introduction to our present miseries, and weak condition: And that your Highness may clearly know his disposition, I send herewithal a Copy of part of a Letter written by him <note n="*" place="margin">Which was part of that Letter mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Lord Deputy.</note>, directed to the Lord <hi>Taaffe,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Plunket,</hi> and <hi>Jeffery Brown,</hi> and humbly submitted to your judgment, whether those expressions be agreeable to the temper of the Apostolical Spirit, and considering whose Person and Authority I represent, what ought to be the reward of such a crime. I must therefore desire your Highness, in the King my Masters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, that he may not be countenanc'd or intrusted in any Affairs, that have relation to his Majesties Interest in this Kingdom, where I have constantly endeavoured, by all possible service, to deserve your Highness good opinion, and obtaining that favour to be a most faithful acknowledger of it, in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and under the title of,</p>

               <p>Thus the Lord Deputy very faithfully discharged his duty; and great cause there was to protest against such proceedings of the Confederates, they putting his Majesties Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> into the hands of a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince, and in that, assuming to themselves the name of <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and People of Ireland,</hi> as if there had been no other Party or People in the Kingdom (or not considerable) but themselves alone; and as if then in <hi>Ireland</hi> there had been no Power or Government but theirs onely, his Majesties Authority in the hands of his Deputy not regarded or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted. They also (the Confederates) in that giving up the Kingdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Power of a Stranger, colouring their Treason with a flattering Clause, and an empty and insignificant Title to their Natural Prince in Reversion, and by Resignation, when the new Protector, commanding all, should please to do it; he being first satisfi'd of all Disbursments, Charges, and Claims whatsoever, he himself being Auditor: A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of that importance, as we seldom find, where others have been called in upon Assistance (especially on such Encouragements) that they have quitted their hold without effusion of much blood, or an absolute dis-inherizon of the right Owner: And therefore the Lord Deputies foresight of such an Evil, doth commend him faithful to his Prince, and just to his Nation. Nor can it be doubted, that the Attestation of this Peer (one that hath run the hazard of his Countreys safety) should be further credited than what the Bishop of <hi>Ferns,</hi> or any obscure loose Frier (how prodigal soever in their Calumnies) should or can publish in the bitterness of their spirit, a crime incident to their Faculty, being ill affected to his Majesty, worse to his Governours.</p>
               <p>One of the principal Motives, which induced the Marquis of <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickard</hi> to submit to that Charge, and to undertake a Province which he knew would be very burthensome and grievous in several respects, was the joynt promise, <hi>That the City of</hi> Limerick, <hi>and the Town of</hi> Galway, <hi>would pay all imaginable duty to him.</hi> The Clergy obliged themselves in that particular with all confidence, and the Deputies of the Places pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:93738:168"/>
all that could be desir'd: But when the Lord Deputy found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to settle that business, they would neither receive a Garrison or Governour from him; and when he offered himself to stay in <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> (when <hi>Ireton</hi> was drawing before it) and to run his Fortune with them, they refused it, as peremptorily as they had done to the Lord Lieutenant. It is true, both <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Galway</hi> were contented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Soldiers; but they must be such onely as were of their own choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, not such either in number or quality as the Lord Deputy would have sent to them, or as were necessary for their security: They chose likewise their own Governour, or rather kept the Government them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and gave the Title to one, whom they thought least like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them; and, in a word, behaved themselves like two Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and obey'd the Deputy no farther than they were inclined by their own convenience; they who compounded with the Enemy in the Countrey, corresponded with them in the Town, and thereby gave the Enemy intelligence of all that passed: Wonderful diligence was used to<note place="margin">The Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates cherish'd in a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents.</hi>
                  </note> make it be thought, that the <hi>Independents</hi> were not uncharitable unto <hi>Papists,</hi> and that they wished not any compulsion should be used in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion; and when the acts of cruelty and blood, of putting their Priests and Prelates to an ignominious death, (of which there were new instances every day) were mentioned: It was answer'd, Those proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were carried on by the power of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> very much against the Nature and Principles of the other Party.</p>
               <p>This license of Communication, and the evil consequences that must attend it, was enough understood by the Lord Deputy, but could no more be prevented, reformed, or punished, than he could infuse a new heart or spirit into the People; one instance will serve the turn: There was in the Town a Frier, <hi>Anthony Geoghean,</hi> who had always adhered<note place="margin">Frier <hi>Geoghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi>'s carriage against the State.</note> to the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and opposed the King's Authority to the utmost of his power, several Letters written by him into the Enemies Quarters were intercepted, and brought to the Lord Deputy, in which, though there were many things in Cypher, there appeared much of the present state and condition of the Town; and in one of them, dated the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1651. he thus writes, <hi>If the service of God had been as deep in the hearts of our Nation, as that Idol of</hi> Dagon, (<hi>a foolish Loyalty</hi>) <hi>a better course for its honour and preservation had been taken in time.</hi> The Lord Deputy believed the crime to be so apparent, and of such a nature, that (what Complices soever he might have) none would have the courage to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his behalf: And that he might give the Clergy an opportunity to shew their zeal in a business, that concern'd so much their common safety, he referr'd the examination of the Frier unto the Bishops (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there were three or four in Town) and to some other of the principal of the Clergy, and appointed them to require him to produce the Cypher which he had used, and to examine him to whom the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were intended (they being directed to counterfeit and suppositious names.) The Cypher was accordingly produced, and thereby <hi>many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> (<hi>in the Letter</hi>) <hi>appear'd to be full of neglect and reproach to the King and others, of insolence and contumely toward the Lord Deputy; they mention'd little hope was left of relief from the Duke of</hi> Lorrain; <hi>and that they resolved to send one to treat with the Rebels, and had found private means of conveying one to that purpose: The Frier promised to use all his diligence to dispose the Catholicks to have a good opinion of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,

and made some request concerning himself.</hi> All that he alledged for his defence was, That the Letters written by him were to one who was employ'd by the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> that he had no ill meaning against the King or Deputy, and that he had himself a Trust from <hi>Rome,</hi> and Instructions from the Secretary of the Congregation, <hi>De propaganda Fide,</hi> and the Bishops certifi'd that they had seen the Instructions, and that they did not relate at all to the Temporal State. And this was all the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and justice the Lord Deputy could procure, though he writ several Letters of Expostulation to the Bishops thereupon: Whether this be a part of the Priviledges and Immunities of the <hi>Catholick Roman Church,</hi> and enjoy'd in any Catholick Countrey, and whether it can be indulged to them in any other Countrey where the Authority of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome</hi> is not submitted unto, we must leave to the World to judge and determine. In the interim, If Protestant Kings and Princes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and severe for the prevention of such practices, and for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing their own security, this must not be imputed to an unreasonable jealousie of, or a prejudice to the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion, but to the confident presumption of those men, (under the vizard of universal obedience) who have pretended Religion for their warrant or excuse, for the most unlawful and unjustifiable actions.</p>
               <p>This was the obedience and submission they paid to the Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Government: Let us see now what Government they provided for themselves, and what course they (who were still jealous of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by those who were trusted by the King) took for their own secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and preservation; and what power the Bishops and Clergy had to support their own Interest and Dignity, after they appear'd to have enough to destroy or suppress that of the King. The City of <hi>Limerick</hi> was entirely govern'd by the Clergy. We have shewn you how the Herald (in proclaming the Peace of 1646.) was affronted there; as also of their contumelious behaviour towards the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> in 1650. We must now take notice of their carriage to the Marquis of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> to whom (contrary to their obligation and solemn promise) they continued the same obstinacy, refusing to receive such a Governour and Garrison as he thought fit to give them, or to entertain him in the Town with the Power and Authority of Deputy, after he had assum'd that Place and Title upon their own importunity, and promise of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; however, he sent thither such men, both Officers and Soldiers, as they desired, and no other.</p>
               <p>During the Siege of <hi>Limerick,</hi> (now straitly begirt by <hi>Ireton</hi>) Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dungan</hi> stormed <hi>Ross-town</hi> and <hi>Castle Jordan;</hi> and the notable Quarter-beater <hi>Nash</hi> killed Colonel <hi>Cook,</hi> coming with a Party from <hi>Cork,</hi> but was slain in the onset, though his Party was victorious; whilst at <hi>Limerick</hi> the Besieged made many fierce Sallies, to the loss of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailants: for in one, of 1000 men, they killed above 300 of the Besiegers; and upon <hi>Ireton</hi>'s attempt against the Island before the Town, the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1651. an hundred and twenty of his men were lost, with their Leaders, Major <hi>Walker,</hi> Captain <hi>Graves,</hi> and Captain <hi>Whiting: Ireton</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding resolved not to depart without it, though the Governour (<hi>Hugh O Neal,</hi> who had so gallantly defended <hi>Clonmel</hi>) refused to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to any Conditions, in hopes that the Winter would force him off, or that himself might receive necessary Supplies from without: But shortly after he perceived what he was to trust to; for before <hi>Ireton</hi> had
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:93738:170"/>
close besieged it a month, and sooner than the Inhabitants were press'd with wants, the Commonalty began to discourse of Treating with the Enemy, all the considerations of what they might undergo hereafter (through timerousness occurred to them, and the improbability of their receiving any succours proportionable to their wants: Yet it was very hard for them to Treat, it being notoriously known, that <hi>Ireton</hi> would except very many principal Persons amongst them, to whom no mercy should be shown; nor could they expect any Conditions for the exercise of their Religion they had been hitherto so jealous of. The Governour had onely the Title and power to set Watch, but the Mayor kept the Keys, and had many of the principal Officers at his devotion; so that upon the <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> a mixed Councel of Officers, and of those of the Civil Government, met in the Town-house, to consult what was best to be done in order to the Treaty with the Enemy, (contrary to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the Governour, who was resolved to hold it out to the last) and after a long debate, it was concluded by the major part, that they would proceed to a Treaty, and that they would not break it off upon the exception of any persons, for Quarter or Confiscation of their Goods: and the next day was appointed for the choosing of the Commissioners to be sent unto the Enemy. The result of the former days debate being known in the Town, they no sooner met for the Election of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners for the Treaty, than the Bishops of <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Emly,</hi> with the Clergy, came to the Town-house, and threatned them to issue out an Excommunication against them, if they proceeded in those Counsels, the effect whereof would be, to deliver up the Prelates to be slaughter'd; notwithstanding which, they proceeded to the naming the Persons who should treat for them. Whereupon the Bishops published their Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, with a perpetual Interdict of the City, which was fixed on the doors of all the Churches and Chappels in the Town. But alas! those Fulminations had been too loosely and impertinently used to retain any vertue in time of need; and as Catholick as the Town was, (and there was not one Protestant in it) the Excommunication wrought no effect. That very night Colonel <hi>Fennel,</hi> and the other Officers of the Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that press'd on the Treaty, possess'd themselves of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gate, and <hi>Cluam</hi>'s Tower, driving the Guards from thence; and when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour came thither, and demanded by what Authority they were there, (he having given them Orders to Guard another Quarter of the Town) they answered, <hi>The best of the Town knew, and approved what they did:</hi> And it was very true, the Mayor <hi>Thomas Strick</hi> was of their Party, and delivered the Key of that Port to Colonel <hi>Fennel,</hi> though he denied it to the other Party that opposed the Treaty. The Governour called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War, and sent for Colonel <hi>Fennel</hi> to appear before them, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to come; and being supplied with Powder from the Mayor, he turned the Cannon upon the Town, and declared, <hi>That he would not quit</hi>

                  <hi>the place that he was possessed of, till the City should be yielded to the Enemy.</hi> The Commissioners were sent out to <hi>Ireton,</hi> who would give no other Conditions than, <hi>That the Garrison should lay down their Arms, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers retaining their Swords, and march to what Place they would, except those exempted from mercy, (who of the Clergy, Soldiers, and Citizens amounted to the number of 24.) The Inhabitants had three months time assign'd them to transport their Persons, and three months more to remove their Goods within any Place the Kingdom appointed, in which they might

live.</hi> In brief, these were their Conditions; but in respect of many things very considerable in the Articles themselves, we shall here give them at large.

               <p>It cannot be believ'd, that these unequal and severe Conditions would have been accepted from any Army, not strong enough to have imposed upon a People unwilling to submit to them, and in a season of the year that alone would have secured a Place less provided for resistance; but that Colonel <hi>Fennel</hi> (the same night these hard demands were sent into the Town) received in St. <hi>Johns Gate Tower</hi> 200 men from <hi>Ireton,</hi> and the other were removed into another Fort, called <hi>Price's Mill,</hi> where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had continued two days; and the People of the Town not yet agreeing what they would do, a Drum was sent through the City, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all manner of Soldiers in pay within the Town, to repair to our <hi>Ladies Church,</hi> and there to lay down their Arms; which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently obeyed; and the Soldiers being bid forthwith to leave the Town, <hi>Ireton,</hi> the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> marched in, and receiving the Keys, was without any contradiction quietly possessed thereof, causing as many of the excepted Persons as could be found to be committed to Prison, and made Sir <hi>Hardress Waller</hi> Governour of the City.</p>
               <p>In this manner was <hi>Limerick</hi> defended by the <hi>Catholick Irish;</hi> and this obedience did the Prelates and Clergy, in their need, receive from those, over whom they had power enough to seduce from the Duty they owed to the King, and from submitting to his Authority; and now was the Harvest that they gathered the fruit of all their labours: The Instances of severity and blood which <hi>Ireton</hi> gave upon his being possess'd of this Place, were very remarkable: <hi>Edmund O Duyr,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Limerick,</hi> had the dexterity and good Fortune, that either by marching out amongst the Common Soldiers, or by concealing himself with some faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friend in the Town, (which is not so probable) to escape their hands, and afterwards died at <hi>Brussels,</hi> pursued with the malice of the Nuncio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist Zealots; whilst <hi>Ireton</hi> manifested what his portion would have been, by the treatment they gave to <hi>Terlagh O Brien,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> whom they took, and without any formality of Justice, and with all reproaches imaginable, caused him to be publickly hanged. This unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Prelate had, from the beginning, opposed with great passion the Kings Authority, and most obstinately adhered to the Nuncio, and to that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty still which was most averse from returning to their Allegiance, and was thus miserably and ignominiously put to death, even in that City, whence he had been a principal Instrument to shut out his Majesties Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>It may be remembred in the former part of this Discourse, that when the King at Arms proclaim'd the Peace at <hi>Limerick</hi> in 1646. one <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Fanning</hi> (a Citizen of the Town) rais'd a Mutiny, which Rabble affronted the Herald, and wounded the Mayor, and was himself, by the Nuncio, (for that good service) made Mayor in the former's place: This man continuing the same bitterness of spirit against the King's
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:93738:173"/>
Authority, always opposed the receiving of a Garrison from the Lord Lieutenant. This <hi>Dominick Fanning</hi> being one of those 24 which <hi>Ireton</hi> had excepted, found a way, amongst the Common Soldiers, to get out of the Town, notwithstanding all the diligence that was used to discover him: When he was free, and in safety, he returned to the Town to fetch some Money that he had privately hid, and to make some provision for his subsistance, which he had not time to do before: But going to his own house, his Wife refused to receive him, or to assist him in any thing; whereupon he departed, and after he had walked up and down the streets some time (the weather being extreme cold) he went to the Main-guard, where was a good Fire, and being discovered to be a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and asked who he was, voluntarily confessed that he was <hi>Dominick Fanning,</hi> for whom such strict search had been made; he was thereupon apprehended, and the next morning carried before the Governour, and immediately hanged. The same Fate had Frier <hi>Wolf,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Thomas Strich,</hi> who (when the Lord Lieutenant would have entred that Town in 1650. for its preservation) rais'd a Tumult, and shut the Gates against him. And this very Colonel <hi>Fennel</hi> (who by possessing himself of the Port, and turning the Cannon upon the Town, betray'd it to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) though he had for the present the benefit of the Articles, was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few months after taken by them, and (without any consideration of his last merit) hanged as the rest had been. In a word, All those who had been the first causers and raisers of the Rebellion, (or who with most malice and obstinacy opposed their return to the Kings obedience) and had the misfortune to fall into the Enemies hands, as the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> (whose Fate we have before told you) <hi>Jeffery Baron,</hi> (who kept <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> from receiving the Lord Lieutenant, taken afterwards at <hi>Limerick</hi> and there hanged) and many others, were made examples of the like nature.</p>
               <p>About the same time that <hi>Limerick</hi> was surrendred, Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> defeated a Party of the <hi>Fitz-Patricks</hi> and <hi>O Duyr</hi>'s Forces, (who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd <hi>Meleke Island</hi> after the taking of it by Colonel <hi>Axtel</hi>) undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a resolute defence thereof to the baffling of his Foot, which were worsted two or three times together; but the Gallantry of his Horse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Honour, making 300 resolute <hi>Irish</hi> accept of Quarter for their Lives, some 300 being slain and drown'd.</p>
               <p>This business of <hi>Limerick</hi> being over, <hi>Ireton</hi> within a few days, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drawing his Army nearer than the Castle of <hi>Clare,</hi> (which he and Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> joyntly took in) sent a Summons to the City of <hi>Gallway,</hi> offering therein <hi>Limerick</hi>'s first Conditions, wishing them withall to put him to no more trouble, lest they far'd as <hi>Limerick</hi> did through their stubbornness; adding such other threats, as he thought most like to make impressions upon them; and a great impression they did make. But <hi>Ireton</hi> dying at <hi>Limerick</hi> the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> having contracted a Feaver through his continual Watching and Services through the whole Siege of <hi>Limerick,</hi> they had a little respite; and being united under the Command of General <hi>Preston,</hi> the Town of <hi>Gallway</hi> address'd themselves to the Lord Deputy, and desired his assistance, promising all obedience to his Majesties Authority in him: Nor was he so much discourag'd by their former carriage, and their having accepted the Articles made with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and their declaring him to be their Protector, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever communicating it to the Lord Deputy, as to decline having

further to do with them. But upon their first Address to him, he sent his Secretary to them with some Directions, and shortly after went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thither, having summon'd such of the Nobility, Prelates, and principal Gentry, as could with safety repair thither, to consult what might yet be done for their defence, they having still Men enough dispersed in several Parties to resist the Enemy, if they were drawn together, and united amongst themselves; and the Town of <hi>Galway</hi> was so good a Port, that any Supplies or Succours might come from abroad to them.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Ireton</hi>'s Death, the Commissioners (formerly mention'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ludlow</hi> made Commander in Chief on <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s death</note> at <hi>Dublin</hi>) made Lieutenant General <hi>Ludlow</hi> Commander in Chief, till the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> should take further Order about that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. In the interim, Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> with his Party straightned <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> blocking up their Harbours, and approaching with his Fortifications nearer by Land, which wrought so far upon the Assembly there, that in <hi>February</hi> they importun'd the Lord Deputy, to give them leave to send to Lieutenant General <hi>Ludlow,</hi> (who by this time was come to aid Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> in the Siege) for a safe Conduct for their Commissioners, to treat of Conditions for the settlement of the Nation; upon which they would submit to the Government of the Parliament, professing to the Lord Deputy, that they would in the mean time make such preparation for their defence, that if the Parliament would not give them good and ample Conditions, they would sell themselves at such a dear Rate, that should make their Conquest of little use to their Enemy. Upon which, the Lord Deputy, the Marquess <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> the 14th. of <hi>February,</hi> 1651. writes to the Commander in chief of the Parliaments Forces, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion had no grateful Reply: Which when the <hi>Irish</hi> found, that they could not have so much as a safe Conduct sent for their Commissioners, nor could be admitted so much as to treat for the Nation, but only that particular Places and Persons might be admitted to compound for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as others had done, their spirits fail'd them; and after a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle deliberation, and before they put the Enemy to the trouble of storm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, (without so much as consulting the Lord Deputy, or asking his leave, though he was within less than half a days journey of the Town) they enter'd into a Treaty, and in a short time after, <hi>viz.</hi> the 12th. of <hi>May,</hi> surrendred the Town to Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> for the use of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> upon such Conditions, as would not be yielded to by the Commissioners, or the Parliament: Though afterwards this Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was composed, and many considerable Garrisons in <hi>Connaght</hi> followed the example, whilst many were amazed, to see (upon what easie terms) they parted with their last important Town, (a Place of great strength, and had they been resolute, invincible) having still (in loose Parties over the Kingdom) more Men in Arms to have defended it, than the <hi>English</hi> could have brought against the Town.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ireton</hi>'s Funerals being over, (which were performed with great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, on the 6th. of <hi>February</hi> following, in <hi>Henry</hi> 7th's Chappel, since buried under <hi>Tyburn</hi>) the Parliament consulted, whom they should make Deputy (as they called it) in <hi>Ireton</hi>'s room: And Major General <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> (a Commissioner in <hi>Scotland</hi>) was by <hi>Cromwel</hi> (the Parliaments Lord Lieutenant) nominated thereunto: Whereupon he presently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:93738:174"/>
but seem'd unwilling to accept of the Charge; a Difficulty soon removed, making in a little time all things ready for his departure, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Waggons with his private Provisions, a recruit of Souldiers, and Money, were in readiness to be sent away. But <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Commission determining in the end of <hi>April,</hi> it came into debate in the House, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it should be renewed again; but he offering to lay it down, it was accepted; so there being no Lord Lieutenant, they voted, there should be no Lord Deputy, and that Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> should be only Commander in chief of the Forces there: And about the 4th. of <hi>July,</hi> 1652. Colonel <hi>Charles Fleetwood,</hi> (who had lately married <hi>Ireton</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lict) Lieutenant General of the Horse, was made Commander in chief of the Forces in <hi>Ireland;</hi> he hastned his Dispatch, and used great diligence to get over to his Charge.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, several things were under debate in the House, for setling of <hi>Ireland:</hi> That great Act for Confiscation of all the Rebels Lands, was passed the 12th. of <hi>August;</hi> and another appointed to be brought in, for setling the Adventurers Estates for <hi>Ireland,</hi> which passed the 26th. of <hi>September,</hi> 1653. and was confirmed, 1656. But these requiring much time, the Commander in chief went away about the midst of <hi>August,</hi> and left them to receive a Dispatch in his absence. He had a very prosperous Passage, and arrived within few days after his departure: He setled his Residence at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> by reason <hi>Dublin</hi> and the Parts adjacent were at that time much infected with the Plague. He found the War of <hi>Ireland</hi> drawing on to a conclusion, the Rebels being Masters of few considerable Forts and Castles, throughout the whole Countrey, <hi>Roscommon-Castle</hi> and <hi>James-town</hi> having yielded the 3d. of <hi>April</hi> to Colonel <hi>Reynolds,</hi> as the strong Hold of <hi>Ross</hi> in <hi>Kerry</hi> did, the 27th. of <hi>June,</hi> to Lieutenant General <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and the strong Fort of <hi>Inchlough,</hi> the 1st. of <hi>August,</hi> to Colonel <hi>Zanckey:</hi> And their Forces were so weak, as they were not able to keep the Field, and so dispersed, as they had already in Parties come in, (as did the Earl of <hi>Westmeath,</hi> the Lord <hi>Muskery,</hi> Colonel <hi>Connor, O Roe,</hi> Sir <hi>William Dungan,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Talbot,</hi> and many others, to the number of 800.) upon the <hi>Kilkenny</hi> Articles, which were (in a manner) <hi>to submit unto discretion, and subject themselves to a Trial, for the Murthers commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the beginning of the Rebellion; all found guilty thereof were except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Pardon, their Estates confiscated, and the others who had only assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the War, were to forfeit two parts of their Estates, and be banished:</hi> And accordingly great numbers of them were transported into <hi>Spain,</hi> the latter end of this Summer.</p>
               <p>Yet the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> did not leave the Kingdom in many months after the Surrender of <hi>Galway,</hi> but endeavour'd by all means possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to draw the scattered Forces together, that he might prosecute the War afresh, according to his Majesty's Letters, (in the years 1650, and 1651.) <hi>encouraging him to his continuance in Arms, as advantagious (by way of Diversion) to his then intended progress of promoting his Design in</hi> Scotland, <hi>and coming into</hi> England. And to that end, the 16th. of <hi>May,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> with the <hi>Connaght</hi> Forces, marched to <hi>Balli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shannon,</hi> which he took by storm, and presently after <hi>Dungal-Castle,</hi> where the <hi>Ulster</hi> Forces under Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal,</hi> the <hi>O Relie</hi>'s, and <hi>Mac Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon</hi>'s joyned with him; but upon intelligence that Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> and Colonel <hi>Venables</hi> were marched against him, he retired to <hi>Armagh,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for <hi>Raphoe:</hi> Whilst Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> (in his pursuit of him) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:93738:174"/>
                  <hi>Ballishanon</hi> and <hi>Dungal-Castle,</hi> gaining also <hi>Sligo, Ballymote,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Garrisons; so as the Marquess was forced to shelter himself in the Isle of <hi>Carrick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And having receiv'd his Majesty's Command, to take care of his own security, that he fell not into the Enemy's hands, he having no Port to friend, where he might choose a Vessel, and being so betrayed by the <hi>Irish,</hi> as not securely to stay 24 hours in a Place) was compelled to have a Pass from the Parliaments Forces, not excepting any other Conditions for himself, than that he might for some time remain secure in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, without taking the Oath usually imposed by them, and have liberty to transport himself, and 3000 <hi>Irish</hi> more, into any Prince's Countrey and Service, then in Amity with <hi>England;</hi> which was granted; and in <hi>March,</hi> 1652. he was transported into <hi>England,</hi> in a Vessel belonging to the Parliament, after he had born the Title of the King's Deputy in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> little more than two years, not with greater submission from the <hi>Catholick Irish,</hi> than had before been paid to the Lord Lieutenant; and so retired to <hi>London,</hi> where not long after he died, and was thence carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Summerhill,</hi> (a pleasant Seat of his own, which <hi>Bradshaw</hi> had in Custodium) near <hi>Tunbridge</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and was buried in the Parish-Church. He was a Person much respected for his Integrity, and, though of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion to those then in Usurpation, looked on as a Favourer of the <hi>English,</hi> and one that no ways indulged the Cruelties and Pretensions of the <hi>Irish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Fate of that unhappy Nation, both under <hi>Protestant</hi> and <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Governours, neither having had the credit to be Masters of the <hi>Irish</hi> Temper, fomented by the Insolencies of the Priests, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might instigate them against the <hi>English</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard</hi>'s Departure, <hi>the lesser Concerns</hi> of that Nation were (with little trouble and charge) brought in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Parliament, who declared, the 26th. of <hi>September,</hi> 1653. <hi>That the Rebels were subdued, and the Rebellion appeased and ended;</hi> and thereupon proceeded to the Distribution of their Lands, in pursuance of the Act for Subscriptions, 17 <hi>Carol.</hi> 1. Some time before which, a High Court of Justice was setled in <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Name we have reason not to mention, without horrour and astonishment, considering who was summoned to such a Tribunal, which certainly would never have been, how vain, how ambitious, how prodigious soever some mens Success was, (a Strumpet often leading one to Attempts above their first thoughts) had not the Rebels of <hi>Ireland</hi> (for carrying on their pernicious Practices) avouched the sacred Authority for their pretence and colour; that though these with <hi>Pilate,</hi> washed their hands from the Blood of this <hi>Righteous One,</hi> yet they have, as the shame, so the guilt of that Royal Blood on themselves, who originally gave the occasion of such a Discourse, which afterwards was made one of the pretended Causes, for the most barbarous and inhumane Act ever perpretated: <hi>Inter tragicoe Fortunoe Exempla om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus</hi>

               <p>It is observable, (let some foam as they please) that there were none, (who so much as pretended to have a Reverence for the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) that ever had the least hand in this foul and ugly Business. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of that is in what the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hide</hi> acquainted the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament with, in express words from his Majesty, when he was imployed in an Embassy to <hi>Spain;</hi> That the Horrid Murther of his Royal Father, was not the Act of the Parliament, or People of <hi>England,</hi> but of a very wretched and little Company of Miscreants in the Kingdom, <hi>fol.</hi> 41. Upon which, Monsieur <hi>Moses Amiraldus,</hi> (the Excellent <hi>French</hi> Divine) hearing of the Protestant Religion aspersed as seditious and treasonable, writ a Piece in <hi>French,</hi> in vindication of the Protestant Religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated it to our King (<hi>Charles</hi> the 2d.) in the time of his Exile, when <hi>Militiere</hi> and others, would have inforced the barbarous Martyrdom of his Royal Father, as a just Motive to his apostatizing, and not trusting his safety to the Protestant Religion; whereas all these blustering Storms, (as the Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi> observes in his excellent Tract against <hi>Militiere</hi>) radicated him deeper in his Religion; that what these intended for his evil, proved his good. And certainly whatsoever conspired to compleat so execrable a Design, as <hi>the Murther of the King,</hi> nothing contributed more than the <hi>Irish,</hi> deluding his Sacred Majesty so long with their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of a competent Army, whereby he relying on them, (too confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently assured of their Ability and Power to perform it) deferred those Agreements, which else he might have seasonably composed at home.</p>
               <p>And could there ever be an equaller Distribution of God's Vengeance, than that they by a parallel Court, should suffer the loss of their Estates, Lives and Fortunes? Which, though un-usual, was the only Expedient; sufficiently set forth in the ensuing Speech of the Lord <hi>Lowther</hi>'s, a Person of that Gravity and Worth, as whatsoever may be said by others, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reach the State of the Question, more fully (with less animosity, and greater truth) than he hath done, at the Trial of Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal,</hi> in <hi>February,</hi> 1652.

                              <p>YOu have well understood, how that by this Commission which hath now been read, the Right Honourable the Commissioners of the Parliament, of the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by vertue of the Power and Trust committed to them, have here erected, constituted, and appointed, a High Court of Justice.</p>

                              <p>And have authorized them to make inquisition for Blood, and that in three main Points.</p>
                              <p>1. To hear and determine all Murthers and Massacres, of any Protestant <hi>English,</hi> or other Person or Persons whatsoever, within this Nation, done or committed by any Person or Persons whatsoever, (both principal and accessaries) who since the 1st. day of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. have killed, slain, or otherwise destroyed any Person or Persons in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which at the time of their being so killed, slain or destroyed, were not publickly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and maintained in Arms, as Officers or private Souldiers, for and on the behalf of the <hi>English</hi> against the <hi>Irish.</hi>

                              <p>2. To hear and determine the Charges, Crimes and Causes, of all and every Person and Persons, (both principal and accessaries) who since the said 1st. day of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. have killed or destroyed any Person or Persons, entertained or maintained as Officers or private Souldiers, for and on the behalf of the <hi>English</hi> against the <hi>Irish,</hi> the said Person so kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or destroying, not being then publickly entertained and maintained in Arms, as Officers or private Souldiers, under the Command and Pay of the <hi>Irish</hi> against the <hi>English.</hi>

                              <p>3. To hear and determine the Charges, Crimes, and Causes, of all such Persons, that have killed or slain, or otherwise destroyed any Person or Persons, after Quarter given, contrary to the Rules of War: And to bring to Trial, Judgement, and condign punishment, the Principals and Acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries to those Crimes, that is to say, the Actors, Contrivers, Councellors, Advisers, Promoters, Abettors, Aiders and Assisters, of any the said Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Massacres, or killing after Quarter given, contrary to the Rules of War.</p>
                              <p>This Commission doth likewise furnish the Commissioners, with all necessary Powers requisite for this great Service, and necessarily conducing to these Ends.</p>
                              <p>By this Commission we may well observe, for the comfort of all the good and faithful People of this Land, the Justice and Wisdom of the High Court of Parliament, of the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> and of their Right Honourable Commissioners here for the Affairs of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="306" facs="tcp:93738:176"/>1. Their Justice, in bringing these Crimes to Trial.</p>
                              <p>2. Their Wisdom, in ordering this honourable, just and equal form of Trial.</p>
                              <p>1. Their Justice and zeal of Justice appears in this, That in all their Treaties and Articles concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> they would never admit of any the least hope of impunity, for these barbarous and cruel Murthers and Massacres, and breach of Quarter, nor of any thing that might give im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, unto the faithful and impartial inquisition after all that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood, which the merciless Murtherers have wickedly shed in this Land.</p>
                              <p>2. Their Justice and zeal of Justice appears, in that they have omitted nothing too dear to them.</p>
                              <p>But have with admirable charge, resolution and contancy, overcome all hazards and perils, and have with a vast expence of <hi>English</hi> Blood and Treasure, prosecuted this War, (which was but an execution of Justice) to this conclusion, and effected this fair and impartial inquisition for inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood, to put away innocent Blood from the Land; for our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, the righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth, hath revealed it in his holy Scripture, that he will not have such wickedness to pass without condign punishment.</p>
                              <p>For there are three things which the Lord hates, <hi>viz. Oculos sublimes, Linguam mendacem, Manus effundentes innoxium sanginem,</hi> Prov. 6. 17.</p>
                              <p>Their Wisdom appears in this:</p>
                              <p>1. In that, as good Husbandmen, they prepare the re-plantation of the Land, by rooting out the noisom Weeds, that always would over-grow and destroy the good Corn, as we have found by sad Experience.</p>
                              <p>And certainly both in Religion and Prudence, it is undoubtedly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to clear the Land by Justice, of this innocent Blood, the innocent Blood of Christians, most wickedly and cruelly shed upon the Land, against the Laws of God and Man, of Nature and of Nations, the Laws of the Land, and the Rights and Rules of War, and the Bonds of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and humane Society.</p>
                              <p>2. In ordering this form of Trial by an High Court of Justice, for the impartial inquisition, trial, and condign punishment, of these Murthers, Massacres, and breach of Quarter: For 'tis manifest to any Man of sound judgement and right knowledge in the Law, That that ancient and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Trial at the Common Law by Juries, Freeholders of the proper Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Hundreds, or Baronies, where the Facts were done, was neither convenient nor possible for the decision of these Causes, as the present Constitution of the Common-wealth now is.</p>
                              <p>Where now can these numbers of indifferent Jurors be had, <hi>Liberi &amp; legales Homines,</hi> free from all exceptions and challenges, out of which the Juries may be equally impannell'd, for the trial of the Prisoners, that are or shall be charged with these Crimes?</p>
                              <p>How can all the effectual Forms, absolutely requisite to that Trial, be observed in all these Cases, if we do but consider the legal Challenges, both for the Common-wealth and for the Prisoners, to the Array, to the principal Pannel, to the Pales, the peremptory Challenges, the Challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for Causes, inducing favour or affection, hatred or enmity, or for Crime, and how in that course could rightly be the Trial of the Articles of War: So that that course of Trial, not being now apt for the decision of these Causes:</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="307" facs="tcp:93738:176"/>The Commissioners of Parliament have, in wisdom and prudence, erected and constituted this Fair, Honourable, Equal, and Indifferent course of Trial, by erecting an High Court of Justice, for the hearing and determining of these Causes:</p>
                              <p>Wherein are Soldiers for the Articles, Rules, and Laws of War; Judges for the knowledge of the National Laws; others that have Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of the Civil Laws, and other Men of great Experience, Reason, and Judgment; and all of them Men of Honour and Integrity, to be the Triers and Judges in these Cases.</p>
                              <p>Having thus far opened the Commission, and manifested this form and course of Trial to be Honourable, Just, and Equal, I conceive it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite a little to consider the Laws against Murther, which are to be as Land-marks and Guides, to direct and lead us in the right way of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this great Work and Service.</p>
                              <p>Let us take a brief view of the Laws of God, held forth unto us in the holy Scriptures; and of the other Laws against Murther. And herein consider, first,</p>

                              <p>This same horrid sin of Murther, this Devil, crept into the World; it began in the beginning, what can expulse this Devil?</p>
                              <p>We find in the holy Scriptures, that the Devil was the first Murtherer<note place="margin">.1 ☜</note> and Lyar, and that he is the Father of Murtherers and Lyars. The unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews bragged they <hi>had Abraham to their Father,</hi> and yet they sought to kill Christ; whereupon our Saviour tells them, that <hi>they are of their Father the Devil, and the lusts of their Father they will do: He was a Murtherer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him: When he speaketh a Lye, he speaketh of his own.</hi> So that from hence the Lyars and Murtherers take their beginning, and from hence these inseparable Twins make and derive their Pedigree and Descent from the Devil; (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>He was a Lyar and a Murtherer from the beginning;</hi> and he is the Father of Lyars and Murtherers.</p>
                              <p>The first and eldest of these in the Stock and Progeny, was <hi>Cain:</hi>

This<note place="margin">Jude ver. 11.</note> way of <hi>Cain</hi> is chalked out unto us in the beginning of the holy Bible, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 8. that he <hi>talked with his brother Abel; and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his Brother, and slew him.</hi> As soon as this innocent Blood was shed upon the Earth, the cry thereof ascended up to Heaven. <hi>And the Lord said to Cain, What hast thou done? the voice of thy Brothers blood crieth to me from the ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Gen.</hi> 4. 10, 11. <hi>And now thou art accursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy Brothers blood from thy hand. When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the Earth.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Learned Divines observe upon the Text, that whereas our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation is, <hi>The voice of thy Brothers blood crieth unto me;</hi> the Original is, <hi>The voice of thy Brothers bloods,</hi> in the Plural Number; for in killing <hi>Abel,</hi> he did not onely kill him, but also all that posterity, the whole Line that should have descended from <hi>Abel;</hi> and therefore <hi>thy Brothers bloods crieth unto me from the ground.</hi> It is not the single blood, as one of the murthered that crieth for vengeance, but even the blood of all that Posterity, as should have descended from him, crieth to Heaven for Vengeance against the Murtherer.</p>
                              <p>We find this innocent blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> shed in the begining of the World, still in remembrance, uttering her voice in the highest strain, and crying against Murtherers even to the Worlds end.</p>
                              <p>Our Saviour denouncing several woes against the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> tells them, that <hi>they should kill the Prophets that should be sent unto them, that on them may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, even from the blood of righteous Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom they slew between the Temple and the Altar.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>

                                 <hi>which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gift, and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>

                              </p>
                              <p>The blood of righteous <hi>Abel</hi> is still in remembrance, and yet speaking. And in the latter end of the Bible, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 9, 10. we find the <hi>Souls of them that were slain for the testimony of Jesus under the Altar, crying with a loud voyce, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not revenge our blood on them that dwell on earth.</hi> So that the blood of righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> and all the innocent blood shed on the Earth, yet speaketh, and still crieth for vengeance and justice against the Murtherers. And, to conclude the Case of Murther before the Flood, we find, that one of the main causes which provoked Gods wrath, and brought that great destruction of the whole World by <hi>Noah's</hi> Flood, was, <hi>because the earth was filled with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Gen.</hi> 6. 11, 18. And will not that which destroyeth the whole World, over-whelm these Nations, if they be not purged by Justice?</p>

                                 <p>The case of <hi>Agag</hi> King of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> whose life <hi>Saul</hi> spared, being<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 32.</note> brought before <hi>Samuel</hi> the great Judge in <hi>Israel.</hi>

                                    <hi>And Samuel said unto him, As thy sword hath made women childless, so</hi>
                                    <note place="margin">Chap. 15. 3.</note> 
                                    <hi>shall thy Mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>The next case is that of <hi>David; David</hi> writes to <hi>Joab,</hi> by <hi>Uriah;</hi> to<note place="margin">1 Sam. 11. 15.</note> set <hi>Uriah</hi> in the fore-front of the hottest of the Battel, and to retire from him that he may be smitten and die: <hi>Joab</hi> did so, and so <hi>Uriah</hi> was slain.</p>
                                 <p>The Lord, by <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, tells <hi>David, That he had killed</hi>

                                 <p>The Lord sends <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet unto <hi>Ahab,</hi> saying, <hi>Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession, &amp;c.

                                 <p>For a man to be drawn upon a Hurdle to the Place of Execution, and there his Bowels to be burned.</p>
                                 <p>It is considerable, why, and upon what grounds or reasons, Murther was made a more horrid and execrable Crime in <hi>Ireland</hi> than in <hi>England,</hi> and punished with a greater severity, (<hi>viz.</hi>) both with Torture and with Death, the Statute <hi>Decimo Hen.</hi> 7. in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which enacts it to be so, gave the reason of the difference.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Praying the Commons</hi> (saith the Law) <hi>Forasmuch as there have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual Murthers, of malice prepense, used and had in this Land of</hi> Ireland, <hi>&amp;c. contrary to the Law of Almighty God, without any fear of due punishment in that behalf: Therefore the Statute doth enact Wilful Murder to be High Treason.</hi> That sin was grown universal in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment must be extraordinary; the universality of the crime causeth the increasing of the punishment, or the severity thereof; <hi>Ut metus ad omnes poena ad paucos perveniet.</hi> But it will admit another <hi>Quoere,</hi> How it came to pass, that Malice and Murther was universal in <hi>Ireland</hi> more than in <hi>England?</hi> I conceive these two Reasons may be given for it as new.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="311" facs="tcp:93738:178"/>1. We have been these many years weltring in blood, by the frequent Rebellions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that have silenced the Laws.</p>
                                 <p>2. Their was a main defect in their <hi>Irish</hi> Laws and Customs, (<hi>viz.</hi>) their <hi>Brehowne</hi> Law, which the <hi>Irish</hi> continued amongst themselves, and the degenerate <hi>English</hi> embraced it, notwithstanding the introduction of the just and honourable Laws of <hi>England.</hi> Now by their <hi>Irish</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome or <hi>Brehowne</hi> Law, Murther was not punished with death, but onely by Fines, or a pecuniary Mulct, which they called an <hi>Errick.</hi> Therefore when Sir <hi>William Fitz-Williams,</hi> being Deputy, told <hi>Mac-guire,</hi> That he was to send a Sheriff into <hi>Fermanagh,</hi> (being lately before made a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) The Sheriff, said <hi>Mac-Guire,</hi> shall be welcome, but let me know his <hi>Errick,</hi> the price of his Head aforehand, that if my People cut it off, I may put the <hi>Errick</hi> upon the County.</p>
                                 <p>Now for the reformation of these grievous abuses in the Land, in the <hi>10th.</hi> year of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. in the Government of Sir <hi>Edward Poinings</hi> Knight, then Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> there were three good and profitable Statutes made, which were called <hi>Poinings Acts, (viz.)</hi> the Statute of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. for the reviving, confirming, and putting in execution of the Statute of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> held before <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence;</hi> by which Statute at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> the <hi>Brehowne Law</hi> was abolished, and decreed to be no Law, but a lewd Custom.</p>
                                 <p>The Statute of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap. oct.</hi> by which it was Enacted, That if any person took any money, or other amends, for the death of his Kinsman or Friend, then the Law would permit (meaning the Law of <hi>England</hi>) the same shall be Felony by this Law, the <hi>Errick</hi> was taken away.</p>
                                 <p>The Statute of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap. vicessimo primo,</hi> by which Murther is made High Treason in the Actor, Provoker, and Procurer of it. So that by these three Statutes, their <hi>Brehowne</hi> Law and lewd Custom was abolished, their <hi>Errick</hi> taken away, and Murther declared to be High Treason. And thus you see how it came to pass, that Murther is a greater offence, and more severely punished in <hi>Ireland</hi> than in <hi>England;</hi> and by these good Laws, that horrid and execrable Crime and Monster of Blood and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was chain'd up, or at least fetter'd and restrain'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> until its breaking loose upon us in this last and most barbarous and cruel Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, with that inhumane violence, and unsatiable thirst of innocent Blood, with the savage Butcheries of Men, Women, and Children, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect either of Age, or Sex, or Quality, as no History or Age can parallel.</p>
                                 <p>It appears by a Cloud of Witnesses, the execrable Cruelties of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers were not satisfied with the variety of Tortures and cruel Deaths of the living, by Striping, Starving, Burning, Strangling, Burying alive, and by many Exquisite Torments put to death the living; so that a present dispatch by death was a great Mercy: So cruel are the Mercies of the wicked.</p>
                                 <p>But their hellish rage and fury stayed not here, but also extended it self even unto the Babes unborn, ripping them out of their Mothers womb, and destroying even those innocent Babes to satiate their savage cruelty. Nor staid it here, but extended also to the ransacking of the Graves of the Dead, dragging the dead Bodies of the Protestants out of their Graves, because they might not rest in their Hallowed Ground.</p>
                                 <p>Nor did yet their execrable malice stay here, but became boundless, not onely to the devastation and the destruction of the Houses, Castles,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:93738:179"/>
and whole substance of the Protestants, and whatsoever tending to Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but also even to the utter extirpation of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and Protestant Religion out of this Land of <hi>Ireland;</hi> all which the Murderers (for of them I speak) acted with that bruitish outrage, as though Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, or rather the wild Beasts of the Wilderness, Wolves, and Bears, and Tigres, nay, Fiends and Furies, had been brought into the Land.</p>
                                 <p>If any think this Language too harsh, let them consider, how the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost ranks and couples the Murderers with Dogs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15. <hi>For without the holy City, the heavenly Jerusalem, are Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murderers, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lye.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>No, no, Swans language to express either the woful miseries which the Protestants have suffered, or the abominable cruelties the Murtherers have committed, are here tolerable.</p>
                                 <p>I have not words to declare, how the Murderers in this horrid Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion have violated all Laws of God and Man, all Faith, all Bonds of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Humane Society, and how perfidiously they have broken all the Rules, and Rights, and Laws of War.</p>

                                 </p>
                                 <p>And so, contrary to the Laws of War, many Protestants were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered after Quarter given, (of which Crime, both are said to be guilty.) But, that which exceeds all that can be spoken, makes their sin exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinful, and their wickedness most abominable, is, That they began this butchery and cruelty even then, when the Protestants were in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect amity with them, and joyned to them not onely in peaceable Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, but even in those Bonds that they pretend to hold most invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Gossiprick, Fosterage, and such like Ties of Friendship and Alliance.</p>
                                 <p>When they enjoyed so licentious a freedom of their <hi>Romish</hi> Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and free use of their Mass, they had their Titular Arch-bishops for every Province, their Titular Bishop, with his Dean and Chapter, for every Diocess, and their Secular Priest for every Parish in the Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides a monstrous multitude of their Votaries and Regular Clergy: They had their Abbots, Priors, Monks, Nuns, Jesuits, Frieries, Monasteries, Nunneries, Religious Houses, and Convents, in the principal Towns and Cities of the Land, even in this City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the residence of the State; so that Father <hi>Harris,</hi> a Secular Priest of their own, published in Print, That it was as hard to find what number of Friers were in <hi>Dublin,</hi> as to count how many Frogs there were in the second Plague of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                                 </p>

                                    <pb n="313" facs="tcp:93738:179"/>They did not onely exercise all their Superstitious Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but also the Papal Jurisdiction, as by Law they had Vicars General, and kept their Provincial Courts and Consistories, and Excommunicated the People, delivering them to Satan: When they enjoyed the benefit of the same Laws with us; nay, the end and force of the Law was in some cases abated as to them, which was not dispensed withall as to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants: The Popish Lawyers were permitted to practice, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists admitted to Sue forth their Liberties and <hi>Ouster lemains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And these Popish Lawyers, Priests, Jesuits, and Friers, have been the principal Incendiaries and Firebrands of all those horrible Flames which have thus consumed the Land, and were the chief Ring-leaders of this horrid Rebellion, that the publick Burthens and Charges of the Common-wealth were born more by the Protestants than by them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration being had to their numbers, and quality of Possessors of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</p>
                                 <p>And that of the Subsidy granted in <hi>Decimo Car.</hi> whereof they raised so great a clamour both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Protestants paid above one third part of the whole, besides the Clergy, though neither the Quantity or Quality of Lands of Inheritance, then holden of them in the Land, did amount to more than a fifth part; and besides all this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Protestants had contributed to the charge of their Committees, towards the obtaining of Grace in Bounties, in sending Commissioners for them; and even then when the <hi>British</hi> and Protestants had improved the Lands of the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists, and enriched their Estates, and brought into the Land Husbandry, Trades, Manufactury, Traffick, Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, &amp;c. by which means, increase of Wealth grew in the Land to that abundance, that the <hi>Irish</hi> grew not onely Rich but Honourable; also they were made Earls, Viscounts, Lords, Baronets, Knights, &amp;c. And when they enjoyed all this, and much more (if time did permit to declare it) then, even then, without any provocation, suddenly to rise up to this heighth of cruelty, to murder some hundreds of thousands of these Protestants, that lived peaceably and friendly with them, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could take Arms in their hands for their defence; these things, I say, makes the sins of Murder, Violence, and Cruelty, unmeasurably sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and detestable.</p>
                                 <p>But I fear I have been too long and too troublesome, both to you and my self, I will conclude. It is well known how the loud cry of innocent Blood of many thousands of Christians ascending up to Heaven, and the devout and fervent prayers of many of Gods dear Saints and Servants, have solicited the Throne of Justice, that this happy and blessed day might come, wherein Justice might impartially be executed against those Murderers, whose cruelties have made this Land a Field of Blood.</p>
                                 <p>And now since the high and righteous Providence of God, by those many and signal Victories given to the Arms and Forces of <hi>Ireland,</hi> hath sent down from Heaven this day of Justice unto us in this Land; we ought to return him all praise and thankfulness for this unspeakable mercy. And since the trust of this great work, by the same Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is committed unto us, let us stir up his Grace within us, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of our minds and Souls, to the faithful discharge and execution of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:93738:180"/>
this great trust. <hi>Sedes Judicanda est quasi Thronus Dei,</hi> saith old <hi>Bracton,</hi> that learned Chief Justice in <hi>Henry</hi> the Thirds time. I well remember, and have often thought upon the counsel of <hi>Jethro</hi> to <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 18. 2. <hi>Thou shalt provide thee out of all thy people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and set them to judge the people.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Moses</hi> having constituted Judges over the People, gave them this charge, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. Ye shall not respect persons in judgment, but ye shall hear the small as well as the great. Ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is Gods. Deut.</hi> 16. 17.</p>
                                 <p>Give me leave likewise to mind you of <hi>Jehosaphat</hi>'s charge to the Judges, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 6, 7, 9, 11. <hi>Take heed what you do, for you judge not for man but for the Lord, who is with you in judgment. Wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed and do it, for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts. This shall ye do in the fear of the Lord, faithfully, with a perfect heart, and shall judge the cause that shall come before you, between blood and blood, &amp;c.

                                 <p>1. Consider of it, consider well the Case, and consider all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it; beware that no guilty person escape, nor innocent person be condemned: <hi>For he that justifieth the wicked, and condemneth the just, even they both are an abomination to the Lord, Prov.</hi> 17. 15.</p>
                                 <p>2.

                                 <p>And therefore right grave and ponderous are the Entries of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Common Law, <hi>scil.

               <p>One of the last Commanders amongst the <hi>Irish,</hi> which bore up against the Parliament, was <hi>Moitogh O Brian,</hi> who, being at last forced into his Fastnesses, obtain'd in <hi>March,</hi> 1653. the usual Articles of Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; By the favour of which, not less then 27000 Men, had that year been sent away; so as through the numbers that had been killed, died of the Plague, Famine, and had been Transported, the scarcity of People was very considerable; To supply which, <hi>Fleetwood</hi> writ that several Colonies might be sent over, offering very good Conditions to such Families that would Transport themselves; whereupon great numbers of all sorts of Sex flocked into <hi>Ireland,</hi> which <hi>Fleetwood</hi> much indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;<note place="margin">1654.</note>

               <p>And the Affairs of <hi>England</hi> growing every day full of change, <hi>Ireland</hi> (understanding what Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> had nobly attempted in <hi>England</hi>) grew thence early in its dutiful Address to his Majesty; And Sir <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus Jones,</hi> (further'd by his Reverend Brother) Colonel <hi>Warren, Bridges, Thompson, Lisle, Warder</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> seized <hi>Dublin</hi> Castle; Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> about the same time, preferring an Impeachment of Treason against <hi>Ludlow, Tomlinson, Corbet,</hi> and <hi>John Jones;</hi> and weighing the Consequences of the present Distempers, he (together with the Council of the Officers of the Army, present at <hi>Dublin</hi>) the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1659. made a Memorable Declaration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Re-admission of the Secluded Members; about the same time, sending Captain <hi>Cuffe,</hi> to attend Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Convention being the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> before Summon'd by the Vigilance and excellent Contrivance and Industry of Doctor <hi>Dudley Loftus,</hi> in which Sir <hi>James Barry</hi> (afterwards Lord Baron of <hi>Santry</hi>) was Chairman: Several Affairs (of greatest Consequence) came there to be considered. First, the Arrears of the Souldiers, (they were to be fastned to the Design, by their Interest, and by the discharge of what was due to them) then what was most popular, (and look'd least to the mark they aim'd at) came under consideration, in as much as they continued till <hi>May,</hi> 1660. having readily accepted of the Kings<note place="margin">1660.</note> Declaration from <hi>Breda,</hi> of the <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1660. laying hold (by their Declaration, of the <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi>) of his Condescentions, as the fittest expedient to cement the divided Interests in his three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which his Majesty (in his Printed Declaration for the settlement of <hi>Ireland</hi>) takes especial notice of, in these words, <hi>That our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the Protestants</hi> (not Usurpers, as the <hi>Irish</hi> in their Case entitle them,) <hi>in our Kingdom of</hi> Ireland, <hi>have born a very good part in the Blessing of our Restitution, and that they were early in their dutiful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses unto Us, and made the same Professions of a Resolution, to return to their Duty and Obedience to Us, during the time of Our being beyond the Seas, which they have since so eminently made good, and put in practice.</hi> And here I cannot pass over, that when the <hi>Irish</hi> Brigade came to assist <hi>Lambert,</hi> against Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> (now Lord <hi>Delameere</hi>) and were in the North with him at that time, advancing to know what General <hi>Monk</hi> intended; they under <hi>Redman,</hi> and <hi>Bret,</hi> first drew back, though some of their Officers (in their canting mood) thought to have wheedled General <hi>Monk</hi> into a Compliance. The Convention gave his Majesty 20000 <hi>l.</hi> the Duke of <hi>York</hi> 4000 <hi>l.</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> 2000 <hi>l.</hi> and in <hi>May</hi> adjourned to the first of <hi>November,</hi> a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Committee remaining in the interim. And the <hi>18th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1660. his Majesty by his Letter, approved of this Convention, which met again the 22. of <hi>January,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Dumvell</hi> was appointed Chairman; it continued till <hi>May,</hi> 1661. Before they determined, they had by a Committee, very sensible and gallantly defended (at Court) the <hi>English</hi> Interest, against the <hi>Irish;</hi> who (by reason of the Peace which had been made with them in 1646. and 48.) thought they had very much to plead for his Majesties favour, when upon the whole, it was proved, that if any of them were afterwards Loyal, the generality

disobeyed whatever had been indulged them; and the Contract was not to be understood to be made with a Party, but the Community; of which more in its due place.</p>
               <p>His Majesty was no sooner setled in <hi>England,</hi> but (upon both Houses of Parliaments apprehension of the late Rebellion, and the <hi>Irish</hi> flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his Return into <hi>England</hi>) he within few days published his sence of that horrible Conspiracy, in the ensuing Proclamation.

after the Lord Lieutenants departure, the Catholicks unanimously (in their Assembly) joyning (if you dare credit their reports?) with the Lord Deputy, to oppose the Usurpers, as the best means to divert the Parliament, from preventing the Kings Designs in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for which his Majesty (as they say) return'd them thanks, they rejecting then many advantagious offers from <hi>Ireton,</hi> though they were in a low Condition; and so continued faithful till the Lord Deputy was driven to the Mountains, and they at liberty to compound for themselves, many of which went beyond-Sea to serve his Majesty; All which they insist on, as a great test of their Loyalty; whereas it can never be made evident, as is alledged, that Proposals were made to that Assembly by the Usurpers, and refused by them, for the enjoyment of their Rights, Priviledges, and Inheritances, alike with others under their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for indeed such Proposals were never made nor offered to them in their most flourishing Condition; but it is confessed, such Terms were tendred and refused by them, as were agreeable <hi>to a conquering Army to give,</hi> as that of the Usurpers then was, <hi>and to a broken scattered Party to expect,</hi> as the other was; being then reduced to Bogs and Woods, as their best Holts; and yet the Terms so offered and rejected by the Assembly together, were soon after embraced by all of them, divided into Parts, on which they submitted and laid down Arms, having by their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, liberty to transport themselves into Foraign Parts, or to stay in the Kingdom: And therefore, it doth no more consist with their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then with Truth to say, they were forced by banishment, to an opportunity of serving his Majesty beyond-Seas, from whence they date their Merits from him; which was more then his late Majesty of blessed memory could obtain from them, although obliged thereunto by Allegiance, and Articles, when his Distress and their Power were subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to the highest Pitch, and his Prerogative lay at the stake, as he did often complain of: The Commissioners from the Lords Justices and Council, besides this, produced the Instructions of the Supream Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to their Agents for <hi>Rome, France, Spain,</hi> (offering the Crown to either of them that would accept of it) together with the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Marquess, now Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and the order of Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof; whereupon Sir <hi>Nicholas Plunket</hi> (who subscribed the said Instructions, and principally insisted on the forementioned Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars) was sent for by the Committee of Lords, who had the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Affair, and acknowledging his hand-writing, Report thereof was made to his Majesty and Council, by whom it was ordered about the <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1661. <hi>That no more Petitions or Addresses should be received by the</hi> Irish, <hi>to the obstruction of the Settlement of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and that Sir</hi> Nicholas Plunket <hi>should thence-forward no more presume to come into his Majesties Presence, nor to Court;</hi> Likewise there was produced an Oath previously taken by several of the Popish Nobility, Clergy, and others of the Gentry of <hi>Ireland,</hi> before the Articles of Peace, made in 1648.

I must refer you to the Office of the Church.</p>
               <p>Here one might well have thought this bloody Scene should have been fully closed, the event of so horrid a Conspiracy, having by God and Man been severely chastized: But as if Heaven were still to be dared, and Majesty affronted, no sooner was this State setled in so wonderful a manner, as it drew the whole world to look on it as a miracle; but the grand Incendiaries of the late Rebellion, Archbishops, Bishops, and others of that Union, (openly owning their Profession) appear'd in publick, in as much as the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was enforced to take notice of their Insolency, as an encouragement to Popery, beseeching his Majesty, that <hi>Plunket,</hi> the Titular Archbishop of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> and <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> should be apprehended, to answer what might be objected against them: And as an Evidence of their Parties Activeness and Insinuation, the Lord of <hi>Ossory,</hi> Lord Deputy, and the Council, by a Proclamation, dated at the Council Chamber in <hi>Dublin,</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1664. shew, <hi>Whereas information hath been given unto us by divers Gentlemen, and others of the Popish Religion, that several pretended Chapters have been, and are to be soon called in several Parts of this Kingdom, and Meetings appointed by Persons dis-affected to his</hi> Majesties <hi>Government, and to the publick Peace and Quiet, who take opportunities from those Assemblies, to diffuse and spread abroad</hi> (<hi>amongst the People of that Religion Seditious Doctrines, to the great dissatisfaction of all those, who are peaceably and loyally inclined,</hi> &amp;c. They therefore to the avoiding the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, that by such Delusions might be ingendered, and those Dangers, which by the continuance and seducement of the said Persons, and other turbulent Spirits, are endeavour'd) <hi>caution'd and forewarn'd, That none should presume to assist, abett, or countenance them; and that</hi> those (<hi>who were engaged therein</hi>) <hi>should, upon their Duty of Allegiance to his Majesty, forbear any further Proceedings,</hi> &amp;c. All which were afterwards blank'd over, as indeed they had the fortune to be strangely palliated, together with what the Bishop of <hi>Ferns</hi> had discovered to the Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> (pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through <hi>Galacia</hi> to <hi>Madrid</hi>) of <hi>Edmond Reylie,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Ardmagh</hi>'s purpose, to raise the <hi>Irish</hi> again into Rebellion; though some to delude the Age, made a Loyal Formulary or Remonstrance of their Obedience, whilst being admitted at <hi>Dublin,</hi> into a National Synod of their own, 1666. (an Indulgence not yet fathom'd) they there split themselves into Parties, and (the <hi>15th.</hi> day of their meeting) broke up, without the least satisfaction to the End they were connived at; so as from their Principles its natural to conclude, <hi>That whatever a Prince must expect from such men, it must be in subordination to the Popes Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation:</hi> A Reflection on the like made King <hi>H.</hi> 8. say, that he found the Clergy of this Realm were but his half Subjects, or scarce so much, every Bishop or Abbot, (at the entering upon his Dignity) taking an Oath to the Pope, derogatory to that of their Fidelity to the King; which contradiction, he desired his Parliament to take away, and it occasion'd (writes my Lord <hi>Herbert, Fol.</hi> 335) the final renouncing of the Popes Authority, about two years after. The Clergies Oath is given at large, in <hi>Walshe</hi>'s Epistle to his Loyal Formulary, <hi>Fol.</hi> 19. which draws me into a further consideration of the late War.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:93738:186"/>A War in which were interessed (on several Principles) some of the greatest Princes and States of <hi>Europe,</hi> the Pope, Emperor, <hi>France, Spain, Lorraign,</hi> and others, who (professedly, or under-hand) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed Money, Arms, Council, or Countenance.</p>
               <p>A War many years in contriving, and (what makes it the more stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious) so secretly and unexpectedly carried on, (villany hates the light) that considering how far the Conspiracy was spread, and who were engaged in it, it is scarce credible, that no apprehension of its event should in the least be discovered, more then what <hi>Ever Mac Mahon</hi> imparted, 1631. The apprehension of which soon passed over, as did also some other petty suspicions, rais'd I know not from what improbable and confused Rumors, amusing, rather then convincing the Judgment of such, as were most concern'd in the notice of them; so as till the 22. of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1641. late at night, (on the very point of the Plot being acted) nothing seem'd certain or infallible, that if God had not been very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, all had been surprized, before any one had been suspected.</p>
               <p>A War not confined to some Province, or parts of Provinces in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as <hi>Tyrones, Desmonds,</hi> and the rest had been; but as if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign were the joynt Act of the whole Kingdom, all seem'd to have one head, few excepted, whose Honour is the greater.</p>
               <p>A War not arising from small beginnings, as some of the former, which from private Interest, at last espoused greater; But this in its first appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, drove all before it, like some Infections, speedily diffusing its Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome through the whole Body.</p>
               <p>A War, for which the most diligent enquiry, could not have found within the Nation, a Head (in Popularity or Parts) for such an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking: The occasion doubtless of security in most, and whereby the State Politicks of that time were deluded, they having their eyes open onely, on what might have been from abroad suspected, not (much less fear'd) at home, the loud alarms of a <hi>Massinello,</hi> a Person of none or of broken Fortunes, of little Power, or of less Brain, (but any thing, even what is under foot, and next at hand, may easily be taken up, and made by Divine Justice, a sufficient Scourge for a provoking People) such was that Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal</hi> esteem'd, till then generally a very Buffoon in Converse, but after own'd and Honour'd as a Principal in that undertaking; Yet being therein rather the hand then the head, proving, however, the Fire-brand of his Countrey, that being the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> of <hi>Phelim an Totan,</hi> or smoaking <hi>Phelimy,</hi> a Name (on this occasion) given him in way of Honour by his <hi>Irish</hi> Rhimers, and wherein he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self after gloried.</p>
               <p>Finally, a War dismal to the <hi>English</hi> and Protestants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in its beginning; so dismal, as no example through the World ever equall'd it, in the Circumstances that accompanied the Butcheries, Massacres, Cruelties, yea, the mercy of the Rebels in that War; though in the end, fatal to the <hi>Irish</hi> themselves, above any thing that ever befel that Nation, so as the greatness of their Sufferings, may well testifie the remarkable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Crimes, sutable to the innocent blood they had barbarously shed, and the devastations they had made of a most flourishing and well setled Kingdom.</p>

               <p>SI ut bellum aliquod justè geratur, tria requiruntur, Causa Justa, Potestas Legitima, &amp; Legitimus belli administrandi Modus: Haec tria in hoc Bello concurrere jam planum fiet.</p>
               <p>Causa enim hujus belli, est dei Gloria, Cui externum Sacrificii cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, &amp; visibilem Sancti Altaris honorem ab Haereticis impiè ablatum, nos restituendum curamus: Gloria item Christi, Cujus Sacramenta gratiam conferre, cum Haeretici blasphemè negent, Christi Evangelium ejusdem infirmitatis accusant, ob quam lex reprobata fuit: Gloria item Ecclesiae Catholicae, quam contra Scripturarum veritatem Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici aliquot saeculis obscuram &amp; mundo ignotam fuisse mentiuntur. At in Dei Nomine, per Christi Sacramenta sanctificando, &amp; in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae unitate servanda, omnium nostrûm salus potissimum consistit.</p>
               <p>Jam vero Potestas hujus belli sumpta est, primum à Jure Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali, deinde ab Evangelico. Jus Naturale potestatem nobis facit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendendi nosmetipsos contra Manifestissimam Haereticorum Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidem, quia contra jus Naturae sub paena Mortis cogunt Nos prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem Nostram de Pontificis Romani Primatu fidem abjurare, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vamque &amp; planè contrariam Religionem invitos recipere ac profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri. Quale Jugum nec Christiani Judaeis aut Turcis, nec illi No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris, unquam imposuerunt.

               <p>Itaque jam non contra legitimum Angliae Sceptrum &amp; honorabile Solium dimicamus, sed contra Tyrannam, quae Christum in Vicario suo loquentem recusans audire, immo Christi Ecclesiam suo foemineo sexui etiam in fidei causis (de quibus cum Authoritate nec loqui debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret) ausa subjicere, merito regiam Potestatem amisit.</p>

Si Ergo Bellum quod ob Pacem cum Deo renovandam gerimus longè Justissimum est, Qui nobis in hoc bello adversantur damnationem sibi acquirent, habituri adversarios non solum omnes Sanctos, quorum reliquias &amp; sanctas Imagines Haeretici conculcant, sed etiam Deum ipsum, Cujus Gloriam oppugnant.

            <head>The Relation of the Lord <hi>Maguire</hi> written with his own hand in the Tower, and delivered by him to Sir <hi>John Conyers</hi> then Lieutenant, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Lords in Parliament.</head>

               </hi> Term last was twelve Moneth (1640.) the Parliament then sitting, Mr. <hi>Roger Moore</hi> did write to me, desiring me, that if I could in that spare time, I would come to his House (for then the Parliament did nothing but Sit, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ, expecting a Commission for the continuance thereof, their former Commission being expired) and that some things he had to say unto me, that did merely concern me, and on receipt of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the new Commission for continuing the Parliament landed, and I did return him an Answer that I could not fulfil his request for that present; and thereupon he himself came to Town presently after, and sending to me, I went to see him at his Lodging: And after some little time spent in salutation<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he began to discourse of the many Afflictions and Sufferings of the Natives of that Kingdom, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in those late times of my Lord <hi>Strafford's</hi> Government, which gave distast to the whole Kingdom. And then he began to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93738:192"/>
cularlize the suffering of them that were the more antient Natives, as were the <hi>Irish;</hi> how that on several Plantations they were all put out of their Ancestors Estates. All which sufferings he said, did beget a general discontent over all the whole Kingdom in both the Natives; to wit, the Old and New <hi>Irish.</hi> And that if the Gentry of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were disposed to free themselves furtherly from the like incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, and get good Conditions for themselves, for regaining their Ancestors (or at least a good part thereof) Estates, they could never desire a more convenient time than that time, (the distempers of <hi>Scotland</hi> being then on foot) and did ask me what I thought of it; I made him answer that I could not tell what to think of it; such matters being altogether out of my Element. Then he would needs have an Oath of me of secrecy; which I gave him, and thereupon, he told me that he spoke to the best Gentry of Quality in <hi>Lemster,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Connaght</hi> touching that matter, and he found all of them willing thereunto, if so be they could draw to them the Gentry of <hi>Ulster,</hi> for which cause (said he) I came to speak to you; then he began to lay down to me the case that I was in there, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in Debt, the smalness of my Estate, and the greatness of the Estate my Ancestors had, and how I should be sure to get it again, or at least a good part thereof; and moreover how the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and maintaining of the Catholick Religion, which he said, undoubtedly the Parliament now in <hi>England</hi> will suppress, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on it: For, said he, it is to be feared, and so much I hear from every understanding man, the Parliament intends the utter subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Religion, by which perswasions he obtained my consent. And so I demanded whether any more of <hi>Ulster</hi> Gentry were in Town, I told him that <hi>Phillip Reyly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jorilagh O Neal,</hi> brother to Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cosloe mac Mahone</hi> were in Town, so for that time we parted.</p>
            <p>The next day he invited Mr. <hi>Reyly,</hi> and I, to dine with him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner he sent for those other Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>Neale,</hi> and Mr. <hi>mac Mahone,</hi> and when they were come, he began the discourse former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used to me, to them, and with the same perswasions formerly used to me, he obtained their consent. And then he began to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the manner, how it ought to be done, of the feazability, and easiness of the Attempt, considering matters, as they then stood in <hi>England,</hi> the troubles of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the great number of able men in the Kingdom, meaning <hi>Ireland,</hi> what succours they were (more then) to hope for from abroad, and the Army then raised all <hi>Irish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and well armed, meaning the Army raised by my Lord <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> against <hi>Scotland.</hi> First, that every one should endeavour to draw his own friends into that Act. and at least those that did live in one County with them; and when they had so done, they send to the <hi>Irish</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countryes,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to let them know of the day, and resolution, so that they be over with them by that day, or soon after with supply of Arms and Ammunition, as they could; that there should be a set day appointed, and every own in his own quarters should rise out that day, and seize on all Arms he could get in his County, and this day to be near Winter, so that <hi>England</hi> could not be able to send forces into <hi>Ireland</hi> before <hi>May,</hi> and by that time there was no doubt to be made, but that they themselves should be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93738:192"/>
by the <hi>Irish</hi> beyond Seas, who he said could not miss of help from either <hi>Spain,</hi> or the <hi>Pope,</hi> but that his resolutions were not in all things allowed. For, first it was resolved nothing should be done, until first they had sent to the <hi>Irish</hi> over-Seas to know their advice, and what hope of success they could give, for in them, as they said, all their hope of relief was, and they would have both their advice, and resolution before any further proceedings, more than to speak to, and try Gentlemen of the Kingdom, every one, as they could conveniently, to see (in case they would at any time grow to a resolution) what to be, and strength they must trust to; then Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> told them, that it was to no purpose to spend much time in speaking to the Gentry. For there was no doubt to be made of the <hi>Irish,</hi> that they would be ready at any time. And that all the doubt was in the Gentry of the <hi>Pale,</hi> but he said that for his own part, he was really assured, when they had risen out, the <hi>Pale</hi> Gentry would not stay long after, at least that they would not oppose them in any thing, but be Neuters, and if in case they did, that they had men enough in the Kingdom without them. Moreover he said he had spoke to a great man (who then should be nameless) that would not fail at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed day of rising out to appear, and to be seen in the Act. But that until then he was sworn not to reveal him; and that was all that was done at that meeting, only that Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> should the next <hi>Lent</hi> following, make a journey down into the North to know what was done there, and that he also might inform them what he had done, and so on parting, Mr. <hi>Phillip Reyly,</hi> and I, did importune Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> for the knowledge of that great man, that he spake of, and on long entreaty, after binding us to new secrecy, not to discover him till the day should be appointed, he told that it was the Lord of <hi>Mayo,</hi> who was very powerful in Command of men in those parts of <hi>Connaght</hi> wherein he lived, and that there was no doubt to be made of him, no more than was of himself, and so we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Lent</hi> following, Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> according to his promise came into <hi>Ulster,</hi> by reason it was the time of Assizes in several Counties; there he met only with Mr. <hi>Reyly,</hi> and nothing was then done, but all matters put off till the <hi>May</hi> following, where we or most of us should meet at <hi>Dublin,</hi> it being both Parliament and Term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time: In the mean time there landed one <hi>Neale O Neale,</hi> sent by the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> out of <hi>Spain,</hi> to speak with the Gentry of his Name and Kindred, to let them know that he had treated with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> for obtaining succour to come for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that he prevailed with the Cardinal, so that he was to have Arms, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Money from him on demand to come for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that he only expected a Convenient time to come away, and to desire them to be in a readiness, and to procure all others, whom they could, to be so likewise, which message did set on the proceedings very much, so that Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> Mr. <hi>Reyly,</hi> my brother, and I, meeting the next <hi>May</hi> at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the same Messenger there too; It was resolved, that he should return to the Earl into <hi>Spain</hi> with their Resolution, which was that they would rise out twelve or fourteen dayes before or after <hi>Allhallontide,</hi> as they should see cause, and that he should not fail to be with them by that time: There was a report at that time, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93738:193"/>
before that the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> was killed, which was not believed, by reason of many such reports formerly, which we found to be false, and so the Messenger departed with directions, that if the Earls death were true, he should repair into the <hi>Low-Countrys</hi> to Colonel <hi>Owen O Neale,</hi> and acquaint him with his Commission from the Earl; whereof, it was thought, he was not ignorant, and to return an Answer sent by him, and to see what he would advise, or would do himself therein. But presently after his departure, the certainty of the Earls death was known, and on further Resolution it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that an express Messenger should be sent to the Colonel, to make all the Resolutions known to him, and to return speedily with his Answer. And so one <hi>Toole O Comely</hi> a Priest (as I think Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Priest to Mr. <hi>Moore</hi>) was sent away to Colonel <hi>O Neale:</hi> In the interim there came several Letters and News out of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> of Proclamations against the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> and also that the Army raised in <hi>Ireland,</hi> should be disbanded, and conveyed into <hi>Scotland:</hi> And presently after several Colonels and Captains Landed, with directions to carry away those men; amongst whom Colonel <hi>Plunkett,</hi> Colonel <hi>Burne,</hi> and Captain <hi>Bryan O Neale</hi> came, but did not all come together; for <hi>Plunkett</hi> landed before my coming out of Town, and the other two after, wherein a great fear of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of Religion was conceived, and especially by the Gentry of the <hi>Pale,</hi> and it was very common amongst them, that it would be very inconvenient to suffer so many men to be conveyed out of the Kingdom; it being as was said, very confidently reported, that the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Army did threaten never to lay down Arms, until an uniformity of Religion were in the three Kingdoms, and the Catholick Religion suppressed. And thereupon both Houses of Parliament began to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their going, and the Houses were divided in their Opinions; some would have them go, others not; but what the definitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the Houses was touching the point, I cannot tell; for by leave from the House of Lords, I departed into the Country before the Prorogation. But before my departure I was informed by <hi>John Barnewall</hi> a Fryer, that those Gentlemen of the <hi>Pale</hi> (and some other Members of the House of Commons) had several meetings and consultations, how they might make stay of the Souldiers in the Kingdom, and likewise to arm them in defence of the King, being much injured both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> then (as they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) and to prevent any attempt against Religion; and presently after I departed into the Country, and Mr. <hi>Reyly</hi> being a Member of the House of Commons stayed the Prorogation; and on his coming into the Country sent to me to meet him, and I came to his House, where he told me that he heard for certain, that the former Narration of <hi>Barnewall</hi> to me (for I did acquaint him with it) was true and that he heard it from several there; also was <hi>Emar mac Mahone</hi> (made firmly privy to all our proceedings at Mr. <hi>Reylys</hi>) lately come out of the <hi>Pale,</hi> where he met with the aforenamed <hi>John Barnewall,</hi> who told him as much; and he formerly told me, and moreover that those Colonels that lately came over, did proffer their Service, and industry in that Act, and so would raise their men under colour to convey them into <hi>Spain,</hi> and then seize on the Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and with their Arms there to Arm their Souldiers, and have them ready for any occasion, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93738:193"/>
should be commanded them, but that they had not concluded any thing, because they were not assured how the Gentlemen of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the Kingdom (and especially of <hi>Ulster</hi>) would stand affected to that Act, and that assurance of that doubt was all their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment. Then we three began to think, how we might assure them help and of the assistance of <hi>Ulster</hi> Gentlemen; It was thought that one should be sent to them to acquaint them there with, and they made choice of me to come; by reason, as they said, that my Wife was allyed to them and their Countrey-woman, and would believe me, trust me sooner than other of their parts, they or most of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Pale.</hi> And so (without as much as to return home to furnish my self for such a Journey, <hi>Volens, nolens,</hi>) they prevailed, or rather forced me to come to <hi>Dublin</hi> to confer with those Colonels, (and that was the last <hi>August</hi> was Twelve-month). Coming to Town, I met Sir <hi>James Dillon</hi> accidentally before I came to my Lodging, who was one of those Colonels: and after Salutations, he demanded of me where my Lodging was, which when I told him, and parted; the next day being abroad about some other occasions in Town, I met him (as he said) coming to wait on me in my Chamber; but being a good way from it, he desired me to go into his own Chamber, being near at hand; And then began to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the present sufferings and afflictions of that Kingdom, and particularly of Religion, and how they were to expect no redress (the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> intending, and the <hi>Scots</hi> resolving ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to lay down Arms until the Catholick Religion were suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed). Then he likewise began to lay down what danger it would be to suffer so many able Men, as was to go with them to depart the Kingdom in such a time: Neither (said he) do their other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are Colonels and my self, affect our own private profit, so as to prefer it before the general good of the Kingdom; And know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are well affected thereunto; and I hope (said he) ready to put your helping-hand to it upon occasion, I will let you know the resolution of those other Gentlemen and mine, which is, if we are ready to raise our Men, and after to seize on the Castle, where there is great great store of Arms, and arm our selves there. This was the first motion that ever I heard of taking the Castle; for it never came into our thoughts formerly, nor am I perswaded ever would, if it had not proceeded from those Colonels, who were the first motioners and contrivers thereof, for ought known to me; and then to be ready to prevent, and resist any danger, that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Kingdom like thereof, and help us: For we of our selves neither are able, nor will do any thing therein without their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. I began according to the directions that were sent with me to approve of their Resolution, and also to let him know, how sure he might be of the assistance of those of <hi>Ulster.</hi> Then he told us, that for my more satisfaction, I should confer with the rest of the Colonels themselves, as many as are privy to the Action, and accordingly a place of meeting was appointed that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; and on the time and place appointed there met Sir <hi>James</hi> himself, Colonel <hi>Bourne,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Plunket.</hi> And that former Discourse being renewed, they began to lay down the Obstacles to that Enterprise, and how they should be redressed. 1st. If there
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93738:194"/>
should VVar ensue, how there should be Money had to pay the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. 2ly, How and where they should procure succours from For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts. 3dly, How to draw in the <hi>Pale</hi> Gentlemen. 4thly, Who should undertake to surprise the Castle, and how it should be done.</p>
            <p>To the first, it was answered; That the Rents in the Kingdom eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, not having respect whose they should be, due to the Lords and Gentlemen thereof, should be collected to pay the Souldiers. And moreover, they might be sure (nay that there was no doubt thereof) to procure money from the Pope, who gave several pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises formerly to my Lord of <hi>Tyrone</hi> (in case he could make way to come into <hi>Ireland</hi>) to maintain six thousand men yearly at his own charge; and that notwithstanding, that my Lord of <hi>Tyrone</hi> was dead, yet that he would continue the same forwardness now.</p>
            <p>To the second, it was answered by Colonel <hi>Bourne,</hi> that help from abroad could not fail them. For (said he) Colonel <hi>O Neal</hi> told me that he had, or would procure in readiness (I do not remember which of those the Colonel spake, or whether he spoke positive, that Colonel <hi>O Neal</hi> had Arms, or would procure them) Arms for ten thousand men. And moreover (said he) I make no great questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if we send into <hi>Spain,</hi> we shall not miss of aid; for I being in <hi>London</hi> the last year in the <hi>Scots</hi> troubles, I was in conference with one of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadours there then, and talking of their troubles then a-foot; he said, That if the <hi>Irish</hi> did then rise too, and send to <hi>Spain,</hi> their Messengers would be received un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Canopies of Gold. These last words he told me, and some one man of those that were present, privately, whose name I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call to mind; (neither well remember I whether he spoke to them all, or no) then it was thought, that when they were both in Arms for defence of the Catholick cause, they would be succoured by the Catholick Princes of Christendom.</p>
            <p>To the third, it was answered by Colonel <hi>Plunket,</hi> That he was as morally certain (for those were his words) as he could be of any thing, that the <hi>Pale</hi> Gentleman would joyn with them, and assist them. For, he said, I have spoke to several of them since my landing in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and I find them very ready and willing; and withal I have at <hi>London</hi> spoke to some of the Committees, and particularly to my Lord of <hi>Gormonstowne,</hi> to let them know his resolution, and they approved it very well. All this was not done at the first meeting, but at three or four meetings; And so on the last meeting, it was resolved to the last doubt, touching seizing the Castle, that Colonel <hi>Plunket</hi> and Colonel <hi>Bourne</hi> should undertake that Task, because they were nearer to it than any other, and also seize on the Forts, Garrisons and other places, where they think any Arms should be; and in particular, <hi>Londonderry,</hi> which should be underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by those of <hi>Ulster,</hi> and then there was a set-day appointed for the execution thereof; that was the fifth of the ensuing <hi>October,</hi> (this being the latter end of <hi>August,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Anno</hi> 1641. I do not know whether). And every one should make provision to rise out that day; and they were named, that should first succour them, that would take the Castle with men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, namely, Sir <hi>James Dillon,</hi> who did undertake to be with them within 3 (or at the most) 4 days, with 1000 men, and so
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93738:194"/>
much more should come to them out of the <hi>North.</hi> For these two Colonels did not intend to use above 100 men in the surprizal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were to have twenty good able Gentlemen: For they made account, that having the Castle, they with the Artillery would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster all the Town, until they were relieved by men from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; And because there was a doubt made, how all this should be done in so short a time, they did appoint, that all that were there present, should not fail to meet again there the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> to give an account of all things, as well hopes as impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And if on that interview all things should happen to be well, that they go forward, or if otherwise, to prolong the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to a more convenient time, and so we parted every man into the Countrey about his own Task. And I in my way home came to Mr. <hi>Reylies</hi> house, and there I received a Letter from Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal,</hi> that his Lady was dead, and to be buried on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following, this being on the <hi>Saturday,</hi> and desiring me in all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to come to the Burial; and Mr. <hi>Reyly</hi> having received another Letter to the same effect, would needs have me go thither (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I was very unwilling, being weary, withal not provided to go to such a meeting) as well (said he) to prevent any jealousie from the Ladies Friends; as also to confer with Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all those proceedings (for neither he nor I spoke to Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> concerning the matters before) but to his Brother <hi>Jorilagh O Neal,</hi> and coming thither, we found Captain <hi>Brian O Neal,</hi> lately come out of the Low-countreys, sent over by Colonel <hi>O Neal</hi> to speak to, and provoke those of <hi>Ulster</hi> to rise out in Arms, and that he would be with them, on notice of their day, the same day, or soon after it. And it was asked of the said Captain what Aid he could send or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, being but a private Colonel, or where he could get any. He replyed, That the said Colonel told him, that he had sent to several places that Summer to demand Aid, and in particular to Cardinal <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> (to whom he had sent twice that year) and had comfortable, and very hopeful promises from them, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from that Cardinal, on whom he thought the Colonel did most depend, so that there was no doubt to be made of succour from him, and especially when they had risen out, that would be a means to the Cardinal to give Aid; we did the more credit him in regard of the former Treaty between the said Cardinal and the Earl of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi> as formerly is said. For my own part, I did and do believe, that the Colonel doth depend on <hi>France</hi> for Aid, more than on any other place, as well for those reasons, as also that <hi>Ever mac Mahone,</hi> formerly mentioned, told me, That presently after the Isle of <hi>Rees</hi> enterprize (he being then in the Low-countreys did hear for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> together with the Colonel did send into <hi>France,</hi> to the Marshal of <hi>France</hi> (that was General of the <hi>French</hi> Forces at the Isle of <hi>Ree</hi>) to deal with him for procuring of Aid to come then for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that he received an Answer from the said Marshal, that he was most willing and ready to contribute his endeavours for his furtherance therein, but that he could not for the present answer my Lords expectations, by reason that the King had VVars in <hi>Italy,</hi> which he thought would be at an end within half a year, or little more, and then my Lord should not doubt of any
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93738:195"/>
thing, that he could do for his Assistance; but these continued a great deal longer, so for that time that Enterprise failed. So after the Burial was done, I gave those Gentlemen knowledg of what I had done at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and how I was to retire thither; and then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think how they should surprise <hi>Londonderry,</hi> they being near it, but could not then agree in the manner; and so Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> desired me to take his House in my way going to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and that I should have a resolution to carry with me touching <hi>Londonderry,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I parted home, but soon after came to <hi>Dublin</hi> to the fore-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Meeting with those Colonels. But first I took in my way Sir '<hi>Phelim O Neal</hi>'s House, to be certain what he had done; and his Answer was, That he knew that matter could not be put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the fifth of <hi>October,</hi> as was appointed, and that they would make another longer day for it, And that he would provide for the taking of <hi>Londonderry</hi> by that day, and so came to <hi>Dublin</hi> to give an account of that was done, and also know what further should be done. I was not two hours in my Lodging when Mr. <hi>Moor</hi> came to me (who knew what was done by those Colonels formerly from Colonel <hi>Bourn</hi>)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and told me that the Messenger sent to Colonel <hi>O Neal,</hi> was come with an Answer, desiring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us not to delay any time in rising out, and to let him know of that Day before-hand, and that he would not fail to be with us within fourteen days of that Day with good Aid; also desiring us by any means to seize the Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> if we could; for he heard that there was great provision in it for VVar: And Mr. <hi>Moor</hi> moreover said, that time was not to be over-slipped, and desired me to be very pressing with the Colonels to go on in their Resolution; But on meeting the Colonels with them, they were fallen from their Resolution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those of the <hi>Pale</hi> would do nothing therein first; but when it was done, they would not fail to assist us. Colonel <hi>Plunket</hi> did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and so by several meetings it was resolved on by them to desist from that Enterprise for that time, and to expect a more convenient time: But before that their Resolution, Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal,</hi> and the aforesaid Captain <hi>Bryan O Neal</hi> followed me to <hi>Dublin</hi> (as they said) to assist, and advise me how to proceed with that Colonel, but neither they nor Mr. <hi>Moor</hi> would be seen therein themselves to those Gentlemen, but would meet me privately and know what was done at every Meeting; alledging for Excuse, That I being first employed in that matter, it would not be expedient that they should be seen in it. And moreover, they would not be known to be in the Town but by a few of their Friends, until they were in a manner ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Town, at least as long as I was in Town, for I left them there; But when I made them acquainted with their determination of desisting from that Enterprise, they thought it convenient, that we should meet with Mr. <hi>Moor</hi> and Colonel <hi>Bourn</hi> to see what was further to be done, concerning the further intention of their own, and according we did send to them that they should meet us; and on that Meeting, it was, Where was only Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> Mr. <hi>Moor,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Bourne,</hi> Captain <hi>Neal,</hi> and my self. After long debate, it was resolved, That we with all those that were of our faction should go on with that determination that was formerly made, concluded to rise out. Moreover, to seize on the Castle (as the Colonels were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93738:195"/>
purposed, for if it were not for their project, and the advice sent by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Neale,</hi> we would never venture to surprise it, neither was it ever thought on in all the Meetings and Resolutions between us, before those Colonels did resolve on it, but by reason, that the other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were privy to these proceedings were not present, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the time and the manner how to execute it was put off to a further meeting in the Country, and this was resolved in <hi>Dublin</hi> on the <hi>Sunday</hi> at Night, being the twenty sixth or twenty seventh of <hi>September,</hi> and the meeting was appointed on the <hi>Saturday</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>mac Colloe, mac Mahone</hi>'s house in <hi>Farney</hi> in the County of <hi>Monaghan.</hi> And thereupon we all left the Town, only Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> stayed about some other his private occasions, but did assure his being there at that day; and by reason, that at that meeting the Gentry of <hi>Lemster</hi> could not be, considering the remoteness of the place from them; it was thought fit that Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> should there meet to receive the final Resolution, and should acquaint them therewith: And in the mean time Colonel <hi>Bourne,</hi> who had undertaken for Colonel <hi>Plunkett,</hi> should inform them all the intention conceived, and dispose them in readiness against that day that should be appointed. On <hi>Saturday</hi> I came to Mr. <hi>mac Mahone</hi>'s house; there met only Mr. <hi>mac<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mahone</hi> himself, Captain <hi>Neale, Ever mac Mahone,</hi> and my self, and thither thatsame day came the Messenger that was sent to Colonel <hi>Neale,</hi> and did report the Colonels answer and advice <hi>verbatim,</hi> as I have formerly repeated from Mr. <hi>Moore;</hi> and by reason that Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> his Brother, or Mr. <hi>Phillip Reyly,</hi> that were desired to meet, did not meet; we stayed that Night to expect them, and that Night I received a Letter from Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> intreating us by any means, not to expect him untill the <hi>Munday</hi> following; for he had, nor could dispatch some occasions merely concerning him, but whatever became of them, he would not fail of the <hi>Munday:</hi> And the next day after receipt of the Letter being <hi>Sunday</hi> (by Mr. <hi>Moores</hi> advice) we departed from Colonel <hi>mac Mahones</hi> house to prevent (as he said) the suspition of the <hi>English</hi> there (many living near) to <hi>Loghrosse</hi> in the County of <hi>Ardmagh</hi> to Mr. <hi>Torilagh O Neale</hi>'s house (not Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s Brother, but Son to Mr. <hi>Henry O Neale</hi> of the <hi>Fewes,</hi> Son in Law to Mr. <hi>Moore</hi>) and left word, that if Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> or any of those Gentlemen did come in the mean time, they should follow us thither (whether only went Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> Captain <hi>O Neale</hi> and my self) and there we expected until the <hi>Tuesday</hi> subsequent before any of those did come. On the <hi>Tuesday</hi> came Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> and <hi>Ever mac Mahone,</hi> all the rest fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to come, Mr. <hi>mac Mahone</hi>'s wife was dead the Night before, which was the cause that he was not there, but I gave his assent to what should be concluded to win therein, and execute what should be appointed him; and then we five (<hi>viz.</hi>) Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> Captain <hi>O Neale, Ever mac Mahone,</hi> and my self, assuring our selves, that those Gentlemen absent should both allow, and joyn to what we should determine, did grow into a final Resolution, grounding all or most part of our hope and confidence on the Succours from Colonel <hi>O Neale,</hi> to seize on the Castle, and rise out all in one day, and the day was appointed on the 23th. of that Moneth, this being the 5th. day of <hi>October,</hi> having regard therein to the day of the week, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that day did fall, which was the <hi>Saturday,</hi> being the Market day,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93738:196"/>
on which day there would be less notice taken of people up and down the streets; then began a question who should be deputed for the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisal of the Castle, and then Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> said he would be one of them himself, and that Colonel <hi>Bourne</hi> should be another, and what other Gentlemen of <hi>Lemster</hi> they could procure to joyn with them, and seeing the Castle had two Gates, the one the great, the other the little Gate going down to my Lord Lieutenant's Stables, hard by which Stables, without the Castle, was the Store-house for Arms, they of <hi>Lemster</hi> would undertake one Gate, and that should be the little Gate, and the great Gate should be undertaken by those of <hi>Ulster,</hi> and (said he) of necessity one of you both (meaning Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> and me) must be there, for the mere countenance of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it being the glory of all our proceedings, and all that his Speech was well liked of all present: But Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> would be exempted from that imployment, and so would I; but then all of them set on me, desiring me to be one, alledging for Reason, that their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Resolutions were very honorable and glorious, it being for Religion, and for to procure more liberty for their Country, as did (say they) of late <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that in taking the Castle consisted all the glory and honour of the said Act; all which should be attributed to them which should be imployed therein, and so by consequence all, or most part to be there, being (as they said) the chief in that Enterprise, and more, Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> said that he would endeavour to take or procure others to take <hi>Londonderry</hi> the same day, and if he should be away, that place would not be taken; with these and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other perswasions they obtained my consent, and then the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain offered himself: they began to think what number should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that Act; and they concluded on two hundred men, one hundred from each Province, for those States which they seize on, of which number Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale</hi> should send forty with an able sufficient Gentleman to conduct them: And likewise Captain <hi>Neale</hi> twenty, Mr. <hi>mac Mahone,</hi> Mr. <hi>Reyly</hi> ten more, and I should bring twenty two; then began a doubt how they should raise those men, and convey them to <hi>Dublin</hi> without suspicion; and it was answered that under pretence of carrying them to those Colonels that were conveying Souldiers into the Kingdom, it might safely be done; and to that purpose Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale,</hi> Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> and the Captain had several blank Patents with Deputations to make Captains to those Colonels, which they sent to those that should send men to <hi>Dublin:</hi> for the more colour, they bethought of what was to be done in the Country that day, and it was resolved, that every one privy to that matter in every part of the Kingdom should rise up that day, and seize on all the Forts and Arms in the several Counties, to make all the Gentry Prisoners, the more to assure themselves against any averse fortune, and not to kill any, but where of necessity they must be forced thereunto by opposition (and that those that were appointed for taking of the Castle should observe) and in particular the Gentry: All their Army in <hi>Ulster</hi> to take that day <hi>Londonderry,</hi> which Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> did undertake, and <hi>Knockfergus,</hi> which they thought Sir <hi>Henry mac O Neale</hi> would do; and to that end Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s Brother <hi>Torilagh O Neale</hi> should be sent to them; and the <hi>Newry</hi> which should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by Sir <hi>Conne Magennis,</hi> and his Brothers; for whom Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:93738:196"/>
in regard they were his Brothers in Law, his deceased Lady being their Sister, did undertake. Moreover, it was agreed, that Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Coll mac Mahone,</hi> and my Brother should with all the speed they could after that day raise all the forces they could, and follow us to <hi>Dublin;</hi> But to Arm the men, and succour, and attend, and garrison the Town and Castle; And likewise Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> should appoint <hi>Lemster</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to send like supply of men; then there was fear of the <hi>Scots</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they should presently oppose themselves, and that would make the matter more difficult, and to avoid which danger, it was resolved on, not to meddle with them, or any thing belonging to them, and to demean themselves towards them, as if they were of themselves, which they thought would pacifie them from any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and if the <hi>Scots</hi> would not accept of that offer of amity, but would oppose them, they were in good hope to cause a stir in <hi>Scotland</hi> that might divert them from them; and I believe the ground for that hope was, that two years before, in or about the beginning of the <hi>Scots</hi> troubles, my Lord of <hi>Tyrone</hi> sent one <hi>Torilagh O Neal</hi> (a Priest) out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that this, I take it, was the time that he was in Treaty with Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> to my Lord of <hi>Argile,</hi> to Treat with him for help from my Lord, for him to come into <hi>Ireland,</hi> as was said for Marriage between the said Earl and my Lord of <hi>Argiles</hi> Daughter (or Sister I know not which) and this Messenger was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> with whom Mr. <hi>Torilagh O Neale,</hi> Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s Brother had conference, from whom this Relation was had, that said Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger went into <hi>Scotland,</hi> as I did hear from the said Mr. <hi>Neale,</hi> or from <hi>Ever mac Mahone</hi> aforenamed, I know not from which of them, but what he did there I could never hear, by reason that my Lord of <hi>Tyrone</hi> was presently after killed, they were the more confirmed therein, hearing that my Lord of <hi>Argile</hi> did say (near to the same time as I guess, and when the Army was raised in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as I think) to a great Lady in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I know not her name, but did hear, that she was much imbarqued in the troubles of that Kingdom, there she que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning, how they could subsist against the two Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> that if the King did endeavour to stir <hi>Ireland</hi> against them, he would kindle such a Fire in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as would hardly or never be quenched; And moreover they knew my Lord to be Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with the <hi>Highlanders, Redshanks</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whom they thought would be prone, and ready to such Actions, they for the most part descended out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> holding the <hi>Irish</hi> Language and Manners still, and so we parted. The next day being <hi>Wednesday Leghrosse</hi> every man went about his own task, and so when I came home I acquainted my Brother with all that was done, and what they had appointed him to do, and did like according as they had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, send to Mr. <hi>Reyly</hi> to let him know as much, and the 18th of the same Month I began my Journy to <hi>Dublin;</hi> and when I came to <hi>Dublin</hi> (being the day bofore the appointed day for putting that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution in execution there) I met with Captain <hi>Conne O Neale,</hi> sent out of the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> by Colonel <hi>O Neal,</hi> who was sent, after the Messenger sent by us formerly to the said Colonel was by him disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with his Answer, to encourage us in our Resolution, and to speedy Performance, with assurance of Succour, which he said would not fail of the Colonels behalf, and for the more certainty of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93738:197"/>
help from him, and to assure us that the Colonel had good hopes to procure aid from others, he said that it was he himself, that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed from him to Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> twice, that some men who gave very fair promises to assure the Colonels expectations, with which he said, that the said Colonel was really with himself assured of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals aid, and that he was likewise commanded by the Colonel upon our Resolution of the day, to give notice thereof to him, and that he would be within 14. days over with them with aid; but he landed 9. or 10. days before, and meeting with Captain <hi>Brian O Neal,</hi> who made him acquainted with what was Resolved; He did write all the matter to Colonel <hi>O Neale,</hi> so as he was sure of his speedy coming: And so that Evening he and I came to meet the other Gentlemen; and there were met Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> Colonel <hi>Bourne,</hi> Colonel <hi>Plunkett,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Fox,</hi> and other <hi>Lemster</hi> Gentlemen, a Captain (I think of the <hi>Bournes,</hi> but I am not sure whether a <hi>Bourne</hi> or <hi>Toole</hi>) and Captain <hi>Bryan O Neale,</hi> and taking an account of those that should have been there; it was found that Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale,</hi> Mr. <hi>Collo mac Mahone</hi> did fail of sending their men; and Colonel <hi>Bourne</hi> did miss Sir <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Gavanagh,</hi> that had promised him to be there, but he said he was sure he would not fail to be that Night or the next Morning in Town: And of the two hundred men that were appointed, there were only eighty present, yet notwithstanding they were resolved to go on in their Resolution, and all the difference was at what time of the day they would set on the Castle, and after some debate, it was resolved in the Afternoon, and the rather hoping to meet the Colonel there then; for they said, if they should take Castle, and be enforced by any extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity for not reciving timely succour out of the Country (having them they could not want) and so parted that Night, but to meet in the Morning to see further what was to be done, and immediately thereon, I came to my Chamber, and about nine of the Clock, Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> and Captain <hi>Fox</hi> came to me, and told me all was discovered, and that the City was in Arms, and the Gates were shut up, and so departed from me: And what became of them, and of the rest, I know not, nor think that they escaped, but how, and at what time I do not know, because I my self vvas taken that Morning.</p>

            <p>WHereas We the Lords, Justices, and Council have lately found that there waas a most disloyal, wicked and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conspiracy intended and plotted against the Lives of Us, the Lords, Justices, and Council, and many others of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties faithful Subjects, especially in <hi>Ulster,</hi> and the borders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and for the surprizing, not only of his Majesties Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> his Majesties principal Fort, but also of other Fortifications in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts, and although by the great goodness, and abundant mercy of Almighty God to his Majesty, and to this State and Kingdom, these wicked conspiracies are brought to light, and some of the Conspiracies committed to the Castle of <hi>Dublin</hi> by Us, by his Majesty's Authority, so as those wicked and damnable plots have not taken effect in the chief parts thereof, yet some of those wicked Malefactors have sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised some of his Majesty's Forts and Garrisons in the North of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> slain divers of his Majesty's good Subjects, imprisoned some, and robbed and spoiled very many others, and continue yet in those Rebellious courses, against whom therefore some of his Majesty's Forces are now marching to fight against them, and subdue them, thereby to render safety to his Majesty's faithful Subjects: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to colour and countenance those their wicked Intendments and Acts, and in hope to gain the more numbers, and reputation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their proceedings in the opinion of the ignorant common people, those Conspirators have yet gone further, and to their other high Crimes and Offences, have added this further wickedness, even to traduce the Crown and State, as well of <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Ireland,</hi> by false seditious and scandalous reports, and rumors spread abroad by them. We therefore to vindicate the Crown and State of both Kingdoms, from those false and wicked calumnies, do hereby in his Majesty's name publish and declare, that the said reports so spread abroad by those wicked persons are most false wicked and triterous, and that We have full Power and Authority from his Majesty, to prosecute and subdue those Rebels and Traytors, which now We are doing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, by the Power and Strength of his Majesty's Army, and

with the Assistance of his Majesty's good and Loyal Subjects, and We no way doubt, but all his Majesty's good and faithful Subjects will give Faith and Credit to Us, who have the Honour to be trusted by his Majesty so highly, as to serve Him in the Government of this his Kingdom, rather then to the vain, idle, and wicked Reports of such lewd and wicked Conspirators, who spread those false and seditious Rumors, hoping to seduce a great number to their party. And as We now believe that some who have joyned themselves with those Conspirators, had no hand in contriving, or plotting the mischiefs intended, but under pretence of those seditious Scandals were delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by those Conspirators, and so are now become ignorantly involved in their guilts, so in favour and mercy to those so deluded, We hereby charge and command them in his Majesty's name, now from Us to take light to guide them from that darkness, into which they were misled by the wicked seducement of those Conspirators, and to depart from them, and from their wicked Counsels, and Actions, and according to the duty of Loyal Subjects, to submit themselves to his Sacred Majesty, and to his Royal Authority, intrusted with Us. But in case those persons which were no Plotters, nor Contrivers of the said Treason, but were since seduced to joyn with them, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, lay not hold of this his Majesty's Grace and Favour, now ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unto them, then We do by this Proclamation Publish and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they shall hereafter be reputed, and taken equally guilty with the said Plotters and Contrivers, and as uncapable of Favour and Mercy, as they are.</p>

               <salute>Our very Good Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>OUR Alliance unto your Lordships Ancestors, and your self, and the Tryal of your and their performance of Trust unto their Friends in their greatest Adversity, encourageth us and engageth your Honour to our fruition of your future favours; The fixion of our Confidence in you before any other of the Peers and privy Councellors of the Kingdom doubleth this Obligation. Your Lordship may therefore be pleased to acquaint the Lords, Justices, and Councel (to be impanted unto his Sacred Majesty) with our Grievances, and the causes thereof, the reading of which we most humbly pray, and the manner of it.</p>
            <p>First, The Papists in the neighbouring Counties are severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and their miseries might serve as Beacons unto us to look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our own, when our Neighbours Houses are on fire: And we and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papists are, and ever will be as loyal Subjects as any in the King's Dominions; For manifestation whereof we send herein inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an Oath solemnly taken by us, which as it received indeleble Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in our hearts, shall be sign'd with our hand, and seal'd with our Blood.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is an incapacity in the Papists, of Honour and the Immunities of true Subjects, the royal Marks of distributive Justice, and a dis-favour in the Commutative, which rais'd Strangers and Foreigners, whose valour and vertue was invincble, when the old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the <hi>English,</hi> and the major part of us the meer <hi>Irish,</hi> did swim in blood to serve the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> and when Offices should call Men of worth, Men without worth and merit obtain them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Statute of the 2. <hi>Eliz</hi> of force in this Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us and they of our Religion, doth not a little disanimate us and the rest.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The avoidance of Grants of our Lands and Liberties by Quirks and Quiddities of the Law, without reflecting upon the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93738:200"/>
King's Royal and real Intention for confirming our Estates, his Broad Seal being the pawn betwixt his Majesty and his people.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The restraint of purchase in the meer <hi>Irish</hi> of Lands in the Escheated Counties, and the taint and blemish of them and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities doth more discontent them than that plantation Rule; for they are brought to that Exigent of povertie in these late times, that they must be sellers and not buyers of Land.</p>
            <p>And we conceive, and humbly offer to your Lordships consideration (<hi>Principiis obsta</hi>) that in the beginning of this Commotion, Your Lordship, as it is hereditary for you, will be a Physitian to cure this Disease in us, and by our Examples it will doubtless beget the like auspicious success in all other parts of the Kingdom: For we are of opinion it is one sickness and one pharmach will suffice, <hi>Sublatâ cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sâ tollitur Effectus:</hi> And it will be recorded, that you will do ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto God, King, and Countrey; And for salving every the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Soars Your Lordship is to be an humble Suitor in our behalf, and of the rest of the Papists, that out of the abundance of his Majesties Clemency, there may be an Act of Oblivion and general pardon without restitution or Account of Goods taken in the time of this Commotion, a liberty of our Religion, a repeal of all Statutes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made to the contrary, and not by Proclamation, but Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary way; A Charter free Denizen in ample manner for meer <hi>Irish:</hi> All which in succeeding Ages will prove an Union in all his Majesties Dominions instead of Division, a Comfort in Desolation, and a Happiness in perpetuity for an imminent Calamitie. And this being granted, there will be all things, <hi>Quae sunt Caesaris Caesari,</hi> and <hi>Quae sunt Dei Deo.</hi> And it was by the Poet written (though he be prophane in other matters, yet in this) prophetically <hi>Divisum Imperium cum Jove, Caesar habet;</hi> All which for this present we leave to your Honourable Care: And we will, as we ever did, and do remain,</p>

               <p>IT is well known to all men, but more particularly to his Majesties Subjects of this Kingdom, who have all gathered plentiful and comfortable fruits of his Majesties blessed Government, how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly careful his Majesty hath been in the whole course of his Government, of the peace and safety of this his Kingdom, and how graciously he hath laboured to derive to all his Subjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, all those benefits and comforts, which from a most gracious King, could be conferred on his Subjects, to make them a happy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whereof he hath given many great testimonies. And as at all times he endeavoured to give them due contentment and satisfaction, so even then whilst the Rebels now in Arms were conspiring mischief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Him, and his Crown and Kingdom, he was then exercising Acts of Grace and benignity towards them, granting to his Subjects here the fulness of their own desires in all things, so far as with Honour or Justice he possibly could, and particularly when the Committees of both Houses of Parliament here this last Summer attended his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in <hi>England,</hi> at which time (amongst many other things graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously assented to by Him, he was content, even with apparent loss and disadvantage to himself, to depart with sundry his Rights of very great value, which lawfully and justly he might have retained; And as his continual goodness to his people, and his Princely care of their prosperity and preservation shall (to the unspeakable joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of all his good Subjects) render him glorious to all Posterity, so the wicked ingratitude and treacherous disloyaltie of those Rebels shall render them infamous to all Ages: and utterly inexcusable even in the judgment of those, who for any respect either formerly wished well to their persons, or now pity them in their transgressions. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the said persons now in Rebellion were in no degree provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by any just cause of publique grief received from his Majesty, or his Ministers, to undertake such desperate wickedness, neither can justly assign any severity or rigour in the execution of those Laws which are in force in this Kingdom against Papists, nor indeed any cause at all, other then the unnatural hatred, which those persons in Rebellion do bear the Brittish and Protestants, whom they desire and publickly profess to root out from amongst them. The more strange

in that very many of themselves are descended of <hi>English,</hi> whence is the original and foundation of all their Estates, and those great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which they have hitherto enjoyed, and whence their Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and others then well affected in this Kingdom, have been at all times since the Conquest cherished, relieved, countenanced, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported against the ancient Enemies of the Kings people of <hi>England:</hi> many of the <hi>Irish</hi> also having received their Estates and livelyhood from the unexampled bounty and goodness of the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> Yet such is their inbred ingratitude and disloyaltie, as they conspired to massacre Us the Lords, Justices, and Councel, and all the Brittish and Protestants universally throughout this Kingdom, and to seize in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, not only his Majesties Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the principal Fort in this Kingdom, but also all other the fortifications thereof, though (by the infinite goodness and mercy of God) those wicked and devillish Conspiracies were brought to light, and some of the Principal Conspirators imprisoned in his Majesties Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> by Us by his Majesties Authority, so as those wicked and damnable plots are disappointed in the chief parts thereof, His Majesties said Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and City of <hi>Dublin</hi> being preserved, and put into such a condition of strength, as if any of them, or their Adherents shall presume to make any attempt thereupon, they shall (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) receive that correction, shame, confusion and destruction, which is due to their treacherous and detestable disloyaltie. And in pursuit of their bloody intentions, they assembled themselves in Arms in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile manner, with Banners displayed surprised divers of his Majesties Forts and Garrisons, possessed themselves thereof, robbed and spoiled many thousands of his Majesties good Subjects, Brittish and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, of all their Goods, dispossessed them of their Houses and Lands, murthered many of them upon the place, stripped naked many others of them, and so exposed them to nakedness, cold and famine, as they thereof died; imprisoned many others, some of them persons of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent quality; laid Siege to divers of his Majesties Forts and Towns yet in his Majesties hands, and committed many other barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties and execrable inhumanities, upon the Persons and Estates of the Brittish and Protestant Subjects of the Kingdom, without regard of quality, age, or sex. And to cover their wickedness, in those cruel Acts, so to deceive the World, and to make way (if they could) to the effecting of their mischievous ends,; they add yet to their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness a further degree of impiety, pretending outwardly that what they do, is for the maintenance and advancement of the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; whereas it appears manifestly, that their aims and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses inwardly are (if it were possible for them so to do) to wrest from him his Royal Crown and Scepter, and his just Soveraignty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Kingdom and Nation, and to deprive him, and his lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of all Authority and Power here, and to place it on such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as they think fit, which can no way stand with his Majesties just Prerogative; nor can any equal-minded man be seduced to believe that they can wish well to his Royal Person, or any thing that is his, who in their actions have expressed such unheard-of hatred, malice, and scorn of the Brittish Nation, as they have done. And such is their madness as they consider not, that his Sacred Majesty disdains to have his Name or Power so boldly traduced by such wicked male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93738:201"/>
Rebels having never in any Age been esteemed fit supporters of the King's Prerogative, much less these, who (under countenance thereof) labour to deface and shake off his Government, and extirp his most loyal and faithful Subjects of his other Kingdoms and here, whose preservation (above all earthly things) is and always hath been his Majesties principal study and endeavour, which even these Traytors themselves have abundantly found, with comfort, if they could have been sensible of it. And whereas divers Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>English</hi> Pale preferred petition unto Us, in the behalf of themselves and the rest of the Pale, and other the old <hi>English</hi> of this Kingdom, shewing that whereas a late conspiracy of Treason was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, of ill-affected persons of the old <hi>Irish,</hi> and that, thereupon Proclamation was published by Us; wherein (among other things) it was declared that the said Conspiracy was perpetrated by <hi>Irish</hi> Papists, without distinction of any, and they doubting that by those general words of <hi>Irish</hi> Papists, they might seem to be involved, though they declared themselves confident, that we did not intend to include them therein, in regard they alleadged they were none of the old <hi>Irish</hi> nor of their Faction or Confederacy; but (as they then pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) altogether averse and opposite to all their designs, and all others of like condition. We therefore to give them full satisfaction (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving indeed at that time great confidence in their loyaltie) did by Proclamation, dated the 29. of <hi>October</hi> 1641. declare and publish, that by the words, <hi>Irish</hi> Papists, VVe intended only such of the old meer <hi>Irish</hi> in the Province of <hi>Ulster,</hi> as were then Actors in that Treason, and others, who adhered to them; and that VVe did not any way intend or mean thereby any of the old <hi>English</hi> of the <hi>Pale,</hi> nor of any other parts of this Kingdom, then esteemed good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, VVe being then (as we conceived) well assured of their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to the Crown, and having experience of the good affection and services of their Ancestors, in former times of danger and Rebellion. And indeed, so believing were we in their faithfulness and loyaltie to the Crown, as we then also represented it into <hi>England</hi> for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and thereupon in the Order of the Lords and Commons in the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> His Majesties loyal Subjects of <hi>English</hi> Blood, though of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Inhabitants within several Counties and parts of this Realm are mentioned, as those who have always in former Rebellions given te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of their fidelity to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> And in further testimony of the good affiance we had in their loyaltie, VVe issued Arms to the several Counties of the <hi>English</hi> Pale, the better to enable them to discharge their duties in defending those parts, and His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties good Subjects therein, against the Rebels, upon deep professions of loyalty made by them, and their seeming detestation of the loath som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the crimes, and bloody guilts of the Rebels, which they for their parts professed (with many Oaths and protestations) to abhor, and promised to oppose and resist them with all their power. And we issued Arms also to many Noblemen and Gentlemen of the <hi>Pale,</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, for the defence of their Houses against the Rebels. Yet much contrary to the expectation of all equal-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, and in deceit of the trust reposed in them by this State, and directly contrary, as to their loyaltie and duty to His Majesty, so to the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93738:202"/>
great professions which they had so lately before made at this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel-Board, many of those, as well whole Counties, as particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons entrusted with those Arms, revolted to the Rebels, carried His Majesties Arms with them, and so the Arms which were trusted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, for the protection of His Majesties good Subjects, they converted to the annoyance and destruction (as much as in them lay) of those good Subjects they were trusted to protect, and of this State and Government, and have not only not resisted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, but have also joyned with them, and they and the Rebels as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in Arms in hostile manner, with Banners displayed against his Majesty, in besieging some of his Town, taking into their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by force or fraud many of his Majesties Burroughs, walled and unwalled, and in committing murthers, spoyls, robberies, and many detestable cruelties on His Majesties good Subjects. And although those of the <hi>Pale,</hi> pretended that they were not able to assemble or Arm any strength against the Rebels, yet lately they found means to assemble, and arm great multitudes to assist the Rebels against His Majesties Forces, and against His Majesties Government, and this State, and as well the persons who were the first Actors in this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, as also many others in the <hi>English Pale,</hi> and several other parts of the Kingdom, forgetting those duties which (by the Laws of God and man) are due from them to His Sacred Majesty, are so ungrateful to His Majesty for the great and abundant benefits and favours from Him, and His Royal Father, and Predecessors derived to them, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible of the happiness which they (with all others in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) enjoyed by His blessed Government, and so improvident to themselves and their posterity, as they have presumed most unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to conspire, raise, and act those abominable Treasons and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against His Majesty, as is herein formerly mentioned.

               <opener>
                  <salute>Right Honorable, my very good Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>SIthence my last by my Lord of <hi>Dungarvan,</hi> my own indisposition and imbecillity hath been such as in mine one person. I have not been able to attempt any thing, but have by my Sickness been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to my Chamber: but the forward earnestness and zeale to the service in my Lord of <hi>Inchequin,</hi> Colonel <hi>Vavasor,</hi> Captain <hi>Jephson,</hi> and the rest of the Officers of the small Army here hath accomplished some Exploits, whereof you may please to receive the ensuing Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I being besieged on the North side of the City by my Lord <hi>Muskry,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carty Leath,</hi> and all the rest of the Western Forces, and having notice that my Lord <hi>Roche,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Ikarne, Donboin,</hi> the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Loghmay,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Butler,</hi> and all the tipperary Forces were drawing up to beleager me on the South, I dispatched away the two Troops then newly landed under the Command of my Lord <hi>Inche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi> and Captain <hi>Jephson</hi> into the Lord <hi>Roches</hi> Country, in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance to divert him from his intended course hitherwards, which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93738:205"/>
to so good purpose, as that I since understand the tipperary Forces have forsaken him, and that he remains himself upon his keeping in his own Countrey. During the stay of these Troops there, they were desired to the relief of a Castle called <hi>Rathgogan</hi> by one M. <hi>Meade,</hi> which M. <hi>Jephson</hi> having performed with a Squadron of each Troop, and 80. Musqueteers drawn out of his House and mine: In his retreat he was encountered by two or three Companies from <hi>Kilmallocke,</hi> on whom he with a Horse, and another Officer with a Foot charged in several places, and routed them, slaying about 150. besides 50. slain in relieving the Castle. On the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of this instant, my Lord of <hi>Muskry</hi> (who hath kept his Camp a long time at <hi>Rochforts</hi> Town three miles from this City) caused a part of his Army to chase home our Scouts to the very Suburbs, where in a bravado they made a stand, wherat my Lord <hi>Inchequin,</hi> Colonel <hi>Vavasor,</hi> and the rest of the Officers being much incensed obtained my leave to issue forth immediately with three hundred Musqueteers, and two Troops of Horse; upon the sallying out they found the Enemy retreated, and pursued him to his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where the main Body consisting of thirty six Colours as they were numbred, forthwith appeared: and after several parties sent from the main Body to skirmish with our men, had been beaten back, they began to pack up their Baggage, and forsook their Camp, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whom our men made all the speed they might; and having cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them two or three miles, charged upon the rear, routed the whole Army, which betook it self to flight over a Bog unpassable for our Horse, and took all their carriage and luggage, whereof the Lord of <hi>Muskeries</hi> own Armour, Tent, and Trunks were a part, slew about two hundred of their men that took to firm ground, and retired without loss of a man. Whereby it is very easie to observe with what facility the Enemy might now be dealt withal, before he can recollect himself anew, or receive forreign supplies which they daily and hourly expect, and being once come to their hands, it will not then be treble the charge and expence both of blood and treasure that will suppress them, which now would reduce them to a very great straight.</p>
               <p>And therefore I do most humbly beseech your Lordship that spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy supplies of Men, Moneys, Arms, Munition and Artilery, with all necessaries depending thereon, as Conducters, Pioneers, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trosses, Carriages, Tackle, Horses and Oxen for draught, and all other appurtenances that may either be sent over, or Commission and means to raise and maintain them here, here being but one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneer, and one Clerk of the store in this Province: without these your Lordship knows that it is to no boot to march into the Field, where if the Enemy be not too hard for us, he will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to his Holds, and so secure himself against our Forces.</p>
               <p>The necessary use of Firelocks and Dragoons, and of a competent supply of Victual, the stock of this Countrey being totally wasted, will deserve serious consideration: and if I had been so fortunate as to have received any succours by those late Easterly winds, it would have so discouraged the Enemy now newly routed, and animated the Protestant party, as that I am very confident by God's assistance I should have given your Lordship a good account of the quiet of these
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93738:205"/>
parts. Whereas they observing that this fair opportunity hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed us no relief, do begin to muster up their Forces afresh, and to take heart at the apprehension of our being deserted in <hi>England</hi> and left wholly to our selves, wherein I cannot sufficiently express how miserable our condition is; for having from the beginning of these troubles supported the Forces mentioned in the inclosed list with Moneys gained upon several hard terms and engagements (besides what I have impressed to the succour sent thence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) I was at last constrained to seize upon four thousand pounds belonging to Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Tynte,</hi> and ready to be transported out of the Kingdom (and which he refused to lend upon the Publick-faith of this State, which nevertheless I gave him upon the seisure) meerly to preserve the Army from disbanding, which otherwise it must have undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done. And therefore I humbly desire that money may be sent over, not only to discharge that and other engagements, amounting to 4000 pounds more, but that there may be order taken for the entring of those men into pay, and continuing them therein ever since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the present troubles which I <note n="*" place="margin">mentioned sol. 82.</note> raised at first (by direction from the Lords Justices) for this service, and that the same course may be taken for them as for the rest.</p>
               <p>The heighth of insolency and arrogancy in the Enemy will appear by the inclosed Remonstrance <note n="*" place="margin">The Rebels Remonstrance here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to it (in the shuffling of Papers) are unhappily lost, though the one was not more insolent then the other resolute and loyal.</note> which they sent me after a motion made for a Cessation, which in the condition I was in, I had some inclination to condescend unto, in case it had been sought for in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting terms: to which purpose I willed them to address their humble petition to his Majesty, and in case I did approve thereof, I would give way thereunto, and to a cessation until his pleasure were known; whereupon they transmit me that, whereof the inclosed is a Copy: at which I took (justly as I conceive) such offence as caused me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them the inclosed Answer, which I should have seconded with such further testimony of my aversion to their insolency as would tend much to their disincouragement were I enabled with any reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable strength so to do, which I earnestly desire I may be, and with instructions what hand to carry in the prosecution of them, and how to manage the War against them; for that every day they encrease in insolency and riot, hanging such prisoners as are not able to pay Ransom, ransoming others, hanging old Women, and stripping all they can lay hold on. All that is left in this Province is the City of <hi>Corke,</hi> the Towns of <hi>Kingsale, Youghall,</hi> and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donbridge;</hi> the Cities of <hi>Limricke</hi> and <hi>Waterford</hi> being fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to defection, save that the Fort in the former is able to command the Town if provided with Munition, wherewith I have sent to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it.</p>
               <p>For persons in Action, it is far less difficult to nominate those that adhere to the Crown, which are the Earl of <hi>Barrymore,</hi> (an industrious servitour) the Lord Viscount <hi>Killmallocke,</hi> Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Barret,</hi> and <hi>Edmond Fitz-Gerrarld</hi> of <hi>Ballmarter</hi> commonly called the <hi>Senescall</hi> of <hi>Imokilly,</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>by whose care and countenance (joyned with my Lord <hi>Barrimore's</hi>) that Barrony of <hi>Imokilly</hi> is kept in due subjection, and the passage betwixt this City and <hi>Youghall</hi> thereby open. But whilst we stand on these unable terms to stir out of these Walls, the Enemy is at liberty to range and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93738:206"/>
forrage over all parts of the Countrey. And indeed our wants of Money are so great and pressing, as that for defect of entertainment and encouragement, the Officers both of Horse and Foot daily flock unto me, and importune to be dismissed and left at liberty to seek their preferment in <hi>England:</hi> and so soon as this little (which is left me to feed the Souldiers with from hand to mouth) is spent, I know no way to prevent their sudden disbanding: and therefore I do again beseech your Lordship to endeavour that I may not be exposed to the dishonour and misery of being abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King's Forces, and left my self single to the mercy of the Enemy; but that Moneys may be speedily transmitted unto me with directions what pay to allow the Horsemen, and Officers of the Foot, with an overplus of Money, as I have always desired, for extraordinary and emergent occasions, about either the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or Forts, whereas yet nothing is in a right posture, but things only shuffled together for a shift by reason we had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to the work as it ought.</p>

            <head>Acts agreed upon, ordained and concluded in the General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation held at <hi>Kilkanny</hi> the 10, 11, and 13 days of <hi>May,</hi> 1642. by those Prelates whose Names are subscrib'd, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of such other Prelates as then were absent being present, together with the Superiours of the Regulars, and many other Dignitaries and learn'd Men, as well in Divine, as also in Common Law, with divers Pastors and others of the Catholick Clergy of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> whose Names are likewise hereafter set down.</head>
            <p n="1">1. WHereas the VVar which now in <hi>Ireland</hi> the Catholicks do maintain against Sectaries, and chiefly against Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, for the Defence of the Catholick Religion, for the maintenance of the Prerogative and the Royal Rights of our gracious King <hi>Charles,</hi> for our gracious Queen so unworthily abus'd by the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, for the Honour, safety and Health of their Royal Issue, for to avert and refrain the Injuries done unto them, for the Conservation of the just, and lawful Safeguard, Liberties and Rights of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and lastly for the defence of their own Lives, Fortunes, Lands and Possessions: VVhereas I said this VVar is by the <hi>Catholiques</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for the aforesaid causes against unlawful Usurpers, Oppressors and their Enemies, chiefly Puritans. And that hereof we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed aswel by divers and true Remonstrances of divers Provinces, Counties and Noblemen, as also by the unanimous consent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of almost the whole Kingdom in this VVar and Union. VVe therefore declare that VVar openly Catholick to be lawful and just, in which VVar, if some of the Catholicks be found to proceed out of some particular and unjust Title, covetousness, cruelty, revenge or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93738:207"/>
hatred, or any such unlawful private intentions. VVe declare them therein grievously to sin, and therefore worthy to be punished and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained with Ecclesiastical Censures if, (advised thereof) they do not amend.</p>
            <p n="2">2. VVhereas the Adversaries do spread divers rumours, do write divers Letters, and under the King's Name do print Proclamations, which are not the King's, by which means divers plots and dangers may ensue unto our Nation; VVe therefore to stop the way of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth and forgeries of the Political Adversaries, do will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, That no such rumours, Letters, or Proclamations may have place, or belief, until it be known in a National Councel, whether they truly proceed from the King, left to his own freedom, and until the Agents of this Kingdom hereafter to be appointed by a National Councel, have free passage to his Majesty, whereby the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may be certainly enformed of his Majesties intention and will.</p>
            <p n="3">3. VVhereas no Family, City, Common-wealth, much less any Kingdom may stand without union and concord, without which this Kingdom for the present standeth in most danger. VVe think it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore necessary that all <hi>Irish</hi> Peers, Magistrates, Noblemen, Cities and Provinces, may be tied together with the holy bond of Union and Concord, and that they frame an Oath of Union and agreement which they shall devoutly and Christianly take, and faithfully observe. And for the conservation and exercise of this Union, VVe have thought fit to ordain the ensuing Points.</p>
            <p n="4">4. VVe straightly command all our inferiours, aswell Churchmen as Laymen to make no distinction at all between the old and ancient <hi>Irish,</hi> and no Alienation, comparison, or differences between Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Cities, Towns or Families; and lastly, not to begin, or forward any emulations, or comparisons whatsoever.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That in every Province of <hi>Ireland</hi> there be a Councel made up, both of Clergy and Nobility, in which Councel shall be so many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at least as are Counties in the Province, and out of every City or notable Town two persons.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let one general Councel of the whole Kingdom be made, both of the Clergy, Nobility, Cities and notable Towns, in which Councel there shall be three out of every Province, and out of every City one, or where Cities are not, out of the chiefest Towns. To this Councel the Provincial Councels shall have subordination, and from thence to it may be appealed, until this National Councel have opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to sit together, Again, if any thing of great importance do oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, or be conceived in one Province, which by a negative Vote is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in the Councel of one Province, let it be sent to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of other Provinces; except it be such a matter as cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, and which doth not pertain to the Weal-publick of the other Provinces.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Embassage sent from one Province to forraign Nations shall be held as made from the rest of the Provinces, and the fruit or benefit thereof shall be imparted, and divided between the Provinces and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which have more need thereof, chiefly such helps and fruits, as proceed from the bountiful liberality of forreign Princes, States, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates or others whatsoever; provided always that the charge and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage be proportionably recompenced.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:93738:207"/>8. If there be any Province which may not conveniently send Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage from it self unto forraign Nations, let it signifie it to another Province, which may conveniently supply it, and ought in regard of their Union to supply it, according to the instructions sent from the other Provinces concerning the place, and Princes to which they would have their Embassage employed.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Let a faithful Inventory be made in every Province of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Burnings, and other Cruelties, which are committed by the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan Enemies, with a Quotation of the place, day, cause, manner, and persons, and other circumstances subscribed by one of publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In every Parish, let a faithful and sworn Messenger be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereby such Cruelties, and other affaires may be written and sent to the neighbouring places, and likewise from one Province to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; Let such things be written for the comfort, instruction, and carefulness of the People.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Great men taken prisoners in one Province, may not be set at liberty for any price, prayers, or exchange, without the consent of the Prelates and Nobility of the other Province united, and let every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince be careful of the Liberties of such Prisoners as are from the other Provinces, as far as it conveniently may.</p>
            <p n="12">12. If any one stubborn, or dangerous be found in one Province, County, or Town, Let him be sent to another Province, County or Town, where he may be safely kept, (and with less danger, or loss of others) remain.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Whosoever shall be declared in one County or Province, Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary or Traitor of this Cause and Country, shall likewise be held and punished in other Countries and Provinces, where he shall be found, and such as receive or favour him, or be his Messengers knowing his misdemeanour, shall be liable to such punishment as the Traitor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p n="14">14. We Command and Ordain as a main point pertaining to this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that no Province, County, City, Town or Person whatsoever shall demand Peace, or submit himself to the Enemies, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the general Council of the whole Kingdom, and that under pain of Excommunication to be incurred <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and for further force of this Statute to be observed; We will that in every Province a firm Oath be taken by the Peers, Nobility, Corporation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty of every Province, and thereupon a Publick and Authentical Instrument be made; And that every Province do send into every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Province an Instrument subscribed, with the proper hands of such as have taken this Oath, for the assurance of their Oaths, and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall refuse to take this Oath, let him be held as Adversary of the common Cause, and of the Kingdom, and let him be punished as such as hereafter shall be declared, except he be excused for the Reasons hereafter to be set down.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The Ordinaries of every place, The Preachers, Confessors, Parish-Priests, and other Churchmen shall endeavour to see perfect peace and charity observed between Provinces, Counties, Cities, and Families, as the obligation of this Union requireth.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Such Goods as well moveable as unmoveable pertaining to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, as were recovered from the Enemies by this present War,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93738:208"/>
shall be restored to their former owners, Provided that such necessary and reasonable charges shall be paid, as the next general or Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Council or Commitees of the County where the Parties dwell, shall decree.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Whereas diverse persons do diversly carry themselves towards this Cause, some with helps and supplies do assist the Adversaries, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with Victuals and Arms, others with their Advice and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, supporting as it were the contrary Cause, some also as Neuters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having themselves, and others lastly neglecting their Oath do forsake the Catholick Union and Cause. We do therefore declare and judge all and every such as do forsake this Union, do fight for our Enemies, accompany them in their War, defend or in any other way assist them, as giving them Weapons, Victuals, Counsel, or Favour, to be Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and by these Presents do Excomunicate them; Provided that this present Decree shall be first published in every Diocess re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively, and having received admonition before hand, which shall supply the treble admonition otherwise requisite, and we do hereby declare, so it be made in a place where it may easiy come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of those whom it toucheth. But as touching the Judgment and Punishment of the Neuters we leave it to the Ordinaries of every place respectively, so that the Ordinaries themselves be not contrary to the Judgment and Opinion of this Congregation, in which cause, we Commit power to the Metropolitans or Archbishops to proceed against such Ordinaries, according to the common course of Law, wherein they are to be very careful and speedy, and if the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans be found herein careless or guilty, let them be lyable to such pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment as is ordained by the holy Canons, and let them be accused to the See Apostolick.</p>
            <p n="18">18.

               <p>WHereas for special reasons of State moving Us thereunto, We issued divers VVarrants, forbidding his Majesties Army, to burn certain Houses and Corn, and to forbear pillaging, spoiling, and taking away Goods and Cattle of divers persons; And whereas also not only We the Lords, Justices, or one of Us, or our very good Lord the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Ossory,</hi> Lieutenant General of the Army, but also the late and present Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander or Commanders of his Majesties Forces in the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> or in <hi>Drogheda</hi> and other places within the Province of <hi>Lemster</hi> (some of them having no authority or direction so to do) and issued War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants admitting sundry persons (many of which persons by their present ill demerits in this General Rebellion, might justly have been forthwith prosecuted with fire and sword) with safety to bring or send to the Markets of <hi>Dublin, Drogheda,</hi> and other places, Corn and other provisions, to be there sold, which was done in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation that by that forbearance used towards them, when they saw just vengeance taken on others for the same adhering to, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving those who in this Rebellion publickly carry Arms, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit open Acts of Hostility, they might be moved to depart from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to, or relieving those notorious Actors in the Rebellion, in gratitude to his Majesty and this State, for so much clemency used towards them; yet so ungrateful have many or most of those persons been found, and so insensible of the duty and loyaltie of good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to his Majesty, as notwithstanding that clemency used to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, they have not returned the fruits of Loyaltie expected from them, but on the contrary have run on in their former rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courses, not so much as having to this time offered any assistance to this State, or any the Governors or Commanders of the Army, and have murdered many <hi>English</hi> and other Subjects in several parts: it being observed, that if any of his Majesties good Subjects, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers or others, pass by, not strongly guarded, they are set upon and murthered in the High-ways and passages as they travel, the very
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93738:214"/>
Plowmen and those that keep Cattle, having continually Arms ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them in the Fields, to murther those his Majesties good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects when they find them weakly guarded; and on the other side when they find them strongly guarded, they seem to go on in their Plowing and Husbandry, shewing those Warrants for their safety, and seeming to be poor, innocent, and harmless Labourers. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the aforesaid open Rebels were frequently in some of their Houses, and continually round about them, they never gave us any intelligence concerning the proceedings of those open Rebels, nor of the places where they had often meetings, and where they might be found to be fallen on by his Majesties Army, which they might easily have done, if their affections to his Majesty and his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been such as by the Laws of God they ought to be, or if they desired to live humbly in obedience to the Laws, as some of them pretend: And albeit in many of the said VVarrants there were conditions expressed, and in all of them Conditions implyed, that the parties taking benefit thereby, should behave themselves as becomes dutiful and Loyal Subjects, whereby We might justly proceed to their deserved Correction, without any violation on Our parts of the said VVarrants, or the word thereby given. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit also that most of those VVarrants were not in themselves Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections to the parties, further than in giving them leave to bring or send Corn and other provisions to the Markets, whereby their Servants, or Horses, or Provisions should not be seized on by the Souldiers when they came to the Markets, which admittance fell out as well for their benefit, as intended for the furnishing of the Market; Yet because We find that the further continuing of those VVarrants, do now appear inevitably to induce a great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to his Majesties General Service, and many of those people do either ignorantly (or perhaps purposely) mistake the true sense and meaning of those VVarrants, and do give out to interpret them to be Protections granted to them for the safety of their Lives and Estates, how foul soever they are in their crimes, which is an interpretation that cannot justly be made out of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or meaning of those VVarrants; yet in regard We (who are entrusted here by His Majesty for the government of this His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and People), are so tender of His Majesties Honour, as VVe neither have done, nor will do anything, that by any construction can be interpreted a Breach of any word given by Us, neither have desired or willingly permitted any violence or hurt to be done to any Inhabitant, or any prejudice, other than for the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Defence and safety of this State, and other His Majesties good Subjects, against those that tookup Arms against His Majesty. And for that we are now necessitated to resolve, not to suffer this State to be any longer deluded and abused, and His Majesties good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects murthered (even as it were in our own view in scorn and affront of the State) and some of the actors passing with impunity under countenance of these VVarrants, VVe think fit before we proceed to the just Correction of those who have so declared themselves Enemies to the Peace of this Kingdom, hereby to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and declare that the said VVarrants so granted by Us the <hi>Lords, Justices,</hi> or either of Us, or by Us the <hi>Lords, Justices</hi> and <hi>Councel,</hi>

               <p>WHereas in the beginning of this hideous and detestable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, We the Lords Justices and Council, desirous if it might be to give some sudden stop thereunto; so to prevent the spreading thereof, and the growth of it to that height to which it hath sithence risen, and conceiving that at that time the multitude were by evil Council, or false rumors seduced to partake in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, who not knowing the truth and depth of the Combination, We did think, could not so wretchedly fail in their Duty and Loyalty to their most Gracious King and Soveraign, as so universally to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in their course of Disobedience to his Majesties Authority, but would with treatable and fair admonitions, laying before them their great danger and the iniquity of their enterprise, have returned to their obedience, We therefore on the 27th. of <hi>October</hi> last, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed divers persons of quality and trust for the several Counties of <hi>Down, Antrim, Armagh, Monaghan, Cavan, Tirone</hi> and <hi>Ferma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagh</hi> (amongst other Powers then entrusted with them) to parly with the Rebels, or any of them, and by Proclamation, or otherwise, to proffer his Majesties Grace and Mercy to them, or any of them, and to receive such of them into his Majesties Grace and Mercy as should submit themselves and desire the same. Yet We held fit then to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the said Commission with our Letters to the said Commissioners, wherein We signified to them, that although by the said Commission We gave them that power, yet We did then let them know that for those who were Chief among the Rebels, and Ring-leaders of the rest to disobedience, that We adjudged them less worthy of favour then the others, whom they had mis-guided. And therefore for those princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal persons We required them to take care not to be too forward (without first consulting this Board) in proffering or promising mercy to those, unless they the Commissioners saw it of great and unavoidable necessity. Which power entrusted by Us with the said Commissioners was then granted, in respect of the conjuncture of affaires at that time, and to answer the then sudden extremities in the publick service. And whereas We have now received information that a long time after the said power entrusted with them, and when the State of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was far different from the Condition wherein it stood at the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93738:216"/>
issuing of the said Commission, and after the general Conspiracy was fully discovered; and that the Rebels of all degrees and conditions had with hateful and bloody obstinacy declared their purpose to extirp the Brittish, throughout the whole Kingdom, without hope of reconcilement, other then by the strength of his Majesties forces, some of the said Commissioners (notwithstanding the premonition given them by Our said Letters, and without consulting this Board therein) have given Protections of late to many of the said Rebels being prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal persons and freeholders, which Protections are (in sundry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects) found to be a mighty hindrance to His Majesties service in those parts, and tending to His Majesties loss and disadvantage. And albeit We are informed that those persons so protected have by their mis-behaviours since the Protections granted to them, violated the express or implyed conditions of all Protections, which besides the unreasonableness of the granting of them, contrary to the intent of Our direction in Our said Letters, might justly give cause to have those Rebells immediately faln upon, and cut off. Yet in regard We who are entrusted here by His Majesty for the Government of this His Kingdom and People, are so tender of His Majesties honour; as We neither have done, nor will do any thing, that by any construction, can be interpreted a breach of any word given by Us, or any other authorized by Us. We think fit before we proceed to the just correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those Rebels, hereby to publish and declare, that all the said Protections granted since the first of <hi>March</hi> last to any person or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoever, in the County of <hi>Downe,</hi> or other Counties above named, shall at the end of ten days next after the pubishing of this Proclamation at <hi>Down-Patrick or Strangford</hi> in the said County of <hi>Down,</hi> or at any other publick place in any of the said Counties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively, stand void and be annulled, repealed and revoked. And we do hereby accordingly from and after the said ten days revoke, repeal, make void and annull them, and every of them, to all intents and purposes, as if they had never been granted, and do Order that from and after the said ten days, they be of no force, nor derive any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, protection or security to any of the parties to whom they were so granted. And this Proclamation We require the Sheriff of the County of <hi>Downe,</hi> and the several Sheriffs of the said several Counties respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, to cause to be proclaimed and published at <hi>Down-Patrick</hi> and <hi>Strangford</hi> aforesaid, and at some publick places in the said several Counties respectively, that so all persons whom it may concern, may take notice thereof, and that hereafter when by the Power and Strength of Hu Majesties Army the said Offenders receive due punishment for their high transgressions, they may not have any colour to presend the beast breach of word in this State or any the Ministers thereof.</p>

            <p>And forasmuch as in the said League or Covenant, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things contained not only tending to a seditious Combination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst His Majesty, but also contrary to the municipal Laws of this Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and destructive to the Church-Government established by Law in this Kingdom, And for that by the Laws of this Kingdom, no Oath ought to be tendred to, or taken by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or persons whatsoever in this Kingdom, but before a Judge or other person thereunto Lawfully Authorised by His Majesty, and for that the said League or Covenant is now endeavoured to be set on foot in this Kingdom, without His Majesties Privity, Direction, or Allowance. And in regard it is directly contrary to the Liberty and Freedom of the Subject, to be by any such Oath or Covenant pre-enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, And for that the setting on foot at this time in this Kingdom the said League or Covenant, without His Majesties Allowance, may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beget much distraction and unquietness amongst His Majesties good Subjects, but also may prove very penal to all those who shall presume to tender or take the same: We therefore for prevention of such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, do in His Majesties Name strictly charge and command, all His Majesties good Subjects of what degree or quality soever within this Kingdom, upon their Allegiance to His Majesties, that they presume not to enter into or take the said League, Covenant or Oath. And we do likewise inhibit and forbid all His Majesties Subjects in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to impose, administer, or tender the said League, Oath, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And if notwithstanding this our Proclamation, any person shall presume to impose, tender, or take the said League, Oath or Covenant, We shall proceed against him or them with all severity according to the known Laws of the Land.</p>

               <opener>To the Kings most Excellent Majesty.</opener>
               <head>The humble Petition of divers of your Majesties Protestant Subjects in your Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well Commanders of Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Army here, as others whose Names are subscrib'd, in the behalf of themselves and other Your Protestant Subjects in this Your Kingdom.</head>
               <p>Sheweth,</p>
               <p>THAT this Your Highness Kingdom (reduced with the vast Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Treasure, and much effusion of British blood, to the obedience of the Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi>) hath been by the Princely care of your Royal Progenitors, especially of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and of Your Royal Father of ever blessed Memory, and your Sacred Majesty, in many parts happily planted, great sums of Moneys disbursed in Buildings and Improvements, Churches edified and endowed, and frequented with multitudes of good Protestants, and your yearly Customs and Revenues rais'd to great yearly sums, by the industry of your Protestant Subjects especially, and great sums of Money by way of Subsidies and Contributions chearfully paid unto your Majesty by your said Subjects. In which happiness this your Kingdom hath flourished in a long-continued Peace, and under your Highness most glorious and happy Government, until that by the present general Conspiracy and Rebellion <hi>rais'd out of Detestation of Your blessed Government, and for rooting out of the Protestant Religion: and so for the dispossessing of Your Majesty of this Your said Kingdom, without the least occasion offered by Your Majesty or Your Protestant Subjects.</hi> And notwithstanding that Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty immediately before, had enlarg'd beyond president Your Royal favour and bounty to them, in granting all that their and our joint Agents did desire of Your Majesty. And we continuing amongst them in all Love and Amity, without distrust; Your Petitioners and others who labour'd to oppose those damnable Designs and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have been driven from their Dwellings, Estates, and Fortunes; their Houses and Churches burnt and demolished; All Monuments of Civility utterly defaced, Your Majesties Forts and places of strength

thrown down, and the Common and Statute-Laws of this Your Kingdom utterly confounded, by taking upon themselves the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of all manner of Authorities and Jurisdictions, Ecclesiastical and Civil, both by Sea and Land, proper and peculiar to Your Sacred Majesty, being Your just Prerogatives and the Royal Flowers of Your Imperial Diadem, to the Disherison of Your Crown, and Your Royal Revenues brought to nothing, and the Protestant Clergy with their Revenues and support for the present destroyed; This Your Kingdom in all parts formerly inhabited with Brittish Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, now depopulated of them, and many thousands of Your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Subjects most barbarously used, stripped naked, tortur'd, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish'd, hang'd, buried alive, drown'd, and otherwise by all barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous cruel sorts of Death murther'd; such as yet remain of them are reduced to that extremity, that very few of them have wherewithal to maintain a Being, and all of them so terrified and afflicted with those barbarous and inhuman cruelties (the true report whereof being now spread abroad into the Christian World)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Your Suppliants conceive fears, that Your Majesties Brittish Subjects will be discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from coming again to inhabit this Kingdom, and the remnant of what is left will be forced to depart: All this being done by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy of the Papists, who did publickly declare the utter extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Protestant Religion, and all the Brittish Professors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of out of this Your Majesties Kingdom. And to the end it may the better in some measure appear, Your Suppliants have made choice of Captain <hi>William Ridgeway,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton</hi> Knight and Baronet, Captain <hi>Michael Jones,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fenton Parsons,</hi> whom they have employed and authorized as their Agents to manifest the truth thereof in such Particulars as for the present they are furnish'd withal, referring the more ample manifestation thereof to the said Captain <hi>William Ridgeway,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton,</hi> Captain <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Fenton Parsons,</hi> or any three or more of them, and such other Agents as shall with all convenient speed be sent, as occasion shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, to attend Your Majesty, from Your Protestant Subjects of the several Provinces of this Your Kingdom.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX, XII. Fol. 142.</head>
            <head>The Propositions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> humbly presented to His Sacred Majesty, in pursuance of their Remonstrance of Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to be annexed to the said Remonstrance; together with the humble Answer of the Agents for the Protestants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the said Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions made in pursuance of Your Majesties di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>May 1644.</hi> requiring the same.</head>
            <p>1. <hi>Pro.</hi> THAT all Acts made against the Professors of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholick faith, whereby any restraint, penalty, Mulct, or incapacity may be laid upon any <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks within the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> may be repealed, and the said Catholicks to be allowed the freedom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To the first we say, that this hath been the pretence of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all those who have entred into Rebellion in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> at any time since the Reformation of Religion there, which was setled by Acts of Parliament above eighty years since, and hath wrought good effects ever since for the peace and welfare both of the Church and Kingdom there, and of the Church and Kingdom of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and Protestant party throughout all Christendom, and so hath been found wholesom and necessary by long experience, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing of those Laws will set up Popery again, both in Jurisdiction, profession and practice, as that was before the said Reformation, and introduce among other inconveniencies the Supremacy of <hi>Rome,</hi> and take away or much endanger Your Majesties Supream and just Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Causes Ecclesiastical, Administration of honour and power not to be endured, the said Acts extending as well to seditious Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as to Popish Recusants; so as by the repeal thereof, any man may seem to be left to chuse his own Religion in that Kingdom, which must needs beget great confusion; and the abounding of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93738:220"/>
               <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy hath been one of the greatest occasions of this late Rebellion; besides, it is humbly desired that Your Majesty will be pleased to take into Your gracious consideration a Clause in the Act of Parliament passed by Your Majesties Royal Assent in <hi>England</hi> in the 17th year of Your Raign, touching punishments to be inflicted upon those that shall introduce the Authority of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> in any Cause whatsoever.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Pro.</hi> That Your Majesty will be pleased to call a free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the said Kingdom, to be held and continued as in the said Remonstrance is expressed, and the Statute of the 10th year of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. called <hi>Poyning's Acts,</hi> explaining or enlarging the same, be suspended during that Parliament, for the speedy settlement of the present Affairs, and the repeal thereof be there further consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> VVhereas their desire to have a free Parliament called, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecteth by secret and cunning implication upon Your Majesties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as if it were not a free Parliament, we humbly beseech Your Majesty to present how dangerous it is to make such insinuation or intimation to your people of that Kingdom touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Parliament, wherein several Acts of Parliament have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready past, the validity whereof may be endangered if the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should not be approved as a free Parliament, and it is a point of high nature, as we humbly conceive is not properly to be dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed but in Parliament; and Your Majesties said Parliament now sitting is a free Parliament in Law, holden before a person of honour and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in the Kingdom, composed of good loyal and well-affected Subjects to Your Majesty, who doubtless will be ready to comply in all things that shall appear to be pious and just, for the good of the True Protestant Religion, and for Your Majesties service and the good of the Church and State, that if this present Parliament should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved it would be a great terrour and discontent to all Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Protestant Subjects of the Kingdom, and may be also a means to force many of Your Majesties Subjects to quit that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or peradventure to adhere to some other party there, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the <hi>Romish Irish</hi> Confederates, rather than to be liable to their power, which effects may prove of most dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and we humbly offer to Your Majesties consideration Your own gracious Expression mentioned in the grounds and motives inducing Your Majesty to agree to a Cessation of Arms for one whole year with the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of <hi>Ireland,</hi> printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> 19. <hi>Octob.</hi> 1643. And let all your good Subjects be assured, that as we have for these reasons, and with caution and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration consented to the Proposition to peace, and to that purpose do continue do continue our Parliament there, so we shall proceed in the accomplishing thereof with that care and circumspection, that we shall not admit even peace it self otherways than it may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Conscience, Honour and Justice. VVe also humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that such Laws as Your Majesty shall think fit to pass, may be transmitted according to <hi>Poynings</hi> Law, and other Laws of explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, or of addition thereunto now in force with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and security to Your Majesties Protestant Subjects; but if the present Parliament be dissolved, we humbly represent unto Your
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93738:220"/>
Majesty, that so many of your ablest and best Protestant Subjects have been murthered or banished by this Rebellion, the few or no Protestant free-holders will be found in the Countreys, Cities or Burroughs to elect and chuse Knights, Citizens or Burgesses, which will be most dangerous to your Majesties Rights and Prerogatives and good Subjects, and may beget great disputes in after-times for the repealings of <hi>Poynings</hi> Acts, notwithstanding their feigned expressions of their loyaltie; yet it plainly appeareth they do not repose such trust in your Majesties Justice as becomes loyal Subjects to do, (and such they pretend themselves to be) for that they seek thereby to prevent Your Majesty and your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> of so full a view and time of mature consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to be had of Acts of Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> before they pass, as in prudence is requisite, and hath been found necessary by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of well near 200 years; and if their Intentions were so clear as they profess, we know not why they should avoid the strictest view and tryal of Your Majesty and your Councels of both Kingdoms; this their desire, tending to introduce a grand diminution to the Royal and necessary Power for the conservation of Your Regal State and protection of your good Protestant Subjects there and elsewhere, and what special use they aim at in seeking such a repeal, Your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Subjects as they know not the particular, so can they conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of none, unless the said Confederates have some design by way of surprize to obtrude upon Your Majesty in their new desired Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, some Acts of justification of their ill-done actions, and for condemning such of your Protestant Subjects, as have in their several degrees most faithfully served Your Majesty there, which we the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe, seeing they have vowed by their Oath of Association and the Bull lately published in <hi>Ireland</hi> since the Cessation, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Protestants there, when they have the Sword in their hands to put the same in Execution.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Pro.</hi> That all Acts and Ordinances made and passed in the now pretended Parliament in that Kingdom since the 7th day of <hi>August,</hi> 1641. be clearly annull'd and declared void, and taken off the File.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> VVe humbly desire that they may particularize those Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Ordinances, which may prejudice Your Majesties service; for we are well assured, that the Parliament now sitting in <hi>Ireland,</hi> on signification of Your Majesties pleasure therein, will give Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty full satisfaction, or repeal any unjust Orders or Ordinances what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever which may be prejudicial to Your Majesty: and there may be some Orders or Ordinances which may concern particular persons in their Lives, Liberties or Fortunes, that may suffer unheard, by the admitting of so general a Proposition, which is meerly propos'd as we humbly conceive to put a scorn upon Your Majesties Parliament now sitting there, and to discourage your Protestant Subjects who have faithfully served Your Majesty in that Parliament.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Pro.</hi> That all Indictments, Attainders, Out-lawers in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> or elsewhere since the said 7th day of <hi>August,</hi> 1641. and all Letters, Patents, Grants, Leases, Custodiums, Bonds, Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizances and all other Records, Act or Acts depending thereon, or in prejudice of the said Catholicks, or any of them, be taken off the File, annulled and declared void, first by Your Majesties Proclamation, and after by Act to be passed in the said free Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:93738:221"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This we conceive to be a very bold Proposition, not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted as we also conceive by any Example, and tending to introduce an ill president in after-times, for that was never seen that the Records were taken off the File, but where there was some corruption or fraud, or some illegal or unjust carriage used, or concerning the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or making up of such Records; and the same first we'll prove upon due Examination, and that may not only conceal, but in some sort seem to justifie their abominable Treasons, Murthers, Cruelties, Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres and Plunders acted against your Majesties Person, Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, upon the persons of your Majesties most loyal Protestant Subjects in that Kingdom, and encourage the Papists to do the like again; besides the discouragement it may beget in your Majesties Officers &amp; Subjects to do their duties in the like insurrections which may happen hereafter, which also may prove very prejudicial to Your Majesties Rights and Revenues, if the Records to support the Forfeitures wherein many of them are or may be grounded, should be taken off the File and cancelled.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Pro.</hi> That inasmuch as under colour of such Out-lawers and Attainders, Debts due unto the said Catholicks, have been granted, levied and disposed of, and of the other side that Debts due upon the said Catholicks to those of the adverse party, have been levied and disposed of to publick use; that therefore all Debts be by Act of Parliament mutually released, or all to stand in <hi>statu quo,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any Grant or dispossession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> VVe humbly conceive, that in time of peace and most set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Government, when the course of Law and Justice is most open and best observed, that Debts due unto the Crown actually levied and paid in to Your Majesties use ought not to be restored, though the Records of the Forfeitures should be legally reversed, which is far from the present case, and this Proposition tendeth to cross that just Right of Your Majesty, and to make the disposition by the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Papists Rebels, of Debts due to Protestants, and by the said Rebels by fraud and force levied and disposed in maintenance of their Rebellion, which cunningly they call by the name of <hi>Publick use,</hi> to be in equal degree to the Debts owing by the Rebels, and by them all forfeited, and many of them by Law duly levied, which is a most unequal and unjust thing, and the said Proposition cannot, nor doth make offer to have the Pope's Confederates cut off from the Debts due to them which they have justly forfeited, but only for a colour of consideration to have the Protestants lose such. Debts (justly due to them) as have been unjustly taken from them, who have done no act at all to forfeit them.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Pro.</hi> That the late Officers taken, or found upon feigned or old Titles since the year 1634, to intitle Your Majestie to several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Connaght, Thornond,</hi> the County of <hi>Typperary, Limrick</hi> and <hi>Kelkenny,</hi> and <hi>Wicklowe</hi> be vacated and taken off the File, and the possessors thereof setled and secure in their ancient Estates by act of Parliament, and that the like Act of limitation of Your Majesties Titles for the security of the Estates of your Subjects in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be passed in that Parliament, as was Enacted in the 21. year of his late Majesties Raign in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> VVe know not of any Offices found, or feigned Titles, nor what the Confederates may demand, in respect of any graces promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93738:221"/>
by your Majesty which we intend not, nor have any occasion to dispute, but do humbly conceive, that all those who have committed Treason in the late Rebellion, subsequent to your Majesties promise of those Graces, have thereby forfeited the benefit thereof, together with the Lands to which the said Graces might else have related, and so their whole Estates are now justly fallen to your Majesty by their Rebellion, which we conceive is of great importance for your Majesties service to be taken into consideration; as First, with regard of the Statutes made in the present Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> Secondly, That necessary increase of your Majesties Revenue decayed by the present Rebellion; Thirdly, The abolishing the evil Customs of the <hi>Irish,</hi> and preservation of Religion, Laws and Government there. Fourthly, The satisfaction of the Protestant Subjects losses in some measure. Fifthly, The Arrears of your Majesties Army, and other debts contracted for the War, and for preservation of that Kingdom to your Majesty. Sixthly, The bringing in of more Brittish on the Plantation. Seventhly, The building of some walled-Towns in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and desolate places, for the security of that Kingdom, and your Maiesties good Subjects there. Eightly, The taking of the Natives from their former dependency on their Chieftains, who usurped an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power over them, to the dimunition of all Regal Power, and to the oppression of the inferiors.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Pro.</hi> That all marks of incapacity imposed upon the Natives of that Kingdom, to purchase or acquire Lands, Leases, Offices, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditaments, be taken away by Act of Parliament, and the same to extend to the securing of Purchases, Leases or Grants, already made; and that for the Education of Youth, an Act be passed in the next Parliament, for the erecting of one or more Inns of Court, Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, Free and Common-Schools.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This we conceive concerneth some of the late Plantations, and no other part of that Kingdom, and that the restriction herein mentioned is found to be of great use, especially for the indifferency of Tryals, strength of the Government, and for Trade and Traffick; and we humbly conceive, that if other Plantations shall not proceed for the setling and securing of the Kingdom, and that if no restraint be made of Popish purchasing, or buying of the Protestants out of their former Plantations, where they were prudently settled, though now cast out of their Estates by the late Rebellion, and unable to Plant the same again for want of means, and therefore probably upon easy terms will part from their Estates to the Confederates; that those Plantations will be destroyed, to the great prejudice of your Majesties Service, and endangering of the safety of that Kingdom. Touching bearing of Offices, we humbly conceive that their now conformity to the Laws and Statutes of that Realm, is the only mark of incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty imposed upon them; we humbly conceive that they ought not to expect to be more capable there, then the <hi>English</hi> Natives are here in <hi>England:</hi> in like case for Schools in <hi>Ireland,</hi> there are divers setled in that Kingdom already by the Laws and Statutes of that Realm; if any person well affected, shall erect and endow any more Schools there at their own charges, so that the School-master and Scholars may be governed according to Laws, Customs and Orders of <hi>England,</hi> and the rest of Free-Schools here; we cannot apprehend any just exception
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93738:222"/>
thereunto, but touching Universities and Inns of Court, we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive that this part of the proposition savoureth of some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to become Independant upon <hi>England,</hi> or to make aspersion on the Religion and Laws of the Kingdom, which can never be truely happy but in the good unity of both in the true Protestant Religion, and in the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> (for as for matter of charge) such of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that are desirous to breed their Sons for Learning in Divinity, can be well content to send them to the Universities of <hi>Lovane, Doway,</hi> and other Popish places in forreign Kingdoms, and for Civil Law or Physick to <hi>Padua,</hi> and other places, which draws great Treasure yearly out of your Majesties Dominions, but will send few or none of them to <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambrige,</hi> where they might as cheaply be bred up and become as Learned, which course we conceive is holden out of their Pride, and disaffection towards this Kingdom, and the true Religion here professed; and for the Laws of the Land which are for the Common Law agreeable to <hi>England,</hi> and so for the greatest part of the Statutes, the Inns of Court in <hi>England</hi> are sufficient, and the Protestants come thither without grudging, and that is a means to civilize them after the <hi>English</hi> customs, to make them familiar and in love with the Language and Nation, to preserve Law in the Purity, when the Professors of it shall draw from one Original Fountain, and see the manner of the Practice of that in the same great Channel where his Majesties Courts of Justice of <hi>England</hi> do flow most clearly, whereas by separation of the Kingdoms in that place of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal instruction where their foundations in Learning are to be laid, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate corruption in Religion and Justice may haply be introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and spread, with much more difficulty to be corrected and restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterwards by any Discipline to be used in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or punishment there to be inflicted for departing from the true grounds of things, which are best preserved in unity, when they grow out of the same root, then if such Universities and Inns of Court as are proposed should be granted, all which we humbly submit to your Majesties most Pious and Prudent consideration and judgment.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Pro.</hi> That the Offices and Places of Command, Honour, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Trust within that Kngdom, be conferred upon Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks Natives, in equality and indifferency with your Majesties other Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We humbly conceive that the Roman Catholicks, Natives of <hi>Ireland,</hi> may have the like Offices and Places as the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks Natives of <hi>England</hi> here have, and not otherwise; howbeit we conceive that in the generality they haye not deserved so much by their late Rebellion, therefore we see not why they should be endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any new or farther capacities or priviledges then they have by the Laws and Statutes now in force in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Pro.</hi> That the insupportable Oppression of your Subjects, by reason of the Court of Wards, and respit of Homage, be taken away, and certain revenue in Lieu thereof setled upon your Majesty, without diminution of your Majesties profits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We know of no Oppression by reason of the Court of Wards, and we humbly conceive that the Court of Wards is of great use for the raising of your Majesties Revenues, the preservation of your Majesties Tenures, and chiefly the Education of the Gentry in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93738:222"/>
the Protestant Religion, and in Civility and Learning, and good Manners, who otherwise would be brought up in ignorance, and barbarism, their Estates be ruined by their Kindred and Friends, and continue their depending upon their Chieftains and Lords, to the great prejudice of your Majesties service, and Protestant Subjects, and there being no colour of exception to your Majesties just Title to Wardships, we know not why the taking away of your Court con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same should be pressed, unless it be to prevent the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords and Gentry that fall Wards in the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For that part of this Proposition which concerns respit of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, we humbly conceive that reasonable, that some way may be settled for that, if that standeth with your Majesties good pleasure, without prejudice to your Majesty, or your Majesties Protestant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Pro.</hi> That no Lord not estated in the Kingdom, or estated, and not resident, shall have Vote in the said Parliament, by Proxie or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, and none admitted to the House of Commons, but such as shall be estated and resident within the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We humbly conceive that in the year 1641. by the Graces which your Majesty then granted to your Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the matter of this Proposition was in a fair way regulated by your utter abolishing of blank Proxies, and limiting Lords present and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that no one of them should be capable of more Proxies then two, and prescribing the Peers of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom not there resident to purchase fitting proportions of Land in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> within five years from the last of <hi>July</hi> 1641. or else to loose their Votes, till they should make such purchases; which purchases by reason of the troubles hapning in the Kingdom, and which have continued for two years and a half, have not peradventure yet been made, and therefore your Majesty may now be pleased and may take just occasion to enlarge that time for five years more, from the time when that Kingdom may again be settled in a happy firm peace: and as to members of the House of Commons, the same is most fit as we humbly conceive to be regulated by the Laws and Statutes of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>Pro.</hi> That an Act be passed in the next Parliament declaratory that the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> is a free Parliament of it self, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant of, and not subordinate to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and that the Subjects of <hi>Ireland</hi> are immediately subject to your Majesty, as in right of your revenue, and that the Members of the said Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all other the Subjects of <hi>Ireland</hi> are indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and no way to be ordered or concluded by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and are only to be ordered and governed within that Kingdom by your Majesty, and such Governours as are or shall be there appointed, and by the Parliament of that Kingdom according to the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This Proposition concerns your Majesties High Court of Parliament, both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and is beyond our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (who are not acquainted with the Records and Presidents of this Nature) to give an answer thereunto, and therefore we humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire your Majesties pardon for not answering unto the same.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>Pro.</hi> That the assumed Power or Jurisdiction in the Council-Board
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93738:223"/>
of determining all manner of Causes, be limited to matters of State; and all Patents, Estates and Grants illegally and extrajudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously avoided there, or elsewhere, be left in state as before, and the parties grieved, their Heirs or Assigns, till legal eviction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Council-Table hath aways excercised Jursdiction in some cases ever since the <hi>English</hi> Government was setled in that Kingdom, and is of long continuance in cases of some Nature, as the beginning thereof appeareth not; which seemeth to be by prescription, and hath always been armed with Power to examin upon Oath as a Court of Justice, or in the nature of a Court of Justice in cases of some natures, and may be very necessary still in many cases, especially for the present till your Majesties Laws may more generally be received in that Kingdom, and we conceive that Board is so well limited by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Instructions, in your Majesties Royal Fathers time, and by your Majesties Graces in the seventeenth year of your Reign, that it needeth for this present little or no regulating at all, howbeit they humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr that to your Majesties great wisdom and goodness to do therein as to Law and Justice shall appertain.</p>
            <p>13. <hi>Pro.</hi> That the Statutes of the 11th. 12th. and 13th. years of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> concerning the Staple Commodities be repealed, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to his Majesty lawful and just Poundage, and a Book of Rates be setled by an indifferent Committy of both Houses for all Como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The matter of this Proposition is settled in a fitting and good way by your Majesty already as we conceive, amongst the Graces granted by your Majesty to your people of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Seventeenth year of your Majesties Reign, to which we humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr our selves.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>Pro.</hi> That insomuch as the long continuance of the chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Governours of that Kingdom, in that place of so great eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and power, hath been a principall occasion that much Tyranny and Oppression hath been used and exercised upon the Subjects of that Kingdom; that your Majesty will be pleased to continue such Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours hereafter but for three years, and that none once employed therein be appointed for the same again, until the expiration of six years next after the end of the first three years, and that an Act pass to disanul such Governour or Governours during their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, directly or indirectly, in Use, Trust or otherwise to make any manner of Purchase or acquisition of any Mannors, Lands, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Hereditaments within that Kingdom, other then from your Majesties own Heirs and Successors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We humbly conceive, that this Proposition tendeth to lay a false and scandalous aspersion on your Majesties gracious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that it toucheth very high upon your Wisdom, Justice and Power, and under colour of supposed Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons pretended to be in the greatest Officer that Commandeth under your Majesty there, if he continue so long in his Government as may well enable him to find out and discover the true State of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the dangerous disposition and designs of the Popish party there, to prevent him therein, and to turne him out from doing Service before or as soon as he is throughly informed and experienced how to do the same, and then to hold him excluded so long, that in all
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93738:223"/>
likelihood he shall not live to come to that place the second time, which we humbly conceive will be a great discouragement to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Honour and Fortune to serve your Majesty in that high Trust: and for their purchasing Lands in that Kingdom, your Majesty may be pleased to leave them to the Laws, and punish them severely if they commit any offence, or exercise any oppressions under colour of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing of any Lands or Estates whatsoever.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>Pro.</hi> That an Act may be passed in the next Parliament, for the raising and setling of Trained-bands, within the several Counties of that Kingdom, as well to prevent foraign Invasion, as to render them the more serviceable and ready for your Majesties service, as cause shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The having of Trained-bands in <hi>Ireland</hi> for the present, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (under favour) be for your Majesties service, or the safety of that Kingdom, for that the Protestants by the said sad effects of the late Rebellion are so much destroyed, that the said Bands must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in effect altogether of the Confederates, Catholicks; and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue them in Arms, stored with Ammunition, and made ready for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by Mustring and often Training, will prove, under colour of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing your Majesties service against foraign Invasions, a meer Guard and Power of the Popish Confederates, and by force of Arms (according to their late Oaths and Protestations) to execute all their cruel designs, for extirpation of the Protestant Religion, and <hi>English</hi> Government, both which they mortally hate, however in cunning they dissemble it, and to prevent the setling an Army of good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, without which your Maiesties good Subjects cannot live se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely there.</p>
            <p>16. <hi>Pro.</hi> That an Act of Oblivion be passed in the next free Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, to extend to all your Majesties said Catholick Subjects and their Adherents, for all manner of Offences, Capital, Criminal, and Personal, and the said Act to extend to all Goods and Chattels, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, <hi>Mesne</hi> Profits, Prizes, Arrears of Rents taken, received, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred since these troubles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We humbly pray that the Laws of force be taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and do humbly conceive, that your Majesty in Honour and Justice may forbear to discharge or release any Actions, Suits, Debts or Interests, whereby your Majesties Protestant Subjects, who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no offence against your Majesty or your Laws, should be barred or deprived of any of their legal remedies, or just demands, which by any of your Majesties Laws and Statutes, they may have against the Popish Confederates, who are the only Delinquents, or any of their party, for, or in respect of any wrongs done unto them, or any of their Ancestors or Predecessors, in or concerning their Lands, Goods, or Estates, since the contriving or breaking forth of the Rebellion, the said Confederates having without provocation shed so much innocent Blood, and acted so many Cruelties as cannot be parallel'd in any Story: and we conceive it to be high presumption in them upon so weak grounds to propound an Act of Oblivion in such general terms, some of the Confederates having been Contrivers or Actors of such cruel Murthers, and other Acts of Inhumanity, as cry to God and your Sacred Majesty for Justice; and they having of your Majesties Revenues, Customs, Subsidies, and other Rights of your Crown in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93738:224"/>
their hands, are disbursed by them to the value of two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds and more.</p>
            <p>17. <hi>Pro.</hi> For as much as your Majesties said Catholick Subjects have been taxed with many inhumane Cruelties, which they never committed, your Majesties said Suppliants therefore, for their vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and to manifest to all the the world their desire to have all such hanious Offenders punished, and the Offenders brought to Justice, do desire that in the next Parliament all notorious Murthers, breaches of Quarter, and inhumane Cruelties committed of either side, may be questioned in the said Parliament, if your Majesty think fit, and such as shall appear to be guilty, to be excepted out of the said Act of Oblivion, and punished according to their deserts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We conceive this Proposition is made but for a Florish, and if the Confederates be so desirous to try their innocency, (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) they need not stay for another Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but submit to that which is now in being, which is an equal and just Parliament, as in some of our Reasons touching that point is expressed; and the offering to draw it to a new Parliament, is in effect to desire that they may be their own Judges; for as that Kingdom is now imbroiled, and wasted, the chief Delinquents or their Confederates will be so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent a faction in the next Parliament, that they will be able, and doubtless will clear all the Popish party, how guilty soever, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all the Protestants how innocent soever.</p>
            <p>These Answers to the high and unexpected Demands of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, we have have framed in humble obedience to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties directions; but being very sensible as of the weight and great importance of the business, so also of our own weakness and want of time, and well knowing that some of your <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. 142.</note> Majesties Privy-Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, Judges and Officers of that Kingdom, are now in Town, sent for over, and here attending by your Majesties Command, who by their long observations and experience of the affaires and State of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are better able to give your Majesty more full and satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers touching the premises then we can, and conceiving that <note n="**" place="margin">Since prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands</hi> 1644. entituled, The false and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Answered; which (though humbly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fled to upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions) was not read, p. 114.</note> 
               <hi>the Collection in Answer to the said Confederates Remonstrance,</hi> which we humbly presented to your Majesty the 17th. of the last Month of <hi>April,</hi> may in many things give your Majesty more light, then these our Answers do or can; We humbly beseech your Majesty, that the said Privy-Counsellors, Judges and Officers, as occasion shall require, may be called upon and heard to give your Majesty the more satisfaction in these particulars, and that to the same purpose, the Book of the said Collections may be perused and considered of, as your Majesty shall find most requisite.</p>
            <p>After reading of which Propositions and Answers thereunto; the King asked the Protestant Agents, whether they had Answered unto the Rebels Propositions <hi>as they were to be granted by Him,</hi> in Law and Justice, and fit for the Security of the Protestants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or <hi>pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> as the times were? who humbly made Answer to his Majesty, That they looked upon the Rebels Propositions as they appeared to them <hi>destructive</hi> to his Majesties Laws, Government, and Protestant Subjects of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Then the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> said, That if they ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what by Law and Justice was due from the Rebels, their Answers
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93738:224"/>
were full; But now the King expected from the said Agents <hi>what prudentially</hi> was fit for his Majesty to do, seeing the Protestants were not in a Condition to defend themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that the King would not admit the Protestants to joyn with the new <hi>Scots</hi> or any other that had the Covenant. To which the Agents conceived not fit to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer more then what before in their Propositions and Answers they had Humbly offered, pretending not to be Judges but submissive Petitioners for what was committed to their Charge.</p>

            <p n="1">1. WE most humbly desire the Establishment of the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> according to the Laws and Statutes in the said Kingdom now in force.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. That Restitution may be made of all our Churches and Church Rights and Revenues, and all our Churches and Chappels re-edified, and put in as good Estate as they were at the breaking out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and as they ought to be, at the Charge of the Confederate <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, (as they call themselves) who have been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the Destruction of the said Churches, and possessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Profits and Revenues thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Parliament now sitting in <hi>Ireland</hi> may be continued there, for the better settlement of the Kingdom, and that all Persons

            <p>In answer wereunto it was replied by the Committee of Lords and others of <hi>Irish</hi> affaires at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That their Lordships did not think that the Propositions present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Protestant Agents to his Majesty, and that morning read before their Lordships, were the sence of the Protestants of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. That those Propositions were not agreeable to the Instructions given the said Agents, by the Protestants of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. That if those Propositions were drawn, they would lay a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice on his Majesty and his Ministers to Posterity, these remaining on Record if a Treaty should go on and Peace follow, which the Kings necessity did enforce, and that the Lords of the Committee apprehended, the said Agents did flatly oppose a Peace with the <hi>Irish.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. That it would be impossible for the King to grant the Protestants Agents desires, and grant a Peace to the <hi>Irish.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. That the Lords of the Committee desired the Protestant Agents to propose a way to effect their desires, either by Force or Treaty, considering the condition of his Majesties Affaires <hi>in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>To the first, <hi>the Protestant Agents replied,</hi> that they humbly conceived that the Propositions which they had presented to his Majesty, were the sence of of the Protestants of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Second, That the Propositions are agreeable to the Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">Fol. 144.</note> given to the said Agents by the Protestants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the well settlement of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>To the Third, That they had no thought to draw prejudice on his Majesty or their Lordships, by putting in those Propositions, neither had they so soon put in Propositions, had not his Majesty by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Protestant Petition directed the same.</p>
            <p>To the Fourth, The said Agents humbly conceived, that they were imployed to make proof of the effect of the Protestant Petition, to manifest the inhumane Cruelties of the Rebels, and then to offer such things as they thought fit for the Security of the Protestants in in their Religion, Lives, Liberties and Fortunes; That the said Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants had no disaffection to Peace, so as punishment might be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to Law, as in the Propositions are expressed, and that the said Protestants might be repaired for their great losses out of the Estates of the Rebels, not formerly by any Acts of this present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>England</hi> otherwise disposed of, which the said Agents desired might be represented to his Majesty and the Lords of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:93738:227"/>To the Fifth, That the said Protestant Agents were Strangers to his Majesties Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> and conceived that part more proper for the advice of his Councils then the said Agents, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be excused, for medling in the treaty further then the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing of the truth of the Protestant Petition, and proposing in the behalf of the Protestants, according to the Instructions given them, which the said Agents were ready to perform whensoever they should be admitted thereunto.</p>
            <p>Touching which and other Particulars there were many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but the Proofs they would have insisted upon (by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of other Affairs) never came to their due discussion.</p>

                  <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THere is no duty incident to the Place I have the Honour to serve the KING in, to which I come with less willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or conscience, than to this of speaking to such an <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly:</hi> And by that time I have done, you will acknowledg I have reason to be unsatisfied with the necessity imposed by custom upon all that sit in this Place, to make Speeches; a <hi>Custom</hi> perhaps reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly introduced by those that did, or at least thought they did it well; but somewhat hardly continued upon those that were sure they did it ill. And yet though I am in the <hi>Number of the Last,</hi> I will rather obey the <hi>Necessity,</hi> than hazard the Imputation of <hi>Sullenness</hi> or <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity.</hi> Besides, I do not know, but that to be silent at this time, and in this Place, may be a <hi>greater Fault</hi> than any I hope I shall commit in speaking; for we are taught by <hi>Infallible Authority,</hi> and enjoyned by <hi>Indispensible Precept,</hi> and it seems to be agreeable to the Dictates of <hi>NATURE</hi> and <hi>REASON,</hi> as well as of <hi>RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGION</hi> and <hi>PIETY,</hi> that for all the Blessings we receive from the <hi>Divine MAJESTIE,</hi> we should make as proportionable Returns as lie within our Power: And therefore <hi>Publique</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional BLESSINGS,</hi> do require <hi>Publique</hi> and <hi>Solemn CE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEBRATIONS.</hi> This was it that induced the Transmission of that Act for an <hi>Anniversary Thanksgiving for his Majesties most Happy RESTAURATION;</hi> and this is it, which if it be dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, sincerely performed, is most like to perpetuate to us, and to our POSTERITY, all the <hi>Happinesses</hi> consequent to that <hi>BLESSING.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:93738:228"/>What these <hi>Happinesses</hi> are, or at least may be, if we Our selves obstruct not the course of them, would be best discerned, and set off, by a <hi>RETROSPECT</hi> into the state of things for above twenty years past; and by opposing to that <hi>Dismal Object</hi> of Our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the <hi>Chearfulness</hi> and <hi>Serenity</hi> of the <hi>Prospect</hi> forwards.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Miseries</hi> and <hi>Desolations</hi> of those years could be enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the time I mean to allow this Discourse; or if they could be described to the Life, by so ill an Orator as I am, they would be fewer, and more supportable, than I doubt the sad experience of too many have found them to be.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore only put you in mind of some more <hi>Remarkable</hi> and <hi>Fundamental deliverances</hi> and <hi>Restitutions,</hi> wrought by most <hi>wonderful Providence,</hi> as a thankful acknowledgment fit, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, to be the subject of the first Discourse from this place, where I have the honour, how unworthily, and how unresemblingly soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to represent the Majestie of my <hi>Great Master.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This very <hi>Seat of Royaltie</hi> is delivered from some neglected Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or contemptible Use, or from a Profanation worse than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the Usurpation of mean and low Aspirers, who having no shadow of right to it, had no other way to ascend it, than by treading down and destroying whatever was ordained by God or Man, to fence and guard it; their extravagant Ambition transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and darkning their understanding to that degree, as not to consider how short their possession of that Throne must be, to the disarming and violation of which, they themselves had but newly shewn the way.</p>
               <p>VVe see this Throne now restored to its proper place, and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral use, surrounded and supported by <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi> by <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Magistrates,</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> the Out-works, as well as Ornaments of Majestie.</p>
               <p>VVe see it restored to the approach, and I doubt not to the delight of the meanest of the Commons, whom you Gentlemen do, nor ought not disdain to represent; for they are the <hi>Foundation</hi> upon which <hi>Monarchy</hi> is built, the <hi>strength</hi> wherewith it is guarded, and the <hi>wealth</hi> whereby it is sustained, inriched and beautified.</p>
               <p>It is restored to the <hi>undoubted Lawful Possessour,</hi> the <hi>Off-spring</hi> of a long-continued <hi>Race of Princes;</hi> in whom all the <hi>Contested Titles</hi> of former Ages are met, without the pretence of a <hi>Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and in whom all the <hi>Vertues</hi> of the <hi>Princes</hi> of those Ages are united, without the severity (to say no worse) of some of the Great and Warlike; and without the as harmful weaknesses of others of more devout and peaceable dispositions: A PRINCE that hath given frequent proof, that though he loves and seeks peace for his Subjects sakes, he fears not War for his own.</p>
               <p>This Sword, the Instrument of conferring Military Honour, and the Emblem of inflicting Punishment, is delivered from the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Stage-like Pageantry of later times, and from a more execrable and Tragical Abuse, from cutting off the most Innocent, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most guilty.</p>
               <p>VVe see it now by the visible immediate hand of God restored, and put into that <hi>Hand</hi> that only had <hi>His Commission</hi> to bear and use it; and let it be <hi>Our Prayer,</hi> That he bear it long, and that he may
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93738:228"/>
bear it long, that he bear it not in vain, but to the <hi>terrour</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination</hi> of <hi>Evil-doers,</hi> and to the <hi>support</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> of those that do well.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> himself, whose <hi>Throne</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> these are, is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, and we to God for him, for many and <hi>great deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> He is delivered from the Murtherers of his <hi>Father,</hi> and the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers of his <hi>Inheritance;</hi> from their restless endeavours to destroy his Person, and to blast his Fame; from their open violence, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret contrivements against both; from Exile, and all the Afflicting consequences of that miserable state of a King; from comfortless wandrings from Protections; from cold Receptions; from narrow supports; and from such applications for them, as were more unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, than the want of them could be to him that was born, and delights to give, rather than receive them. He is deliver'd from a continual tormenting Anxietie for the danger of his Friends, and the oppression and slavery of his Countrey; from the importunity of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Arguments, drawn from his misfortunes, to draw him from his Religion; and from a necessity of hearing, and bearing with the Reproaches and Revilings cast upon our then Desolate Church, only because she was desolate, and made so by her own <hi>unnatural Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this dejected, despised, and in all humane appearance, despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condition, he is raised and restored to the Throne of his Fathers, to his Native Countrey, become more dear and valuable to him, by his Experience of others; to the free and uncontrol'd exercise of the Religion he was bred in, to a capacity of making Royal Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution for any kindness he hath received abroad or from home: and which is the greatest earthly Felicity, so good a KING as he could wish, he is not only restored to, but by the love of his People, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the chargeable, and many times dangerous assistance of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who are not over-tender, nor much distinguishing betwixt the party they come to assist, and that they come to subdue, when they are made Umpires in such Quarrels; for they rarely employ their Auxiliary Treasure and Blood, purely out of Generosity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; which may in Romance be found the ultimate end of such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, but seldom in the truth of <hi>History.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here it may be observed, that if the revolt and deviation of our Nations from their KING, and from <hi>Monarchy</hi> it self, was the most unreasonable and prodigious that any Age hath known, their volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary uncompelled Return to both, is as much without Example: nor indeed could that Return have been so miraculous, if the Revolt had not been so prodigious. And it may also be worth the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that as the first most bloody Eruption from Peace to Rebellion, took birth in this Kingdom, so from hence came the first Overtures to Peace and Submission.</p>
               <p>By and with the Kings deliverance and Restitution, our Church is delivered from Contempt, Sacriledge and Desolation, and restored to a due veneration, a competent improving support, and to fair begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Decency and Order.</p>
               <p>Our Laws are delivered from corrupt, incompetent Interpreters, from monstrous, unnatural expositions and applications, and Justice is restored to the distribution of upright, learned, lawfully sworn and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized Judges.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:93738:229"/>The noblest Acts of <hi>Loyaltie</hi> shall now no more receive the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to the foulest Treason, due to the unrighteous Judges, that pronounced it without Authority in the Persons, or Justice in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. High Courts of Justice shall no more usurp that name, nor our Benches be crouded or oppressed with the throng and wicked weight of those that ought rather to have stood manacled at the Bar. A happy change to those for whose destruction those extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Tribunals were erected, and a secure change to all; for it hath been often an observed Method in God's never-failing Justice, to catch <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Oppression</hi> in those very snares they had prepared for others.</p>
               <p>All Men are delivered from the intanglements of two-edged Oaths; from the conflicts raised by them in Mens Brests, betwixt Conscience and conveniency, betwixt the prostitution of Conscience, and the ruine of their Fortunes; than which a harder, a more <hi>Tyrannical choice</hi> cannot be obtruded upon Christians: For here the <hi>election</hi> was not, <hi>Swear thus against your Conscience, or you shall have no part in the Civil Government, no Office in the Army, no Benefice in the Church;</hi> but, <hi>Swear thus, or you shall have no House to put your Headin, no Bread to sustain your selves, your Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude these Observations, who is not delivered from some <hi>Oppression,</hi> and restored to some <hi>Advantage?</hi> Even those that shall lose <hi>the wages of iniquitie,</hi> their ill-got possessions, shall be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>oppression of a bad;</hi> and if they have any, shall be <hi>resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a good Conscience;</hi> if they have none, they were not in the <hi>Kings,</hi> and I hope will not be in <hi>Your</hi> care.</p>

               <p>As it is <hi>our duty</hi> thus thankfully to <hi>commemorate</hi> these <hi>great things</hi> done for us; so it is <hi>our duty</hi> to <hi>endeavour</hi> in our several <hi>Stations,</hi> to <hi>improve</hi> and <hi>secure</hi> them to <hi>Our selves,</hi> and <hi>Our Posterity:</hi> And sure the most <hi>Natural way</hi> to that end, is to call to mind, and avoid <hi>those Errours</hi> that brought us into those <hi>miseries</hi> from which we are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</hi>

               <p>Many are the <hi>causes too boldly assigned,</hi> for the Calamities these <hi>Nations</hi> so long laboured under; But in such <hi>Inquisitions</hi> the <hi>verdict</hi> is seldom impartially brought in, the <hi>Jury</hi> are too often the <hi>Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals:</hi> But I think I may safely say, that <hi>one,</hi> and that a <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cause,</hi> was, that the <hi>late King</hi> was <hi>maliciously represented</hi> to the People; I am sure the <hi>Freedom, Peace, Plenty,</hi> and <hi>Happinesses</hi> they were told they should <hi>enjoy without him,</hi> proved miserable and fatal <hi>delusions.</hi>

                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:93738:229"/>Let us mistrust those that shall use the same Arts, lest they involve us in the same misery; and let us judge of the <hi>King's intentions</hi> to His People, by His <hi>Publique Acts</hi> of grace and bounty; by His mild and easy Government; by His desire and endeavours to make His Subjects happy at home, and renowned abroad; and by the reluctancy of His Nature to just severity, when the wickedness or frenzy of the worst Offendors extort it from him.</p>
               <p>That something will be amiss in the Administration of the most perfect Government in this World, must be expected; but whoever shall think that these things are to be <hi>rectified by force upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and that effected, proposes to acquiesce, and return to <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> cannot <hi>know himself</hi> so well, as to be sure, that <hi>Opportunity</hi> and <hi>success</hi> may not suggest more <hi>inordinate Appetites</hi> to him; And there are those alive that know, how far further than their <hi>first inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the <hi>Reformers</hi> of our times were led on, till the unwarrantable force they had raised, grew <hi>too strong</hi> for their <hi>Management,</hi> flew in their faces, and in conclusion, <hi>acted those villanies,</hi> that I dare say their <hi>Souls abhorred;</hi> but neither their <hi>Policy</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain.</p>

Let the people remember how <hi>many,</hi> and how <hi>chargeable</hi> their <hi>Masters;</hi> nay how many and <hi>chargeable</hi> the <hi>changes</hi> of their <hi>Masters</hi> were, when once they foolishly <hi>affected the misery,</hi> indeed the <hi>impossibility of having none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VVhen <hi>Misrepresentations</hi> had taken <hi>place</hi> and <hi>root</hi> in the minds of the people, their heart grew <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>barren,</hi> towards the <hi>King;</hi> those that soon after rob'd them both, perswading them to keep their <hi>purses full for them to empty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This close <hi>Oratory</hi> is seldom <hi>unsuccessful;</hi> but what the people got by following this <hi>thrifty Counsel,</hi> some have taken the pains to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and it is found, that the <hi>Impositions</hi> laid and levied upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to support <hi>Usurpation</hi> and <hi>Tyrannie,</hi> in a few <hi>bad years</hi> came to more, than the most chargeable <hi>Princes</hi> had raised in some Ages to <hi>conquer Enemies</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> abroad, whilest this was <hi>employed</hi> to make <hi>Enemies</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi> and little better than <hi>Infidels</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> at home.</p>
               <p>I confess this <hi>Animadversion</hi> is not so seasonable now, or proper to he <hi>applyed</hi> to you, who in your <hi>Liberalities</hi> have outgone all <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> and prevented <hi>even the Kings wishes;</hi> nor are those <hi>Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> the <hi>less,</hi> but the <hi>more</hi> valued by Him, that he intends to <hi>apply them</hi> intirely to the security and improvement of a <hi>true Protestant,</hi> and a <hi>right English Interest</hi> in this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>There is nothing that declares, indeed that constitutes perfect U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and a <hi>happy Harmony,</hi> so much as <hi>mutual trusts</hi> and <hi>confidence,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> has trusted you as far as ever <hi>King</hi> trusted Subjects; and He has given you more than ever any <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Lord of Ireland</hi> had to give.</p>
               <p>You have trusted <hi>the King with all you had,</hi> and all <hi>you</hi> had to pretend to; and you have given <hi>Him more</hi> than he thought of to desire; Let it not therefore <hi>be apprehended,</hi> that this <hi>Commerce</hi> must cease by the <hi>Prodigality</hi> on both sides, as if there were no more to be <hi>given</hi> or <hi>received:</hi> No, my <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi> protection from <hi>Forreign Invasion</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> at home, the due and uncorrupt administration of <hi>Government,</hi> and of the <hi>Laws,</hi> and under them the <hi>advancement</hi> and <hi>encouragement</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Learning, Trade,</hi> and all sorts of <hi>Industry</hi> and <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> are benefits that may to the <hi>end of time,</hi> descend from the Throne to you and yours: And a due subjection to that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and obedience to those Laws, and application to that Piety and Learning, to that Trade and Industry, and to those Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, may be as lasting Retributions from the People to the Throne.</p>
               <p>I should here end this unusual Exercise, but that I am command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>King</hi> to let you know, that as He is abundantly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with those demonstrations of <hi>Duty, Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> you have given him, during the whole time of your sitting, so he looks with great <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Delight</hi> upon those <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Bounty</hi> that have past from him to you; and he commands me to be sure not to forget to assure you, upon all Proper Occasions, that all his <hi>Promises</hi> shall be <hi>inviolably observed;</hi> and that he will <hi>consent</hi> to whatever else may make this <hi>Kingdom flourishing</hi> and <hi>happy,</hi> whether it shall be the Enacting of <hi>new</hi> and <hi>profitable,</hi> or the <hi>repeal</hi> of <hi>old unuseful,</hi> or <hi>burthensom Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To say <hi>anything</hi> of, or from <hi>my self</hi> in this place, may be <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption;</hi> but to say nothing to <hi>you, my Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> to whom I owe so much, must be <hi>Ingratitude.</hi> You have before and since <hi>My Arrival,</hi> been pleased to make <hi>many</hi> and <hi>obliging Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> of <hi>your Approbation</hi> of the <hi>Kings choice</hi> of Me for this Government: I have great reason to fear, both the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>you</hi> consulted <hi>your Indulgence</hi> to Me, more than <hi>your judgement</hi> of Me.</p>
               <p>Yet without much <hi>Presumption</hi> or <hi>Vanity,</hi> I think I may say, thus far the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>you</hi> may be excusable, that He chose, and You approved a <hi>Person,</hi> whose Fortune and Family must prosper or decay, must Ruine or Subsist by and with this Kingdom. This has not perhaps always been the case, and it is possible mean <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> thus stimulated, may be more <hi>profitable and industrious</hi> than greater, actuated by less, or by <hi>contrary Incentives.</hi> There are upon me all imaginable <hi>Obligations</hi> to apply all that is in me, to the <hi>safety</hi> and <hi>prosperity</hi> of this Kingdom: Those of <hi>duty, fidelity</hi> and <hi>thankfulness</hi> to the best, and most bountiful <hi>Master</hi> in the World; those of <hi>Retribution</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> to you, for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and liberal manifestations of <hi>kindness</hi> and <hi>affection,</hi> and

                  <p>ALmighty God and heavenly Father, who out of thy most wise and watchful Providence, and tender mercies towards us thine unworthy Servants, hast been pleased, as at all other times, so on this day, to prevent the extreme malice, michievous imagination, and bloody intention of our Enemies, by revealing so wonderfully, and opportunely their Rebellion, and cruel Enterprises, plotted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our dread Soveraign Lord the King, and the whole State of this Realm, for the subversion of this Government, and the utter extirpation of the truth of thy Gospel, and pure Religion professed amongst us. We most humbly praise and magnifie thy glorious name for thine infinite goodness in this our marvellous deliverance. We confess it was thy mercy, thy mercy alone (most merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that we were not consumed. And therefore not unto us, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, O Lord, but unto thy name be ascribed all honour and glory, in all Churches of the Saints throughout all Generations. For thou Lord didest discover unto thy Servants the snares of death; thou didst break them, and we were delivered. Be thou still our mighty Protector, and scatter our Enemies that delight in blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> infatuate their Councils, enfeeble their strength; put fear in their hearts, and accomplish this thy mercy in our safety and future deliverance. And to that end, strengthen the hands of our gracious King, the Lord Lieutenant, the Nobility, and Magistrates of the Land with Jugdment, Justice, and Power to restrain such workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, who pretend Religion and practise Rebellion, and devout thine Inheritance. This Lord we crave at thy merciful hands, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the continuance of thy powerful Protection over our dread Soveraign, the whole Church, and these Kealms, and the speedy Conversion of all our Enemies, and that for thy dear Sons sake Jesus Christ our only Mediator and Advocate. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>O Eternal God, in whom we live, move, and have our being, and by whom alone we are protected in all our dangers and distresses; we thy people, and sheep of thy Pasture, do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge our selves above all others, infinitely bounded unto thy heavenly Majesty for thy many unspeakable benefits daily conferred and heaped upon us; especially for the enlightning us with thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly truth, and planting thy Gospel amongst us; for placing over us a most gracious King, a faithful Professour, and Defender of the same, a wise and vigilant Lieutenant. And as at this time espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially we praise thee for the discovery and prevention of the bloody and treacherous designs of the Enemies of thy Truth and People: We laud and magnifie thy Glorious name for these thy Mercies, and will ever shew forth thy praise from generation to generation: for it was thy goodness alone that we were not delivered over for a prey unto their Teeth. Thy prudence not our foresight, thy love not our merit, that we appear this day before thee: That the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my did not triumph in our utter destriction, nor root up the Uine which thy right hand had planted. O Lord God of hosts look down from Heaven, and behold, and visit this thy Uine, water it with thy blessing, and make it to fill the Land to the astonishment of our Enemies; but unto the joy of all that wish well unto our Sion: So will we not go back from thee; but will serve thee in fear and holiness all the days of our lives, through Jesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

These together with a glorying in our impieties, might in justice have brought upon us a sudden and horrible destruction. But contrary to the method of thy proceedings against others, thou hast spared us, thereby woing us to return unto thee by unfeigned Repentance. Thou hast magnified thy mercy towards us, that we may magnifie thee, as we do this day, this memorable day, O Lord, for thy patience, and long suffering, notwithstanding all our provocations: we repent O pardon; we return, O vouchsafe to receive us, and enable us to walk worthy of thy great past deliverance, by a more strict, and

                              <p>VVe hereto with all meekness and lowliness of minds return this our joint Answer.</p>
                              <p>1. That forasmuch as we see and know, that the Protestants of this City, for the most part, are much grieved in heart for the want of the daily accustomed Service of God in the two Cathedrals, and the Parish Churches of this City, and for their late being deprived of us and our Ministery, which they have long enjoyed; VVe are very much troubled, and are very sorrowful in our selves for their grief: We acknowledg our selves bound to preach the Gospel of Christ unto the People, and are so far from a voluntary desertion of our Churches, People, Ministery, and the exercise thereof, as that we shall rejoyce
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93738:234"/>
in nothing more, than that we may finish our course with joy, and the Ministry which we have received of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> to testify the grace of God.</p>
                              <p>2. That we have been and still are effectually debarred from our Churches, and the exercise of our Ministry by your Honours <hi>Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Command,</hi> bearing date the 24. of <hi>June,</hi> 1647. wherein you require the discontinuance of the Book of Common-Prayer, and the receiving of the Directory, &amp;c. which <hi>Injunction</hi> lies still upon us, with the danger of <hi>non-protection</hi> in case we disobey the same.</p>
                              <p>3. That we cannot consent with a good conscience to the disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Book of Common-Prayer, and receiving the Directory in lieu thereof, or any other private form of publick Service for the reasons exhibited, and alledged in our <note n="*" place="margin">Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given in writing, the <hi>Copies</hi> cannot be recovered, though the <hi>main</hi> of what is <hi>there</hi> insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, is <hi>here</hi> repeated.</note> Answer the 22. of <hi>June</hi> last, whereto we humbly annex these Reasons following, amongst others which we debated upon in our mutual conference the 25. of <hi>June,</hi> and on the same day touched some of the Heads of them before your Honours.</p>
                              <p>I. VVe all at our Ordination or being made <hi>Presbyters,</hi> have (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things) made this solemn Promise before God, which we account the same with or little different from an Oath, <hi>that we would so minister the Doctrine and Sacraments, and Discipline of Christ, as the Lord hath commanded, and as this Realm hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the same.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>II. VVe have often taken the Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and sworn that the <hi>King's Highness is the only supreme Governour of this Realm, as well in all spiritual and Ecclesiastical things, or causes, as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and that we shall assist and defend all Jurisdictions, &amp;c. granted or belonging to the King's Highness, his Heirs and Successors, or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Kingdom.</hi> Now should we receive a Directory printed, or any other form without Royal Authority, we do not conceive how this can stand with this our Oath.</p>
                              <p>III. As the Act of Parliament 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi> still in force in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, expresly commands the use of this Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> so it forbids <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> or Administration of the Sacraments o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise or after any other manner or form, with any private dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation whereof we cannot comply, we being bound to the obedience thereof, <hi>not only for fear of penalty, but for conscience sake,</hi> Rom. 13. 5.</p>
                              <p>IV. VVhereas the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> is one main part of the Reformation established in the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> the laying aside thereof and the receiving of the Directory or any other form would be, we conceive (considering the present state and circumstances of things) a departing in this from the Communion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>V. It is evident, that as the Constitution of a Law in any matter Ecclesiastical, the order ever observed in the Church since Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>nursing Fathers</hi> thereto, was, is, and ought to be this, That it first pass the consultation and determination of a lawful Ecclesiastical Council; and then, that it receive the sanction and confirmation of the civil Supreme Magistrate; for this gives it the formal strength and vigour of a Law outwardly obliging, and that gives it materiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93738:235"/>
and substance, and supplies ground sufficient to make it a Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly obliging Christian People to receive it. So in the promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and execution of that Law, concerning a matter Ecclesiastical, there was and is this order observed: First, the supreme civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate remands and recommends it to the Ecclesiastical Governours, and they deliver it to the rest of the Pastors, and they to the People. So that the immediate actual reception of an Order Ecclesiastical by the Ministers, is from the hand of the Bishop or Ordinary. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this is founded that solemn Promise made before God by every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister at his Ordination, That he will reverently obey his Ordinary, and other chief Ministers, unto whom the Government and Charge over him is committed, following with a glad mind their godly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, and submitting himself to their godly judgments.</p>
                              <p>Since then in this matter concerning the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> all the required premisses were fulfilled, and that any other form, that for the present we can use, wants all of them, we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of our Promise forementioned, and disordered anticipation or neglect of the judgment of our Ordinances, receive any such or other form, considering the King's Command concerning the only use of the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> expressed in the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is still in force, and the Commands and Constitutions of our lawful Convocation of the Bishops and Clergy, still live and speak unto us, in the Canons made in the year 1634. whereof the third thus expresly, <hi>That Form of Liturgie or divine Service, and no other, shall be used in any Church of this Realm, but that which is establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law, and comprized in the Book of Common-Prayer, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Sacraments.</hi> VVhich Canon with all the rest is confirmed and published by His Majesties Authority under the great Seal of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>VI It may be added, that the Reformed <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of our dread Soveraign the King, is and ever was reputed a free National Church, and not subordinate unto or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the convocation of any other Church. And hence it was, that till the Convocation held at <hi>Dublin, Anno</hi> 1634. the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles<note place="margin">☞ Where by what was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted by some, (as if the Reception of the <hi>English</hi> Articles abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the <hi>Irish</hi>) it was evident there was no such Intention.</note> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were not held, or reputed the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and when they were received, they were not received in any acknowledged subordination to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but for manifestation of our agreement with that Church in the confession of the same Christian Faith, and the Doctrine of the Sacraments, as is expressed in the first Canon. Hence it is, besides that our Canons were not imposed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nay when somewhat highly the Clergy was invited to submit to the Book of <hi>English</hi> Canons, the Convocation utterly refused the same, and framed a new Book of Canons for the Church of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Should we therefore receive or admit of any other form, without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Church, we should be held and esteemed before God and the World, guilty of unconscionably betraying of the Liberty of the free National Church of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>VII. The Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> hath been in use in this Church from the beginning of the Reformation; we have preached for it, and recommended it to the people as a form of God's publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93738:235"/>
and Service: the people of God in this City for the most part generally do love it, have been edified by it, are loath to part from it, and earnestly desire the continuance of it. Now should we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the taking it away, and receive or use any other form not esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Law, we should not avoid the guilt of Sin, it being all one to <hi>destroy that which is well built,</hi> as to build <hi>that which a man once destroyed,</hi> which in the Apostles judgement (<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 8.) <hi>renders a man a transgressor.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And withall we should, as matters stand, give great offence and scandal to the Consciences of our Brethren, and so sin against them, who deserve better at our hand, and for whom Christ dyed.</p>
                              <p>VIII.

                              <p>First, I held my self bound (in discharge of that trust I have from them I serve) to put all places of strength now within our power, into such a posture and condition, before our taking the Field, as that I may (through the blessing of God) give a good account of them to those that have intrusted me. And this I thought I could not do without timely giving of such <hi>warning</hi> to the people of this City; who, by their principles and practices (at least for the most part) do appear, so far disaffected to us, and the Cause and Interest we serve in, and so unlikely to be faithful and trusty to us, (if we should trust them to stay there) especially considering that there is yet no Castle, or Cittadel, whereby that City can be secured from being in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the people that inhabit it, without leaving great numbers of Soldiers to overpower them. I need not say much to demonstrate their unfitness to be (in such a case) confided in by us, their actions speaking so loud and large as they do, to that purpose, telling us, they are our Enemies; witness their practices all the time of this VVar, but more especially in their carriage of late: As to the first, all know, and they cannot be ignorant, that the City of <hi>Waterford</hi> hath been one of the chief places in this Dominion which hath maintain'd and upheld the trade of Piracy upon the <hi>English,</hi> both by receiving the Goods so taken by others from the <hi>English,</hi> and thereby much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging those Thieves and Robbers in their wicked Practises, and also by setting forth and maintaining Ships or Frigats of their own for the same Pyratical trade. To their carriage of late (especially since our endeavouring the reducement of the place) their continued obstinacy even almost to utmost extremity and their refusing all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures made to them for returning them to their due obedience, and delivery up of that place upon good terms for themselves (even when it was in their own power to have done it, <note n="*" place="margin">Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral <hi>Farrall, vid.</hi> f. 230. putting by the Marquess of <hi>Ormond.</hi>
                                 </note> having no Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at all in it to over-power them, till they received one from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and fetch'd it in with their own Boats from the other side of the River in view of our Army then treating fairly with them) are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient arguments of their unfitness to be trusted by us in so much power of betraying such a place, to the party they so much adhere unto, in their judgments and affections. And to this purpose I shall desire them but to remember what was offered by the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and refused by them when we came <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>December</hi> 1649. in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the weakness of his Forces, and the wetness of the Season.</note> first against the City; and what trouble, hazard, and expence they have put us to, then and since; As also what was offered by us a second time in the Treaty at <hi>Dunkit,</hi> and by the Letters proceeding (that occasion'd it.) And how it was received by them, as some of them yet present in the City, (acting then as Commissioners in the name of the rest) well know. And how at <note n="†" place="margin">August 20. 1652.</note> last they necessitated us to march down with our whole Army and Artillery against them before they would deliver, and we have no reason to think, they had delivered then, but the extremity of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and want of provisions (together with their own fears of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93738:238"/>
induced them to it seeing us come prepared in every respect (through God's blessing) to have forc'd them, if they had not yielded: And whether persons that do their utmost to the last in holding out a place against us, upon such an account as they did, be fit to be let stay in that place with us (where they may have such opportunities of betraying it, when the Army may be ingaged at a remote distance) I leave to all rational men to judge, considering we are free by the Articles to turn them out upon due warning.</p>
                              <p>A further ground leading me to conclude them unfit to be trusted by us in such a case, and in the power of such a place, is, the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of those principles in their Religion (owned and pursued by the people of this Nation more evidently than in many others, and so by them in that City) tending in endless violence, injustice, falshood and treachery towards us, whereever they find opportunity, as That Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks (which in their sense are all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons not of their Religion) but that (at least) where the keeping of it is to the prejudice, and the breaking of it may be of advantage to the Catholique cause, it may be broken, and any thing (in a manner) is lawful to be done for the advantage of that Cause (at least) if it be with the allowance or dispensation of their Ghostly Fathers; And how dangerous and unsafe it is to keep persons of such differing and destructive principles to the Cause and Interest we serve, in such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of strength and so much in the power of the Inhabitants, I wish them only to make it their own case, and then judge: And though such principles be denied or disowned in the expressions of some, yet sure I am, nothing hath been more clear in the practices of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the people of that Religion in this Nation: as appears in the several times of their Rebellion against the lawful authority which God had set over them (to whom <note n="*" place="margin">The Chief of every <hi>Sept</hi> who formerly at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of each K. since the Conquest swore Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance.</note> they have several times sworn to be true and faithful, and as often broke their faith and obligations as engaged) and especially in this Rebellion, by the Murders and Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres of so many innocent <hi>English</hi> Protestants (in the beginning of it) living in peace and Trust quietly by them: And that this is still their practice (suitable to such principles) I desire those that question it, but to look upon the late actions of many of those that (upon their fair professions to us, and our trust in them for faithfulness or (at least) for innocent and peaceable demeanors towards us) have received protection from us, who, notwithstanding, do (most of them) make it their daily business to do us all the mischief they can (wherever they see an opportunity) and for that purpose do harbor, entertain and encourage those many Tories, in every corner, that, otherwise durst not come into our Quarters, nor could subsist in them undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, or do that mischief as they do, and escape yet from all our Forces and Garrisons (in every corner ready to pursue them) but that (as they are assured and find) the <hi>protected people are friends to them,</hi> 
                                 <note n="*" place="margin">
                                    <hi>Tories, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerns,</hi> or any that oppose the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and in their hearts Enemies and false to us, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their professions to the contrary: nay many of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected people themselves, upon every slight occasion or ground of hope of doing mischief to us, do frequently run from their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, join with the Enemy in Arms, and deliver up their Castles to them; And though, for the shame and ill consequences of such principles to themselves (if owned and profest by them) many do
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93738:239"/>
disclaim any such opinions, yea perhaps (from the sence of those evil consequences) may, in their present and private Judgments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them; yet whilst they hold entire communion with that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church (as they account it) which maintains, or holds forth the same, and implicitly resolve their private judgments into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or determination of that Church, or (however) do own and adhere to a power (both forreign and adverse to us) in their Pope, and Clergy, which, they acknowledg, can bind and lose their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences without limitation; It must needs follow, that upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations or allowance of that Church, or the injunctions or abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of that power, they must, when it comes to trial, unless they will renounce that Communion and Dependance, account themselves not only absolvable thereby, from all obligations of humane right or duty towards us, to the contrary; but also obliged, by an higher bond, and duty, to answer and pursue any Injunctions of that CHURCH, or power, in any ways of violence and treachery to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, which for the upholding or advancement thereof, shall be required, or warranted thereby, and they shall see any opportunity for. Now though these and many more such considerations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences may suffice, both to justifie us in, and awaken us to, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for security to our selves and our Cause, against such a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by all ways, to which, in common Justice, we are free (as by this <hi>warning</hi> out these Inhabitants in this case) and not to trust them in so visible a power and opportunity to betray or hurt us (as their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in that City beyond the period of this <hi>warning</hi> they would have) yet, in humanity and our common Christian charity we cannot but pity Men, so miserably blind-folded and captivated in delusions (as the generality of them appear) and heartily wish and pray, that neither they nor any other might any longer be so; and we do not desire their hurt or prejudice, further than justice and necessity (for our own and the publick safety) do require; and therefore (even in this <hi>warning</hi> given) we have not only consulted the justice and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity leading to it, but also the conveniency of time (as to them) for doing of it, that it might be at such a season, as might be most convenient or least prejudicial to them also, which I judge the time of the period of this <hi>warning</hi> to be, in regard that (being in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>May</hi>) it is the most fitting season for persons in such conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to provide for themselves, either by hiring or building themselves places of Habitation in some parts near adjoyning (to be allotted them for that purpose) or to march, if they so desire it, by Land, or take a Voyage by Sea, to those places unto which they shall desire to go. And that all may see, who do not wilfully shut their eyes, that our end is, not to ruin them and inrich our selves, but only, to act in order to publique safety and security, <q>I do resolve (where I can find a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Character or mark of distinction concerning any person or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that have not had a hand in the first years Rebellion, and Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres, or have discovered themselves to be Friends to the Interest and People of <hi>England,</hi> or have not been known to have been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently active in the prosecution of the War or holding out of that City against us) to difference them (<hi>by favour and respect shewn</hi>) from others, and, in all other cases, wherein mercy and favour may be shewed (without prejudice to publick justice and safety)
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93738:239"/>
I do intend it, and particularly in that of Orphans and Aged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepid people and Widdows, whose condition is the most to be pitied in regard many of them may not be able to help themselves, but if they should be turned out with the others immediately, might suffer much by it,</q> I shall therefore take the best care and course I can for them, to prevent any of those inconveniences that may otherwise fall upon persons in their conditions, and to do for them, as near as I can suitable to what their necessities may require, and the Condition and State of Affairs under my charge can admit: as, either by continuing them, or so many of them in Town, as shall be thought fit, or (for those of that condition that do go out) by allotting for them some places, near hand, such as may (by industry and care of any Friends in their behalfs) be, in most respects, equal to what benefits they have in Town, or at least contribute competently towards their livelihood and subsistence, at present, until either the state of our Affairs or frame of their Spirits be known to be altered as may admit their return, or a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provision for them.

            <head>Dr. <hi>Robert Maxwell</hi> (since Bishop of <hi>Kilmore</hi>) his Examination, worthy deliberate and serious Reflexions, but not here to be flied to as quoted in the Abstract, That only to be sought for in the Archives of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>DOctor <hi>Robert Maxwell,</hi> Rector of <hi>Tynon</hi> in the County of <hi>Armagh,</hi> sworn and examined: and first touching the nature of the Rebellion, deposeth and saith, that (to begin higher than the 22th of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1641.) at the coming in of the Scots<note place="margin">The Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors joy'd at the coming in of the Scots, dejected at their going out from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle.</hi>
               </note> to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> he observ'd Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil, Tirlagh oge O Neil</hi> his Brother, <hi>Robert Hovenden</hi> Esq. deceased, and generally all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Neighbours overjoyed; and at their peaceable disbanding as much cast down and dejected, calling the English base degenerate Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and the Scots dishonourable Bragadochies, who came into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> not to fight, but to scrape up wealth, merchandizing their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours for sums of money. But he, this Deponent, did not much heed those distempered speeches, as every where rise in those days, and as proceeding from bankrupt and discontented Gentlemen; and the rather because many in <hi>Ireland</hi> at that time, measuring the Scots Laws by their own, accompted the Scots subjection not much better than Rebellion, although since by the Event their Judgments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are now rectified; yet he asked what they meant to be thus sad at good News, but joyful at evil? They said, if the two Kingdoms had gone by the ears, they hoped the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> (whose Government had been most avaritious and tyrannical) would (in regard of his forwardness) have perished in the Combustion. But this he, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, thought not worth the informing, because what they said most men thought from the disbanding of the Scots, until the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the present Rebellion. He observed also frequent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary meetings of Priests and Fryars almost every where under colour of Visitations, and at the first summons of Fryars (to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of two or three thousand in a Company) they would usually meet together for a twelvemonth before the Rebellion, who, with others<note place="margin">The Irish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their grand Erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, borrowed what they could of the English.</note> of the same stamp, borrowed what sums of money they possibly could from the Brittish, ane often without any apparent necessity; neither did it afterwards appear what they did with the money so borrowed, for they would not pay any man a penny. And the Deponent further saith, That in <hi>April</hi> 1641. there went a report amonst the Irish (the Deponents next Neighbours) that the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> was seen with
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93738:251"/>
Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil</hi> in the Wood of <hi>Ballynametash,</hi> but upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation they denied it; yet since the Rebellion they told the Deponent, That a great man out of <hi>Spain</hi> was at that time with him, but they would not name him; and about three years before that, one <hi>Priest mac Case</hi> came from <hi>Rome</hi> with the Pope's Bull for the Parish of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and (being kept out by Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>) talked freely of a Rebellion plotted and intended by him and others: Upon which the Priest went to <hi>Dublin</hi> to inform the Lord Deputy <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Christopher Wendisford,</hi> Esq.</note> thereof, by whom (being examined) he either said nothing to the purpose, or was not believed, or was taken off by Sir <hi>Phelim.</hi> And further saith, That Sir <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim O Neil</hi> (a little before the Rebellion) brought two Hogsheads of Gunpowder from <hi>Dublin,</hi> under colour of Wine, by <hi>Patrick O</hi>
               <note place="margin">Powder (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then by such little Quantities not to be parted with) so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the State.</note> 
               <hi>Dogherty</hi> Vintner of <hi>Kynard;</hi> he bought a great part thereof by ten or twelve pounds in the name of most of the Gentry in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This he bragged of to the Deponent afterwards; and that he likewise told this Deponent, (when the Lord <hi>Magwyre,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rebels, were taken in <hi>Dublin</hi>) his man, <hi>James Warren,</hi> and Friar <hi>Paul O Neil,</hi> were apprehended amongst them, having sent them thither a little before to assist and attend the Issue of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but said, that upon Examination at Council-table, they were both dismissed contrary to his expectation. He said also, <hi>that some Lord or other spoke for them</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, f. 20.</note>. This Deponent further saith, That<note place="margin">* A Favour not the first of that kind.</note> he heard Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil</hi> (upon his first return from <hi>Strabane</hi>) say, that this Plot was in his head five or six years before he could bring it to any maturity: but said that after <hi>it was concluded by the Parliament</hi> (meaning the Popish party) he was one of the last men to whom it was communicated. He said likewise, That to bring about his own ends, he had formerly <hi>demeaned himself as a fool</hi> in all great mens Company, but that he hoped (by that time) the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of them saw, that Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil</hi> was no such fool as they took him for: And further saith, That he, this Deponent, heard Sir <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim</hi>'s Brother <hi>Tirlagh oge O Neil</hi> say, that this business (meaning the Rebellion) <hi>was communicated by the Irish Committee</hi> (meaning the Popish Irish) <hi>unto the Papists in</hi> England, <hi>who promised their</hi>
               <note place="margin">The English Papists charg'd with the knowledge of the Irish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note> 
               <hi>assistance; and that by their advice, some things formerly resolved upon were altered;</hi> saying, it was a good Omen, and undoubted sign of Divine Approbation, <hi>that the Parliament here should send over a Committee, the major part whereof were Papists.</hi> He also affirmed, that when the Protestants of the lower House in <hi>Ireland</hi> withdrew themselves apart unto <hi>Chichester-Hall, The Papists at the same time,</hi> (never dreaming the Deponent should live to tell it again) <hi>debated, concluded, and signed a combinatory Writing of this Rebellion under their hands in the</hi> Tollbooth <hi>or</hi> Tolsell; which (he said) that Session drew on, and hastned sooner than it was intended: and when the Deponent answered, That the Papists in all former Parliaments (which either of them had seen) usually, and without exception, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted apart as often as they pleased: He replied in great choler, <hi>But so did never the Protestants before.</hi> And this Deponent further saith, That in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 19. 1641. he the Deponent heard Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> in his own House, and in the hearing of Mr. <hi>Joseph Traverse,</hi> and others,<note place="margin">The Gentry (besides those of <hi>Ulster</hi>) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused.</note> say, <hi>That if the Lords and Gentlemen</hi> (meaning Popish) <hi>of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provinces, then not in Arms, would not rise, but leave him in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93738:252"/>
the lurch for all, he would produce his Warrant signed with their hands, and written in their own blood, that should bring them to the Gallows; and that they sate every day at Council-board, and whispered the Lords Justices in the ear, who were as deep in that business as himself.</hi> And saith also, That on the third day after this Rebellion began, <hi>Tortlagh oge O Neil</hi>'s wife (a most bloody woman,<note place="margin">It is a known Truth, that though he took not the Castle, yet all his Horses in the Stable were both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy furnished and in good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage, which by several was observ'd and wonder'd at.</note> and natural Daughter to the late Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi>) told this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that all <hi>Ireland</hi> was in the same case with <hi>Ulster;</hi> for (said she) my Brother the Earl of <hi>Antrim,</hi> hath taken the Castle and City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> having lately moved thither for the same purpose, and not to please the Dutchess (as was given out) and my brother <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander mac Donnell</hi> (according to the general Appointment) hath taken the Town and Castle of <hi>Carrickfergus.</hi> He, the Deponent, then asked what they meant to do with those whom they had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed and pillaged? She said, as long as their preservation should be deemed consistent with the publick safety, they should injoy their lives; when otherwise, better their enemy perish than themselves: which was but a very cold comfort to a Freshman prisoner (as my self was). And also said, That Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil</hi> told this Deponent in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> last, that his stock in money amounted to 80000 sterling, wherewith he said <hi>he was able to maintain an Army for one year, though all shifts else failed.</hi> And that Captain <hi>Alexander Hoven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> told him, that as soon as his brother Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> was created Earl of <hi>Tyron,</hi> and great <hi>O Neil,</hi> he wrote Letters, and sent them by Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars to the Pope, and Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> but would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <hi>Contents.</hi> And further saith, That about the first of <hi>March</hi> last, the said <hi>Alexander</hi> told the Deponent, <hi>that the Friars of</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">As is evident in the History, f. 63.</note> 
               <hi>Drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heda</hi> (by Father <hi>Thomas</hi> brother to the Lord of <hi>Slane</hi>) <hi>had the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time invited Sir</hi> Phelim <hi>thither, and offered to betray the Town unto him,</hi> by making, or discovering (the Deponent knoweth not whether) a breach in the Wall, through which he might march six men a breast. The Deponent saw this Friar the same time in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> whom Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> took by the hand, and brought to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, saying, <hi>This is the Friar that said Mass at</hi> Finglass <hi>upon Sunday morning, and in the Afternoon did beat Sir</hi> Charles Coote <hi>at swords.</hi> I hope, said the Friar, to say Mass in <hi>Christ-Church Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> within eight weeks. And further Deposed that he, this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, asked many, both of their Commanders and Friars, what chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved them to take up Arms: They said, <hi>Why may not we as well,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reasons why the Rebels as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed Arms.</note> 
               <hi>and better fight for Religion, which is the Substance, than the Scots did for Ceremonies, which are but Shadows? and that my Lord of</hi> Strafford's <hi>Government was intolerable.</hi> The Deponent answered, That that Government, how insupportable soever, was indifferent, and lay no heavier upon them, then on him, and the rest of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Protestants. They replied, <hi>That the Deponent, and the rest of the Brittish, were no considerable part of the Kingdom; and that over and above all this, they were certainly informed, that the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>had a plot to bring them all to Church, or to cut off all the Papists in the Kings Dominions, in</hi> England <hi>by the English Protestants</hi> (or as they call them, Puritans) <hi>in</hi> Ireland <hi>by the Scots.</hi> And further deposeth, That he asked (as seeming very careful of their saftety) what hope of Aid they had? and from whom?
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93738:252"/>
as also what discreet and able men they had to imploy as Agents to their Friends beyond the Sea? They said, if they held out this next Winter, they were sure and certain in the Spring to receive Aid from the Pope, <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and that the Clergy of <hi>Spain</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready contributed five thousand Arms and Powder for a whole year then in readiness. They said, <hi>their best and only Agents were their Priests and Friars, but especially the forenamed</hi> Paulo Neil, upon<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Paul O Neil,</hi> a prime Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Rebellion.</note> whose coming (with advice from <hi>Spain</hi>) they presently opened the War; and that since the War began, in the very dead of Winter, he both went with Letters, and returned with Instructions from <hi>Spain</hi> in one Month, professing the good Cause had suffered much prejudice <hi>if he had been hanged in</hi> Dublin. And this Deponent further saith, That he demanded why sometimes they pretended a Commission from the King, at other times from the Queen, since all Wisemen knew<note place="margin">How the King and Queen came to be charg'd with the Rebellion.</note> that the King would not grant a Commission against himself, and the Queen could not. They being Commanders and Friars, said, <hi>That it was lawful for them to pretend what they could in advancement of their Cause:</hi> That many of the Garrison Souldiers (now their Prisoners, whom they determined to imploy in the War, and to train others) would not serve them in regard of <hi>their Oath,</hi> unless they were made so to believe: That <hi>in all Wars, rumours and lies served many times to as good purpose as Arms, and that they would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim any advantage.</hi> But they said for the Queen (in regard, as<note place="margin">Reasons why the Queen not to be nam'd.</note> a Catholick, she had enemies enough already) they would command their Priests publickly (at Mass) to discharge the people from speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her <hi>as a Cause, or Abetter of the present Troubles.</hi> And the Deponent also asked Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil,</hi> what his demands were<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Ph. O Neil</hi>'s Motives to the Rebellion.</note> without which his Lordship and the rest would not lay down Arms? At first he told this Deponent, <hi>That they required only Liberty of Conscience.</hi> But afterwards as his Power, so his Demands were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied. <hi>They must have no Lord Deputy, great Officers of State, Privy Councellors, Judges, or Justices of Peace, but of the Irish Nation; no standing Army in the Kingdom; all Tythes payable by Papists to be paid to Popish Priests; Church Lands to be restóred to their Bishops; All Plantations, since</hi> primo Jacobi, <hi>to be disannulled, none made hereafter; no payments of debts due to the Brittish, or restitution of any thing taken in the Wars; all Fortifications and Strengths to be in the hands of the Irish, with power to erect and build more, if they thought fit; all Strangers (meaning Brittish) to be restrained from coming over; all Acts of Parliament against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Papists, together with Poynings Act to be repealed, and the Irish Parliament to be made Independent.</hi> But saith, that others told him, this Deponent, that although <hi>all these Demands were granted,</hi> yet Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> for his own part was not resolv'd to lay down Arms, unless his Majesty would confirm unto him the Earldom of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> with all the ancient Patrimony and Priviledges belonging to the <hi>O Neils</hi>

he had driven King <hi>Charles,</hi> with his whole Posterity, out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who should be afterwards <hi>profugi in terra aliena in aeternum.</hi> The Paper it self, with the Deponents whole Library, to the value of seven or eight hundred pounds, was lately burnt by the Scots under the Conduct of the Lord Viscount <hi>Montgomery:</hi> since that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the Deponent saith, he hath often seen Captain <hi>Tirlagh mac Brian O Neil,</hi> a great man in the County of <hi>Armagh,</hi> with many others, no mean Commanders, drinking Healths upon the knee to Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil, Lord General of the Catholick Army in</hi> Ulster, <hi>Earl of</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone, <hi>and King of</hi> Ireland. But the Deponent professeth (<hi>in verbo Christiani</hi>) he did never pledge that Health; although sometimes he fled it with hazard of his life, if he had been observed. And this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent further saith, That <hi>Art oge O Neil</hi> his eldest Son (whose name if it be not <hi>Art,</hi> he hath forgotten) now, and of a long time a Captain, and one of the stoutest Rebels in the County of <hi>Armagh,</hi> was, as he told the Deponent, in <hi>Dublin</hi> at School, and dieted at an Aldermans house, whose name he also doth not remember in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the rebellion, and that being found in <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man aforesaid became bound at Council-board in one thousand pounds for his forth-coming; but afterwards seeing how business sorted, he<note place="margin">The perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the City Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the State.</note> came unto this young man, and said, <hi>Boy, get you gone, and shift for your self:</hi> Alas, saith he, Sir, you are bound for me in one thousand pounds. <hi>No matter Boy,</hi> said he, <hi>I must loose that and many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands more:</hi> whereupon he faith he fled upon foot, and escaped to the Army about <hi>Drogheda</hi> that same night. And further saith, That in <hi>May</hi> 1642. Captain <hi>Walter White</hi> told <hi>Edward Bleeke</hi> an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the Deponent, in <hi>Hovenden</hi>'s Garden, that amongst others, <hi>Roger Moore,</hi> or <hi>Moore</hi> and <hi>Bryan O Neil</hi> were designed to take, and man the Postern door of the Castle of <hi>Dublin;</hi> and that he was in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and himself of the Plot, that told them this of his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. It may be enquired if there were any more <hi>Bryan O Neils</hi> in Town at that time then one; the Deponent durst not ask what <hi>Bryan</hi> he meant. And further saith, That <hi>Tirlogh oge O Neil</hi> told<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil</hi>'s carriage at <hi>Strabane.</hi>
               </note> him in <hi>Armagh,</hi> three or four days before the Irish Army went to <hi>Strabane,</hi> that the Lady of <hi>Strabane</hi> had by Letters invited Sir <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim</hi> thither, assuring that the Town should be betrayed unto him, or yielded, he knoweth not whether: And Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> himself (at his return from taking <hi>Strabane</hi>) told him the same over again; yet he said, when he came to the Castle to avoid suspicion, they shot ten or twelve shots over him. He told the Deponent likewise, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing withstood his present marriage with the said Lady, but the want of a Dispensation impetiable from their Lord Primate for a Vow which she made not to marry for three years to come. He said also, That at his entrance into the Castle, the Ladies Priest (a Scotch Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit) exacted, and ministred an Oath unto him, that he, and those his noble Cavaliers, came thither for the propagation of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, and not in any way to violate the Lady, since it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very credibly that they are married. Captain <hi>Alexander Hoven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> told the Deponent, that when Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> brought her to <hi>Kynard</hi> from her own Castle of <hi>Strabane,</hi> she did pray him to burn and raze it, least thereafter it might be useful to the Scots, and was of opinion Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> did very ill in neglecting so good advice. The Deponent,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93738:253"/>
and the rest of the Brittish, expected much favour by her means, but immediately after her coming to these parts, the Sword was let fly, whether at her intreaty or not, the Deponent cannot affirm. More the Deponent hath heard, but because it is not Treason, and she is a Lady nobly descended, he will not publish it. And further the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent saith, That in <hi>March</hi> last a Footman of the Earl of <hi>Antrims</hi> was denied lodging, as was reported by Mrs. <hi>Hovenden,</hi> Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s mother, which gave much occasion of Discourse in the Country, and that he heard Dr. <hi>Daly</hi> say, <hi>That Sir</hi> Phelim <hi>would never have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to have joyn'd with Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>the Province of</hi> Ulster, <hi>if he had not been perswaded that the said Earl would have taken up Arms as soon as himself;</hi> and he himself hath heard others say, that his approbation of the business was as much as theirs; but that when it came to Action, <hi>he durst not shew his face in the field for fear of discomposing his clothes:</hi> And that <hi>Owen mac Clymon</hi> (at his parting from the Earl in <hi>March</hi> last, as himself reported to divers in the Country) told him that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cause suffered by his Non-concurrence: But he replied, <hi>The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Reasons why <hi>Antrim</hi> complied not</note> 
               <hi>was already spoiled, especially in</hi> Ulster, <hi>by bloodshed and robbery; and that he would not declare himself, either one way or other, until after May-day following.</hi> And the Deponent hath heard many of the Rebels call Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> a Confident of the Earls, for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him go when he was taken Prisoner by the Captain of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> saying, That he deserved to loose his Head for some words he spake, going through <hi>Armagh,</hi> about the last of <hi>April,</hi> or first of <hi>May</hi> last, <hi>viz. That he saw nothing amongst them but desolation and execrable cruelty; for which God's wrath, and the King's just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge hung over their heads, and would very speedily overtake them.</hi> As he rode through the Parish of <hi>Derenoose,</hi> he would very gladly (although the Deponent is a stranger unto him) have seen him the said Deponent, but could not procure the Friars Guides to send a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger for him; they were afraid (as some of them told him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) that he would have rescued the Deponent, but he the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent thinketh, they more feared, least he might have laboured to divert his Lordship from joyning with them, which was then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently expected: so that a man can see no part of <hi>This Tragedy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is not a Devil or a Friar, or both.</hi> And the Deponent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saith, That he was certainly informed by the chief of the <hi>O Donnellies</hi> and <hi>O Donnellies</hi> and <hi>O Lappans,</hi> and many others, whereof some were very near unto Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> and it is generally reported in those parts, where the Deponent lived, that Mrs. <hi>May,</hi> Widow to Mr. <hi>Edward May</hi> late of <hi>Dublin</hi> (a meer Irish woman, whom the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral long kept <hi>for his fancy,</hi> and thereafter married out of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)<note place="margin">Mrs. <hi>May</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> Sir <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim</hi>'s Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer.</note> is and was ever (since the Rebellion began) Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s chief and unsuspected Intelligencer; that he addressed all his Packets sent to <hi>Dublin</hi> unto her, and by her means, and for the most part by <hi>Owen mac Clymon</hi> aforesaid, and other of her Servants received An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers; perhaps the truth may be found out by suddain search for Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or unexpected examination of her and her Servants apart. And also saith, that he hath heard many of the Rebels say amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they feared nothing so much, as the corrupting and spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Monroe's</hi> Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</note> of their Harvest: and that if <hi>G. M. Monroe</hi> had put three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men in the Towns of <hi>Armagh, Dungannon,</hi> and <hi>Monaghan,</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:93738:254"/>
before they were burnt, he had made himself absolute Master of all the Corn in the three Counties, without which they could not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly subsist this Winter. And saith moreover, That Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil,</hi> his deputed Lieutenants and Governours (in all their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Passes, and Warrants) leave out these words (<hi>in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties name</hi>) yet if any be tendred by the Brittish in the old stile, they seldom except against them <hi>de nomine,</hi> and as seldom sign them. And the Deponent also saith, that the last, <hi>who were devoured, were</hi>
               <note place="margin">The last that suffered were those who had complied.</note> 
               <hi>Apostates through fear, and Revolters to Popery, who (though but a very handful) yet such was their insatiable thirst of blood, they could not spare them.</hi> And further saith, That it was credibly told him, that the Rebels (least they should hereafter be charged with more murthers then they had committed) commanded their Priests to bring in a true account of them; and that <hi>the persons so slaughtered</hi> (whether in <hi>Ulster,</hi> or the whole Kingdom, the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent<note place="margin">154000 slaughtered by the Priests estimate.</note> durst not enquire) <hi>in March last, amounted unto one hundred, fifty four thousand.</hi> Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil</hi> asked the Deponent very scornfully once in <hi>Armagh,</hi> and in the hearing of many, why the Scots in so many weeks came not to relieve or revenge the Death of their Countreymen? The Deponent durst not reply in this so danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a question; but one that stood by said, <hi>That they did wisely to stay until his Lordship made them more elbow room.</hi> This Riddle was soon after interpreted upon the March of the Scottish Army from the <hi>Newry</hi> back to <hi>Carrickfergus,</hi> by the bloody Massacre of above five thousand of the Brittish in three days. About two hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, within seven weeks after, that were relieved by the Lord <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> Army, sent for the same purpose, so that the Deponent doth confidently say, that now of all the <hi>Royal Plantation</hi> in <hi>Ulster,</hi> there<note place="margin">The Scots de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</note> doth not remain alive two hundred more amongst the Rebels. And further saith, That a Nephew of <hi>Art. O Neil's,</hi> Brother to <hi>Henry O Neil</hi> Lord of the <hi>Fewes,</hi> told him, this Deponent, that his Uncle the said <hi>Art.</hi> had but one Scotchman upon his Land, and that about two days foregoing, gave directions to have him murther'd, thereby to give to Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> a proof of his zeal in the common Cause, from which there was a suspicion he meant to Revolt. And further saith, that there went a common report amongst the Irish in <hi>Armagh,</hi> that the Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi> had undertaken to betray the Town of <hi>Derry</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Phelims</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to have cut off Dr. <hi>Bramhall</hi> Bp. of <hi>Derry.</hi>
               </note> unto Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil,</hi> which he remembring, or being put in mind thereof at <hi>Strabane,</hi> as he told the Deponent upon his return, he resolved from thence to have written unto him a Letter, promising to be with him such a night, and desiring admittance at the Gate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. This Letter, said he, I intended to send by a Prisoner, with whom (upon search finding this Letter) the Scots (without more examination) would have cut the Bishop into Collops, but he said somewhat put this project out of his head. He may in time do as much for others, as then he intended to do for the Bishop, wherefore the Deponent thought this passage not worthy the inserting. And the Deponent further saith, That <hi>Tirlagh oge O Neil,</hi> then Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Armagh,</hi> caused an English Ditcher to be killed upon a proof made, that he should say he was a better preacher then <hi>James Usher</hi> Primate of <hi>Armagh:</hi> this he did (as he said) to suppress <hi>Brownisme</hi> in his Government. And further saith, That amongst
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93738:254"/>
the Rebels he hath seen some laugh and wonder at the English for keeping their words or protestations given to the Irish; and some said in mockery, that this was a secret Confession of the Protestants, that the Papists were not Hereticks: and for some instance of extream cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty used by the Irish in <hi>Ulster,</hi> the Deponent saith, that by special command from Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil,</hi> they dragged the Deponents bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lieutenant <hi>James Maxwell,</hi> out of his bed in the rage and<note place="margin">The Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents Brother murther'd, and his Wife drown'd.</note> height of a burning Fever, and least any of his Acquaintance or Friends should bury him, they carried him two miles from any Church, and there cruelly butchered him, when he knew neither what he did or said: and thus Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> paid him two hundred and sixty pounds which he owed him. And that his Wife <hi>Grizell Maxwell,</hi> being in Child-birth, the Child half born, and half unborn, they stript stark naked, and drove her about an arrow flight to the <hi>Blackwater,</hi> and drowned her. The like they did to another Englishwoman in the same Parish in the beginning of the Rebellion, which was little infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour (if not more unnatural and barbarous) then the roasting of Mr.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Watson</hi> roasted alive.</note> 
               <hi>Watson</hi> alive, after they had cut a Collop out of either Buttock. That a Scotchwoman was found in the <hi>Glyn-wood</hi> lying dead, her belly rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up, and a living Child crawling in her Womb, cut out of the<note place="margin">Others barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd.</note> Cawl. That Mr. <hi>Starky,</hi> Schoolmaster at <hi>Armagh,</hi> a Gentleman of good parentage and parts, being upwards of one hundred years of age, they stripped naked, caused two of his Daughters (Virgins) being likewise naked, to support him under each arm, not being able to go of himself, and in that posture carried them all three a quarter of a mile to a Turf-pit, and drowned them, feeding the lust of their eyes and the cruelty of their hearts with the self same objects at the same time. At the Siege of <hi>Augher,</hi> they would not kill any English beast,<note place="margin">Cruelties to Beasts.</note> and then eat it, but they cut Collops out of them being alive, letting them there waste till they had no more flesh upon their backs; so that sometimes a beast would live two or three days together in that Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The like they did at <hi>Armagh,</hi> when they murther'd <hi>Hugh Echline</hi> Esq. they hang'd all his Irish Servants, which had any ways proved faithful or useful unto him during this Rebellion. And as touching exemplary constancy in Religion, the Deponent saith, that <hi>Henry Cowell</hi> Esq. a gallant and well-bred Gentleman, was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, because he would not consent to marry a beastly Trull, <hi>Mary ny Neil,</hi> a near Kinswoman of Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s: He was proffered his<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Echline</hi> and his Son constant in the Faith.</note> life without the Blowse if he would have gone to Mass, but he chose rather to dye then do either. There was made the like proffer of life for going to Mass unto <hi>Robert Echline,</hi> Son to the above-named <hi>Hugh Echline,</hi> a Child of eleven or twelve years of age, but he also refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it, saying, <hi>He saw nothing in their Religion for which he would change his own.</hi> And the Deponent further saith, That his, and the rest of the Brittish chief and best Friends amongst the Rebels were, Mrs. <hi>Katherine Hovenden</hi> Widow, Mother to Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil:</hi> she<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s Mother chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> preserved four and twenty English and Scots in her own house, and fed them for seven and thirty weeks out of her own store; and when her Children took her away upon the approach of an Army, she left both them, and this Deponent, to their liberty, and gave them free leave to escape: many more she would have saved, but that while she lay sick ten weeks of an Ague, none of them were suffered to come
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93738:255"/>
near her, she swooned twice, as was said, when she heard that six and fifty were taken out of the Deponent's House, and murther'd in one day. <hi>She used often to say, she had never offended the English,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Captain <hi>Alex. Hovenden</hi>'s good Service.</note> 
               <hi>except in being Mother to Sir</hi> Phelim <hi>and Captain</hi> Alexander Hoven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Son to Mrs. <hi>Hovenden,</hi> and half Brother to Sir <hi>Phelim;</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted five and thirty English out of <hi>Armagh</hi> to <hi>Drogheda,</hi> whereof some were of good quality, when it was thought he had secret dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to have murthered them: twenty more he sent safe to the <hi>Newry,</hi> and would trust no other Convoy then himself. It is to be observ'd, that all others perished under colour of Convoys, except<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants trusting to Convoys, were betray'd.</note> only those whom he undertook. At the Deponents Request he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Armagh</hi> twice from burning, and would have saved it the third time, but that he lay sick of a Fever. When he beheld the Ruins thereof, but especially of the Church, 'tis said he wept bitterly, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Who will ever trust the Irish again, who have neither kept their promises to God, nor protestations to men?</hi> When he (<hi>viz.</hi> Captain <hi>Alexander Hovenden</hi>) saw Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s Warrant for the last general Massacre, after the taking of the <hi>Newry,</hi> he solemnly swore he would never draw his Sword again in Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s quarrel or cause, cursing (in his passion) the Brittish, if ever they spared Irish man, woman, or child. He was desirous to submit himself to the King's mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord <hi>Montgomery</hi> his protection, offering to root out that bloody Sept of the <hi>Huges,</hi> with his own Followers and Arms, out of <hi>Ireland:</hi> But the motion was rejected; perhaps worse will be admitted. He never had his hand in blood out of Battel. That this Deponent knoweth he is not yet (which may plead some favour) full two and twenty years of age, and doth not pretend to one foot of Inheritance. Dr. <hi>Dally</hi> preached so vehemently against murthering,<note place="margin">Some sensible of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> that in the end he was forced to fly himself for a safeguard of his life. <hi>Patrick Kelly,</hi> and <hi>Gilduffe mac Tynny,</hi> would suffer nothing rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed from the Brittish to come within their doors. And this Deponent further saith, That very many of the Brittish Protestants, the Rebels buried alive, and took a great pleasure to hear them speak unto them, as they digged down old Ditches upon them. Except those, whom they thus buried, they (the Rebels) buried none of the Protestants, neither would permit any, who survived, to perform the duty for them. And further saith, That the Rebels would send their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren abroad in great Troops, and especially near unto <hi>Kynard,</hi> arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with long wattles and whips, who would therewith beat mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies about their privy Members, until they beat, or rather thrashed them off; then would return in great joy to their Parents, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them for such service, as it were in triumph. And further saith, If any women were found dead, lying with their faces down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,<note place="margin">Dead women abused.</note> they would turn them upon their backs, and in great flocks go unto them, censuring all parts of their bodies, but especially such as are not to be named, which afterwards they abused so many ways so filthily, as chast ears would not endure the very naming thereof. And further saith, That many of the Protestants the Rebels would not kill outright, but being half dead, would leave them, intreating for no greater favour at their hands, two or three days after, but to kill them out-right, which sometimes was granted, sometimes deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A young youth having his backbone broken, was found in a field,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93738:255"/>
having like a beast eaten all the grass round about him. The Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent<note place="margin">One not able to stir forced to eat grass.</note> could not learn that they killed him, but that they removed him to a place of better pasture: so that in these most bloody and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wretches, that of the Holy Ghost is clearly verified, <hi>The very mercy of the wicked is cruelty.</hi> And further saith, That the Rebels themselves told him, this Deponent, that they murthered nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fifty and four in one morning in the County of <hi>Antrim;</hi> land that besides them, they supposed they had killed above eleven or twelve hundred more in that County. They told him likewise that Colonel <hi>Bryan O Neil</hi> killed about one thousand in the County of <hi>Downe,</hi> besides three hundred killed near <hi>Killeleagh,</hi> and many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds both before and after in both those Counties. At Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s return from <hi>Lisnegarvy</hi> some of his Souldiers forced about four and<note place="margin">Some burned alive.</note> twenty British into a House, where they burned them alive, whose terrible out-cries they delighted very much to imitate and express un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others; and saith, that he heard Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> likewise report, that he killed six hundred English at <hi>Garvagh</hi> in the County of <hi>Derry,</hi> and that he had neither left man, woman, nor child alive in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony of <hi>Muntulony</hi> in the County of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and that betwixt <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh</hi> and the <hi>Newry</hi> in the several Lands and Plantations of Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Atcheson, John Hamilton</hi> Esq. the Lord <hi>Cawfield,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Mountnorris.</hi> And saith also, that there were above two thousand of the British murther'd in their own Houses, for the most part, and that he was informed hereof by a Scotchman, who was in these parts with Sir <hi>Phelim,</hi> and saw their Houses filled with their dead bodies. In the <hi>Glenwood,</hi> towards <hi>Drummore,</hi> there were slaughtered (as the Rebels told the Deponent) upwards of twelve hundred, who were all killed in their flight to the County of <hi>Downe.</hi> The number of people drowned at the Bridge of <hi>Portadowne</hi> are diversly reported, according as men stayed among the Rebels. The Deponent (who stayed as long as any, and had better intelligence then most of the English amongst them) had better reason to know the truth, and<note place="margin">Drown'd at <hi>Portadown</hi> Bridge.</note> saith there were by their own report one hundred and ninety drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Mr. <hi>Fullerton.</hi> At another time they threw one hundred and forty over the said Bridge; at another time six or seven and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and so continued drowning every day, more or fewer, for seven or eight weeks, so that the fewest, which can be supposed there to have perished, must needs be above one thousand, besides as many more drowned betwixt that Bridge and the great Lough of <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> besides those who perished by the Sword, Fire, and Famine in <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brazill,</hi> and the English Plantation adjacent, which in regard there escaped not three hundred out of all those quarters, must needs amount to many thousands. Near unto the Deponents own House, six and thirty persons were thrown from the <hi>Currbridge</hi> at one time; at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Drown'd in other places.</note> time eighteen or nineteen; at another time six and fifty men, women, and children, all of them being taken out of the Deponents own House; and at several other times several other numbers besides these, who were drowned in the <hi>Blackwater</hi> at <hi>Kynard:</hi> In which Town and Parish of <hi>Tynon,</hi> whereof the Deponent was Rector, there were drowned, slaughtered, and died of Famine, and for want of Clothes, about six hundred. And saith, he might add to these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many thousands more, but the Diary, which he the Deponent wrote
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93738:256"/>
amongst the Rebels, being burned with his House, Books, and all his Papers, he referreth himself to the number in gross, which the Rebels themselves have upon enquiry found out and acknowledged, which notwithstanding will come short of all that have been murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>Ireland,</hi> there being above One hundred fifty and four thousand now wanting of the British within the very Precinct of <hi>Ulster.</hi> And the Deponent further saith, that it was common Table-talk amongst the <hi>Rebels,</hi> that the Ghosts of Mr. <hi>William Fullerton, Timothy</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apparitions of those flung over <hi>Porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down.</hi>

               <hi>Jephes,</hi> and the most of those who were thrown over <hi>Portadown</hi> Bridge, were daily and nightly seen to walk upon the River, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times singing of Psalms, sometimes brandishing of naked Swords, and sometimes screeching in a most hideous and fearful manner. The Deponent did not believe the same at first, and yet is doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe it or not; but saith, that divers of the Rebels assured him, that they themselves did dwell near to the said River, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily frighted with those apparitions (but especially with their horrible screeching) were in conclusion forced to remove further into the Country. Their own Priests and Friars could not deny the truth thereof, but as oft as it was by the Deponent objected unto them, they said, <hi>That it was but a cunning slight of the Devil to hinder this great work of propagating the Catholick Faith, and killing of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; or that it was wrought by witchcraft.</hi> The Deponent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self lived within thirteen miles of the Bridge, and never heard any man so much as doubt of the truth thereof; howsoever the Deponent obligeth no man's faith, in regard he saw it not with his own eyes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he had as much certainty as morally could be required of such a matter. And the Deponent further saith, <hi>That the Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi>
               <note place="margin">Those of the Pale cruel.</note> 
               <hi>Pale-English were most cruel amongst the British Protestants, being beaten from their own Lands, and were never satisfied with their blood, until they had in a manner seen the last drop thereof, affrighting Sir</hi> Phelim O Neil <hi>every day with their numbers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading him that while they</hi> (meaning the Protestants) <hi>lived, there would neither be room for them, nor safety for him.</hi> It was easie to spur on the cowardly bloody Rebel; yet no sooner were the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants cut off, but contrary to their expectation, the meer Irish took present possessions of their Lands and Houses, whereat they (of the Pale) very much grumbled, and said Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> had not kept pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise with <note n="*" place="margin">How this was resented, see the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry f. 69.</note> them; howsoever they were forced to swallow those and many other injuries. And further saith, That he knew one boy near unto himself, not exceeding fourteen years of age, who killed at <hi>Kynard</hi> in one night fifteen able strong men with his Skean, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disarmed, and most of their feet in the stocks. Another not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twelve years of age killed two women and one man at the siege of <hi>Augher.</hi> A woman, Tenant to the Deponent, killed seven men<note place="margin">Cruelties in which their children were encouraged.</note> and women of her English Fellow-tenants in one morning: And it was very usual in all parts for their children to murther the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants children; and sometimes with lath Swords, heavy and well sharpned, they would venture upon men and women of riper years; cruelties not to be believed, if there were not so many Eye-witnesses of them. And the Deponent further saith, That the first three days and nights of this present Rebellion, <hi>viz. Octob.</hi> 23, 24, and 25. it was generally observed, <hi>That no Cock crew, or any Dogg was heard
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93738:256"/>
to bark,</hi> no not when the Rebels came in great multitudes unto the Protestants Houses by night to rob and murther them: and about three or four nights before the six and fifty persons were taken out of the Deponent's House and drowned, and amongst those the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents brother, Lieutenant <hi>James Maxwell,</hi> in the dark of the Moon, about one of the clock at night, <hi>a Light was observed in manner of a long Pillar to shine for a long way through the Air, and refracted upon the North Gabel of the House.</hi> It gave so great a light about an hour together, that divers of the watch read both Letters and Books of a very small Character thereby, <hi>The former</hi> the Deponent knoweth to be most true both by his own Experience, and the general observation of as many as the Deponent met with within the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Armagh. The later</hi> was seen by all those of the Deponents Family, and besides by many of his Irish guard. For some of them at that time were drunk, and could see nothing, who interpreted the same to be an immediate expression, and token of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and watchfulness over the Protestants, affirming that many times the Rebels had purposed to destroy the Deponent, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but were always hindred and interrupted, but which way themselves could not tell; But the Deponent (as is well known) made a far contrary interpretation thereof, which shortly after fell out to be the truer of the two, for (presaging thereby that bloody Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre which ensued) the Deponent (with the rest of his Family) gave themselves to Fasting and Prayer, expecting each hour that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal cutting off, which fell out very shortly after.</p>

            <p>AND further this Deponent saith, that the Rebels having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the murthered bodies of the British so long unto the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view and censure, that they began to stink, and infect the Air (which commonly being a thing very strange, would not sometimes happen until four or five weeks after the murthers commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) they usually permitted some of their bodies to be removed, and cast into Ditches, but so, as they must ever be laid with their faces downward; the reason whereof this Deponent not understanding, asked the Rebels themselves what was meant thereby, who readily answered that they so placed them to the intent they might have a prospect and sight of Hell only, and therefore, when they killed any of us, they used always these words, <hi>Anima Dewll,</hi> which is, thy soul to the Devil. And this Deponent further saith, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the moderation formerly pretended by the forenamed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Hovenden,</hi> and the many real favours done by him unto many of the British, and in particular to this Deponent, that yet he heard him both say and swear, <hi>That he wished them all damned, both body and soul, who were against them in this cause.</hi> Further, this Deponent saith, That it was usual sport with one <hi>mac Mahon,</hi> Capt. of the Castle and Town of <hi>Monaghan</hi> (as he said Mr. <hi>Mahon</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before Mr. <hi>Hugh Echline</hi> and many others) to take a wooden Prick or Broach, and thrust it up into the Fundament of an English or Scotchman, and then after drive him about the Room with a Joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool, until through extream pain he either fainted or gave content to the Spectators by some notable skips and frisks, which rare invention he offered to put in practice at the same time, and in the same place where he boasted thereof, but that the said Mr. <hi>Echline</hi> prevailed with him to omit it, as sufficiently (without any further demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) believing the excellency of the sport. And it is further of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable truth, That the said <hi>mac Mahon,</hi> and other Rebels in the Castle of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> after a great Feast there held, took an English or Welshman, and bound him naked upon the Table, at which they drank after dinner, and at every Health gave him a gash or wound (but not mortal) until his whole body became (as it were) one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued wound, and thereafter flung him out upon the Dunghill, where he died, partly of his said wounds, and partly of famine, none daring to relieve him.</p>
