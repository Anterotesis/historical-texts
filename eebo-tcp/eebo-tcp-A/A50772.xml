            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE HONOURABLE
HOUSE OF COMMONS,
now assembled in Parliament.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our reverend attention during the
length of this service, together with
a deportment suitable to the duty of
the day, and matter in hand, gave
me to conceive that your hearts were
kindly warmed by a better spirit
then yours or mine; and because you
command a farther impression of this
work, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>amfther instructed to conceive; 1. that besides the
<hi>hearing ear,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 20. 12.</note> there is (you know) to be imployed A <hi>seeing
eye, both which are the gift of the Lord; 2. that</hi>
having <hi>bought the truth</hi> as tryed gold, the filings are
not to be be lost; 3. that upon your tryall (what ever
some say) you are willing the wise should judge whether you
are taken with <hi>sounding brasse,</hi> or any thing rather then
<hi>Crown gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These reasons (besides your command) are pressing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with me to make this Sermon publique to the whole
(as well as to the representative) body of our Commonalty,
<pb facs="tcp:55282:3"/>
and now I leave it to Gods blessing and your patronage,
which I may the rather expect, because I have prayed for
the former, and the latter is implyed in your command, to which
I owe (and will yeeld) this kind of <hi>obedience</hi> though I
were sure to be made a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon your summons (Noble Senators) I appeared, knowing
that God and his Vicegerents can make use of mean Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for high imployments, whereof had I not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
I should have fled (with <hi>Jonah</hi> to my Country
goord,<note place="margin">Amos 7. 14.</note> with the hazzard of a storm; or (with <hi>Amos</hi>) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed
my function, rather then speak (so freely as I did)
in the heard-mans language, and tell this (my) mother
City, that <hi>for three</hi> great oversights, and for four, (to
say no worse nor more) God hath a few things against her,
which I complained of in this sad message.</p>
            <p>As first, though she professes to hate the works of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants,
yet there are those (if not in her bosom, yet) on her
skirts, that say they are true to Church and State, but are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi>
of another <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and by their blasphemy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
it loud enough, that either <hi>they went out from
us, or were never of us;</hi> and when the wine hath light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their braines, they make light of our <hi>Parents</hi> naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
discover it <hi>without shame</hi> or sorrow in the streets
at noon-day; where the sad <hi>spoiles and robberies</hi> of our
Nation, are made matter either of sporting Pamphlets, or
merry discourse; to meet with these, I made it my first work
to tell you in sadnesse, that <hi>the plundering and spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a people was a sad and shamefull penalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, (though she own not the doctrine of <hi>Baal)</hi> yet she
harbours such Doctors as <hi>Baalam, that peep, and mutter,</hi>
and would amuse the Land with tales from the stars, and
<hi>old-wives-fables,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 8. 19.</note> as if the Planets had met in a Counsell of
war, and (by an Arbitrary power of their own) condemned
<pb facs="tcp:55282:3"/>
our present State to a fatall desolation; to meet with these, I
was to give you Information from the Iudge of all the world
(speaking to the case, and concluding) that what was done <hi>he
did it,</hi> and did us but right in it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, though she have many golden heads, that appear
active in subtle contrivances, she hath more leaden hearts, and
(setting aside the great Councel) hath too few of those that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her case aright, and lay it to heart: to meet with these,
the last part of my message was to put home Christs counsell
to that Church of Sardis that had a foot in the grave, yet
a step there was betwixt death and us, if we timely took
her cordiall (viz.) <hi>to remember what we have heard and
received.</hi> This (if any thing) would quicken us to give the
Lord a meeting, and thereby prevent the wrath to come.</p>
            <p>These things (worthy Patriots) you have heard, and that
you might the better reform them, and know how <hi>to behave
your selves</hi> in Gods method, beginning with his <hi>own house,</hi>
you have chosen an Assembly of such Counsellors as you and
all may conside in: (To whom I should have thought it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
enough for me to have been a door-keeper) their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
conflicts and pious debates want nothing but his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
ears to make them hear well throughout the Land,
being indeed a precious reserve, (such as the Lord promises
to leave for hot service in the most conflicting times, Zeph.
3. 12. who doubtlesse will come up in the Rear, <hi>and doe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
in</hi> Ephrata.</p>
            <p>Former times have made a great noise about the <hi>Church</hi>
or place of <hi>Gods worship,</hi> but these later (with Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
upon your indeavours) may produce the power and purity
of it. I shall pray that our Dread Soveraign may live to see
and say of Gods house (as that Emperour did of Roome, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit

<pb facs="tcp:55282:4"/>
leave it adorned and paved with <hi>Whitakers, Prestons, and
Sibses, cum multis aliis</hi>—The work is <hi>great</hi> indeed, but
there is a <hi>great</hi> God that hath a great hand in it, and (as you
have been told by a good providence more then once) wil send
Auxiliaries from heaven, proportionable, at least, to the
strongest oppositions. To this purpose the God of the heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
an answer to your prayers, for the peaceable returne
of our Soveraign, which is or should be the dayly suit of
those that wish well to our publique wel-fare, and resolve
to live or die in the pursuit of this blessing; Amongst

I shall not need therefore by way of clearing a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to the words, to say much, more then what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
did in opening a Prophesy in this book, which (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<hi>This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears,</hi>

               <hi>and they

before the Text, to quicken up your attention, <hi>Who

            <p>Briefly (to come in upon them with the best speed
I may) this whole Sermon of the Prophet (beginning
at the first <hi>v.</hi> of this chapter, and ending at the 13. <hi>verse</hi>
of the next) is a Prophecy so strangely enterwoven
with threats and promises, that it appears as so much
Checker-work of Judgements and mercies; <hi>hear a little</hi>
of the one, then as much of the other, with line upon
line, judgement upon mercy, very suitable to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
which we may conceive to have been a mixed num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
for it is well known, that the <hi>sinners in Sion, and
mourners in Sion</hi> in those days were so blended and
mixt together that there needed a Divine hand to <hi>mark</hi>
the one from the other.<note place="margin">Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the former part of this chapter we have the Lord

            <p>Which (by the way) may serve as a warning caution
to that Nation or people (suppose it be ours) that have
had more of Christs company then they care for, more
of his proffered Grace then they are willing to accept

done, leaves it with the world to judge, whether there
were not all the reason in the world for what he did,
when he <hi>gave Iacob to the spoyl, and Israel to the robbers, &amp;c.</hi>
and thus we are come through the context to the words.</p>
            <p>Which being very clear and plain, I conceive it would
be time impertinently spent to give accompt what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
say of the words, or dash their judgements one

103. 13. Yet rather then fail of Reformation, he makes
them (when occasion serves) blush, &amp; bleed at once. Thus
he dealt with those that dealt falsly with him in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55282:7"/>
Covenant, he threatens to make them <hi>greatly ashamed,
verse</hi> 17. meaning he would strip them naked when hee
strikes them, their penaltie was to be aggravated with
infamie; to this purpose we finde them pointed at, as the
ignominious captives of wanton conquerers, that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
as much in their vassallage as in their ransome,<note place="margin">verse 22.</note> 
               <hi>verse
22. This is a people snared in holes, &amp;c.</hi> their friends were
either ashamed or afraid to come at them; <hi>They are for a
prey,</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>and none delivereth, for a spoil,
and none saith, Restore;</hi> an hard case, when friends shall
not own each other, when a common calamity sets them
at such a shamefull distance.</p>
            <p>Now when the Lord deals thus with a people, he
would have you know by that token, that he is angry
indeed; and expects that in their humiliations, besides
their sighes and tears, they should expresse a shame that
accompanies their punishment as well as their sin, which
they were wont in such case to acknowledge, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 24,
25. <hi>Shame hath devoured the labours of our fathers, we lie
down in our shame, and our confusion covers us;</hi> or in case
they did not speak out, their Ministers were to do it for
them: As <hi>Ezra</hi> very feelingly, <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. 6.—<hi>I blush and
am ashamed to lift up mine eyes to thee, O my God,</hi>—Why?
it follows; beside the sinne acknowledged, there was a
shame treading upon the heels of it, <hi>verse 7. We are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to
confusion of face, as it is this day:</hi> As their sinne was
shamefull, and deserved a shamefull punishment; so it
was a burning shame (he thought) that Gods Inheritance
should be rob'd, &amp; spoyl'd, cow'd, &amp; conquer'd, by his
and their enemies; and it must needs be so if we examine
the grounds,<note place="margin">Grounds.</note> and to that purpose consider first the parties,
secondly the penalty.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55282:7"/>
               <hi>spoyling,</hi> God clothes them both with shame; and if Gods
anger be the rule and measure of the shame, (as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear)
it will be hard to say for the present, which of the
two are worst to passe; for whilst Gods anger is smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and both under the fury thereof, it is not easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
whether he be more angry with the <hi>rods of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
which are his enemies, or <hi>the people of his wrath,</hi>
which may be his own; Indeed when he hath done stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
it is well known, but not before, as we finde in the
10. <hi>Chap.</hi> of this Prophesie, comparing the 5. <hi>verse</hi> with
the 12. At the first, Gods anger seems strongest towards
his people, but when he hath done with them, then he
faces about, and gives fire upon his enemies, <hi>verse</hi> 16.
So that look how far Gods anger smoaks upon a Nation
in generall, or any person in particular, so far they may
hang the head for shame, as the Lord himselfe inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
in the case of <hi>Miriam, Numb. 12. 14. If her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven
dayes? let her be shut out from the camp seven dayes.</hi> Surely
thus hath the Lord dealt with the <hi>daughter of his people</hi>
amongst us; he hath not only spit in our face, but cast the
excrements of our Nation, the robbers, &amp; spoilers, over
the surface, of our Land; In which case we may take up
the Prophets complaint, <hi>Ier. 14. 1, 2, 3. Our land mourns,
the gates thereof languish, and are black to the ground, their
Nobles were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads;</hi>
The truth is, both noble, <hi>ignoble,</hi> agents, <hi>patients,</hi> amongst
us may well be ashamed, the one for being so weak as
not to maintain their own right, the other for being so
powerfull to do the other wrong, <hi>Psal.</hi> 52. 1. That ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
did but glory in his shame, that boasted how mighty
he was to do a mischief. The oppressed may be ashamed
to deserve it so justly, the oppressour for doing it so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly;
Divine justice frowns on both: now the frowns
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55282:8"/>
of a King are the shame of the subject, whether he be a
favourite, or malefactour, especially when he is known
to have been both; In the mean time God is righteous,
and will not foul his hands with the sin of either, but
glorifies himself in the just-deserved shame of both: The

so much. In the mean time Gods anger soots them both,

Rebuke, O Lord, the multitude of spearmen, together with the

plunderer? or if he do, who can be sure to speed,
that knows he shall lose his suit &amp; breath together? since
God and their consciences give them no quarter how can

            <p>But of all spoiling penalties none like that of a Civill

his own; and if a Nation must needs bleed to death, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any do it, then they of their own bloud and bowels,
for there is much of Gods anger, and consequently much
more shame in such a misery. God was too angry with the
Israelites to let them die by the strength of battell, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55282:9"/>
therefore expresses his fury more, in consecrating their
brethrens swords to do execution upon them as so many
condemned malefactors, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 29. To have a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>This being so,<note place="margin">Vse 1. Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that the robbing &amp; spoiling of a Nation
is actively a sin, and passively a shame, this will concern

the while to take notice of this penalty, and consider
these robbers, &amp; spoilers, as they fal under a twofold cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance;
for they may be viewed as a double-faced piece;
look one way, and you see a beautifull face, on the other

was in the first heats of its love, and it was pity then,
that Christs Lambs (that fell into so hard a time) should
be so butchered, and Bonnered as they were, weltring in

pity that those Pirats, and robbers (that brought a floating
Iland by Sea, to over-power ours by land) should have
their will of us; that design was blasted, and we in pity
spared for that time. So again, in the beginning of our

thus was it with them, (and how much better of late with

mentioned and threatned, that the Prophets were as wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of speakiug, as the people of hearing Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
in this case, therefore the Lord in pity to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and displeasure to this people, gives them a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
either of praying for them, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 14. 10, 11.
or preaching to them, <hi>Hos. 4. 17. Let them alone,</hi> saith
God, <hi>(q. d.) they are joyn'd to their idols,</hi> wedded to
their wayes, and it is in vain to forbid the bains between
them and their new-chosen deities; let them take their
course, I shall reckon with them once for all. The thing
that grieved him, was their forwardnesse to strike Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
and their readinesse to break them. In the times of
their reforming Magistrates, (when Piety was in fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at Court) then they will wade through bloud to get
to the Temple, their cancel'd covenants shall be renewed,
and new covenants sealed and subscribed, yea heaven
and earth shall be called to witnesse, what fast friends
they were to God and their guides; hands, and seals,
and oaths, and all that could be said and done to make
sure work, and all this lasted very hot, (how long?) for
a <hi>slaying</hi> time, whilest the sword was at their throats,
the pestilence in their houses, the famine in the fields,
so long, and not much longer, <hi>vide Psal. 87. 34, 35. When
he slew them, they sought him, &amp;c.</hi> This provoked the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55282:19"/>
Lord exceedingly, as it doth a workman to have his work
seem to fadge, and then to fail him; or a sutor to have
his beloved accept of a ring, and break a piece of gold,
and then to deceive trust; this gauls worse then if there
had been a churlish refusall at the first profer. The first
and suddain dislike of a man is imputed to strangenesse,
but a dislike upon knowledge charges the party repudia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with unworthinesse; in this case, all kindes of revolts
are grievous, but those that are reiterated are insufferable.
So <hi>to know Gods Name,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 9. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and not to trust him,</hi> is a deserting
with a witnesse, which he takes so unkindly, that if the
whole flaming Army of his wrath can expresse the fury
of his anger and jealousie, the provoking party in this
case must look for it. It was for this that the Lord disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
so much passion by his Prophets, and tells them,
their desolation should be so great, that other Nations
should raise the wonder, and say. <hi>Wherefore hath the Lord
done thus, to this great City?</hi> Why, what had he done?
<hi>vide Ier. 22. 7. Prepared destroyers</hi> (not weaponlesse, but)
<hi>well armed,</hi> able and resolved, not onely to abridge them
of their fuell, (which we now finde to be a great strait)

            <p>Briefly, these things were written for our admonition;
so much the Prophet implies in the preface, where he
lifts up his voice to this purpose, that posterity may hear
him, <hi>verse 23. Who will hearken and hear for the time to

takes it from him, and stretches it even to our dayes, and

Say ye so? but what if God will not have it so? he
expects the work he is now about should work a <hi>careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in you, and a clearing of your selves:</hi> but the truth is,
it is with many of us, as with Bankrupts, (that had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be in the Counter then their Counting-houses) So
we, as soon enter into hell as into our hearts, to examine
what is amisse there, therefore are resolved to let it alone,
untill God come to reckon once for all: But this will be
a sad reckoning, and so we shall see and say, if we come
to be <hi>judged of the Lord, and condemned with the world</hi> at
once; it will be a terrible plea, when God shall charge it
upon any of us, that he spared our lives and liberties,
bodies, and goods on purpose that we should make use
of these forfeited mercies, for his glory, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
good, that we should runne into the gap upon these
dayes of publike humiliation, and upon our bended
knees, say as <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 8, 9, 10. that we should bring forth
that which hath escaped the fire, and give it up to his
disposing, not reserving any thing of our selves, which
he would have us deny for his sake. The misery of our
times hath taught us in our common discourse to say,
We can call nothing our own; Let us learn to speak this
in good earnest.</p>
            <p>Nay then (will some say) let him take our lives also,
we shall never live merry day more, if we come to yoak
our selves to the strict courses of covenanting, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
as good be rob'd, and spoil'd by our enemies, as
be hamper'd, and fetter'd by such precise, and religions
yoaks as are likely to be laid upon us, which neither we,
nor our forefathers were able to bear.</p>
            <p>To which I answer; first, Better so, then be suffer'd to
run wilde and loose into hell. But secondly, there is no
such matter intended, this is the cavill onely of the <hi>sons
of Beliall,</hi> that had rather take sanctuary at <hi>Rome,</hi> then in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55282:27"/>
a reformed Church: Assuredly God intends no bands
for us,<note place="margin">Amantibus facile, amenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus difficile. Ambr. in locu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> but what will be golden, and glorious, even the
easie yoak of Christ, hard to none that have their sound
mindes: It was a yoak to the young Prodigall, that his
portion should be in his fathers keeping, but by that
time it fell out of his own into the Harlots keeping, and
nothing left of it to keep him, he was brought to think,
that the yoak of his fathers servants was far better then
his miserable freedom: So doubtlesse, by that time our
Nation findes (as it is now in a fair way for it) what it
is to waste the publique stock in riotous living, and
come at length to be beneath the hopes of borrowing, &amp;
no remedy but we must hire out our selves to those that
may feed us with husks; it is likely we may be brought
at length to think our fathers house and home worth
looking after, where it is likely he will provide some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beyond the bashfull modesty of those that think
our former commons good enough if they may be got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
but if the Lord provide better, and we thrust off
our mercy with a pretended humility, it is possible we
may meet with that check which <hi>Ahaz</hi> had for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
when it was construed infidelity and impiety,

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> To conclude, if upon these considerations, we can be
perswaded to see and know the day of our visitation,<note place="margin">What if we do?</note> if
the Lord warning us by a burning shame, hath brought
us to that temper, that it appears to him and the world,
that his proceedings are laid to heart; there is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

breaking forth into tears of joy. As it was with <hi>Ioseph</hi>

that time the Lord Jesus hears this Church of ours,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55282:27"/>
(which doubtless is as dear to him, as any in the
Christian world) when he is once satisfied,<note place="margin">Esay 16. 5.</note> that we have

as much mercy, as can be expected from the Captain of

he might be as mercifull, as he is powerfull <hi>and mighty</hi>

hands from striking, and his voice from crying out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
against those that are mounted (as <hi>Saul</hi> was) with
Commissions, to make havock of the Church; These
rods of his fury shall be made passively such, by that time
they have done his work.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, he cannot hold, neither from whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
in that comfort which doth belong to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

Doubtlesse, the robbing and spoiling by the
sons of violence, shall but lay us in the way for the good
Samaritan; the poor traveller in the Gospel lost nothing
upon the matter but the Priests blessing, (as good lost as
found) by that time he was once revived and recovered,
he knew his friends from his foes, and so I hope shall
we, when the Lord Jesus hath bound up our bleeding
wounds, and shews himself good in his office to that
purpose, <hi>Esai.</hi> 61. 1, 2, 3. Then shall we be able to say,
