         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>WE do not well; this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light, ſome miſchief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the Kings houſhold:</hi>—Thus reaſoned the Lepers that firſt came to the knowledg of the <hi>Syrians</hi> flight, and <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance: And the application of their arguments hath (in a much like caſe) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced more the like reſolution.</p>
            <p>Having been a witneſs of the late diſcovery of a richer <hi>Mine,</hi> than any of thoſe which golden <hi>Peru</hi> affords, <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Health,</hi> and vigorous <hi>Strength</hi> of Mind and Body, general <hi>Plenty,</hi> and private <hi>Wealth,</hi> yea and <hi>Vertue</hi> it ſelf (inaſmuch as, for the moſt part, the conditions of the Mind fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the temper of the Body) being to be extracted thence with very little pain and coſt, and without any danger at all: I have thought my ſelf bound to give publick notice thereof to the world.</p>
            <p>And ſo much the rather, as having been a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator</hi> only, I find my ſelf debarred from that plea of modeſty, wherewith the <hi>Adventurers</hi> excuſe themſelves from the publication of this <hi>Treaſure.</hi> But who knoweth whether I have not in part been reſtrained from the credit of partnerſhip, to mine
<pb facs="tcp:65894:3"/>
own private good; to this intent, that I might be enforced to become the <hi>Publiſher</hi> of it for common benefit? Surely, methinks as in ſome regard my want of Intereſt in the buſineſs makes my teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the more validity (for who will not believe a witneſs giving in evidence to his own prejudice?) ſo it ſeems to impoſe on me a kind of neceſſity of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the world therewith, if happily by the promotion of others good, I may help to redeem mine own negligence. This good effect, I hope, may follow to mine own advantage upon this publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as on the contrary I might juſtly be afraid of multiplying damage, and doubling puniſhment upon my head, for the unjuſt concealment, as well as for the not practiſing of that, which I cannot but approve moſt excellent and beneficial to all thoſe ends, that a wiſe man and a Chriſtiam ſhould aim at. In this regard, I hope the pious and charitable Reader (and none but ſuch I invite) will help me rather with his prayers; and a fair acceptance of my hearty deſires of his good, then cenſure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe my want of abſolute conformity to that which I exhort him unto. And thus much touching my ſelf, and the reaſons that have moved me to the publication of theſe enſuing Treatiſes.</p>
            <p>The middlemoſt of which, as it was firſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in order of time, ſo it was in tranſlation; and therefore I will begin with it.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>George Herbert</hi> of bleſſed memory, having at the requeſt of a Noble Perſonage tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it into Engliſh, ſent a copy thereof; not many moneths before his death, unto ſome friends of his, who a good while before had given an attempt of regulating themſelves in matter of <hi>Diet:</hi> Which, although it was after a very imperfect manner, in
<pb facs="tcp:65894:3"/>
regard of that exact courſe therein preſcribed; yet was of great advantage to them, inaſmuch as they were enabled, through the good preparation that they had thus made, to go immediately to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of that pattern, which <hi>Cornarus</hi> had ſet them, and ſo have reaped the benefit thereof, in a larger and eminenter manner then could otherwiſe poſſibly have been imagined in ſo ſhort a ſpace.</p>
            <p>Not long after, <hi>Leſſius</hi> his book, by happy chance, or, to ſpeak better, by gracious providence of the <hi>Author of Health</hi> and all other good things, came to their hands: Whereby receiving much inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confirmation, they requeſted from me the Tranſlation of it into Engliſh. Whereupon hath enſued what you ſhall now receive.</p>
            <p>It was their deſire to have the Tranſlation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; and finding no juſt reaſon to the contrary, I have been willing to ſatisfie them therein. Maſter <hi>Herbert</hi> profeſſeth, and ſo it is indeed apparent, that he was enforced to leave out ſomething out of <hi>Cornarus:</hi> but it was not any thing appertaining to the main ſubject of the book, but chiefly certain extravagant excurſions of the Author againſt the Reformation of Religion, which in his time was newly begun. Neither his old blind zeal, nor the new and dangerous profeſſion of <hi>Leſſius,</hi> will (as we hope) breed any ſcandal or diſcredit to theſe preſent works of theirs, nor to the Imitators of them, with any diſcreet and ſincere <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> That they were both <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the one of them a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> is no prejudice to the truth of what they write concerning <hi>Temperance:</hi> In the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof we ought not only to agree with them, but to ſeek to advance and excell them, inaſmuch as the purity of our Religion exacts a more perfect en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring
<pb facs="tcp:65894:4"/>
after all manner of true vertue, than theirs can do. We have not therefore judged it meet, either to wave, or to diſguiſe the condition of the Authors, but rather to give notice thereof; eſteeming, that as Treakle is made of Vipers, ſo from this very poyſonous ſuperſtition on their parts, an excellent Cordial may be extracted, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all that truly fear God, and ſincerely deſire to ſerve him: who cannot but make a conſcience of being <hi>inferiour</hi> in the practiſe of vertue to them over whom they are ſo much <hi>ſuperiour</hi> in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Truth.</p>
            <p>The quality of the Author being thus known, the Judicious Reader will not find any cauſe of ſtumbling at his commendation of ſome perſons, or inſtitutions, nor at his uſe of ſome kind of phraſes anſwerable to his Religion. That which was of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ſcandal, hath received correction. In thoſe things which may receive a favorable conſtruction, or are not of any great moment, it hath not been thought fit to make any alteration; becauſe it could not indeed be well done without obſcuring, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt utterly diſſolving the frame of the Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The names of <hi>Hermires</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> are perhaps offenſive to weak minds, that have only heard of the late profeſſors thereof, and have not heard, or do not believe the virtue and true holineſs of thoſe in the Primitiv times. But ſince they are not brought in heree for proof of any controverſal points, but only as inſtances to confirm the virtue and power of <hi>Temperance,</hi> for the conſervation of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Health;</hi> there is ſo little cauſe of ſcandal to the moſt ſcrupulous minded that can be, as it muſt needs be interpreted deſire of quarrel and contention in any that ſhall ſound Alarm on this
<pb facs="tcp:65894:4"/>
ground. And for the ſurer binding of ſuch itching ſingers (if any ſuch ſhall be) to the Peace, I have thought it not amiſs to make uſe of the <hi>Decree</hi> of that Great <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Law,</hi> the late <hi>Vicount</hi> St. <hi>Albans,</hi> as I find it regiſtred in his Book which he entitles, <hi>The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Life and Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which, ſerving not only to bear me out in this particular, but ſummarily ratifying the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, I have thought fit to prefix <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> a general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; ſheltring my ſelf thereby, as upon a war ant under the great <hi>Seal</hi> of Learning and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come to the third Diſcourſe, which is added to the other, as a banquet of Junkets after a ſolid Feoſt. The Author thereof was an <hi>Italian</hi> of great reputation, living in the ſame age which <hi>Cornarus</hi> did. The change of the time, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of our faſhions, hath neceſſarily cauſed ſome alterations and additions in the Engliſh tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make it more Denizon like. If it give any delight, we have as much as we deſire: although there is no reaſon to exclude the hope of benefiting. For however it ſeems to play, yet in very truth it ſtrikes home, and pierceth to the quick.

            <p>Oft times lighter arguments effect, what ſtronger and more ſerious cannot do: and that is taken in good part by way of mirth, which being done in earneſt would by no means be brooked.</p>
            <p>Thus (good Reader) thou haſt as much as I, conceive needful to be known touching my ſelf, or to be ſaid touching the work. As for the Practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
<pb facs="tcp:65894:5"/>
they forbid any more to be ſpoken of them than this, That as they find all the benefits, which are promiſed by <hi>Cornarus</hi> and <hi>Leſſius,</hi> moſt true and real; ſo by Gods mercy they find no difficulty at all in the obſervation of this courſe. They are ſufficient witneſſes in their own affairs, and I hold them to be faithful: And therefore making no doubt of the truth of the latter part of their report, as I can abundantly give teſtimony of the verity of the former, I commend both to thy belief and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and ſo commit thee to Gods grace.</p>

               <hi>Out of the</hi> Hiſtory of Life and Death, <hi>written by</hi> FRANCIS Lord VERULAM, Vicount <hi>St.</hi> Albans, <hi>and Lord</hi> Chancellor <hi>of England,</hi> pag. 241.</head>
            <p>IT ſeems to be approved by experience, that a ſlender Diet, and well nigh <hi>Pythagorean;</hi> or ſuch as is anſwerable to the ſevereſt Rules of Monaſtical Life, or to the inſtitutions of <hi>Hermites,</hi> who had Neceſſity and Scarceneſs for a Rule, doth produce long life. And to this courſe appertains drinking of water, cold air, ſlender food (to wit, of roots and fruits, and poudred and pickled fleſh and fiſh, rather than that which is freſh and hot) the wearing of hair-cloth, often faſtings; frequent watchings, and ſeldom enjoyment of ſenſual pleaſures, and the like: For all theſe do diminiſh the ſpirits, and reduce them to that quantity, which ſufficeth meerly to the ſervices of life; whereby the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Radical humour and Vital heat is abated.</p>
            <p>But if the Diet be ſomewhat more choice than theſe rigours and mortifications allow, yet if it be always equal, and after one conſtant proportion, it will afford the ſame benefit: For we ſee it to be ſo in flames. A flame that is ſomewhat greater, if it be kept conſtant and without blazing, conſumes leſs of its nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:65894:6"/>
then a leſſer flame doth that is ſtirred up and down, and ſometimes augmented, and otherwhiles abated. Which was evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by the Regiment and Diet which the <hi>Venetian Cornarus</hi> uſed, who eat and drank ſo many years by one juſt weight; by which means he came to live above an hundred years, continuing an able man both in ſtrength and ſenſes,</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT REVEREND Father in Chriſt, D. RUMOLD CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIBRANT, Preſident of <hi>Poſtell,</hi> Health and Salvation.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou will marvel perhaps <hi>(Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Lord Preſident)</hi> what hath moved me being a <hi>Divine</hi> by profeſſion, and a <hi>Religious,</hi> to write concerning <hi>Health,</hi> a Subject proper to <hi>Phyſicians.</hi> But concerning this matter, I doubt not to have given ſo juſt reaſons in the <hi>Preface</hi> of this work (where I have ſet down the aim of my undertakings in this kind) as will take away all ground of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Inaſmuch as it is not my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to write like a Phyſician concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſervation of Health; that is, ſetting down a thouſand obſervations and cautions touching the <hi>quality</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:65894:12"/>
meats and drinks, and of their proper <hi>uſe</hi> according to the ſeveral <hi>ſeaſons</hi> of the year, and of timely <hi>purgation</hi> of humors and of <hi>ſleep</hi> and <hi>watching, bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,</hi> and <hi>medicines</hi> whereby the ſeveral humours are to be corrected, and whereby the <hi>Head, Stomach,</hi> and <hi>Bowels</hi> are to be comforted and ſtrengthened: I ſay, it was no part of my intent to enter upon the handling of any of theſe matters. For however it would have been no great difficulty perhaps to have gathered theſe things out of ſundry <hi>Authors,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to have with judgment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted them according to order and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: yet, that I might not ſeem to act the Part of a <hi>Phyſician</hi> rather than of a <hi>Divine,</hi> I have thought fit altogether to omit the mention of them. There was a higher matter in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and that which is proper to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines:</hi> that is, to recommend to aell (and in particular to the <hi>Religious,</hi> and thoſe who are ſtudiouſly addicted to the employments of the mind) that <hi>Holy Sobriety</hi> which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer of ſo many ſingular benefits both to the minds and bodies of men. For
<pb facs="tcp:65894:12"/>
beſides that it brings <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life,</hi> it doth wonderfully conduce to the attainment of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Contemplation, Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> and to the preſervation of <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> and other vertues; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cauſeth all theſe employments and functions to be performed with marvellous eaſe, and exceeding great conſolation. It befits not a <hi>Divine</hi> to buſie himſelf in trifles, which appertain to the body, and to engage dtlicate perſons to the further purſuit of ſuch matters; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering that bodily health may very well be preſerved without them: but a <hi>Divine</hi> ought principally to have an Eye to thoſe good things whereby we may become acceptable to God, and promote our own ſalvation. Inaſmuch then as <hi>Holy Sobriety</hi> doth bring with it the good things belonging to both parts of a man, I did not think it miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming my profeſſion, to write this fiort Treatiſe in the commendation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and withal to ſhew and declare, by what way and means we might come to the juſt <hi>ſcantling</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65894:13"/>
I have annexed a Treatiſe tending to the ſame purpoſe, of a <hi>Venetian</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, <hi>Lodowick Cornaro,</hi> a man of great eminency, and of a ſharp judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: who having learned by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of many years the great vertue and power that is in <hi>Sobriety,</hi> did at laſt by writing notably make declaration thereof.</p>
            <p>Both theſe Treatiſes <hi>(my Reverend Lord)</hi> I have thought fit to dedicate unto your name, and to ſend forth into the world under your patronage. For to whom can a Treatiſe of <hi>Sobriety</hi> be more fitly dedicated, than to ſuch a one as hath ſo ſtoutly and conſtantly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sobriety,</hi> as by the help thereof to preſerve himſelf vigorous and cheerful unto near upon Seventy years of his age? You are he that can ſit a hungry in the midſt of daily feaſts, enjoyned to be made unto the <hi>Gentry</hi> that paſs by ſolitary <hi>Campinia:</hi> and whileſt others fill their bellies and ſatisfie their appetites, you contract both into narrow bounds and limits. Beſides this, there are ſundry other cauſes, which deſerve this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of my venerable reſpect towards
<pb facs="tcp:65894:13"/>
your Lordſhip; to wit, that zeal where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you do ſo induſtriouſly promote the cauſe of your <hi>Religion,</hi> which is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly beneficial to the whole <hi>Church,</hi> and to our <hi>Belgia:</hi> and together here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with that ſingular wiſdom of yours in <hi>Government,</hi> through means whereof you have for ſo many years ſpace ſafely conſerved your noble <hi>Hoſpital</hi> in that deſert where it ſtands, in the midſt of many tumults of wars, and ſhocks of armies, in great licentiouſneſs of milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcipline, and almoſt daily inrodes of both ſides unto it: by means whereof you have further not only recovered it out of thoſe great debts, wherewith it was formerly burdened, but have more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over adorned it with beautiful ſtructures, and a high Tower, for the ſetling of a <hi>Monaſtery</hi> therein. And that I may paſs over your other vertues, whereof <hi>Sobriety the mother of all vertues,</hi> is the true cauſe in you, this dedication ſeems due to you in particular, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that ancient friendſhip which for above forty years ſpace I have had with your brother, <hi>Father George Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librant,</hi> a learned man, and of noted
<pb facs="tcp:65894:14"/>
holineſs, exceedingly addicted to ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, prayer, mortification of the fleſh, and zeal touching the ſoul: by whoſe example and wholeſome admonitions, many Centuries of excellent young men have in ſundry places given themſelves unto <hi>holy Religion.</hi> The conjunction that we likewiſe have with your other brother, <hi>John Colibrant,</hi> a man of great uprightneſs, whoſe every where approved integrity far excells rich patrimonies, makes this work belong to you. I could relate many other things appertaining to your own and your friends commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but I make ſpare of them, that I may not offend your modeſty, which doth not willingly hear ſuch matters.</p>
            <p>Receive therefore <hi>(Right Reverend Lord)</hi> this ſmall gift, a teſtimony of our affection towards you and yours: and be not wanting to the recommendation of that excellency of <hi>holy Sobriety</hi> which you have made proof of in your ſelf, and we make declaration of in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, to all men, but eſpecially to <hi>Gods ſervants,</hi> that they may by this means come to ſerve God more perfectly and
<pb facs="tcp:65894:14"/>
ſweetly in this life, and obtain greater glory in heaven.</p>
            <p>Now I beſeech the <hi>Divine Goodneſs</hi> to proſper all your holy deſigns to its own glory, and the ſalvation of men; and after that you ſhall have been adorned with all manner of vertue, to renew your long and happy <hi>Old age</hi> with the bleſſed <hi>Youth</hi> of <hi>Eternity.</hi>

                  <p>The occaſion and ſcope of this Work.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. MAny Authors have written largely and very learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touching the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Health: but they charge men with ſo many rules, and exact ſo much obſervation and caution about the quality and quantity of meats and drinks; about air, ſleep, exerciſe, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the year, purgations, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting, and the like; and over and above preſcribe ſuch a number of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65894:19"/>
Compound, Opiate, and other kinds of exquiſite remedies, as they bring men into a labyrinth of care in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and unto perfect ſlavery in the endeavoring to perform what they do in this matter enjoyn.</p>
               <p>And when all is done, the iſſue proves commonly much ſhort, oft-times clean contrary to that which was expected; in regard perhaps that ſome ſmaller matter in appearance, yet wherein the chief of the buſineſs indeed lay, was not obſerved and practiſed as it ought. For men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth will have their own minds, eat every thing that likes them, and to their fill: they will ſhape their diet according to the ordinary uſage of the world, and give in every thing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to their ſenſuality and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. Whereby it comes to paſs, that all their other care and diligence touching theſe phyſical precepts and obſervations, comes in the end to little or nothing at all for matter of benefit.</p>
               <p>Hereupon moſt men bidding adieu to Phyſicians counſels and injunctions,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65894:19"/>
leave all to nature and ſucceſs. They hold it, according to the common <note n="*" place="margin">Qui me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicè vivit, miſerè vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</note> Proverb, <hi>A miſerable life to live after the Phyſicians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript;</hi> a great part of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs to be limited in a mans diet, ſo that he may not eat freely, and to the full, of what he hath a mind unto: To be kept conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually as it were in awe, ſo that he dare not content his appetite, nor give ſatisfaction to his belly, they fancy to themſelves to be the moſt wretched condition of life that may be. Upon this ground they fall on eating twice or thrice a day, without ſtint or reſtraint in meaſure or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of food, but as their appetites lead them on.</p>
               <p>Having thus filled their bodies, they inſtantly apply themſelves ſome good ſpace to their buſineſs, exerciſing their minds, and all the faculties thereof in the conſideration and purſuit of weighty and important matters: Nor can they ever be perſwaded to purge at ſitting ſeaſons, or before the diſeaſe oppreſs them, imagining all to be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65894:20"/>
well with them, as long as they feel nothing plainly to the contrary. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it comes to paſs, that their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in tract of time grow repleniſhed with crude and ill humors, which are not only increaſed by continuance, but become putrified, and of a malignant temper; ſo that upon every light oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, either of heat, or cold, or weather, or windes, or extraordinary labor, or any other inconvenience or exceſs, they are inflamed, and break out into mortal ſickneſſes and diſeaſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I my ſelf have obſerved many excellent men on this ground only ſnatched away by death in the prime of their age; who undoubtedly, had they uſed the right courſe of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their health, might have many years prolonged their lives, and by their learning and worthy deeds have notably benefited the world, and thereby (it may be) added to their own glory in heaven. There are queſtionleſs likewiſe a great many of all kinds of perſons, both of thoſe that enter into religious Orders, and of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65894:20"/>
thoſe that live at large in the world, who through ignorance of this matter enjoy little health, and through the want thereof remain much hindered in their ſtudies, and in the performance of thoſe offices and functions of the mind, which they moſt deſire, and are bound to do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Having therefore of a long time and in ſundry places taken this matter into diligent conſideration, I thought with my ſelf, that it would prove a work of no ſmall benefit, to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the world of that way and means for preſervation of health, whereby. I my ſelf have for many years paſt been kept not only ſound in body, but expedite to all operations and exerciſes of the mind: although I have all this ſpace labored under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corporal inconveniences, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I entered into this courſe, was ſo far gone, as by the judgment of very skilful Phyſicians I was not like to have lived above two years at the moſt. The ſame good effects that it wrought in me, have divers of our Society and ſundry others abroad
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65894:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made happy proof of, maintaining themſelves in conſtant health and chearfulneſs by this means; being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very ſelf-ſame, which was of old practiſed by Holy men and ſage Philoſophers. And it conſiſts chiefly in a <hi>right Ordering of the diet, and in a certain Moderation of our meat and drink:</hi> ſuch a moderation I mean, as is no way troubleſom, not breeding weakneſs or diſtemper; but on the contrary very eaſie to be undergone, and ſuch as brings ſtrength and vigor both in Mind and Body.</p>
               <p>Being very intent on theſe matters, there was brought unto me by a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon a little Treatiſe concerning the benefits of a Sober Life, written in Italian by <hi>Lodowick Cornaro,</hi> a noble Gentleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> of great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Honorable, Rich in eſtate, and a married man: In which book this courſe is marvellouſly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all men, and confirmed by much and certain experience. I was much taken with the reading thereof, and held it very well worth the tranſlating into Latin, to make it common to all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65894:21"/>
men; and to annex it to this explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Treatiſe of mine own.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <note place="margin">That this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is not un befitting a Divine.</note>I would not have any  man to think ſtrange of the matter, that I being a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Divine ſhould take upon me to write of this ſubject. For beſides that I have long ago made ſome good progreſs in the Theory of Phyſick, this matter is no way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepant to the profeſſion of a Divine; in regard that it is the divine vertue of Temperance, which is chiefly in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to wit, Wherein it conſiſts; what is the right way to attain it, and what may be the true meaſure of its object; how this meaſure may be found: and laſtly, what benefits will ariſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. The ſearch then and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this buſineſs is not altogether Phyſical, but in great part appertains to Divinity and moral Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>And over and above, the end and ſcope which I aim at herein, is indeed moſt befitting a Divine. For that which I principally intend, is to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh religious perſons, and thoſe who give themſelves to piety, with ſuch a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65894:22"/>
way and manner of living, as they may with more eaſe, chearfulneſs, and fervency apply themſelves to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervice of the Great God, and our Saviour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For verily it is ſcarce to be believed, with how great alacrity, and with what abundance of inward conſolations, thoſe men who addict themſelves to ſobriety, may (if ſo be they have any reaſonable underſtanding in divine myſteries) attend Divine Service, and the hearing of Gods Word, their private devotions and meditations, and in ſum all manner of ſpiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. And this indeed was my principal aim in the writing of this Tractate; this my chiefeſt wiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. As for the benefit and help that it affords to Students of good learning, and to all thoſe whoſe imployments conſiſt in affairs and buſineſſes apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the mind and underſtanding, I ſay nothing at preſent; purpoſing hereafter to ſpeak more at large there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Whether you take the matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or the end, this Treatiſe can no way misbeſeem a Divine. And ſo, good

Reader, thou haſt an account of my reaſons in undertaking this buſineſs.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>What is meant by a Sober life: and what is the fit meaſure of meat and drink:</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO come then to the thing it ſelf, I will firſt ſet down, What we mean by a Sober life: Secondly, By what way and means we may come to the determination of the juſt meaſure that is to be obſerved in our life and diet: And thirdly, What the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and benefits thereof be.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Touching the firſt point then, We call that a <hi>Sober life</hi> or <hi>diet,</hi> which ſets ſtint not only in drink, but alſo in meat: ſo that a man muſt neither eat nor drink any more than the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his body allows, with reference to the ſervices of his mind. And this ſelf-ſame we term an <hi>orderly, regulate,</hi> and <hi>temperate life</hi> or <hi>diet;</hi> for all theſe phraſes and names we ſhall make uſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65894:23"/>
of, intending by them all one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>The matter than about which this Diet or Temperance is mainly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, is Meat and Driuk, in which a conſtant meaſure is to be kept. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it doth likewiſe reach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the care and ordering of all other things; ſuch as are, immoderate heat and cold, overmuch labor, and the like; through the exceſs whereof there grows any inconvenience in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health, or diſturbance in the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mind.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <note place="margin">The Meaſure is different, according to the diverſity of conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ages.</note>Now this meaſure is not the ſame in reſpect of  the quantity in all ſorts of people, but very different according to the diverſity of complexions in ſundry perſons, and of youth and ſtrength in the ſelf-ſame body. For one kind of proportion belongs to Youth, when it is in its flower; another to Conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; a third to Old age: The Sickly and the Whole have likewiſe their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral meaſures; as alſo the Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and the Cholerick: In regard that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65894:23"/>
in theſe ſeveral conſtitutions the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and temper of the ſtomach is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different. Now the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of the food ought to be exactly proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as much as poſſibly may be, to the quality and condition of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. <note place="margin">What is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones due meaſure.</note>And that Meaſure  is exactly proportionable, which the ſtomach hath ſuch power and maſtery over, as it can perfectly concoct and digeſt in the midſt of any employments either of mind or body, and which withal ſufficeth to the due nouriſhment of the body.</p>
               <p>I ſay, <hi>In the midſt of any employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mind or body,</hi> &amp;c. In regard that a greater meaſure is requiſite to him that is occupied in bodily labor, and continually exerciſing of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the body, than to him that is altogether in ſtudies, meditation, prayer, or other like works and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of the mind: Inaſmuch as the exerciſes and imployments of the mind do very much hinder and diſturb the concoction: and that, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in calling up the whole force of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65894:24"/>
the ſoul, they do as it were abate and ſuſpend the power and actions of the inferior faculties, as experience ſhews; for when we are very intent on ſtudy or prayers, we neither hear clock, nor take notice of any thing that comes before our eyes or other ſenſes: or elſe becauſe they do withdraw not only the animal, but the vital and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſpirits themſelves from their proper ſervices. And hence it comes, that for the moſt part twice as little food ſerves their turn, who are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually imployed in ſtudy and affairs of the mind, as is neceſſary for them that apply themſelves to bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes; although equal age and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per might otherwiſe perhaps require an equality in both their diets.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The difficulty then lies in finding out this meaſure. Which S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> of old well obſerved, in his fourth Book againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> and in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter writing thus, <hi>Now when we come to the putting in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ure of that neceſſary pleaſure, with which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh our bodies, who is able to declare in words, how it ſuffers us not to know
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65894:24"/>
the meaſure of neceſſity? but if there be any of thoſe things that yield delight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, it by their means ſteals a way, and hides, and leaps over the bounds and limits of procuring health; whileſt we cannot think that to be ſufficient, which is indeed ſufficient, being willingly led on by the provocation thereof, fancying our ſelves to be about the buſineſs of Health, when indeed we are about the ſervice of Pleaſure: ſo that Luſt knows not where Neceſſity ends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe words he refers the ground of this difficulty to Pleaſure, which blinds us that we cannot diſcern when we are come to the due meaſure we ought to hold, but hides the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks thereof, to draw us paſt them, and perſwades us that we do but make proviſion for Health, when in very truth we canvaſs for Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Concerning the diſcovery of this meaſure therefore are we to treat in the ſecond place, producing Rules, whereby it may be clearly and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly found out.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65894:25"/>
8. <note place="margin">Whether Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, or thoſe that live in Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about this meaſure.</note>But here perhaps ſome will object, That in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries  and other regular Societies, ſuch as are Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no man need trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf touching this meaſure, inaſmuch as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſtatutes of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, or the diſcreet orders of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors have ſet down the juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that is to be held, appointing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral ſeaſons of the year ſuch and ſuch portions of fleſh, egges, fiſh, roots, rice, butter, cheeſe, fruits, and broths; and ſuch quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of wine and bear, as are fit; all of them being proportioned out by weight and meaſure: ſo that we may boldly (ſay they) take our allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in theſe things without danger of exceſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe men will by no means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the catarrhs, coughs, head-aches, pains of the ſtomach, fevers, and other the like infirmities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into they often fall, ſhould proceed from the exceſs of their food; but lay
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65894:25"/>
the fault upon winds, ill airs, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, too much pains-taking, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like outward cauſes. But queſtionleſs they are deceived in this opinion; inaſmuch as it cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be, that any one certain meaſure ſhould be found proportionable to ſo many different ſorts of complexions and ſtomachs, as uſe to be in ſuch kind of Societies: ſo that what is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to a young and ſtrong body, is more than twice or thrice too much for an old or infirm perſon: as <hi>Thomas,</hi> following <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> doth well prove, 2. 2. <hi>q. 141. art.</hi> 6. and is indeed of it ſelf without proof manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe allowances then both for quantity and variety, are not ſet out by Founders and Superiors, as juſt meaſures for every man, but with the largeſt for all in general; to the intent that the ſtrongeſt, and they who need moſt, might have enough, and the reſt might take of that which beſt liked them, (yet always keeping within thoſe limits which reaſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes,) and in thoſe things which they forbore, might have opportunity
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65894:26"/>
to exerciſe their vertue. For it is no great glory to ſhew temperance in the abſence of temptations: but to keep hunger on foot at a banquet, and to reſtrain the greedineſs of the belly in the midſt of provoking dainties; why, this is a maſtery indeed, eſpecially to Novices, and ſuch as have not gotten the victory over their appetites. It is a great maſtery, I ſay, and therefore undoubtedly of no ſmall price with God. To the intent therefore that the exerciſe of this vertue, and the benefit of the reward that by Gods mercy belongs to it, might not be wanting to them that ſeek and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor the increaſing of their reward hereafter, the Founders and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of religious Societies have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps allotted a larger meaſure, and more variety of food, than is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or they would have every one to make uſe of.</p>
               <p>Touching this matter we have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pertinent example in the life of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomius,</hi> faithfully written 1200. years ago, as it is extant in <hi>Surius, 14. Maii.</hi> Where it is mentioned, that this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomius</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65894:26"/>
in his Monaſteries, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe that younger perſons lived in, would have (beſide bread and ſalt) ſome ſod or roſt meat ſet before all the Monks, to the intent that, albeit the moſt of them were ſo abſtemious, that they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only with bread and ſalt, or ſome <note n="*" place="margin">Crudo aliquo fructu.</note> green fruit, yet they might have it in their free choice and liberty, either to eat thereof, or to forbear: And ſo, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for mortification ſake, or the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fitting of themſelves for devotion, they ſhould abſtain, they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a greater vertue; ſince it is a more difficult thing to abſtain, when meat is ſet before us, and by its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence doth provoke the appetite, than when it is removed out of our ſight. More to this purpoſe may be read in <hi>Jacob. de Paz. Tom. 2. l. 2. de Mortif. ext. hom. cap.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Nor will it any thing at all abate from the probability of this opinion, to ſay that in this allowance of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and abundance there was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect intention of giving ſome kind of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65894:27"/>
refreſhment to Nature: Inaſmuch as the refreſhment, which the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Founders of theſe Societies meant, conſiſteth not in this, that the true and right meaſure of temperance ſhould at any time be notably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; but that there might be now and then an opportunity of delight miniſtred, through the different and grateful ſavor of ſundry kinds of meats: yet ſo always, as this delight ſhould be kept bounded within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of temperance, and the appetite never fully ſatisfied. For whatſoever exceeds this meaſure, is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vice, be it upon what occaſion it will, whether of Marriage, Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Churches, or any other ſolemn Feaſts whatſoever. Now that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies exceſs, which proves more in quantity, than the ſtomach can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly digeſt without leaving any cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities at all behind.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Seven Rules for the finding out of the right Meaſure.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="9">9. NOw to find out this right Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, we ſhall make uſe of theſe Rules and obſervations follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Rule</hi> is, If thou doſt uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take ſo much food at meals, as thou art thereby made unfit for the duties and offices belonging to the Mind, ſuch as are Prayer, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Studies of learning, and the like; it is then evident, that thou doſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the meaſure which thou oughteſt to hold: For both Nature and Reaſon exact, that the Vegetative part in a man (that is, that wherein the growth and conſervation of the body conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) ſhould be ſo ordered and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that there ſhould ariſe no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or damage thereby to the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and Reaſonable parts of the ſoul; in as much as the Vegetative part is ordained to the ſervice of theſe other
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65894:28"/>
and therefore ought to be of further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and help, and no ways of hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance unto them in their ſeveral functions and operations.</p>
               <p>Whenever therefore there is ſo much food taken in upon account of the Vegetative part, as proves of any remarkable offence or hinderance to the operations of the ſuperior facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to wit, of the Senſes, the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, the Underſtanding, or the Memory; then it is a ſign, that the fitting meaſure in this kind is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now this impediment and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence proceeds from the abundance of vapors, that are chiefly ſent up into the head out of the ſtomach: which, as experience demonſtrates, would be but ſparingly ſent up, if this meaſure were not exceeded.</p>
               <p>For they who follow a ſober courſe of life, are as apt and ready to all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and imployments of the mind after their meals, as before: as our Author, whom we have annexed to this preſent Treatiſe, doth oft times teſtifie; and my ſelf, and divers others of our Society do daily make proof of.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65894:28"/>
Nay, thoſe holy Fathers of old, who eat only once a day, did it ſo ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they were no whit at all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hindered in their performances of the functions belonging to the mind: How much more eaſily than may it be effected by them, who divide the quantity, and twice a day uſe mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate refection!</p>
               <p n="10">10. I ſaid before, that thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors and fumes, which cloud and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow the clearneſs of the Brain, <hi>are chiefly cauſed by the meat taken down into the stomach: Chiefly,</hi> I ſay, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that however this be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, yet it is not the only cauſe. For theſe vapors proceed not only from the meat immediately before taken, which begins to boil and concoct; but alſo from the abundance of blood and other humors, which are in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Spleen, and the Veins: which together with the meat fall on ſeeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were, and ſend up great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of theſe kind of ſooty fumes.</p>
               <p>But a Sober diet doth by little and little diminiſh this <note n="*" place="margin">Plethoram.</note> abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of humors, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65894:29"/>
this <note n="*" place="margin">Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miam.</note> ill moiſture, and reduceth them to their due proportions both in quantity and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: ſo that they do not more upon eating ſend up theſe kind of fumes. For when Nature doth perfectly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern all the humors of the body by the miniſtery of the vegetative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, ſhe doth ſo order and diſpenſe all things, as neither any diſeaſes ariſe in the body, nor any impediment follows to the ſuperior offices and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Nor matters it at all, that many men addicted to ſobriety are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſleep a while after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: inaſmuch as they do it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that their vigor and the ſpirits, which have been ſpent and waſted by any labor, either of mind or body, might be refreſhed and reſtored by the means of ſleep: for ſleep ſerves to both theſe ends. And then beſides, that ſleep of theirs is very ſhort, and ſuch as they could eaſily forbear, but when by wearineſs and cuſtom they are inclined thereunto. Some of them indeed ſleep a good while, but thoſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65894:29"/>
uſe to abate as much of their nights reſt, as they take out thus in the day, dividing as it were into two parts the reſt and ſleep that is due to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. But indeed generally it is more agreeable to health, to forbear all ſleep after meat at noon, according to the commonly received opinion of Phyſicians.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The ſecond <hi>Rule</hi> is, If ſo be thou take ſo much meat and drink, as thou afterwards findeſt a certain kind of dulneſs, heavineſs, and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wearineſs, whereas before thou waſt quick and lightſome; it is a ſign that thou haſt exceeded the fitting meaſure: except this come to paſs through preſent ſickneſs, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of ſome former diſeaſe. For meat and drink ought to refreſh the ſtrength and powers of the body, and to make them more chearful, and no ways to burden or oppreſs them.</p>
               <p>They therefore who find their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to be ſuch, as they feel op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion after their meals, ought to make abatement of their daily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, having firſt uſed good and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65894:30"/>
diligent conſideration, whether this inconvenience ariſe from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their meat, or of their drink, or of both together: and when they have found out where the error lies, it is by degrees to be amended, till the matter be brought to that paſs, that there be no more feeling of any ſuch inconvenience.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Many there be, who are much deceived in this caſe; who although they eat and drink liberally, and uſe nouriſhing meats, yet nevertheleſs complain of continual weakneſs and faintneſs; and that, they perſwade themſelves, comes from the want of nouriſhment and ſpirits: whereupon they ſeek out meats of much nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and provide breakfaſts, betimes in the morning, leſt Nature, ſhould faint for want of its due ſuſtenance.</p>
               <p>But, as I ſaid, they are miſerably beguiled in this opinion, and do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by add a ſurcharge to their bodies, which are in truth already overbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with ill juice and moiſture. For this weakneſs which they complain of proceeds not from defect of nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65894:30"/>
but from the abundance of ill humors; as both the conſtitution of their bodies, and the ſwelling of their bellies in particular do evidently ſhew. Now theſe ill humors do cloy up the muſcles and the nerves, through which the ſpirits have their courſe and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: whereby it comes to paſs, that the animal ſpirits (from which, as from the moſt general and immediate inſtrument of the ſoul, all the vigor of the body in ſenſe and motion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived) cannot freely take their courſe nor govern and order the body <gap reason="illegible: damage" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> they ought. And hence comes that weakneſs and lumpiſhneſs of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that dulneſs of the ſenſes, the animal ſpirits being as it were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in their paſſage by this exceſs of humors.</p>
               <p>Daily experience ſhews this to be true in divers bodies abounding, with ill humors and vicious moiſtures, which in the morning are faint and dull, through the ſuperfluities of moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture remaining in them upon their former nights ſupper &amp; ſleep: But when theſe moiſtures are conſumed by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65894:31"/>
and <note n="*" place="margin">Apophleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſmos.</note> the purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the head, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more chearful and active; and this vigor goes on ſtill increaſing till night come, albeit they take little or nothing at all at noon. But in caſe they eat, whileſt theſe moiſtures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unconcocted in the body, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be in any great quantity or moiſt food, the indiſpoſition is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and they preſently return to their former miſery.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if a man deſire to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways quick, apt, and ready to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and to every other uſe of his ſenſes, theſe humors are to be leſſened by abatement of diet, ſo that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may have their free paſſage through all parts of the body, and the mind may find them always ready to every motion and ſervice in the body.</p>
               <p n="13">13. the third <hi>Rule</hi> is, We muſt not paſs immediately from a diſordered kind of life to a ſtrict and preciſe courſe: but it is to be done by little and little, by ſmall abatements ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting from that exceſſive quantity,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65894:31"/>
whereunto we have been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until at laſt we come to that juſt meaſure, which doth not at all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the body, nor offend and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the operations of the mind. This is a common Tenet amongſt Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. For all ſudden changes, if they be any thing remarkable, do prejudice Nature; in regard that Cuſtom gets almoſt the force and quality of Nature it ſelf: Wherefore it cannot but be very dangerous to be driven off forcibly from that, which a man hath been long uſed unto, and to be put upon the contrary. For as that which is againſt Nature, ſo likewiſe that which is againſt long and inveterate Cuſtom, is very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to be undergone, whileſt the ſtrength and power of Cuſtom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains on foot. We muſt therefore break off old uſages by degrees, and not all at once; going backward ſtep by ſtep, as we grew on towards them: and ſo the alteration being not much perceived in the progreſs, will be leſs difficult in performance.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The fourth <hi>Rule</hi> is, That albeit
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65894:32"/>
there cannot be any one determinate quantity ſet for all, in reſpect of the great difference of ages, ſtrength, and other diſpoſitions in men; as alſo in reſpect of the great diverſity in the nature and quality of ſeveral kinds of food: yet notwithſtanding generally for them who are ſtept in years, and for thoſe who are of weak complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it ſeems twelve, thirteen, or fourteen ounces of food a day ſhould be enough; accounting into this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion bread, fleſh, egges, and all other kind of victuals: And as many, or but a few more ounces of drink would ſuffice.</p>
               <p>This is to be underſtood of thoſe, who uſe but little exerciſe of body, and are altogether addicted to ſtudy, and other offices and imployments of the mind. Verily <hi>Lodowick Cornaro,</hi> whoſe Treatiſe touching a Sober life we have hereunto annexed, approves greatly this meaſure, having ſtinted himſelf thereat, when he was thirty ſix years old, and kept it conſtantly as long as he lived, and that was indeed very long, and with perfect health.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:65894:32"/>
The holy Fathers likewiſe that lived in the deſerts, albeit they fed only upon bread, and drank nothing but water, exceeded not this proportion, eſtabliſhing it as it were by Law eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in their Monaſteries: For ſo <hi>Caſſianus</hi> writes in his ſecond Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Abbat <hi>Moyſes, chap.</hi> 19. Where Abbat <hi>Moyſes</hi> being demanded what was the beſt meaſure of temperance, anſwered on this wiſe: <hi>We know there hath oft times much diſcourſe been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our Anceſtors touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For examining the ſeveral man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Abſtinence uſed by divers, to wit, of thoſe who paſſed their lives only with pulſe, or altogether with herbs, or fruits, they did prefer before them all the Refection by Bread alone. The moſt equal meaſure whereof they did conclude to be in</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In duobus paximaciis.</note> 
                  <hi>two biskets; which ſmall cakes it is very certain were ſcarce a pound weight.</hi> So that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears they did count the juſt allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for a day to be twelve ounces of bread, which might generally ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for all. For the pound weight amongſt the Ancients was not of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65894:33"/>
ounces, as our pound weight now is, but only of twelve ounces.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Some do think, that each of theſe cakes ſhould be a pound weight: and ſo they underſtand thoſe words of Abbat <hi>Moyſes, Which ſmall cakes,</hi> that is, each of them ſeverally, and not both joyntly. But that it cannot be ſo underſtood, will be very plain to them that well conſider the matter. For firſt, his intention was to expreſs, how much the whole allowance, which was in two ſeveral cakes, did weigh, and not what each cake weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Moreover, that meaſure of bread was, as Abbat <hi>Moyſes</hi> teacheth, very ſcant, and difficult to be obſerved, <hi>chap.</hi> 21. Now if the two cakes had been two pounds, that would not have been a ſcant allowance for a day, nor hard to be kept, eſpecially by old men. For who is there, that may not be contented with ſuch a quantity of bread, or can be ſaid after the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof to have eaten but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately and ſparingly? Nay verily, even amongſt us of theſe colder cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, it would be thought very
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65894:33"/>
ſtrange, if any of thoſe whom we call Religious, ſhould at one meal eat up two pound weight of bread: undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſuch a one could not be eſteemed (in regard of the quantity) abſtinent or ſober, but rather a great feeder and devourer.</p>
               <p>Moreover, theſe two cakes did not ſo allay hunger, but that there were ſome, who choſe rather to faſt two days together, than every day to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelves with others: Their reaſon, as Abbat <hi>Moyſes</hi> reports, <hi>chap.</hi> 24. (though he much diſallow it) was, that by this double portion they might be able fully to content and ſatisfie their appetite. Now what man (I pray) devoted to the exerciſes of the mind is there, that can at one repaſt eat up four pounds, or forty eight ounces of dry bread?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as Abbat <hi>Moyſes</hi> recounts in the 11 <hi>chap..</hi> Abbat <hi>Serapion</hi> being a little boy, after he had at meals with others at the ninth hour of the day eaten his two cakes, was ſtill a hungry; whereupon he was wont to ſteal a third bisket, which he uſed to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65894:34"/>
eat in ſecret. Now what child can eat three pounds of bread at once? It ſeems therefore very certain, that theſe bisket cakes were but ſix ounces a piece, and two of them together weighed only a pound.</p>
               <p>Now if theſe holy Fathers upon long experience found twelve ounces of dry bread, without any other ſort of <note n="*" place="margin">Abſque ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo obſonio.</note> food, to be enough, and with this diet conſerved themſelves healthful and ſound in all their members and ſenſes, even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit age: How much more than may ſix, ſeven, or eight ounces of bread ſuffice, together with ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ounces of other choiſe victuals, which yield double the neutriment that dry bread doth! conſidering withal that inſtead of water (which ſerved their turn, and of it ſelf nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth not at all) we now drink bear or wine, which yield much nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Laſt of all, experience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates, that there are many, who live with far leſs quantity of meat.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65894:34"/>
                  <note place="margin">That this meaſure may ſuffice (ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily) even thoſe that are healthy and ſtrong.</note>Now although our ſpeech here be chiefly touching  weak perſons, and thoſe that are declining in years; yet I hold it very probable, that the aforeſaid meaſure is large enough for the moſt part, even for thoſe that are in health, and ſtrong, and in the flower of their age, if they be ſuch as give themſelves to prayer, ſtudy; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like operations and exerciſes of the mind. And this may be made good by infinite examples of holy men, who from fifteen, ſixteen, or twenty years old, have kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this ſtint, or it may be leſs; albeit they eat nothing but bread, herbs, or pulſe, nor uſed other drink than water: and yet nevertheleſs they lived exceeding long and healthfully, in the height of labors and afflictions both of their minds and bodies: as is plain to be ſeen in many, whoſe lives are extant in hiſtory; ſome whereof, we will ſet down, <hi>Num.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, I incline to hold this meaſure ſufficient, in regard it was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65894:35"/>
commonly eſtabliſhed as it were by Law in ſundry Monaſteris, as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſufficient as well for the younger, as for the elder ſort of people. So that thoſe ancient Fathers, who had the largeſt experience of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and beſt knew what was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in this kind for Nature, judged that this meaſure might ordinarily ſuffice to all ages. Of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is our Author, and confirms it by his own example: for he began to keep this ſtint at thirty ſix years old.</p>
               <p>Now whereas ſome may here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that <note place="margin">Panada</note> 
                  <hi>Panada,</hi> although it weigh ſeven, or eight, or nine ounces the meſs, yet the water or broth being deducted, there remains not in truth above three or four oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of bread, or other ſolid ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients.</p>
               <p>The Solution is eaſie. For when <note n="*" place="margin">Eſculenta &amp; potulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</note> meats and drinks are mingled (as in <hi>Panada,</hi> and other ſuch like <note n="*" place="margin">Meneſtris.</note> ſuppings) they are to be ſeverally weighed and reduced to the making
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65894:35"/>
up of the juſt meaſure of that kind, to which they properly belong. And ſo drinking liquors are to be put on the account of drink, and bread, and other ingredients on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of meat. But it is not our intent to proſecute theſe ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: it is enough to have made a general remonſtrance, that this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which we have put, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The fifth <hi>Rule</hi> is, That as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quality of the food, there is no great care to be had, if ſo be a man be of a healthful conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and find that ſuch kind of meat as he makes choice of, doth not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend nor harm him. For almoſt all ſorts of meats that are commonly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, do well agree with good and healthful conſtitutions, if ſo be the right quantity and meaſure be kept: So that queſtionleſs a man may live long and healthfully on bread only, with milk, butter, cheeſe, and beer; eſpecially if he have from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood been uſed unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65894:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <note place="margin">Hurtful meats are to be avoided.</note>But from all thoſe ſorts  of food, whereby a man finds prejudice, he muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain, albeit they reliſh his taſte ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo well: at leaſt he may not uſe them in any quantity. Of this ſort are for the moſt part fat meats, which make looſe the ſtomach, and weaken the aſtrictive and retentive faculty thereof, ſo as the other ſorts of meat are much hindered in their concoction, and are indeed cauſed to ſlip out of the ſtomach undigeſted, and half raw as it were. Beſides, theſe fat meats do ſend up ſtore of fumes into the head; whereupon follow <note n="*" place="margin">Nebula.</note> clowdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in the brain, coughs, <note n="*" place="margin">Aſthmata.</note> wheazings, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the lungs. Laſt of all, they themſelves, except they be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well concocted (to which intent both a good ſtomach, and length of time is required) turn into evil hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and to the matter of fevers; inaſmuch as they are converted part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into cholerick, and partly into phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick juices and moiſtures. Students therefore are to uſe theſe kind of meats
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65894:36"/>
but ſparingly, &amp; with a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of bread taken together with them: For ſo the damage which they bring may be in great part avoided.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Of the ſame nature likewiſe (as experience ſhews) are all thoſe kind of meats, which in the head breed cataracts, clouds, dizzineſſes, diſtillations, and coughs; and in the ſtomach breed crudities, inflations, gripings, gnawings, frettings, and the like; and in a word, all thoſe which any way breed damage to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Body, or impediment to the functions of the Mind. For how ſenſleſs a thing is it, to buy the vile and fading pleaſures of Gluttony at the rate of ſo many inconveniences! Undoubtedly a man cannot make plainer proof of his thraldom to glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, than when he thus thruſts and pours in that which he knows is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto him, only to content his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriſh appetite.</p>
               <p>Now when we ſay, A man muſt warily abſtain from theſe kinds of food, it is not ſo to be underſtood, as that a man may not (for example)

eat a little of <note n="*" place="margin">Braſſica.</note> Colewort, Onions, Cheeſe, Beans, Peaſe, and the like; although they naturally breed melancholy, choler, <note n="*" place="margin">Humoris viſcoſi.</note> ſlime, and windineſs: but that he ought not to eat them in any notable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. For theſe being but ſeldom u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and in ſmall quantities, cannot hurt, eſpecially when they be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the appetite.

The reaſons why this ſort of food is ſo excellent, are,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65894:37"/>
becauſe it is moſt light and eaſie of digeſtion, being prepared by art, ſo as it is very like to that <hi>Chylus,</hi> which the ſtomach makes by the concoction of meats: as alſo, becauſe it is moſt temperate in the qualities thereof: And further, it is little ſubject to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction and corruption, as many other ſorts of meats be, which do eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupt in the ſtomach. Laſt of all, it breeds abundance of good blood: And if occaſion need, it may eaſily by ſupply of other ingredients be made more hot and nouriſhing. So that worthily was it ſpoken by the wiſe man, <hi>Ecclus. 29.

It were ſurely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beſt, ſo to accuſtom the body, that it ſhould not require any fleſh at all to feed on. In regard that the Earth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth abundantly not only thoſe things which ſerve to nouriſhment, but alſo that which may ſuffice to pleaſure and delight: A great number of which thou mayſt feed upon without any manner of preparation; and the other, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding and mingling them in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeveral ways, may be eaſily made ſweet and pleaſant.</hi> To this opinion of <hi>Plutarch</hi> many Phyſicians agree; and experience, the ſureſt proof to go upon, confirms it. For there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations which ſeldom eat Fleſh, but live chiefly on Rice and Fruits; and yet notwithſtanding they live very long and healthfully; as the <hi>Japans,</hi> the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> the <hi>Africans</hi> in ſundry regions, and the <hi>Turks.</hi> The ſelf-ſame is to be ſeen likewiſe amongſt

means it comes to paſs, that the juſt Meaſure is enormouſly outſhot, and oft-times as much as Nature required, is thus thruſt in by licoriſhneſs.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65894:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a juſt meaſure, proceeds from the ſenſual Appetite; and the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite ariſeth from that apprehenſion of the Phancy, or Imagination, whereby meats are conceived to be delightful and pleaſant: ſpecial care is to be uſed touching the correction and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of this conceit and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. To the furtherance whereof, two things amongſt all other will moſt conduce. The firſt is, that a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw and apart himſelf from the view of Feaſts and Dainties, to the end they may not by their ſight and ſmell, ſtir up the Phanſie, and entice on Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: Inaſmuch as the preſence of every object doth naturally move, and work upon the faculty whereunto it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. And therefore it is much more difficult to reſtrain the appetite, when good cheer is preſent, then not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that which is away. The ſelf-ſame happens in all the objects and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the other ſenſes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond help is, To imagine theſe ſelf-ſame things, whereunto Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny allureth us, not to be as ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades, and as outwardly they appear,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65894:40"/>
good, pleaſant, ſavory, reliſhing, and bringing delight to the palate; but fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ſordid, evil-ſavored, and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as indeed after a very little while they prove. For all things, when they are reſolved into their principles, ſhew what they be in truth, and manifeſt what it was that lay diſguiſed under that amiable appearance, wherewith they preſented themſelves. Now what can be imagined more unſavory, or loathſome, then theſe dainties, aſſoon as they have received a little alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſtomack? Nay verily, by how much any thing proves more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable to Gluttony, by ſo much doth it inſtantly prove more abominable in truth, and yeelds the worſe and more noyſome ſmell. Whereupon they who give themſelves to delicacies, were it not for the help of outward perfumes, would undoubtedly be as intolerable through the evil ſavors that ariſe from their bodies, as dead carcaſes are. Their excrements likewiſe are of moſt noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſavor, and all the breathings of their bodies accompanied with a moſt filthy ſmell. The contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65894:41"/>
is to be ſeen in Country people, and mechanick artificers, who live temperately upon Brown Bread, Cheeſe, and other ſuch like ordinary Food.</p>
               <p>And this verily was excellently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by Gods ordinance, to the end that we ſhould learn thereby, ſo much the more to contemne delicacies, and to content our ſelves with ſimple and plain fare.

               <p n="21">21.<note place="margin">Whether this meaſure or ſtint ought not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</note> BUt here ariſe two  Doubts: The firſt Whether both the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and quality of the meat and drink ought not to be varied according to the ſeaſons of the year. Foraſmuch as it ſeems a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65894:41"/>
larger quantity of Food is agreeable to Winter, than to Summer; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that in Winter time (as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> affirms, <hi>Sect. 1. Aphoriſm,</hi> 15.) Mens Bellies are hotter, by reaſon that the cold without forceth the heat into the inward bowels, as it were from the circumference into the Center: But in Summer, upon a clean contrary ground, Mens Bellies become more feeble; to wit, in regard that the heat is drawn out by the warmneſs of the Air from the inward parts, as it were from the Center to the circumference, and there diſſipated. In like manner, drie and hot meats ſeem more proper for Winter, in regard of the abundance of Phlegme which is then bred, and is not ſo readily diſſolved: But in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, moiſt and cooling meats are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, inaſmuch as through the heat of the outward Air there is a great diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of humours, and much drying of the Body.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, According to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians Rules we ought indeed ſo to do; nevertheleſs not over ſcrupulouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor preciſely, but as occaſion fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65894:42"/>
For if opportunity be wanting, there is no great care to be had touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this buſineſs. For if we find neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a drier kind of Diet in Winter, or long continued moiſt weather, we may eaſily remedy the matter by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing our ſtint of Bread, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing the ſtint of our Drink, or other kinds of moiſt nouriſhment. For the abundance of drink and other moiſt food, which is beneficial in dry weather, will be of prejudice, if it ſhould be continued many days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the Air is raw and cold: for it may perhaps breed diſtillations, hoarſneſſes, and coughs. And on the other ſide, when a moiſter kind of Diet ſeems requiſite, the ſtint of the drink may be augmented, putting a larger quantity of water into the wine; or inſtead of wine we may uſe ſmall Beer, which will ſufficiently moiſten and refreſh.</p>
               <p>The Holy Fathers of old ſeem not to have made any account at all of this diverſity of ſeaſons, having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the ſelf-ſame meaſure of one and the ſelf-ſame kind of meat and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65894:42"/>
drink for the whole year through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and yet notwithſtanding they lived exceeding long. But now adays in Monaſteries there is good proviſion made this way for health, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing change of victuals appointed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeaſon; out of which they who follow Temperance, may make choice of what they find moſt convenient for them.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <note place="margin">Whether the daily meaſure or ſtint ought to be taken at one, or at more refections.</note>The ſecond Doubt  is, Whether this meaſure and ſtint which we have preſcribed, or any other which men ſhall find meet for them, is to be taken at one meal, or more. To which I anſwer, That however all the Ancients, who did ſo notably practiſe Temperance, contented themſelves with one meal a day, and that either after Sun-ſet, or at the Ninth hour of the day, that is, three hours after noon; as <hi>Caſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> reports in the ſecond Collation of Abbat <hi>Moyſes, chap. 25. and</hi> 26. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs many there be that think it more convenient, for old men to make two meals a day, dividing the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65894:43"/>
foreſaid meaſure into two parts. And the reaſon is, becauſe old men being not able to take much ſuſtenance at once, it is better that they ſhould eat oftner, and ſmaller quantities. For by this means they will not be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with meat, and make their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion eaſier. Wherefore they may take 7. or 8. Ounces at dinner, and at evening 3. or 4. or otherwiſe, as they ſhall find it moſt convenient for them.</p>
               <p>But verily in theſe matters long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom bears great ſway, and much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is to be had likewiſe to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the body. For if the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack abound with cold and tough phlegme, it ſeems to be more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that a man ſhould make but one meal a day, in regard that there is a good ſpace of time requiſite for the concocting and diſperſing of them: And this I have by experience abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly made proof of. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding if the meal be deferred till night, it will be good to take ſome ſmall modicum at noon, and ſuch in particular, as may help to drie up the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65894:43"/>
vicious moiſture of the ſtomack. Or if ſo be the chief meal be a dinner, it will not be amiſs at night to take ſome dried Raiſins, with Bread or the like. For they who are thus affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ought to have eſpecial care that this moiſtneſs of the ſtomack be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, as much as may be: in regard that from this indiſpoſitinn the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is troubled with wind, and the head filled with cloudineſs and tough phlegme.

               </p>
               <p n="23">23. Some will perhaps object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this which we have delivered. That this ſtinting a mans ſelf at a ſet meaſure for meat and drink, is a thing that hath been reproved by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Phyſicians: in regard that by this means the ſtomack is contracted or made narrow, and at laſt becomes ſo proportioned to this ſet quantity, as if at any time it chance to exceed,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65894:44"/>
it feels great oppreſſion and hurt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it is thereby extended or enlarged beyond that which it uſeth. For the remedy of which inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience they advice, that a man ſhould not keep always one ſtint, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times take more food, and ſometimes leſs. Which opinion ſeems to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Hippocrates, Aphor. 5. ſect.</hi> 1. where he writes thus; <hi>A very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſet, and exact diet is perilous even in them that are in health; inaſmuch as they become thereby leſs able to endure errors when they happen. And therefore in this respect a ſlender and exact diet is more perilous, than that which is a little fuller.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. I anſwer, That this Rule of the Phyſicians takes place in them, who cannot ſtedfaſtly hold the ſame courſe of Temperance, in regard of the often intercourſe of feaſts and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, which they either cannot, or will not avoid; and have not ſo got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the maſtery of Gluttony, as they are able to reſtrain their Appetites, and keep themſelves in their wonted bounds, when they ſee abundance of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65894:44"/>
dainties before their eyes, and are on every ſide enticed, and combated by perſwaſions and arguments of them that are in company, to take their part of them. For verily theſe men upon ſuch filling of themſelves will run upon ſome inconvenience, for the reaſon above ſpecified. But the caſe is otherwiſe with them, who may well avoid theſe occaſions and exceſſes, and are able to hold themſelves in their own courſe. For to them a ſet meaſure is moſt fitting, eſpecially if they be weakly or old, as both Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Reaſon evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
               <p>Nor doth it matter much, if now and then through ſome occaſion they be drawn to exceed this meaſure: in regard that one or two exceſſes do not much harm, if ſo be a man inſtantly return to his wonted ſobriety, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther altogether in ſuch caſes omit his next repaſt, or elſe make it as much ſparer, as the former was exceſſive. As ſuppoſe uſing to eat moderately both at dinner and ſupper, thou be drawn on to eat more largely at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65894:45"/>
than forbear thy ſupper altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And if at ſupper thou exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, forbear thy dinner the next day after.</p>
               <p>This inconvenience therefore is not of that moment, that for ſhunning the hazard thereof, a man ſhould refuſe to bind himſelf ordinarily to a ſet mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his food; inaſmuch as ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental exceſſes, ſo they happen but ſeldom, are of little prejudice even to old and weakly diſpoſed perſons.</p>
               <p n="25">25. But if theſe exceſſes come often, or be continued many days together, they who are uſed to a ſet ſtint, will find much hurt by them, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they who are ſickly or ſtricken in age. Our Author relates, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lived from the 36. Year of his Age to the 75. with only Twelve oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of food, and Fourteen of drink for the day, he did all that while en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his health very proſperouſly: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the Phyſicians counſel, and through his friends importunity, he was over-ruled to add only Two ounces a piece both to his food and to his drink. But this ſmall addition
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65894:45"/>
after Ten days brought upon him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great infirmities; to wit, very ſore pain in his ſide, much grief in his cheſt, and a fever, which held him 35. days, ſo that the Phyſicians gave him over for a dead man: nor could he have been cured, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his former cuſtom. I my ſelf alſo know one, who for many years together having uſed himſelf to ſuppers, taking only a bit at noon, and that of ſome dry kind of food, was by the perſwaſions of friends drawn on to eat a little more largely at noon, and that of liquid ſubſtance: which thing after Ten or Twelve days ſpace brought upon him ſuch cruel pains in his ſtomach and bowels for divers weeks together, that it ſeemed verily he would have died. From which although he was twice recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the help of many remedies, and the care of excellent Phyſicians, yet he did ſtill fall again into the ſame paſſions. At laſt, upon his third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe, after many days torment, the altering of his wonted cuſtom came to remembrance, which when he had
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65894:46"/>
well bethought him of, he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it was the true ground of all this miſchief: whereupon he determined to return to his former courſe. Which he no ſooner began to do, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt day his pains aſſwaged, and in four days ſpace were ſo quite gone, as there remained nothing behind, ſave a great debility and weakneſſes of body: which yet notwithſtanding by little and little wore away likewiſe by means of that ſober and dry diet. For it is not the abundance of meats, nor the daintineſs, that ſtrengthens Nature; but the moderate quantity proportionable to the ſtrength, and the good condition of the food an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the conſtitution of the body.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Nor is <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Aphoriſm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove alledged, contrary to this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ours: inaſmuch as he there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by a ſpare diet, That which is of ſo ſmall nutriment, and ſo little in quantity, as is not ſufficient for the maintenance of ſtrength, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of a mans conſtitution. But we allow all ſorts of meats that are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65894:46"/>
agreeable to Nature, and that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and quantity, which is moſt convenient and proportionable to the ſtomach, and beſt conducing to health.</p>
               <p n="27">27.<note place="margin">Another help to preſerve health.</note> But ſome will ſay,  It's not in every bodies power, (or at leaſt not with convenience) to obſerve this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act courſe of diet: what then? is there no other way for a man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his health, and to prolong his life? I anſwer, There is only one, which many excellent Phyſicians have preſcribed. And that is, That every year twice, namely in the Spring and Autumn, the body ſhould be well purged, and cleared of all ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65894:47"/>
done by ſtrong medicines one upon the neck of another; but gently, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the medicines Two or Three days together. For ſo they will both be eaſilier born, and with much more benefit. For the firſt day, the firſt region (as the Phyſicians term it) is to be purged, that is, the Bowels: The ſecond day, the Liver: and the third day, the Veins, in which lies the great drain of ill humors. For they who do not live temperately, do every day add ſome crude humor, which being ſucked in by the veins as by a ſpunge, is afterwards diſperſed through the whole body.</p>
               <p n="28">28. So that after Two or Three years ſpace there is ofttimes ſuch a maſs of ill humors gathered in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as a veſſel big enough to hold Two hundred ounces would ſcarce ſerve to receive them in.</p>
               <p>Now theſe humors in tract of time do corrupt and putrifie, and caſt a man upon mortal infirmities; and are the very true ground why moſt men die ſo much before their time. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all that die before old age, die
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65894:47"/>
by this means: thoſe only excepted, who are ſlain by outward violences; as by fire, ſword, wild beaſts, water, or the like: as alſo thoſe who die of the ſtone, of poyſon, of the plague, or ſome ſuch other infection. And queſtionleſs there be many, who with ſtore and plenty of all things in their own houſes, die and periſh through this abundance of malignant humors in their bodies; who had they been condemned to the Gallies, and there kept at bisket and water, might have lived long, and with good health. This danger therefore may in great part be remedied by purging ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, at leaſt twice every year. For ſo it will come to paſs, that neither the quantity of the ill humors will be very great, nor be much putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, being evacuated and kept under by this purging at every half years end. I have known many, who by this means have prolonged their lives to extream old age, and ſcarce all their lives long been oppreſſed with any great ſickneſs.</p>

                  <p>Of the Commodities which a ſober diet brings to the body; and first, That it freeth almoſt from all diſeaſes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="29">29. NOw follows the third of thoſe things, which we propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to wit, The explication of thoſe Commodities, which a ſober life brings both to ſoul and body.</p>
               <p>The firſt Benefit therefore is, That it doth free a man, and preſerve him from almoſt all manner of diſeaſes. For it rids away catarrhs, coughs, wheazings, dizzineſſes, and pains of the head and ſtomach: it drives away Apoplexies, Lethargies, Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and other ill affections of the brain: it cures the Gout in the feet, and in the hands, the <note n="*" place="margin">Dolores iſchiadicos.</note> Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atica, and thoſe diſeaſes that grow in the joynts. It likewiſe prevents Crudity, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all diſeaſes. In a word, it ſo tempers the humors, and maintains them in an equal proportion, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65894:48"/>
they offend not any way either in quantity or quality. Now where there is an agreeable proportionable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs amongſt the humors, there is no matter for ſickneſs to work upon: inaſmuch as the ground of health lies in this, That the humors be rightly and proportionably tempered in the body.</p>
               <p>And this both Reaſon and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience doth confirm. For we ſee, that thoſe who keep them to a ſober courſe of diet, are very ſeldom or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never moleſted with diſeaſes: and if at any time they happen to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with ſickneſs, they do bear it much better, and ſooner recover, than thoſe others, whoſe bodies are full fraught with ill humors, bred through the intemperance of Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony. I know very many, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be weak by natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and well grown in years, and continually buſied in imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the mind, nevertheleſs by the help of this Temperance they live in health, and have paſſed the greateſt part of their lives, which have been
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65894:49"/>
many years long, without any nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſickneſs. The ſelf ſame is to be made good by the examples of the Holy Fathers and Monks of old, who lived very long, healthy, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the height of ſpare diet.</p>
               <p n="30">30. The reaſon hereof is, For that almoſt all the diſeaſes, with which men are ordinarily vexed, have their beginning and birth from Repletion; that is to ſay, from mens taking more of meat and drink, than Nature requires, and then the ſtomach can perfectly concoct. In proof whereof we ſee, that almoſt all diſeaſes are cured by Evacuation. For blood is taken away either by opening a vein, or by cupping-glaſſes, leaches, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, that Nature may be lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The great overflowing of humors in the bowels, and throughout the whole body, is abated and drained by Purgings and other Medicines: Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and a very ſpare diet is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. All which ways of cure do plainly ſhew, that the diſeaſe was bred by Repletion: For contraries are cured by contraries. Whereupon
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65894:49"/>
                  <hi>Hippocrates, Sect. 2. Aphor.</hi> 22. ſaith, <hi>Whatever diſeaſes are bred by Repletion, are cured by Evacuation; and thoſe that are bred through Evacuation, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion.</hi> But diſeaſes by Evacuation happen ſeldom, and ſcarcely other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than upon dearths, ſieges, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyages, and the like chances. In which caſes, the aduſt humor, which the heat through want of food hath bred and kindled, is firſt to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and after that, the body by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little is to be nouriſhed and ſtrengthened, the meaſure of food be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing increaſed by degrees. The ſelf-ſame courſe is likewiſe to be held for the repair of Nature, when upon great ſickneſſes the Evacuations have been many, whereby the ſtrength hath been much impaired.</p>
               <p>Since therefore almoſt all diſeaſes proceed from this ground, to wit, That more food is taken into the body, than Nature requires; it will follow, That he who follows the juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhall be free from almoſt all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.

Whereupon <hi>Galen,</hi> in his <hi>firſt Book concerning meats of good and evil juice or nouriſhment,</hi> ſaith, <hi>No man ſhall be oppreſſed by ſickneſs, who keeps himſelf warily from falling into Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> And in reſpect of theſe Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the common ſaying is, That more are killed by <note n="*" place="margin">Non plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res gladio quàm ceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere gula.</note> ſurfets than by the ſword. And the holy Scripture ſaith, <hi>Ecclus. 37. Many have periſhed by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fets; but he that is temperate ſhould prolong his life.</hi> And a little before, <hi>Be not greedy upon every dainty, and pour not thy ſelf out upon every meat;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65894:50"/>
for in many meats there will be ſickneſs.</hi> Now a ſober courſe of Diet doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent theſe Crudities, and thereby cuts away the ground of diſeaſes. That which we call <hi>Crudities,</hi> is the imperfect concoction of Food. For when the ſtomach, either through the over-great quantity of meats, or for their refractory quality, or for the variety of them taken at the ſame time, or becauſe there was not a due ſpace of time left for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect concoction of food, doth imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly digeſt: then that Chylus or juice, which it makes of the meats ſo taken, is ſaid to be Crude, that is, raw, or to have Crudity in it; which brings many inconveniences. Firſt, it fills the brain and bowels with many phlegmatick and bilious excrements. Secondly, it breeds many obſtructions in the narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the bowels. Thirdly, it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the temper of the whole body. Laſtly, it ſtuffes the veins with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid humors, whereof proceed very grievous diſeaſes.</p>
               <p n="32">
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:65894:51"/>
32. Theſe things might be largely demonſtrated; but the thing is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt enough of it ſelf, eſpecially the firſt and the ſecond point: I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore explain the third and fourth.</p>
               <p>When the Chylus is crude, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignantly concocted by the ſtomach, and rather corrupted than digeſted (for ſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; a corruption, not a concoction) there cannot be bred good blood in the ſtore-houſe of the Liver, out of this kind of Chylus, but only that which is bad and vicious. For, as Phyſicians affirm, The ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction cannot amend the firſt. Now then from corrupt blood there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made good nouriſhment in the body, but of neceſſity the whole tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the body is corrupted, and ſo becomes ſubject to diſeaſes. For the third concoction, which is made in the ſmall pores of the body (where the blood is aſſimilated to every part which it is to nouriſh, and laſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the receiving of the form thereof) cannot mend the ſecond.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65894:51"/>
By this means the temper of the body through theſe Crudities is by little and little altered, and marred, and made ſubject to many inconveniences.</p>
               <p>Again, the crudity of the Chylus is a cauſe, that the veins through the whole body are repleniſhed with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and foul blood, and ſuch as is mingled with many evil humors, which in tract of time do by little and little putrifie, and at laſt upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Labor, Heat, Cold, Winds, and the like, are ſet on fire, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into great and perilous diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whereby an innumerable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men do periſh even in the flower of their age.</p>
               <p>Theſe inconveniences a ſober courſe of Diet prevents, by taking away the Cruditities which are the cauſe of all. For when there is no more taken in, than the ſtomach can well concoct, and afterwards ſufficient ſpace of time is allowed thereunto, Crudities can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ariſe, but the Chylus is made good and agreeable to Nature: And from good Chylus, good blood is bred; And from good blood there
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65894:52"/>
followeth good nouriſhment and good temper in and throughout the whole body.</p>
               <p>By this means alſo the putrefaction of the humors in the veins is avoided; as likewiſe obſtructions in the inward parts, and thoſe ſuperfluous excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which do ſo often vex and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the head and inward parts and joynts of the body: So that a good conſtitution of the body, and health is hereby preſerved: for they conſiſt in theſe two things,<note place="margin">Health con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in two things.</note> to wit, the due proportion and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry  of the humors, both in reſpect of their quantity and quality; and in a certain ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy kind of diſpoſition throughout the whole body, having no let nor impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by obſtructions, ſo that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and blood have their free paſſage and recourſe through all parts.</p>
               <p>Nor doth Sobriety only prevent the Crudity of humors, and the evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences ariſing thereupon: but it doth alſo conſume the ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and that much more ſafely and effectually than bodily exerciſe doth;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65894:52"/>
as the famous Doctor <hi>Viringus</hi> doth learnedly ſhew <hi>in his Fifth Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Fasting, chap.</hi> 3, 4, 5. For Labor doth confuſedly ſtir the body, and alwaies exerciſeth ſome parts more than other, and moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly only ſome few parts alone; and that ofttimes with a great perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the humors, with much heat and hazard of ſickneſs, eſpecially of Fevers, Pleuriſies, and ſeveral kinds of Diſtillations upon ſundry parts, which breed much grief and pain. But Abſtinence pierceth far more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, even unto the very entrals, and to all the joynts and knittings in the body, and doth with eaſe and equality make a general evacuation: For it extenuates that which is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thickened, it opens that which is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it conſumes thoſe things that are ſuperfluous, it unlocks the paſſages of the ſpirits, and makes the ſpirits them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the more clear; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbance of the humors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fluxes and pains, without heating the body, and without hazard of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, without expenſe of time, or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65894:53"/>
loſs and neglect of better imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Notwithſtanding it muſt needs be granted, That Exerciſe, if it be uſed in due time, and do not exceed meaſure, is very profitable, and to many neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Yet ordinarily to ſuch as lead tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and ſober lives, and follow their ſtudies, being much given to the imployments of the mind, there is no great need of long walks, or other long continued exerciſes, whereby much time is waſted and loſt: but it is ſufficient, if only for the ſpace of a quarter or half an hour before meals, they uſe to ſwing or to toſs a <note n="*" place="margin">Vectis agitatio.</note> Bar, Stool, or ſome ſuch like heavy thing; or taking in each hand a weight of Two or Three pounds, they ſtrike and ſwing their arms about them, the one after the other as if they <note n="*" place="margin">

Now in the firſt and ſecond kinds of death there is a great diſturbance of Nature, and ſo conſequently much grief muſt needs enſue, as long as that continues; in regard that the Temper is overthrown by the violence of that which is contrary to it, and the bond of Nature is forcibly broken: But in the third there is either none at all, or very little grief, in regard that the Temper is inwardly, diſſolved by little and little, and the Original Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, in which Life chieſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, is waſted together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred heat: For whileſt the Humidity or Moiſture waſteth, the heat founded therein doth equally abate; and the moiſture being ſpent, the heat is joyntly extinguiſhed, as we ſee it comes to paſs in Lamps. After this manner do moſt of them die, who have obſerved an exact Rule of diet, unleſs perchance they die by means of outward violence.

And therefore it will needs follow, that they muſt live till the Original Moiſture, together with the Heat that is founded thereupon, be ſo conſumed, as it is not ſufficient to retain the ſoul any longer in the body. And in the like manner would a mans death be, if God ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his conſervation of the Natural Heat, although the Radical Humor ſhould remain; or on the other ſide, if the Radical Humor ſhould by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine operation be in an inſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>

               <p>This impediment is taken away or much diminiſhed by the Sobriety of meat and drink, and by abſtinence from thoſe things which repleniſh the head with fumes; ſuch as are all fat things, and eſpecially Butter, if it be taken in a good quantity, ſtrong wines, and thick beer, or ſuch as are compounded with thoſe herbs that fly up into the Head.</p>

part apprehend things anſwerable to the Humor and Quality then preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and eſpecially upon the firſt preſentment of the object, till it be corrected and otherwiſe directed by reaſon.</p>
               <p>So then the exceſs of theſe Humors doth pervert the natural condition and apprehenſion of the Phanſie. For Choler, inaſmuch as it is extream bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and contrary to Nature, cauſeth a man to apprehend other mens words or deeds, or any thing that diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, as if it were intended againſt him with deſpight and injury: And becauſe this Humor is fiery and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous, it makes the apprehenſion to be ſwift and violent, and drives a man on to a ſpeedy repulſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the evil which he conceiveth done towards him. The Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Humor is heavy, cold, and dry, lumpiſh, ſower, ſwart in colour, and very hurtful to the heart. And ſo it cauſeth that the Phanſie apprehends all things as having enmity, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorrow, and full of darkneſs. Now by reaſon of the cold and heavineſs
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65894:66"/>
therein it comes to paſs, that this Humor doth not incite a man to the repulſe of evil, as Choler doth, which is light and active: but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it caſts a man into fears, flight, and delays. Phlegm is cold and moiſt, whereby it comes to paſs, that the apprehenſion is ſlow and dull to every thing without any vigor, acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or alacrity. So that Choler makes a man angry, raſh, haſty, bold, earneſt, quarrelſome, peeviſh, angry at every thing; a ſwearer, a curſer, a clamorer, and a brawler. And hence ariſe ſo many injuries, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, wounds and ſlaughters, as are rife amongſt men. For even thoſe things which are committed upon drunkenneſs, do for the moſt part come from the fury of Choler ſet on fire, and augmented by the wine. Melancholy makes men ſad, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, timorous, ſolitary, thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and inclining to deſpair. And as Choler, whilſt it boils, doth for a ſhort ſpace pervert the right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the mind: ſo Melancholy perverts it almoſt alwaies, eſpecially
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65894:67"/>
if it be that kind which poſſeſſeth the brain, or ſends up foul vapors from the <note n="*" place="margin">Ex Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriis.</note> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal parts into the Head and Heart. Phlegm makes men ſlow, feeble, ſleepy, fearful, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful, and in a word altogether unfit for matters of worth. For albeit this Humor be not ſo hurtful to the Body as Choler and Melancholy, it is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs exceeding contrary to the functions of the Mind, inaſmuch as by the coldneſs thereof it dulls the vigor of the ſpirits, and by the moiſtneſs thereof it cloyes the brain, and ſtops up the paſſages of the ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Now a Sober Diet doth in great part remedy all theſe evils. For by the continuance thereof, the evil Humors are by little and little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, Nature either conſuming or driving them out, and eſpecially if there be adjoyned ſome little help by means of purging Medicines. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the temper of the body is corrected, inaſmuch as there is a ſupply of pure and well-tempered a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65894:67"/>
ſupply of pure and well-tempered blood, which is neither mixed with Crudities, nor corrupted by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Humors, nor exceeding in any hurtful quality. And hereupon we ſee thoſe men that are accuſtomed to Sobriety, to be calm, affable, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, chearful, tractable, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in all things. For the benign juice or nouriſhment which Nature works upon, cauſeth benign affections and manners: and the malignant juice (ſuch as Choler and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly breed, if they exceed either in Quantity or Quality) cauſeth fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wildneſs in the affections and manners. Wherein it is alſo very conſiderable, That evil Humors do not only excite and ſtir up paſſions, and ſet them on work; but again by a certain Sympathy that is between them, are themſelves alſo ſet on fire, and ſtrengthened by the paſſions: and being thus kindled and ſtrengthened, they add new force and ſtrength to the paſſions, augmenting and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
               <p>This is evident in the Cholerick
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65894:68"/>
Humor, which, when it is abundant, ſtirs up wrath by means of the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Phanſie, which it hath corrupted: And on the other ſide, the commotion of Anger, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind of Sympathy, ſets on fire the ſpirits and the cholerick humor; and then again the cholerick humor being inflamed, cauſeth the Phanſie to apprehend the matter more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vehemently, ſo that the injury ſeems much greater than it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And hereupon the commotion of Anger it ſelf is increaſed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. And ſo it ofttimes happens that men run out from Anger into Madneſs, if ſo be the Phanſie dwell long upon imagination of the injury. It is therefore the beſt counſel that can be given, to perſwade a man to turn away his thoughts from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries that he conceives to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, inaſmuch as the thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them is prejudicial not only to the Mind, but alſo to the Body. In like manner, the Melancholick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, by means of the Phanſie, ſtirs up grief, although there be no true
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65894:68"/>

For Memory is above all things moſt hurt by a cold humor poſſeſſing the Brain, which commonly uſeth moſt to moleſt intemperate perſons, and thoſe who are ſtricken in age. For this humor both ſtops up the narrow paſſages of the ſpirits, and benumbs
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65894:69"/>
the ſpirits themſelves, making them ſluggiſh: whereby the apprehenſions of the mind become ſlow, languid, and inconſtant; and ofttimes they do ſo fail a man in the midſt of his diſcourſe, as himſelf knows not what it was he ſaid, nor about what he was ſpeaking, but is fain to ask the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by concerning the matter that they were treating of. And this is cauſed Three ways: Firſt, by reaſon that the Animal ſpirit which the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie makes uſe of, as well in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance as in all her other actions, is as it were haſtily intercepted in her courſe by the phlegmatick hu<gap reason="illegible: damage" resp="#APEX" extent="6+ letters">

                  </gap> upon the interception whereof the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion ceaſeth, and conſequently all remembrance. Secondly, this comes to paſs, in regard that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion was feeble and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, and that by reaſon of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and unaptneſs of the ſpirits. Now the apprehenſion of any thing, made without reflexion, cannot leave any ſuch print of it ſelf as is ſufficient for remembrance: Foraſmuch as all remembrance is immediately conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65894:69"/>
about our own actions, and only mediately about the objects of thoſe actions. For I do not properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Peter</hi> was dead; but that I ſaw, or heard, or read that he was dead: ſo that where there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion upon our own actions, there cannot be a ſufficient print left for memory. The third cauſe is, from the unaptneſs of the ſpirits: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the print and footſtep be in ſome manner ſufficient for its own part; nevertheleſs it comes often to paſs, that by reaſon of the poverty, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, or ſluggiſhneſs, or too much heat of the ſpirits, we cannot conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently make uſe of that print and footſtep. And by this means it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens, that a man almoſt quite loſeth his memory, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all his learning; As when abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of cold Phlegin ſtops up the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſages of the Brain, and makes the ſpirits become ſluggiſh, and doth overmuch moiſten and cool the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Brain.</p>
               <p n="50">50. Now all this evil is wonderfully prevented or cured by a ſober and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65894:70"/>
courſe of Diet; to wit, by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from hot drinks and ſuch as ſume, except it be in ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For albeit wine is hot, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs being drunk often and in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, it breeds cold diſeaſes, to wit, Diſtillations, Coughs, <note n="*" place="margin">Coryzas.</note> Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings at the Noſe, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies, Palſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe it fills the head with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, which being there refrigerated, are congealed into that cold Phlegm, which is the cauſe of all theſe evils. Nor muſt a man in this caſe abſtain from hot and fuming drinks only, but alſo from all abundance of moiſt things, and, aſmuch as may be, hold himſelf to a dry kind of diet: For ſo it will come to paſs, that the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous humidity will either not be bred, or being bred will be conſumed; and conſequently that the obſtructions cauſed by means thereof will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the paſſages of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits made free, and the ſpirits them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rarified, and brought to their right quality, and the brain it ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to its natural temper, and

               <p n="51">51. THe Fourth Commodity is the vigor of the Wit in excogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, reaſoning, finding out; and judging of things, and the aptitude and fitneſs that it hath for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of divine Illuminations. And hence it comes to paſs, that men given to Abſtinence are watchful, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, provident, of good forecaſt, able to give counſel, and of ſound judgment: and for matters of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they do eaſily grow to excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in thoſe things whereunto they apply themſelves. As for Prayer, Meditation, and Contemplation, they do perform them with great facility, pleaſure, and ſpiritual delight.</p>
               <p>The Ancient Fathers and thoſe that lived in the deſerts prove this by their example, who being moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinent,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65894:71"/>
were always freſh in their minds, and ſpent whole nights in prayer, and in ſearch and ſtudy of divine matters, with ſo great ſolace of mind that they deemed themſelves to be in Paradiſe as it were, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the paſſage of the time: And by this means they came to that great meaſure of holineſs, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with God, and were adorned with the gifts of propheſie and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and became admirable to all the world. For having their minds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lifted up and ſet on God, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty vouchſafed to deſcend down to them, illuminating them wonderfully according as it is in the 34 Pſalm, <hi>They had an eye unto him and were lightned;</hi> making them partakers of his ſecrets, and inſtruments of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous works; that ſo the world might know how acceptable their kind of life was with God, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to the honor and imitation of them.</p>
               <p n="52">52. There are very many alſo now adays, who tend unto the higheſt pitches of wiſdom and vertue by the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65894:71"/>
ſelf-ſame way of Abſtinence: whereof ſome are very admirable in all mens eyes, through the abundance of their writings, and their ſurpaſſing learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But no man without the aſſiſtance of Sobriety can perform any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and if he obſtinately attempt it, he ſhall kill himſelf long before his time. No man is able without the help of this vertue to refrain his paſſions, to keep his mind in quiet, to perform the ſervices of the mind about divine myſteries with eaſe and pleaſure, or to come to any eminent degree of holineſs. For Sobriety is as it were the ground and Baſis of all theſe things, as <hi>Caſſian</hi> teacheth in his Fifth Book which is <hi>de Gaſtrimar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, chap.</hi> 14. and 17. So that all the Saints who have gone about the building up of the high Tower of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Perfection, have made their beginning from this vertue, as from the foundation of their ſpiritual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick.</p>
               <p n="53">53. Nor is it any thing contrary to this which we have ſaid, that Faith ought to be held the foundation of all
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65894:72"/>
vertues, and conſequently the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of all this ſpiritual building: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as Faith is the internal and primary foundation, into which all other vertues are ſet, and whereupon they are reared: but Abſtinence is an outward, ſecondary, and miniſterial foundation, inaſmuch as it removes thoſe things which breed impediment to the exerciſes of Faith, and to the functions of the Intellectual faculty, or make them full of difficulty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, and tedious: And together herewith it affords many helps, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the functions of the Intellectual power become more clear, eaſie to be performed, and delightful.</p>
               <p>For all ſpiritual progreſs doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the uſe of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of Faith which reſides in the Underſtanding. For we cannot love any good thing, or profit in the love thereof, nor hate any evil thing, or grow in the hatred thereof, except it be propoſed by the Underſtanding, ſo as it may move the Affections: Whereupon he that is ſo diſpoſed by heavenly Grace, as that heavenly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65894:72"/>
matters are always in his mind (as it was in the Apoſtles, and in other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical men) will eaſily contemn all earthly things, and ſo by degrees, from a great meaſure of holineſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained here below, mount up to the injoyment of a glorious Crown of everlaſting bliſs in heaven. For the Wil doth eaſily conform it ſelf to the judgment of the Underſtanding, when matters are propounded by the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, not by ſtarts as it were, but conſtantly and ſeriouſly. From theſe grounds it is evident, That thoſe things which hinder the functions of the Mind, or obſcure them, or make them to become difficult and irkſome, are the things which in very truth debar us from attaining to any great meaſure of perfection either in Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or in exerciſes of Religion, or in ſanctity of Life: And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, thoſe things which make the functions of the Mind to become more eaſie, expedite, clear, and delightful, are thoſe things which fit a man to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſpiritual affairs with eaſe and pleaſure, and do lead on to the ready
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65894:73"/>
attainment of excellent wiſdom and holineſs.</p>
               <p n="54">54. Since Sobriety then hath this vertue, that it takes away thoſe things which hinder the conſideration of the Mind, or make it to become difficult and unpleaſant, and doth make ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of thoſe things, whereby it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes eaſie and pleaſant: It deſerves juſtly to be called the ſecondary Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of wiſdom and ſpiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. Now how this is brought to paſs, is manifeſt by that which hath been ſaid formerly. For the things that hinder ſpeculation, and make it irkſome, are theſe, Too much moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the brain, abundance of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors and ſooty exhalations, obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the paſſages of the brain, too much ſtore of blood, heating of the ſpirits, ariſing from blood or Choler, the flying up of cholerick vapors, and thoſe which proceed from aduſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy into the head, cholerick and melancholick humors poſſeſſing the brain. Now all theſe impediments, if ſo be they be not already in act, are prevented by means of a Sober
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65894:73"/>
Diet, ſo that they cannot ſteal in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man: And if they be already got into the body, they are by little and little overcome and amended, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if at the beginning there be uſe made of ſome ſuch medicines as are needful; unleſs the evil be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate and incurable: as it ſometimes happens, that there is bred a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued madneſs, to wit, when Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and Phlegm have poſſeſſed the brain.</p>
               <p>Nor doth a Sobet Diet only take away the impediments of Speculation, but alſo miniſter the proper helps thereof, to wit, good blood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently pure and well-tempered ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and ſuch a temper in the brain as ought to be. For the very temper of the brain it ſelf, which by Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance is made either too moiſt, or too cold, or too dry, or too hot, is by little and little mended through the help of diet, and reduced to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity.</p>

a Chriſtian man more deſire, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially he that intends Piety, than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long old age to enjoy his Mind healthful, cheary, expedite, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous to all imployments and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions thereof? For beſides that this is very pleaſant in its own nature, it brings along with it, if ſo be we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, a very great ſpiritual commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For then by long experience of forepaſt age, the vanity of the world is better diſcerned, and becomes more contemptible; heavenly matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to reliſh us better, and earthly to be deſpiſed: Thoſe everlaſting future things which hang over our heads, are always before our eyes, and call upon us to make fitting preparation for them; All the knowledg and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which we have gotten from our youth up until that time, turns then greatly to our advantage, and we reap the ſweet fruit thereof. And then the affections and perturbations of our minds being calmed, we can with great eaſe and pleaſure give our ſelves to Prayer, Meditation of divine matters, Reading of Scripture and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65894:74"/>
the works of the holy Fathers. Then we may with delight always buſie our minds with pious cogitations, and, as the holy Fathers were wont, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ruminating upon ſome one or other divine ſentence out of Gods Word, and with great reverence and devotion be conſtantly partakers of the Prayers, and other publick duties which the Church enjoyns us unto. It is not to be believed, what an apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and facility there is in a ſober old age to all theſe good duties and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of the mind, and how much pleaſure and conſolation they ſhall here find by means thereof, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently increaſe their reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

the Seed is expelled: And by the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing cauſe,</hi> I mean the Imagination of luſtful matters. This Imagination firſt ſtirs up the Concupiſcence, and that ſtraightways moves the ſpirits to the expulſion, and they being thus ſtirred up do accompliſh the thing, except the Will do reſtrain them. Now in the overcoming of this violence doth the Chriſtian Combate chiefly lie, eſpecially in them that are in the flower of their Age, and in the ſtrength of Nature.</p>
               <p n="58">58. Now Sobriety doth take from the Matter and the Impulſive cauſe: for it maketh an abatement by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees both in the quantity and heat of the Seed. It doth likewiſe diminiſh the ſtore and firineſs of the ſpirits, by abſtaining from hot and windy meats, and from the uſe of wine and ſtrong beer, at leaſt ſo long as is needful for coming to the right Mediocrity. And when the Seed is diminiſhed and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, and withal the ſpirits, luſtful imaginations do ceaſe of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: or if ſo be they riſe, they are eaſily quelled, except it be ſo, that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65894:77"/>
by Gods permiſſion they are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the devils ſuggeſtion. For luſtful imaginations do ſpring up in the Mind through a certain kind of ſympathy which they have with the diſpoſition of the Body, to wit, by reaſon of the abundance of Seed and Spirits; as alſo other imaginations do, which follow the condition of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Humor, as we formerly declared. In ſign and proof whereof, we ſee the followers of Sobriety for the moſt part free from ſuch kind of imaginations and temptations, or rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moleſted with them. Now if ſo be there be not ſtore of theſe cauſes laid up beforehand in the body, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety doth eaſily prevent their growth, inaſmuch as it cauſeth that a man neither eats nor drinks more than the ſuſtenation of the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: For he doth not meaſure the quantity of thoſe things which he takes, by his Appetite, which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deceitful; but by Reaſon, which looks what and how much is proportionable for the conſervation of the Body, and the performance of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65894:78"/>
the duties and ſervices belonging to the Mind.</p>
               <p n="59">59.<note place="margin">Why the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful.</note> Now there is a double Reaſon, why the  Appetite becomes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Meaſurer in this kind. The firſt is, Becauſe the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite doth not only deſire that which is neceſſary to the conſervation of the Body, but alſo that which may ſerve for the uſe of Procreation. For the appetite of eating and drinking is both in men and beaſts ordained to both theſe ends, to wit, to the conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Individual, and to the propagation of the whole Kind. And therefore Reaſon chargeth them who deſire to live chaſtly, and not to be moleſted by the ſting of Luſt, that they ſhould not obey their Appetite to the full, but give it ſatisfaction only to the half, that is, only aſmuch as is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the ſuſtenance of the Body: which thing if they carefully obſerve, there will be little ſtore of Seed bred in their Bodies, and very few incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Luſt, For Seed is bred of that ſuperfluity of the nouriſhment,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65894:78"/>
which was more than requiſite for the ſuſtentation of the body. So that where there is no more ſuſtenance taken in, than is ſufficient for the nouriſhment of the body, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains either nothing at all, or very little to be diſtributed for the increaſe of Seed.</p>
               <p n="60">60. The other cauſe why the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is deceitful, is, Becauſe it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times longs after more than is any way proportionable to either of theſe fore-mentioned ends, that is to ſay, more than is fitting either for the nouriſhment of the Body, or for the matter of Propagation. And that is cauſed either through the ill diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtomach, as it comes to paſs in that ravening kind of Appetite, which is called <hi>Dogs-hunger,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Bulimia.</note> 
                  <hi>Ox-hunger,</hi> and when the Melancholick Humor is ſoaked into the tunicles of the ſtomach: or elſe by reaſon of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and <note n="*" place="margin">Mangonia.</note> Lickoriſh cooking of the meats themſelves, which by their variety and new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes do go on continually provoking
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65894:79"/>
the Appetite, and ſtirring up Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. In which regard, this variety and curious dreſſing of meats is, as Phyſicians teach, eſpecially to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed by all them that are followers of Sobriety and Chaſtity, and in very truth by all thoſe who have care of their health, concerning which thing we have diſcourſed more largely before.</p>
               <p>By all this it appears, That there is far greater vertue and power for the quenching of Luſt, in Sobriety and Abſtinence, than in other corporal mortifications, ſuch are hair-cloths, whippings, <note n="*" place="margin">Chameunia.</note> lying upon the ground, and bodily labors; for theſe do only afflict the body outwardly, and but raſe the skin as it were, but come not at all to the ground of the evil which lies hidden within: But Abſtinence plucks up the cauſe of all by the roots in the inward veins, reducing the natural temper to a juſt modiocrity. This remedy then is to be uſed by all thoſe who are vexed with this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p n="61">
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:65894:79"/>
61. And thus much touching the benefits and ſingular fruits of Sobriety: all which might well be confirmed by the teſtimonies of the ancient holy Fathers: but for brevity ſake I omit them, contenting my ſelf with one paſſage only out of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who in his firſt Homily concerning Faſting writes thus: <hi>Faſting is, aſmuch as lies in us, an imitation of the Angels, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of things preſent, a ſchool of prayer, a nouriſhing of the ſoul, a bridle of the mouth, an abatement of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, as they that uſe to faſt do well know and prove in themſelves: It molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies rage, it appeaſeth anger, it calms the tempeſts of Nature, it excites reaſon, it clears the mind, it diſburdens the fleſh, it chaſeth away night-pollutions, it frees from head-ach, and it breeds clear and well-coloured viſages. By fasting a man gets compoſed behavior, free utterance of his tongue, right apprehenſions of his mind, &amp;c.</hi> See him likewiſe in his Firſt Homily on <hi>Geneſis.</hi> And agreeable to this we find many things in S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> in his Oration concerning <hi>Faſting;</hi> In <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:65894:80"/>
and in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his Oration concerning <hi>Faſting;</hi> and in many others.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That a Sober Diet is not of any grief or trouble: and that Intemperance bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth many great and grievous mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="62">62. BUt ſome will object, That this ſtraitneſs of Diet is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, in regard it leaves a man always tormented as it were with hunger; and therefore it were better to die ſooner, than to prolong a wretched life by ſuch a painful medicine; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as it was once ſaid by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſeaſed perſon, whoſe Thigh was to be cut off; that <note n="*" place="margin">Non eſt tanto digna dolore ſolus.</note> 
                  <hi>The preſervation of life would be two dear bought at the price of ſo much pain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, At firſt indeed this ſpareneſs of Diet is ſomewhat troubleſome, in regard of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65894:80"/>
uſage formerly, and alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the inlargement of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach: but by little and little that trouble is removed. For we muſt not ſuddenly paſs from a great quantity to a ſmall, but every day by degrees ſubtracting a little, till we come to the juſt meaſure, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth oftentimes warn: for by this means the ſtomach is contracted by little and little without any great trouble, and the greedineſs, which was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felt, is taken away. Now when the ſtomach comes to be contracted to the right meaſure that it ought, there is no more trouble remaining by means of a Sober Diet, inaſmuch as that ſmall quantity doth juſtly agree and anſwer the capacity and ſtrength of the ſtomach. In proof whereof we ſee, that it is very grievous to moſt men to forbear their uſual Break-faſt at the beginning of <hi>Lent;</hi> but by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little that offence is diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and divers do in the end find ſuch benefit by Abſtinence, as that they chooſe willingly ever after to forbear Break-faſt. The ſelf-ſame do
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65894:81"/>
many prove in forbearing of Suppers. And in like manner, after that men have a while forced themſelves, they find no pain in abſtaining from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of meats, to which their appetites did formerly lead them with great violence. It is therefore alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether untrue which is commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, That a ſober Diet doth tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a man with continual hunger.</p>
               <p n="63">63. Secondly, I anſwer, Suppoſe there were ſome trouble in ſuch kind of diet, and that it ſhould dure long, (which yet in truth is not ſo) yet ought we to conſider the many profits and benefits which it brings in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of this ſmall trouble, to wit, That a ſober Diet expels diſeaſes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the body agil, healthful, pure and clean from noiſomneſs and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, cauſeth long life, breeds quiet ſleep, makes ordinary fare equal in ſweetneſs to the greateſt dainties, and moreover keeps the Senſes ſound, and the Memory freſh, and adds perſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to the Wit, and clearneſs and apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the receiving of divine Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; And further, quits the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65894:81"/>
drives away Wrath and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and breaks the fury of Luſt; In a word, repleniſheth both ſoul and body with exceeding good things; ſo that it may well be termed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Health, of Chearfulneſs, of Wiſdom, and, in ſum, of all Vertues.</p>
               <p n="64">64.<note place="margin">The diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> And on the contrary, a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered life repays that ſmall and fading pleaſure, which  it affords to the throat, with an innumerable company of miſchiefs: For it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the belly with the weight thereof, it deſtroys health, it makes the body to become noiſome, ill-ſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, filthy, and full fraught with muck and excrements; it inflames Luſt, and inthrals the mind to paſſions; it dulls the Senſes, weakens the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, obſcures the Wit and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and, in ſum, makes the Mind become lumpiſh and unapt for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the functions proper thereunto, ſuch as are Learning, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Meditation, and all other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and lofty matters; whereby is brought about, that there can be little
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65894:82"/>
progreſs made either in knowledg of good things, or in holineſs of life, or in the exerciſe and performance of good works.</p>
               <p>And what a goodly Benefit is it, for the injoyment whereof we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go all this loſs and damage! Nothing but a ſhort delight of the throat for a minutes ſpace, which is only felt whilſt the meat is in chewing and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down into the belly; which in its own nature is very baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, being no other than that which is common with us together with the beaſts, and ſuch as doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect only a very ſmall portion of the body, to wit, the tongue, the palate, and the throat: For this it is, that we pull upon our ſelves all theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs; and through the deſire of this it is, that the following of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance ſeems ſuch a difficult buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For were there no pleaſure in taking meat and drink, there would be no grief in forbearing them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance then hath no other piece of goodneſs in it, than only a baſe momentany delight and pleaſing of

What a height of miſery and indignity then muſt it needs be for a man to inthral himſelf to the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thereof, and for this cauſe to indanger ſo many inconveniences and prejudices! what a deal of wormwood and gall doth Gluttony pour in, after the ſmall ſweet and pleaſure which it hath afforded!</p>
               <p n="65">65. Theſe things ought to be diſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſidered and weighed by wiſe men, and eſpecially by Church-men, and ſuch as ſet themſelves apart to the ſervice of God, whoſe profeſſion is to attend continually upon divino myſteries and the functions of the mind. For if we carefully ponder theſe things, it will not be poſſible but that we ſhould make choice of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and find it pleaſant and eaſie; and on the contrary, intemperance will appear and prove full of horror and deteſtation unto us: we ſhall be aſhamed of our delicacy, and bluſh at the feeble and baſe tempers of our minds, that are ſo captivated to the ſervice of Gluttony, that we ſlaviſhly obey the Tyrannical Rule of it, not

            <p>HAving obſerved in my time many of my friends, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wit and noble diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, overthrown and undone by Intemperance; who, if they had lived, would have been an ornament to the world, and a comfort to their friends: I thought fit to diſcover in a ſhort Treatiſe, that Intemperance was not ſuch an evil, but it might eaſily be remedied: which I undertake the more willingly, becauſe divers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy young men have obliged me unto it. For when they ſaw their parents and kindred ſnatcht away in the midſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65894:88"/>
of their days, and me contrariwiſe, at the age of Eighty and one, ſtrong and luſty; they had a great deſire to know the way of my life, and how I came to be ſo. Wherefore that I may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their honeſt deſire, and withal help many others, who will take this into conſideration, I will declare the cauſes which moved me to forſake In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and live a ſober life, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing alſo the means which I have uſed therein. I ſay therefore, that the infirmities, which did not only begin, but had already gone far in me, firſt cauſed me to leave Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, to which I was much addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For by it, and my ill conſtitution, (having a moſt cold and moiſt ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach) I fell into divers diſeaſes, to wit, into the pain of the ſtomach, and often of the ſide, and the beginning of the Gout, with almoſt a continual fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and thirſt.</p>
            <p>From this ill temper there remained little elſe to be expected of me, than that after many troubles and griefs I ſhould quickly come to an end; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as my life ſeemed as far from it by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65894:89"/>
as it was near it by Intemperance? When therefore I was thus affected from the Thirty fifth year of my age to the Fortieth, having tried all reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies fruitleſly, the Phyſicians told me that yet there was one help for me, if I could conſtantly purſue it, to wit, <hi>A ſober and orderly life:</hi> for this had every way great force for the recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preſerving of Health, as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly life to the overthrowing of it; as I too well by experience found. For Temperance preſerves even old men and ſickly men ſound: But In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance deſtroys moſt healthy and flouriſhing conſtitutions: For contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſes have contrary effects, and the faults of Nature are often amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Art, as barren grounds are made fruitful by good husbandry. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded withal, that unleſs I ſpeedily uſed that remedy, within a few months I ſhould be driven to that exigent, that there would be no help for me, but Death, ſhortly to be expected.</p>
            <p>Upon this, weighing their reaſons with my ſelf, and abhorring from ſo ſudden an end, and finding my ſelf
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65894:89"/>
continually oppreſſed with pain and ſickneſs, I grew fully perſwaded, that all my griefs aroſe out of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: and therefore out of an hope of avoiding death and pain, I reſolved to live a temperate life.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, being directed by them in the way I ought to hold, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the food I was to uſe, was ſuch as belonged to ſickly conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that in a ſmall quantity. This they had told me before: But I, then not liking that kind of Diet, followed my Appetite, and did eat meats plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to my taſte; and, when I felt inward heats, drank delightful wines, and that in great quantity, telling my Phyſicians nothing thereof, as is the cuſtom of ſick people. But after I had reſolved to follow Temperance and Reaſon, and ſaw that it was no hard thing to do ſo, but the proper duty of man; I ſo addicted my ſelf to this courſe of life, that I never went a foot out of the way. Upon this, I found within a few days, that I was exceedingly helped, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance thereof, within leſs than one
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65894:90"/>
year (although it may ſeem to ſome incredible) I was perfectly cured of all my infirmities.</p>
            <p>Being now ſound and well, I began to conſider the force of Temperance, and to think thus with my ſelf: If Temperance had ſo much power as to bring me health; how much more to preſerve it: Wherefore I began to ſearch out moſt diligently what meats were agreeable unto me, and what diſagreeable: And I purpoſed to try, whether thoſe that pleaſed my taſte brought me commodity or diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; and whether that Proverb, wherewith Gluttons uſe to defend themſelves, to wit, <hi>That which ſavors is good and nouriſheth,</hi> be conſonant to truth. This upon trial I found moſt falſe: for ſtrong and very cool wines pleaſed my taſte beſt, as alſo melons, and other fruit; in like manner, raw lettice, fiſh, pork, ſauſages, pulſe, and cake, and py-cruſt, and the like: and yet all theſe I found hurtful.</p>
            <p>Therefore truſting on experience, I forſook all theſe kind of meats and drinks, and choſe that wine that fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

my ſtomach, and in ſuch meaſure, as eaſily might be digeſted: Above all, taking care never to riſe with a full ſtomach, but ſo as I might well both eat and drink more. By this means, within leſs than a year I was not only freed from all thoſe evils which had ſo long beſet me, and were almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come incurable; but alſo afterwards I fell not into that yearly diſeaſe, whereinto I was wont, when I pleaſed my Senſe and Appetite. Which bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits alſo ſtill continue, becauſe from the time that I was made whole, I never ſince departed from my ſetled courſe of Sobriety, whoſe admirable power cauſeth that the meat and drink that is taken in fit meaſure, gives true ſtrength to the body, all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities paſſing away without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and no ill humors being ingendred in the body.</p>
            <p>Yet with this diet I avoided other hurtful things alſo, as too much heat and cold, wearineſs, watching, ill air, overmuch uſe of the benefit of marriage. For although the power of health conſiſts moſt in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65894:91"/>
of meat and drink, yet theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named things have alſo their force. I preſerved me alſo, aſmuch as I could, from hatred and melancholy, and other perturbations of the mind, which have a great power over our conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. Yet could I not ſo avoid all theſe, but that now and then I fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; which gained me this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that I perceived, that they had no great power to hurt thoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which were kept in good order by a moderate Diet: So that I can truly ſay, That they who in theſe two things that enter in at the mouth, keep a fit proportion, ſhall receive lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hurt from other exceſſes.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Galen</hi> confirms, when he ſays, that immoderate heats and colds, and winds and labors did little hurt him, becauſe in his meats and drinks he kept a due moderation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never was ſick by any of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, except it were for one only day. But mine own experience confirmeth this more; as all that know me, can teſtifie: For having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured many heats and colds, and other
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65894:91"/>
like diſcommodities of the body, and troubles of the mind, all theſe did hurt me little, whereas they hurt them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much who live intemperately. For when my brother and others of my kindred ſaw ſome great powerful men pick quarrels againſt me, fearing leſt I ſhould be overthrown, they were poſſeſſed with a deep Melancholy (a thing uſual to diſorderly lives) which increaſed ſo much in them, that it brought them to a ſudden end. But I, whom that matter ought to have affected moſt, received no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience thereby, becauſe that humor abounded not in me.</p>
            <p>Nay, I began to perſwade my ſelf, that this ſuit and contention was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Divine Providence, that I might know what great power a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and temperate life hath over our bodies and minds, and that at length I ſhould be a conqueror, as alſo a little after it came to paſs: For in the end I got the victory, to my great honor, and no leſs profit: whereupon alſo I joyed exceedingly; which exceſs of joy neither could do me any hurt.

which it is manifeſt, That neither melancholy, nor any other paſſion can hurt a temperate life.</p>
            <p>Moreover I ſay, That even bruiſes and ſquats, and falls, which often kill others, can bring little grief or hurt to thoſe that are temperate. This I found by experience, when I was Seventy years old: for riding in a Coach in great haſte, it happened that the Coach was overturned, and then was dragged for a good ſpace by the fury of the horſes, whereby my head and whole body was ſore hurt, and alſo one of my arms and legs put out of joynt. Being carried home, when the Phyſicians ſaw in what caſe I was, they concluded that I would die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Three days. Nevertheleſs at a venture Two Remedies might be uſed, letting of blood, and purging, that the ſtore of humors, and inflamation, and fever (which was certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected) might be hindred.</p>
            <p>But I, conſidering what an orderly life I had led for many years together, which muſt needs ſo temper the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the body, that they could
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65894:96"/>
not be much troubled, or make a great concourſe, refuſed both remedies, and only commanded that my arm and leg ſhould be ſet, and my whole body anointed with oyl: and ſo without other remedy or inconvenience I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; which ſeemed as a miracle to the Phyſicians. Whence I conclude, That they that live a temperate life, can receive little hurt from other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.</p>
            <p>But my experience taught me ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing alſo, to wit, That an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and regular life can hardly be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered without exceeding great danger.</p>
            <p>About Four years ſince, I was led by the advice of Phyſicians, and the daily importunity of my friends, to add ſomething to my uſual ſtint and meaſure. Divers reaſons they brought, as, that old age could not be ſuſtained with ſo little meat and drink; which yet needs not only to be ſuſtained, but alſo to gather ſtrength, which could not be but by meat and drink. On the other ſide I argued, that Nature was contented with a little, and that I had for many years continued in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65894:97"/>
good health, with that little meaſure; that Cuſtom was turned into Nature, and therefore it was agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that my years increaſing, and ſtrength decreaſing, my ſtint of meat and drink ſhould be diminiſhed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than increaſed; that the patient might be proportionable to the agent, and eſpecially ſince the power of my ſtomach every day decreaſed. To this agreed two Italian Proverbs, the one whereof was, <note n="*" place="margin">Mangerà più, chi manco man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia. Ed è contrario. Chi più onangia, manco man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia. Il ſenſo, è Poco vive; chi treppo ſparechia.</note> 
               <hi>He that will eat much, let him eat little;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by eating little he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs his life. The other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb was, <note n="*" place="margin">Fa più pro quel' che ſi laſcia ſul' tondo, che quel' che ſi mette nel ventre.</note> 
               <hi>The meat which remaineth, profits more than that which is eaten.</hi> By which is intimated, that the hurt of too much meat is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than the commodity of meat taken in a moderate proportion.</p>
            <p>But all theſe things could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me againſt their importunities. Therefore, to avoid obſtinacy, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie my friends, at lengh I yielded, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65894:97"/>
permitted the quantity of meat to be increaſed, yet but Two ounces only. For whereas before the meaſure of my whole days meat, <hi>viz.</hi> of my bread, and eggs, and fleſh, and broth, was 12 ounces exactly weighed; I increaſed it to the quantity of 2 ounces more: and the meaſure of my drink, which before was 14 ounces, I made now 16.</p>
            <p>This addition after ten days wrought ſo much upon me, that of a chearful and merry man I became melancholy and cholerick; ſo that all things were troubleſome to me: neither did I know well, what I did or ſaid. On the Twelfth day, a pain of the ſide took me, which held me Two and twenty hours. Upon the neck of it came a terrible fever, which continued Thirty five days and nights; although after the Fifteenth day it grew leſs and leſs. Beſides all this, I could not ſleep, no not a quarter of an hour: whereupon all gave me for dead.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, I by the grace of God cured my ſelf, only with returning to my former courſe of Diet, although I was now Seventy eight years old, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65894:98"/>
my body ſpent with extream leanneſs, and the ſeaſon of the year was winter and moſt cold air. And I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that under God nothing holp me, but that exact rule which I had ſo long continued. In all which time I felt no grief, ſave now then a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition for a day or Two.</p>
            <p>For the Temperance of ſo many years ſpent all ill humors, and ſuffered not any new of that kind to ariſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the good humors to be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or contract any ill quality, as uſually happens in old mens bodies, which live without rule. For there is no malignity of old age in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of my body, which commonly kills men. And that new one, which I contracted by breaking my diet, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was a ſore evil, yet had no power to kill me.</p>
            <p>By this it may clearly be perceived, how great is the power of order and diſorder; whereof the one kept me well for many years; the other, though it was but a little exceſs, in a few days had ſo ſoon overthrown me. If the world conſiſt of order, if our corporal
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65894:98"/>
life depend on the harmony of humors and elements, it is no wonder that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould preſerve, and diſorder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. Order makes arts eaſie, and armies victorious, and retains and confirms kingdoms, cities, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in peace. Whence I conclude, that an orderly life is the moſt ſure way and ground of health and long days, and the true and only medicine of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Neither can any man deny this, who will narrowly conſider it. Hence it comes, that a Phyſician, when he cometh to viſit his Patient, preſcribes this Phyſick firſt, That he uſe a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diet: and when he hath cured him, commends this alſo to him, if he will live in health. Neither is it to be doubted, but that he ſhall ever after live free from diſeaſes, if he will keep ſuch a courſe of life; becauſe this will cut off all cauſes of diſeaſes, ſo that he ſhall need neither Phyſick nor Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician: yea, if he will give his mind to thoſe things which he ſhould, he will prove himſelf a Phyſician, and that a very compleat one: For indeed no man
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65894:99"/>
can be a perfect Phyſician to another, but to himſelf only. The reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this, Every one by long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may know the qualities of his own nature, and what hidden pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties it hath, what meat and drink agrees beſt with it; which things in others cannot be known without ſuch obſervation, as is not eaſily to be made upon others; eſpecially ſince there is a greater diverſity of tempers, than of faces. Who would believe that old wine ſhould hurt my ſtomach, and new ſhould help it; or that cinnamon ſhould heat me more than pepper? What Phyſician could have diſcovered theſe hidden qualities to me, if I had not found them out by long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience? Wherefore one to another can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a perfect Phyſician. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I conclude, ſince none can have a better Phyſician than himſelf, nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Phyſick than a Temperate Life; Temperance by all means is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, I deny not but that Phyſicians are neceſſary, and greatly to be eſteemed for the knowing and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65894:99"/>
curing of diſeaſes, into which they often fall, who live diſorderly: For if a friend who viſits thee in thy ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and only comforts and condoles, doth perform an acceptable thing to thee; how much more dearly ſhould a Phyſician be eſteemed, who not only as a friend doth viſit thee, but help thee!</p>
            <p>But that a man may preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in health, I adviſe, that inſtead of a Phyſician a regular life is to be imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, which, as is manifeſt by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is a natural Phyſick moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us, and alſo doth preſerve even ill tempers in good health, and procure that they prolong their life even to a hundred years and more, and that at length they ſhut up their days like a Lamp, only by a pure conſumption of the radical moiſture, without grief or perturbation of humors. Many have thought that this could be done by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum potabile,</hi> or the <hi>Philoſophers-ſtone,</hi> ſought of many, and found of few. But ſurely there is no ſuch matter, if Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance be wanting.</p>
            <p>But ſenſual men (as moſt are) deſiring to ſatisfie their Appetite, and pamper
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65894:100"/>
their belly, although they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ill-handled by their intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet ſhun a ſober life: becauſe they ſay, It is better to pleaſe the Appetite (though they live Ten years leſs than otherwiſe they ſhould do) than always to live under bit and bridle. But they conſider not, of how great moment Ten years are in mature age, wherein wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and all kind of vertues is moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous; which, but in that age, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perfected. And that I may ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of other things, are not almoſt all the learned books that we have, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by their Authors in that age, and thoſe Ten years, which they ſet at nought in regard of their belly?</p>
            <p>Beſides, theſe Belly-gods ſay, that an orderly life is ſo hard a thing that it cannot be kept. To this I anſwer, that <hi>Galen</hi> kept it, and held it, for the beſt Phyſick: ſo did <hi>Plato</hi> alſo, and <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> and many others of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; and in our age, <hi>Paul the Third,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Bembo,</hi> who therefore lived ſo long; and among other Dukes, <hi>Laudus,</hi> and <hi>Donatus,</hi> and many others of inferior condition, not only in the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65894:100"/>
city, but alſo in villages and hamlets:</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſince many have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a regular life, both of old times and later years, it is no ſuch thing which may not be performed; eſpecially ſince in obſerving it, there needs not many and curious things, but only that a man ſhould begin and by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle accuſtom himſelf unto it.</p>
            <p>Neither, doth it hinder, that <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, That they who are imployed in the common-wealth, cannot live regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, becauſe they muſt often endure heats, and colds, and winds, and ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and divers labors, which ſuit not with an orderly life: For I anſwer, that thoſe inconveniences are of no great moment (as I ſhewed before) if a man be temperate in meat and drink; which is both eaſie for common-weals-men, and very convenient, both that they may preſerve themſelves from diſeaſes, which hinder publick imployment; as alſo that their mind, in all things wherein they deal, may be more lively and vigorous.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, he which lives a regular life, eating always light meats,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65894:101"/>
and in a little quantity, what diet ſhall he uſe in diſeaſes, which being in health he hath anticapated? I anſwer firſt; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which endeavors to preſerve a man as much as ſhe can, teacheth us how to govern our ſelves in ſickneſs: For ſuddenly it takes away our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, ſo that we can eat but a very little, wherewith ſhe is very well contented: So that a ſick man, whether he hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved heretofore orderly or diſorderly, when he is ſick, ought not to eat, but ſuch meats as are agreeable to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and that in much ſmaller quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than when he was well. For if he ſhould keep his former proportion; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is already burdened with a diſeaſe, would be wholly oppreſſed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I anſwer better, That he which lives a temperate life, cannot fall into diſeaſes, and but very ſeldom into indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; Becauſe Temperance takes away the cauſes of diſeaſes; and the cauſe being taken away, there is no place for the effect.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſince an orderly life is ſo profitable, ſo vertuous, ſo decent, and ſo holy it is worthy by all means to be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65894:101"/>
imbraced; eſpecially ſince it is eaſie and moſt agreeable to the Nature of Man. No man that follows it, is bound to eat and drink ſo little as I: No man is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to eat fruit or fiſh, which I eat not: For I eat little, becauſe a little ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth my weak ſtomach: and I abſtain from fruit, and fiſh, and the like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hurt me. But they who find benefit in theſe meats, may, yea ought to uſe them: yet all muſt needs take heed, leſt they take a greater quantity of any meat or drink (though moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to them) then their ſtomach can eaſily digeſt: So that he which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with no kind of meat and drink, hath the <hi>quantity,</hi> and not the <hi>quality</hi> for his rule, which is very eaſie to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>Let no man here object unto me, That there are many, who though they live diſorderly, yet continue in health to their lives end: Becauſe, ſince this is at the beſt but uncertain, dangerous, and very rare, the preſuming upon it ought not to lead us to a diſorderly life.</p>
            <p>It is not the part of a wiſe man, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf to ſo many dangers of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65894:102"/>
and death, only upon a hope of an happy iſſue, which yet befalls very few. An old man of an ill conſtitution, but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving orderly, is more ſure of life, than the moſt ſtrong young man who lives diſorderly.</p>
            <p>But ſome, too much given to Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, object, that a long life is no ſuch deſirable thing, becauſe that after one is once Sixty five years old, all the time we live after, is rather death than life. But theſe err greatly, as I will ſhew by my ſelf, recounting the delights and pleaſures in this age of 83, which now I take, and which are ſuch, as that men generally account me happy.</p>
            <p>I am continually in health, and I am ſo nimble, that I can eaſily get on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back without the advantage of the ground, and ſometimes I go up high ſtairs and hills on foot. Then, I am ever chearful, merry, and well-contented, free from all troubles and troubleſome thoughts; in whoſe place, joy and peace have taken up their ſtanding in my heart. I am not weary of life, which I paſs with great delight. I confer often with worthy men, excelling in wit,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65894:102"/>
learning, behavior, and other vertues. When I cannot have their company, I give my ſelf to the reading of ſome learned book, and afterwards to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; makinglit my aim in all things, how I may help others to the furtheſt of my power.</p>
            <p>All theſe things I do at my eaſe, and at fit ſeaſons, and in mine own houſes; which, beſides that they are in the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place of this learned City of <hi>Padua,</hi> are very beautiful and convenient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove moſt in this age, being ſo built by me according to the rules of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, that they are coll in ſummer, and warm in winter.</p>
            <p>I enjoy aſo my gardens, and thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, parted with rills of running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which truly is very delightful. Sometimes of the year I injoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the <hi>Euganean</hi> hills, where alſo I have fountains and gardens, and a very convenient houſe. At other times, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to a village of mine; ſeated in the valley; which is therefore very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, becauſe many ways thither are ſo ordered, that they all meet and end in a fain plot of ground; in the midſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65894:103"/>
whereof is a Church ſuitable to the condition of the place. This place is waſhed with the river <hi>Brenta;</hi> on both ſides whereof are great and fruitful fields, well manured and adorned: with many habitations. In former time it was not ſo, becauſe the place was mooriſh and unhealthy, fitter for beaſts than men. But I drained the ground, and made the air good: Whereupon men flockt thither, and built houſes with happy ſucceſs. By this means the place is come to that perfection we now ſee it is: So that I can truly ſay, that I have both given God a Temple, and men to worſhip him in it: The memory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is exceeding delightful to me.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I ride to ſome of the neighbor cities, that I may enjoy the ſight &amp; communication of my friends, as alſo of excellent Artificers in <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, painting, ſtone-cutting, muſick,</hi> and <hi>husbandry,</hi> whereof in this age there is great plenty. I view their pieces, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with thoſe of Antiquity; and ever I learn ſomewhat which is worthy of my knowledg: I ſurvey <hi>places, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, antiquities,</hi> publick <hi>fabricks, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:65894:103"/>
and <hi>fortifications:</hi> neither omit I any thing that may either teach, or delight me. I am much pleaſed alſo in my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, with the beauty of ſituation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this my pleaſure made leſs by the decaying dulneſs of my ſenſes, which are all in their perfect vigor, but eſpecially my Taſte; ſo that any ſimple fare is more ſavoury to me now, than heretofore, when I was given to diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and all the delights that could be.</p>
            <p>To change my bed, troubles me not; I ſleep well and quietly any where, and my dreams are fair and pleaſant. But this chiefly delights me, that my advice hath taken effect in the reducing of many rude and untoiled places in my country, to cultivation and good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry. I was one of thoſe that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for the managing of that work, and abode in thoſe fenny places two whole months in the heat of ſummer (which in <hi>Italy</hi> is very great) receiving not any hurt or inconvenience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: So great is the power and efficacy of that <hi>Temperance</hi> which ever accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the delights and ſolaces of

my old age, which is altogether to be preferred before others youth: Becauſe that by <hi>Temperance</hi> and the <hi>Grace of God</hi> I feel not thoſe perturbations of body and mind, wherewith infinite both young and old are afflicted.</p>
            <p>Moreover, by this alſo, in what eſtate I am, may be diſcovered, becauſe at theſe years <hi>(viz.</hi> 83.) I have made a moſt pleaſant Comedy, full of honeſt wit and merriment: which kind of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems uſeth to be the child of Youth, which it moſt ſuits withal for variety and pleaſantneſs; as a Tragedy with old Age, by reaſon of the ſad events which it contains. And if a <hi>Greek Poet</hi> of old was praiſed, that at the age of 73 years he writ a Tragedy; why ſhould I be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted leſs happy, or leſs my ſelf, who being Ten years older have made a Comedy?</p>
            <p>Now leſt there ſhould be any delight wanting to my old age, I daily behold a kind of immortality in the ſucceſſion of my poſterity. For when I come home, I find eleven grand-children of mine, all the ſons of one father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all in perfect health; all, as far as I
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65894:104"/>
can conjecture, very apt and well given both for learning and behavior. I am delighted with their muſick and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, and I my ſelf alſo ſing often; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have now a clearer voice, than ever I had in my life.</p>
            <p>By which it is evident, That the life which I live at this age, is not a dead, dumpiſh, and ſower life; but chearful, lively and pleaſant. Neither, if I had my wiſh, would I change age and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution with them who follow their youthful appetites, although they be of a moſt ſtrong temper: Becauſe ſuch are daily expoſed to a thouſand dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and deaths, as daily experience ſheweth, and I alſo, when I was a young man, too well found. I know how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate that age is, and, though ſubject to death, yet continually afraid of it: For death to all young men is a terrible thing, as alſo to thoſe that live in ſin, and follow their appetites: whereas I by the experience of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years have learned to give way to Reaſon: whence it ſeems to me, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſhameful thing to fear that which cannot be avoided; but alſo I hope,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65894:105"/>
when I ſhall come ta that point, I ſhall find no little comfort in the favor of Jeſus Chriſt. Yet I am ſure, that my end is far from me: for I know that (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting caſualties aſide) I ſhall not die but by a pure reſolution: becauſe that by the regularity of my life I have ſhut out death all other ways. And that is a fair and deſirable death, which Nature brings by way of reſolution.</p>
            <p>Since therefore a Temperate life is ſo happy and pleaſant a thing; what remains, but that I ſhould wiſh all who have the care of themſelves, to imbrace it with open arms?</p>
            <p>Many things more might be ſaid in commendation hereof: but leſt in any thing I forſake that <hi>Temperance</hi> which I have found ſo good, I here make an End.</p>

               <hi>A DISCOURSE Tranſlated out of</hi> Italian, That a Spare Diet is better than a Splendid and Sumptuous.</head>
            <head type="sub">A PARADOX.</head>
            <p>I Verily believe, however I have ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled this opinion, yet it will by no means be allowed for a <hi>Paradox</hi> by a number of thoſe, whoſe judgment ought to bear the greateſt ſway. And, to ſpeak freely, it would ſeem to me very uncouth, that any man that makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of more underſtanding than a beaſt, ſhould open his mouth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, or make any ſcruple at all of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſubſcribing to the truth and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this Poſition, <hi>That a frugal and ſimple Diet is much better than a full and dainty.</hi> Tell me, you that ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur on the buſineſs, whether a ſober &amp; auſtere diet ſerves not without further help to chaſe away that racking humor of the Gout, which by all other helps that can be be uſed, ſcarce receives any mitigation at all; but, do what can be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65894:106"/>
done, lies tormenting the body, till it have ſpent it ſelf. Tell me whether this holy Medicine ſerve not to the driving away of Head-ach, to the cure of Dizzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to the ſtopping of Rheums, to the ſtay of fluxes, to the getting away of loathſome Itches, to the freedom from diſhoneſt Belchings, to the prevention of Agues, and, in a word, to the clearing and draining of all ill Humors whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in the body. Nor do the benefits thereof ſtay only in the Body, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend likewiſe to the perfecting of the, Soul it ſelf: for how manifeſt is it, That through a ſober &amp; ſtrict diet, the Mind &amp; all the faculties thereof become wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, quick, and chearful! How is the Wit ſharpened, the Underſtanding ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, the Affections tempered, and; in a word, the whole ſoul and ſpirit of a man freed from incumbrances, &amp; made apt &amp; expedite for the apprehenſion of wiſdom, &amp; the imbracement of vertue!</p>
            <p>The Ancient Sages were (I am ſure) of this opinion: and <hi>Plato</hi> in particular made notable remonſtrance of it; when upon his coming into <hi>Sicily</hi> from <hi>Athens,</hi> he did ſo bitterly condemn the <hi>Siracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:65894:106"/>
Tables, which being furniſhed with precious and dainty cates, provoking ſauces, and rich wines, ſent away their gueſts twice a day full of good chear. But what wouldſt thou have ſaid, Oh <hi>Plato,</hi> if thou hadſt perhaps light upon ſuch as we Chriſtians now adays are; amongſt whom, he that eats but two good meals a day (as we term them) boaſts himſelf, and is applauded by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for a perſon of great Temperance and ſingular good diet? Undoubtedly; our extravagancy in this matter (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving added <hi>Prologues</hi> of Break-faſts, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terludes</hi> of Banquets, and <hi>Epilogues</hi> of Rere-ſuppers to the <hi>Comedy)</hi> would have cauſed thee to turn thy divine Eloquence to the praiſe of thoſe <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Gluttons, which, in reſpect of our u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and cuſtoms, might ſeem great Maſters of Temperance. Nay, very <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf, however (he may thank <hi>Tullies</hi> ſlanders) his name is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in this regard ſo infamous, yet placed his chief delight this way in no greater dainties than Savoury Herbs; &amp; Freſh Cheeſe. But I would fain once underſtand from theſe Belly-gods, that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65894:107"/>
ſeem born only to waſte good meat, what the reaſon may be. That now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days the ſtore of victuals is ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and the price inhaunſed of that it was in time of old; when yet the world appears to have been then much fuller of people then it now is. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, That ſcarcity and dearneſs, under which we labor, can proceed from nothing but our exceſſive Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which devours things faſter than Nature can bring them forth. And that plenty and cheapneſs, which crowned their happy days, was maintained and kept on foot chiefly through the good husbandry of that <hi>frugal and ſimple Diet</hi> which they uſed. S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> writing of the courſe of life held by thoſe good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that retired themſelves into the deſerts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the better to ſerve God, tell us, That they were ſo inamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Spare and Simple Diet, that they cenſured it in themſelves for a kind of Riot, to feed on any thing that was dreſt with Fire. The ſame in every point doth <hi>Caſſian</hi> report, in his Relations of the Holy <hi>Monks</hi> &amp; <hi>Hermits</hi> of his time.</p>
            <p>I find in Ancient Phyſicians, that the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65894:107"/>
inhabitants of the old world were ſuch ſtrict followers of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> that they Kept themſelves preciſely to Bread in the morning; and at night they made their Supper of Fleſh only, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Sauces, or any firſt or ſecond courſes. And by this means it came to paſs, that they lived ſo long and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual health, without ſo much as once hearing the names of thoſe many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous infirmities, that now adays vex mankind. What think you might be the cauſe, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> and the <hi>Portugals</hi> paſſed ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of years, without having any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance at all with Phyſick or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians? Surely nothing elſe but their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſpare Diet; which, when all is done, we are ofttimes conſtrained to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, and ever indeed directed &amp; adviſed unto, by thoſe who really practiſe this Divine Science of Phyſick, for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and conſervation of their patients health, &amp; not covetouſly for their own gain. I read in approved Hiſtories, that <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> upon ſome occaſion or other outriding his followers in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was ſo preſſed with hunger, that he was fain to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65894:108"/>
call in at a poor mans cottage, who brought him a piece of Rie-bread; which when he had eaten, he took a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn oath, That he never in all his life had taſted better; nor more pleaſing meat: And from that day forward, he ſet light by all the coſtly ſorts of bread, which he had been formerly accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto. The <hi>Thracian</hi> women, that they might bear healthful, ſtrong, and hardy children, eat nothing but Milk and Nettles. And the greateſt dainties that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had amongſt them, was a certain kind of black Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that looked no better than melted pitch, and could not by computation ſtand in above three half pence a gallon at the moſt. The <hi>Perſians,</hi> that in their time were the beſt diſciplined people on the earth, eat a little <note n="*" place="margin">Creſſes, or wild Mint.</note> 
               <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturtium</hi> with their bread; &amp; that was all the victuals that this brave Nation uſed, when they made conqueſt of the world. <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> the brother of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> being overthrown in battel, was conſtrained in his flight to ſit downwith dry Figs and Barly bread; which upon proof he found ſo good, as he ſeriouſly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65894:108"/>
lamented his misfortune, on having (through the continual cloying of arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial dainties, wherewith he had been bred up) been ſo long time a ſtranger to that great pleaſure and delight, which natural and ſimple food yields, when it meets with true hunger. True it is, our belly is a troubleſom Creditor, and ofttimes ſhameleſly exacts more than its due: but undoubtedly, if we were not partial, and corrupted by the allurements of that baſe content which dainties promiſe, we might eaſily quiet the grudgings &amp; murmurings thereof.</p>
            <p>It's not the Belly (I wiſh) which would reſt well enough apayed with that which is at hand; but the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our capricious Phanſies, that makes us wear out our ſelves, &amp; weary all the world beſides with unceſſant travel in the ſearch of Rarities, and in the compounding of new Delicacies. If we were but half as wiſe as we ought to be, there need none of all this ado that we make, about this and that kind of Manchet, Dutch-bread; and French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread: and I know not what new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are brought on foot, to make
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65894:109"/>
more buſineſs in the world; whereas with much leſs coſt &amp; trouble we might be much better ſerved with that which grows at home, &amp; is to be found ready in every thatcht cottage. That which is moſt our own, &amp; that which we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perhaps (fools as we be) moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn in this kind, Barley-bread I mean, is by all the old Phyſicians warranted for a moſt ſound and healthful food: He that eats daily of it, ſay they, ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly never be troubled with the Gout in the feet. Shew me ſuch a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in any of theſe new inventions, and I'le yield there were ſome reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in making uſe of them, if they might with eaſe and quiet be procured. But to buy them at the price of ſo much pains, time, and hazard as they coſt us, were undoubtedly too much, although they brought aſmuch benefit as they do prejudice. Conſider well (I pray) whether it be not a thing to make a wiſe man run beſide himſelf, to ſee ſuch a ranſacking of all the Elements by <hi>Fiſhers,</hi> and <hi>Fowlers,</hi> and <hi>Hunters;</hi> ſuch a turmoiling of the world by <hi>Cooks</hi> and <hi>Comfit-makers,</hi> and <hi>Tavern-keepers,</hi> and a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65894:109"/>
numberleſs many of ſuch needleſs oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations; ſuch a hazarding of mens lives on Sea and Land, by heat &amp; cold, and a thouſand other dangers and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: and all forſooth in procuring dainties for the ſatisfaction of a greedy Maw, and ſenſleſs Belly, that within a very ſhort while after muſt of neceſſity make a banquet of it ſelf to worms.</p>
            <p>What an endleſs maze of error, what an intolerable hell of torments and afflictions hath this wicked <hi>Gluttony</hi> brought the world unto! And yet, wretched men that we are, we have no mind to get out of it, but like ſilly Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals led by the chaps, go on all day long, digging our Graves with our Teeth, till at laſt we bring the Earth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our heads much before we other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe need to have done. And yet there was a certain odd fellow once in the world (I would there were not too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſame mind now adays!) <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loxenus</hi> by name, that ſeriouſly wiſht he might have a ſwallow as long and as large as the Cranes, the better to injoy the full reliſh of his licoriſh morſels. Long after him, I read of another of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65894:110"/>
ſame fraternity, <hi>Apitius,</hi> I trow, that ſet all his happineſs in good chear: but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle credit (I am ſure) he hath got by the means; no more than <hi>Maximinus,</hi> for all he was an Emperor, by his uſing every meal to ſtuff into his paunch thirty pounds of fleſh, beſide bread and wine to boot. But <hi>Get a</hi> deſerves in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Monarchy of <hi>Gluttons,</hi> as he had of the <hi>Romans:</hi> His feaſts went always according to the letters of the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet: as when <hi>P</hi>'s turn came, he would haye <hi>Plovers,</hi> &amp; <hi>Partridges,</hi> &amp; <hi>Peacocks,</hi> and the like; and ſo in all the reſt, his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was always furniſhed with meats whoſe names began with one and the ſame letter. But what do I raking up this carrion? Let them rot in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, &amp; lie more covered over with Infamy then with Earth. Only, to give the world notice who have been the great Maſters of this worthy Science of filling the belly and following good chear, I have been inforced to make this remembrance of ſome of their goodly opinions and pranks. Which let who ſo will be their partner in: for my part, I ſolemnly avow, that I find no
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65894:110"/>
greater miſery than to <hi>victual the Camp</hi> (as the Proverb is) cramming in luſtily over night, and to be bound next morning to riſe early, and to go about ſerious buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Oh what a piece of Purgatory is it, to feel within a mans ſelf thoſe <hi>Qualmes,</hi> thoſe <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,</hi> thoſe <hi>Swimmings,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Fluſhing heats,</hi> that follow upon over eating! And what a ſhame (if our foreheads were not of braſs, and our-friends before whom we act them, infected with the ſame diſeaſe) would it be, to ſtand <hi>yawning, ſtretching,</hi> and <hi>perbreaking</hi> the crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the former days ſurfet!</p>
            <p>On the contrary, what a happineſs do I prove, when after <hi>a ſober pittance</hi> I find ſound and quiet ſleep all night long, and at peep of day get up as freſh as the morning it ſelf, full of vigor and activity both in Mind and Body, for all manner of affairs! Let who will take his pleaſure in the fulneſs of delicates: I deſire my part may be in this happy injoyment of my ſelf, although it ſhould be with the abatement of much more content than any dainties can afford.</p>
            <p>When I was laſt at <hi>Meſſina,</hi> my Lord <hi>Antony Doria</hi> told me, that he was acquainted in <hi>Spain</hi> with an old man, who had lived above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years. One day having invited him home and entertained him ſumptuouſly, as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips manner is, the good old man inſtead of thanks told him, <hi>My Lord, had I been accuſtomed to theſe kind of meals in my youth, I had never come to this age which you ſee, nor been able to preſerve that health and ſtrength both of Mind and Body, which you make ſhew ſo much to admire in m.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:65894:111"/>
See now! here's a proof even in our Age, That the length and happineſs of mens lives in the old world was chiefly cauſed by the means of Bleſſed <hi>Temperance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what need more word, in a matter as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident as the Sun at noon-day, to all but thoſe whoſe Brains are ſunk down into the <hi>Quagmire</hi> of their Bellies? I'le make an end with that which cannot be denied, nor deluded, nor reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo plain is the truth, and ſo great is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Argument; and this it is: Peruſe all Hiſtories of whatever times and people, and you ſhall always find the haters of a Sober Life and Spare Diet to have been ſworn enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt virtue and goodneſs: Witneſs <hi>Claudius, Caligula, Heliogabalus, Clodius</hi> the Tragedian, <hi>Vitellius, Verus, Tiberius,</hi> and the like: And on the contrary, the friends and followers of Sobriety and Frugality, to have been men of divine ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and moſt heroical performances for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of mankind; Such as were <hi>Auguſtus, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Severus, Paulus Aemilius, Epaminondas, Socrates,</hi> and all the reſt who are regiſtred for excellent in the liſts of Princes, Soldiers, and Philoſophers.</p>
            <p>A ſpare diet then is better than a ſplendid and ſumptuous, let the <hi>Sardanapaluſes</hi> of our age prattle what they liſt. Nature, and Reaſon, and Experience, and the Example of all vertuous perſons prove it to be ſo. He that goes about to perſwade me otherwiſe, ſhall loſe his labor, though he had his tongue and brain furniſhed with all the Sophiſtry and Eloquence; that ever <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> could joyntly have afforded,</p>
