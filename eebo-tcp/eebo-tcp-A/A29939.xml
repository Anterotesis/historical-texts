            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU cannot but remember, that at our laſt Meeting, there
happened betwixt us, a hot diſpute touching Co-ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
occaſioned by your reading the day before a Tract,
not long ſince expoſed to publick view, and Intituled,
by the Author thereof, <hi>An Account of the Growth of Knavery,</hi> &amp;c. In
a Letter to a Friend, (In Anſwer to Two Pamphlets, the one ſtyled,
<hi>An Account of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary Government in</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;
The other, <hi>A ſeaſonable Argument to perſwade all the Grand
Juries in</hi> England to <hi>Petition for a New Parliament;</hi>) in which ſaid
Tract there are ſome Paſſages that ſeem very diſtaſtful to your Palat,
but more eſpecially that Sentence (pag. 44 &amp; 45.) concerning the
Legiſlative Power thus expreſſed by our Author.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Making of Laws (ſayes he) is a peculiar and incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Priviledge of the Supream Power; And the Office of the
Two Houſes in this Caſe, is only Conſultive or Preparative, but
the Character of the Power, reſts in the Final Sanction, which
is in the King; and effectually the paſſing of a Bill is but the
Granting of a Requeſt; The Two Houſes make the Bill 'tis true,
but the King makes the Law, and 'tis the Stamp, and not the
Matter that makes it Currant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This piece of Doctrine [ſay you] is very ſtrong and Heterodox;
for it contradicts, not only your own darling Sentiments, but alſo
the opinion of many other Perſons in this Nation, who hold, That
the Legiſlature reſides not in the King only, but in him, and in the
Two Houſes of Parliament; ſo that you, and thoſe other Perſons
fancy a Mixture, or Co-ordinacy in the Supremacy it ſelf, making
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy a Compound of Three Co-ordinate Eſtates.</p>
            <p>This ſame opinion [ſay you] is founded upon the Authority of
the Law Books, which tell us, That every Statute muſt be made
by the King, Lords and Commons; And if it appear by the Act.
that it is made by Two of them only, it is no Statute, as appears
by 4 <hi>H. 7. 18. b. Co. Lit. 139. b. Co. 4. Inſt. f. 25. Co. 2. Inſt. 157.
158. 334. Bulſtrods</hi> Reports, <hi>Dominus Rex &amp; Alleu, v. Tooley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe ſame Authorities I allow as well as you, but then it muſt
be with this diſtinction, that the Two Houſe of Parliament, are
in a ſort Co-ordinate with His Majeſty <hi>Ad aliquid</hi> to ſome Act, or
Exerciſing the Supream Power, that is to ſay, there is an equal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57704:3"/>
Right in the King and the Two Houſes of a Negative Voice in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of new Laws to be Enacted, or old to be repealed; But if
you intend by Co-ordination (as indeed you do) a Fellowſhip
with the King, in the very Supremacy it ſelf, you are much beſide
the Cuſhion, and truly in the wrong ſide of the Hedge too. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is repugnant to the nature thereof, and a clear Contradiction,
If it be true as it is, that the King is our only Soveraign, there can
be no ſuch thing, as a Co-ordinate or Co-equal Power; If they be
Co-partners in the Soveraignty, in what a fine Condition are we,
that muſt be obliged to Impoſſibilities. For we must obey three
Maſters, Commanding contrary things. The Two Houſes may as
well injoyn us to do them Homage, which is, and ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
only to the King, as to challenge a Corrival Power with the
Soveraignty of Royalty. 'Tis true, no Law can be impoſed on us,
without the conſent of the Two Houſes, yet this doth not make
them Co-ordinate with their Prince in the very Supremacy of Power
it ſelf, but ſtill leaves the Power of Ordaining Supreamly in him
as in the Fountain, though the Efflux or Exerciſe of that Power be
not ſolely in his Will, but expects the Conſent of his People; And
therefore 'tis very curiouſly expreſſed by the Learned Mr. <hi>Hooker,
That Laws do not take their Conſtraining Force from the Quality of ſuch
as deviſe them, but from the Power that doth give them the ſtrength of
Laws: Le Roy le veult,</hi> the King will have it ſo, is the Interpretative
Phraſe pronounced at the King's paſſing of every Act of Parliament:
<q>And it was (ſayes Sir <hi>Henry Filmer</hi> in that moſt excellent diſcourſe
called <hi>Patriarcha</hi>) the Antient Cuſtom for a long time, till the
dayes of <hi>H.</hi> 5. that the Kings, when any Bill was brought unto
them, that had paſſed Both Houſes, to take and pick out what
they liked not, and ſo much as they choſe was Enacted for a Law:
but the Cuſtom of the later Kings hath been ſo Gracious, as to
allow alwayes of the entire Bill (and ſometimes with a Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too) as it hath paſſed both Houſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So much (Sir) in general, touching your fancied Corrivality of
Power, I come now to a more cloſe and minute Application, and I
argue thus:</p>
            <p>If the Two Houſes have a Joynt and Co-equal Authority with
their King in making Laws and the like, it muſt be one of theſe
two wayes, either it muſt be <hi>Primitively</hi> Seated in them, or it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them by <hi>derivative participation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, the Two Houſes of Parliament cannot have this Co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Power veſted in them Primitively or Radically; For are not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57704:3"/>
Both Houſes Summoned by the King's Writ? Do they not fit in
Parliament by Virtue only of the Authority Royal? Can either
the Lords or Commons or both together Lawfully convene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
appoint the time and place of their own Meeting? Our
Books of Law can tell you (Sir) that the Power of Convocating
and keeping of Aſſemblies of Subjects; the Power of Calling, Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Proroguing of Parliaments is an Eſſential Part, and Inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Privilege of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regality.</p>
            <p>All able Juriſts and Polititians very well know, that the King is
<hi>Caput Principium &amp; Finis Parliamenti,</hi> ſolely made and Created by
him, and into him only can be ultimately reſolved; And therefore
ſurely it muſt be the moſt unreaſonable thing that ever was in the
World, that Subjects Aſſembled by their Soveraign's Writ, ſhould
have a Co-equality of Power with their Prince, without whoſe call
they could not meet together, and at whoſe will and pleaſure they
are Diſſolved in Law, and bound to betake themſelves to their own
Habitations: And return to the <hi>Statu quo</hi> of Private Perſons and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
whereas Supremacy is a Publick and indelible Character of
Lawful Authority.</p>
            <p>But farther, can the Two Houſes of Parliament pretend to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Firſt King in time, can they outvy him in Seniority? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
no.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 8. num. 2.</note> As for the Lords, <hi>Bracton</hi> affirms, that the Earls and Barons

            <p>But it was Objectect by you in our Diſecptation as it hath been
by others heretofore, that the very Stile of <hi>Comites</hi> and Peers, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a Co-ordinative Aſſociation with the King in the Government;
they are in Parliament His <hi>Comites,</hi> His Peers.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol. Lib. 1. c. 8. Num. 5.</note> that Mr. <hi>Bracton</hi> tells us, <hi>Rex parem non habet in Regno
ſuo,</hi> the King has no Peer, and offereth us another Reaſon of the
Stile of <hi>Comites, Quia ſunt in Comitatu,</hi> without any Relation to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
becauſe they are either in the Train of the King, of becauſe
placed in each County, <hi>ad Regendum Populum,</hi> and ſo aſſumed to
the King to the like end that <hi>Moſes</hi> did his under-Officers, in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
his People. They were not only to be Companions as to
his Perſon,<note place="margin">Pares Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, non Regis</note> but in reſpect of his Cares; <hi>Pares Curis, ſolo diademate
diſpares.</hi> They are the Higheſt, and in the nature of Privy-Counſellors,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57704:4"/>
but Created by the Soveraign Prince (the Fountain of Honour) and
ſo not equal unto him, though exalted above Fellow-Subjects. To
be ſhort, if this word <hi>[Comites]</hi> ſhould imply a Co-ordinative So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
it muſt needs follow that the Commons muſt be the King's
Peers too, for they are as much Co-ordinate with His Majeſty as
the other; And ſo let's ſet up Three Thrones, One for the King,
another for the Lords, and a Third for the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p>I would adviſe you (Sir) to make a Voyage, next long Vacati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
into <hi>France,</hi> and argue there at the <hi>French</hi> Court, from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomiation
of <hi>Pares Franciae,</hi> and ſee what Thanks you ſhall have
for your Logick. Thus much for the Lords, I muſt have a touch at
the Commons too.</p>
            <p>As for the Commons, they ſurely will not pretend to exceed the
Lords in Antiquity: If what Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> (that Famous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary)
relates, in ſome part of his <hi>Poſthuma</hi> Works, be truth;
And he hath been pleaſed in this very manner to expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As this great Court or Council, conſiſting of the King and
Barons, ruled the great Affaires of State, and Controlled all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Courts; ſo were there certain Officers, whoſe tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Power ſeemed to be ſet to bound in the Execution of
Princes Wills, as the Steward, Conſtable and Marſhal fix'd upon
Families for many Ages. They as Tribunes of the People, or
<hi>Ephori</hi> amongſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> grown by an unmannerly Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
fearful to Monarchy, fell at the Feet and Mercy of the King,
where the daring Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was ſlain at <hi>Eveſhum.</hi> This
Chance and the Dear Experience <hi>Henry</hi> the Third himſelf had
made at the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> in the Fortieth year of His
Reign, and the Memory of the many ſtreights his Father was
driven unto, eſpecially at <hi>Rumney Meade</hi> near <hi>Staues,</hi> brought

And this wrought by ſearching into the Regality, they had Uſurped

                  </note> before all Ordinances paſſed by the King and Peers) but their
Conſent in Judgments of all natures, whether Civil or Criminal.</q>
By what I have here offered out of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
before in this Diſcourſe; It is as clear as the Sun at Noon
day, That the Two Houſes of Parliament are not <hi>Co-aetaneous</hi> with
the Firſt King, much leſs before him, and conſequently the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cannot be ſaid to be Originally and Radically ſeated in the
Lords and Commons.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As I have made it appear that the Architectonick Power
Paramount of making Laws in Parliament was never Natively, and
formally ſeated in the Two Houſes, ſo I come now to prove that
the Supream Legiſlative Authority was never veſted in them, by
way of Emanation, or derivation from the Imperial Crown of this
Nation.</p>
            <p>Now if they have derivatively ſuch a power, it muſt be one of
theſe two wayes, either by way of Donation or Uſurpation: Again,
if they have it <hi>via Donationis,</hi> by way of Grant, they muſt have it
either by way of Diviſion or by way of Communication: But they
cannot challenge it by either of theſe ſame wayes.</p>
            <p>1. The Houſes of Parliament may not challenge a Co-ordination
in the Supremacy by way of Diviſion or Partition; For <hi>Suprema
poteſtas,</hi> is an Entity or being Indiviſible, as it is ſubordinate to none
but God Almighty; ſo it admitteth no <hi>Co-ordinate, Collateral, Co-equal</hi>
or <hi>Corrival Power;</hi> To make <hi>Majeſtatem in Maj<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtate, Regnum in
Regno,</hi> more than one Soveraign in a Kingdom, is inconſiſtent
with <hi>Supremity;</hi> for Supream admits neither of Equal nor Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
and to affirm it, is <hi>Contradictio in Adjecto.</hi> And therefore you
may read, that <hi>Henry de Beauchamp</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> for the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
favour that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth bare to him,<note place="margin">Co. 4. Inſt. f. 237.</note> Crowned him
King of <hi>Wight:</hi> But we could never find (ſayes <hi>Cook</hi>) and Letters
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57704:5"/>
Patents of this Creation, becauſe (as ſome hold) the King could
not by Law, Create him a King within his own Kingdom, becauſe
there cannot be Two Kings in one Kingdom, or if ſuch there be,
they are but <hi>Reguli</hi> or <hi>Proreges,</hi> Kings to their Subjects, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to the Supream King.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Oedipus</hi> King of the <hi>Thebans</hi> having Iſſue Two Sons, <hi>Polynices</hi>
and <hi>Eteocles,</hi> ordained that after his Deceaſe, his Two Sons ſhould
alternative by Courſe, Reign in his Kingdom. But what was the
event? <hi>Fratres de Regni Haereditate diſſidentes ſingulari certamine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſi
mutuis vulneribus ceciderunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let any Man look upon the Eſtate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, when
it was divided by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great amongſt his Three Sons,
<hi>Conſtantinus, Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Conſtans;</hi> Or upon the Eſtate of the
Weſtern Empire, after the Diviſion made by <hi>Lotharius, Lewis</hi> and
<hi>Charles,</hi> Sons of <hi>Lodovicus Pius;</hi> And he will find moſt ſad and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Confuſions enſued on ſuch Partitions. But letting paſs For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Conntries, we muſt not pretermit the miſerable Eſtate within this
Kingdom, under the Heptarchy until all was Re-united under one Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign;
And this is the Reaſon that in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Royal Dignity is deſcendible to the Eldeſt Daughter or
Siſter, <hi>Co. 4 Inſt. f. 243. &amp; on Lit. fol. 165. a.</hi> For <hi>Regnum non eft

            <p>2. As the Two Houſes cannot have a Co-ordinate Power with
the King, by way of Diviſion; ſo neither can they challenge to
themſelves a Co-ordination in the Supremacy it ſelf by way of
Communication; for the Prerogative of Legiſlation (as many
others) is ſo naturally intrinſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cally inherent in the Supremacy (for
where Majeſty is, there muſt be the Power Legiſlative,) that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be transferred or ſeparated from the Crown, or ſo Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to Both Houſes, as to denude or diſrobe the King of that
Sacred Supream Right which God has given to him, as his Vice-Gerent
on Earth.</p>

            <p>The ſum of all that I have ſaid as to the point of Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is this; That however the prime eſſential Conſtitutives of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,

himſelf of the Soveraign Power, nor of any of thoſe Sacred
Rights and Prerogatives that are naturally and intrinſecally inherent
in his Imperial Crown.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, as the Two Houſes cannot challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by way of Grant (that is to ſay neither by Diviſion, nor by
Communication) a Co-ordination in the very Supremacy of Power
<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſelf (and conſequently there cannot be any ſuch thing as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57704:6"/>
of Power in the Legiſlature;) ſo neither can they make
forth a good and Lawful Title to themſelves, for a Fellowſhip in the
Legiſlative Power, <hi>via uſucapionis,</hi> by virtue of any Cuſtom or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription;
For no immemorial Cuſtom can hold good, when there
be Authentical Records to the Contrary; And whether there be not
ſuch, I will appeal unto your own good ſelf.</p>
            <p>Antiently the Law Enacted began thus, <hi>Rex Statuit,</hi> the King
Ordains, and before the Laws and Statutes in each Kings Reign
from the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt to this day, I find the Title or

            <p>7. E. 1. <hi>the Statute of Mortmain,</hi> We therefore by Advice of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,

            <p>5. E. 3. <hi>Statute de Natis ultra Mare,</hi> Our Lord the King by the
Aſſent of the Prelates, Earles, Barons and other Great Men, and all the
Commons of the Realm, hath Ordained and Eſtabliſhed theſe things under
Written.</p>
            <p>3. R. 2. c. 3.—Our Lord the King, by the Advice, and
Common Conſent, &amp;c. hath Ordained and Eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>4. E. 4. c. 1.—Our Lord the King, by the Advice, Aſſent
Requeſt and Authority aforeſaid, hath Ordained and Eſtabliſhed.</p>

Advice and Aſſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of this Preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p>1. H. 7. c. 7.—The King our Soveraign Lord, by the Advice
and Aſſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, at the Supplication of
the Commons ordaineth.</p>
            <p>1. H. 8. e. 7. The King our Soveraign, by the Aſſent of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons ordaineth.</p>
            <p>1. E. 6. c. 4.—Wherefore the King our Soveraign Lord, at
the humble Petition and Suit of the Lords and Commons, doth Ordain,
Declare and Enact, by the Aſſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
and of the Commons in Parliament Aſſembled.</p>
            <p>1. Mar. c. 1.—Be it therefore Enacted by the Queens our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Lady, with the Aſſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and
of the Commons in this preſent Parliament Aſſembled.</p>

Majeſty, with the Aſſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the
Commons in this preſent Parliament Aſſembled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57704:6"/>
1. Jac. c. 2. Be it therefore Enacted by the King's Moſt Excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
by and with the Aſſent and Conſent of the Lords Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
and the Commons in this preſent Parliament Aſſembled.</p>
            <p>16. Car. 1. c. 1. Be it Enacted by the King's Moſt Excellent Majeſty,
with the Conſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons
in this preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p>12. Car. 2. nunc Regis c. 11. Be it Enacted by the King's Moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Majeſty, with the Advice and Conſent of the Lords and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in this preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thus (Sir) by the Title or Introduction of our Statutes in each
King's Reign (from King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, to this very day) it is
clearly proved, that the Two Houſes cannot challenge a Co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Power with the King in making Laws in Parliament by Uſage,
or Preſcription, the Legiſlative Authority being only in the King,
though the uſe of it be reſtrained to the Conſent of the Lords and
Commons in Parliament; <hi>Le Roy fait les Liex avec le Conſent du
Seigniors, &amp; Communs, &amp; non pas les Seigniors &amp; Communs avec le
Conſent du Roy;</hi> The King makes the Laws with the Conſent of the
Lords and Commons, and not the Lords and Commons with the
Conſent of the King: In a word, the Soveraign is the ſole Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator,
it is His Stamp and Royal Will, and that alone which gives
Life, and Being, and Title of Laws to that which was before, but
Counſel and Advice; All marks of Supremacy being ſtill in him,
nor is it an Argument of Communicating his Power, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains
himſelf from exerciſing ſome particular Acts without Conſent
of Parliament, for it is by virtue of his own Grant, that ſuch
after-Acts ſhall not be valid. He hath not divided his Legiſlative
faculty, but tyed himſelf from uſing it, except by the Advice and
Conſent of the Peers, and at the Requeſt of the Commons, their
Rogation muſt precede his Ratification. Wherefore upon what has
been ſaid, I may very well pronounce our Author's words.</p>
            <p>That the Making of Laws is a peculiar and incommunicable priviledge
of the Supream Power; And the Office of the Two Houſes in this Caſe is
only Conſultive or Preparative, but the Character of the Power, reſts in the
final Sanction which is in the King; And effectually the paſſing of a Bill
is but the granting of a Requeſt; the Two Houſes make the Bill 'tis true,
but the King makes the Law, and 'tis the Stamp, and not the Matter, that
makes it Currant.</p>
