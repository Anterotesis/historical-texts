            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>OF late, ſince the Spirit of Diſcontent hath poſſeſſed a great part of this Nation; nothing more hath been diſcourſed of and feared, next to that of the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Proteſtant Religion, than <hi>Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> which I ſuppoſe is the Rule of any Perſon or Perſons, by their own Will and Authority, without being tyed to the Rules, Methods, and Directions of the Laws of the Land, and a Converting of this moſt glorious <hi>Monarchy,</hi> into <hi>Tyranny.</hi> The fear and Jealouſie of this Government, hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, of late, fomented, among the diſcontented People, by the ſly Arts of thoſe, who are, and ever will be, Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Religion, Peace, and Tranquility of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and no doubt, but the Machivilian <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and the Zealous <hi>Papiſt,</hi> have been the cauſe of all the imbroils of <hi>England,</hi> hoping by that Gate, to bring in their own <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government</hi>: The thing ſo much feared by the People of <hi>England.</hi> And truely in this Caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they are not to be blamed, <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> being the two chiefeſt, and moſt valuable Jewels, belonging to the Crown of Life. And when they caſt abroad their Eyes, and behold the Arbitrary, Deſpotical and Tyrannical reign of the Princes of other Countries, they may well be deſirous of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their own happy Government, in the Monarchy of this <hi>Nation;</hi> which is ſo equally divided, betwixt King and People, That the one cannot do injury, or wrong to the other, unleſs the one become Arbitrary, and the other Rebellious.</p>
            <p>The Conſtitution of the Government of <hi>England</hi> is ſo ſound, as it is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be ſhaken or altered, with every ſmall Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for it muſt be abſolute Tyranny on the one Hand, or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Rebellion of the other, that muſt break it to Pieces, and bring in the ſo much feared <hi>Arbitrary Government.</hi> And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29574:4"/>
therefore, it is againſt the Intereſt both of King and People, to intrench upon one the other, the one to invade the Prerogative of the King, the other the Priviledges of the People: For ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually bangs the Ballance between them, that as it is the Envy and admiration of all other Nations, ſo is it the Happineſs and ſtrength of our own; for the one ſide cannot Preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or weigh down the other, without breaking the juſt and equal Conſtitution of our Government. If therefore the Kings of this happy Nation, ſhould at any time, thorow the Evil advice of their Councellors, go about to invade the peoples Liberties, and to think or hope to bring in Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it would not be ſo eaſie a thing to effect it, ſince the mutual Bonds and Obligations, between the King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are already ſo ſtrong, as it is almoſt impoſſible to attain to that end, whilſt the three Eſtates of the Land have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and without whom no alteration can be made. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therefore, need not be in thoſe Fears and Agonies, on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the leaſt Occaſion, of the evil Miniſtration of ſome of the chief Officers of <hi>State,</hi> of their Kings Intentions of bringing in of <hi>Arbitrary Government;</hi> for no doubt the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> are as great and Imperial Monarchs, holding their Crowns of God only, and ſo account themſelves, as any other Monarch whatſoever: Nor can we ſee, how a lawful Monarch can any ways better himſelf, or become more great, by ſuch unlawful Arbitrarineſs, who by the Laws of the Land, and the Love of his People, wants neither Power nor Money, the only things a Tyrant can pretend to. It is therefore the Cunning Arts of the Enemies to <hi>Englands</hi> peace, who ſo needleſly, ſeek to bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it into the Ears of the People, that their King intends to bring in Arbitrary Government, upon every Occaſion, given by any of his Miniſters of State, in the management of thoſe Affairs, they cannot ſee into the Bottom. But ſince the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Miniſters, are Accountable for their male-Adminiſtration to <hi>Parliaments,</hi> there is, and can be no ſuch Fear, I ſay of ever attaining that end, ſo long as <hi>Parliaments</hi> have a being, and without which our happy Monarchy cannot ſubſiſt totally. But many cry out againſt <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> and know not what it is, not being ſufficiently ſenſible; of their living under, and being ruled and governed by a legal Monarch:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29574:4"/>
Tho ſome Faults and Miſcarriages may be ſound, or appear in his Miniſters; for the King himſelf can do no wrong, ſince he Acts nothing of himſelf, but by Miniſters, who are all Reſponſible for their Actions. Yet the People are not to be blamed, for their abhorrency of <hi>Arbitrary</hi> or <hi>Tyrannick Government,</hi> which always attends Uſurpation, ſince it is not ſo many years, that they have felt the burthen thereof; and if we look back, into all the Actions, of the moſt Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and Tyrannick, the lawful Kings of this Nation, we ſhall find the <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> attending Uſurpers, in the little time of their Uſurpation, to be more horr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and dreadful, and brought on this Nation more Miſery, Blood, and Perſecution, than any of them; nay, all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I cannot think therefore, that any are ſerious, who cry out on the <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> as indeavouring or deſiring a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> for I do think there are none of them, ſo really mad, as to deſire any ſuch thing, that would bring on them the dreaded <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> they ſo much Fear; ſince they found it by ſo late Experience, to be no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to their Evils, and cured their Fears and Jealouſies with a Plaiſter of Poyſon. And this alſo, I look upon to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem of the ſame Enemies, on the other ſide, to Create a Jealouſie in the Head of the Prince, and his Miniſters, and to make them Conſtrue every Action of the People, tending to that end, which may be, and no doubt is, as far from their thinking, as it is from that of the other, in bringing in of <hi>Arbitrary Government.</hi> Since the Fears and Jealouſies of either ſide, are alike much heightned, by the indeavours of ſeveral ſorts of evil Perſons, and by ſome well meaning People, by being too ſevere in uncomely and bitter Expreſſions, and thorow the Toleration of the many Licentious, and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Papers, which daily fly abroad, the <hi>Author</hi> of theſe true Collections, of the Miſeries this Nation ſuffered, under the <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> of Tyrannic Uſurpers, Expoſes it to the Abhorrency of the Nation, that they might behold it in a Glaſs; and that the Governours of our Common-wealth, may not run upon the ſame Rocks: Nor the People, into the like Rebellion, in ſeeking to avoid <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> or ſome Shadows of it, bring it upon themſelves totally, to

the ſubverting the Monarchy and the Fundamental Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>To the intent then, that they may ſee the difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the happy Reign of lawful Kings, and uſurping Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, we have Collected the illegal Acts, and bloody Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, of thoſe Uſurpers of <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> the <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Oliver,</hi> that by the matter of Fact, the People may be convinced and deterred from thinking of Rebelling againſt their lawful Prince, ſince 'tis the only way to bring in <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> whoſe moſt horrid Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is diſplay'd in the following Hiſtory.</p>

            <p>IF we mount up the Hill of <hi>Time preſent,</hi> and thence take a view; on either hand lyes <hi>Time paſt,</hi> and <hi>Time future,</hi> or to come; the latter is continually hidden in a Cloud, and we are not able to take any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it, unleſs by Divine or Prophetick illumination, which tho certain, is rare; yet a wiſe man by looking back on <hi>Time paſt,</hi> and Comparing the certain Effects reſulting from ſeveral Cauſes, may give a ſhrewd Gueſs of what is to come; and thus from Experience he will pronounce, that Fears and Jealouſies betwixt a Prince and his people, being wrought to the height, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce on the one hand <hi>Severity,</hi> on the other <hi>Rebellion:</hi> If the Prince gets the better of the People, after they have run into actual diſobedience, it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, he ſhould, whilſt he Lives, ſlacken the Reins of his Power, but by keeping them under, extend it to the utmoſt of the line: If the people thrive in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the certain ſequel is <hi>Uſurpation,</hi> Tyrannick and <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> as hath been ſeen in ſeveral Ages, and recounted in ſeveral Hiſtories, which we ſhall not mention; our Deſign being to confine our Diſcourſe to our own late Affairs, and Tranſactions, from the firſt ſetting up of the <hi>Rump,</hi> in the place of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> to the Reſtauration of our preſent <hi>Monarch,</hi> whom God grant long to Reign.</p>
            <p>If we look down from this Hill of <hi>Time preſents</hi> tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Optick of Hiſtory, on <hi>Time paſt,</hi> we behold the firſt Ages as in Landſkip only, not in a due Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being much leſſened in Relation; the middle A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

are more clearly viewed, and lye open to diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and are more largely Diſplayed in Hiſtory: but again, the more near, or next to the Mountain of <hi>Time preſent,</hi> are alſo covered in a certain obſcurity, and as it were over-ſhadowed by the Mount of <hi>Time preſent,</hi> that Truth is traced with a faint touch, and uſually things are not ſo clearly ſeen, as at a longer diſtance. But ſince every day renders the Proſpect more clear, We hope in this our ſhort Relation, of the late Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and of their Tyrannick and <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> to ſhew to the People a moſt lucid Picture of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Monſter, which they do, and may moſt juſtly fear, <hi>Arbitrary Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fears and Jealouſies fomented and heightned, we may ſay begot it, and Rebellion brought it forth, for it was the foul Iſſue of our bloody Civil Wars. It is not my task to write the Tranſactions, between the late King and his Parliaments, nor to draw forth a Scheme of that moſt unnatural War, which robb'd <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of it's Peace, and devoured ſo many brave and valiant Subjects; this hath been ſufficiently and fully, by ſeveral Pens, already performed. But I ſhall begin the riſe of my Hiſtorical Collections, from the time of the Excluſion of the greater part of the Members of the houſe of Commons, called the long Parliament, and when the Tail or <hi>Rump,</hi> as they are called, of the ſaid Commons, againſt all Law and Right uſurped, the Regal Authority of the Nation, and placing it upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Exerciſed a <hi>Tyrannick,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> with any ſhadow of legal Authority; for altho it is not to be doubted, that the bloody War, commenced by the long Parliament, againſt their ſovereign Lord and King, was illegal and unjuſt, yet I ſay, by that Bill, paſſed by his late Majeſty, together with the Bill of attainder againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> on the 8<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1641. for the continuance of that Parliament, and that it ſhould not be Prorogued or Adjourned, but by act of Parliament, and on the 10<hi>th.</hi> of the ſame Month had the Royal aſſent, gave them I ſay
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29574:6"/>
ſome Colour or ſhadow of Authority, and extreamly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled the Kings affairs. The adviſers to the paſſing of this Act are not certainly known, ſome attribute it to the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> others to the deſigning Marqueſs <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> who brag'd of it in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as his Act; but whoever they were, it prov'd moſt pernicious to the King, and ſeem'd to Authoriſe the Rebellion by his own Act.</p>
            <p>But before we enter upon the Actions of theſe Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, we ſhall only make mention of ſome prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Acts, of illegal Arbitrarineſs, of this Parliament, before their Votes of Non-Addreſſes to the King, and their ſceluding their fellow Members, and of their growing up to that perfection of Evil, in taking upon them the Adminiſtration of the Government, and of that unparallel'd-Murther of a great Monarch, their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord and King. The firſt was, under the Notion of maintaining the Proteſtant Religion, their entring into a ſolemn Proteſtation or Aſſociation among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and alſo impoſing it on the Conſciences of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who ſhould bear any Office either in Church or State. Secondly, their raiſing men, arming them, and forming an Army, and ſo running on into actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, againſt their Head, and continuing that moſt Bloody War with ſo much Heat and Animoſity, heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing to no Treaties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Next, their flinging the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops out of the Houſe, and impriſoning twelve of them for aſſerting their Right only, by a Proteſtation. And which was abſolutely againſt the Priviledges granted to them by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and a lopping off one of the Eſtates of the Realm. Then their putting a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Kings perſon, and his politick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, raiſing War againſt him in his own Name, for as yet the <hi>Keepers of the Liberties of England</hi> were not thought of, but the Style ran in the name of the King and Parliament, making the King to fight againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to War with himſelf. Next their illegal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning their fellow Subjects, and diſſeizing many of their free Holds, for their Loyalty to their Prince, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29574:7"/>
for not lending them Money to carry on their Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and alſo putting to Death the <hi>Hothams,</hi> all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Liberty of the ſubject, and full of <hi>Arbitrarineſs.</hi> Next their endeavouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the People, that the Soveraignty law wholly and radically in them, and ſo effectually in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> on Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> for they now began to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Then by their Endeavouring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to their own illegal and Arbitrary proceedings. With many more Acts of the ſame nature, which plainly declared to all the World, how far they had deviated from their firſt more plauſible Pretexts. But all this while I ſay, by the Kings great Conceſſion, in yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to paſs that Act, which wrought him ſo much Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, they ſeemed to have a ſhadow of Power, from the King: and acted as an Houſe, tho contrary to the King, the Laws of the Land, the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and againſt Equity, Conſcience, and Religion.</p>
            <p>But now, after the King had been delivered up to them from the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that they had ſubdued all his Forces and Garriſons, <hi>Ragland</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Wales,</hi> being the laſt that held out for his Majeſty, then they ſhewed their power more manifeſtly, and that their Intentions were to uſurp the Regal Authority altogether, having thus far taſted the ſweetneſs of it, and thrived in their Rebellion. On the 4<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1647. a Party of Horſe, under Cornet <hi>Joyce,</hi> ſeized the King at <hi>Holdenby,</hi> where he was under reſtraint by the Parliaments order, and Carried him away to the Army, and thence by them brought to <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> about the middle of <hi>Auguſt</hi>; where both the Parliament and Army make to him their ſeveral unjuſt Propoſals, after the inſolent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Victors, which the King could in no ways grant, being contrary to his Conſcience, his Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. At the ſame time the Independant Officers of the Army, kept their chief Cabals at <hi>Putn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſing them to comply with the Kings juſt deſires, on the 26<hi>th.</hi> of November they concluded, That four Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Acts ſhould be drawn up, and ſent to the King, to which if he would ſign, they Voted, That they then would admit of a perſonal Treaty with him.

               </gap> and Succeſſors for ever, and gave an unlimitted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29574:8"/>
power to the two houſes, to raiſe what Forces they pleaſe, for Land or Sea and of what perſons they pleaſe, and what Money they pleaſe to maintain them. The ſecond was, that all Declarations, Oaths, Proclamations againſt the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, might be recalled, or againſt all or any that adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them. The third, an Act that thoſe Peers, that were made after the great Seal was carried away from the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, might be made uncapable of ſitting in the houſe of Peers: And laſtly, That Power may be given to the two Houſes to adjourn themſelves as they think fit. By theſe you may eaſily perceive, to what height they were come of all unreaſonableneſs. Theſe were preſented to the King at <hi>Cariſbrook Caſtle</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> on the 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1647: by the Earl of <hi>Denby,</hi> the Lord <hi>Mountague, Liſle, Goodwin, Bunkley,</hi> and <hi>Kemp,</hi> Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from both Houſes of Parliament. The King it may well be thought, having no deſire to dethrone himſelf, and enſlave his Subjects, refuſed the Bills, and deſired to Treat perſonally, ſending them his reaſons in Writing: Whereupon Sr. <hi>Tho. wroth,</hi> moves the Houſe, That the King, who had Acted like a Mad man, ſhould be ſecured in ſome inland Caſtle, with ſure Guards: That Articles of Impeachment ſhould be drawn up againſt him: That he ſhould be wholly lay'd by, and that they would think of ſome other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no matter what, ſo it were not by Kings or Devils. Then <hi>Ireton</hi> gravely, and with his Proteſting he ſpake the Sence of many thouſand Godly men, who had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured their Lives with him in the Army, ſaid: That the King in denying thoſe Bills, had deny'd his ſafety and protection to the People, and that therefore they might juſtly, and lawfully deny to yield him any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Obedience, and that it was fit they ſhould ſettle the Kingdom without him. Then <hi>Cromwell</hi> at laſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long debate, with an Hypocritical Face, ſtood up, telling them, of the Valour, Courage, Reſolution, and readineſs of the Army, to ſtand by them, and to Live and Dye with them, and that therefore, now the Parliament ſhould by their own Power, Rule and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29574:9"/>
Govern the Kingdom, and not expect ſafety any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or any help from an Obſtinate man, whoſe heart God had hardened, and therefore no more to be truſted, for that his future Reign, would become more inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, and fuller of Revenge than Juſtice. That elſe thoſe men, who had ſo long defended them, would think themſelves betray'd by them, to the Malice and Rage of an irreconcileable Enemy, whom they had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued for their ſakes, and that diſpair might teach them, to ſeek their ſafety, by ſome other means, than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to them, who would not ſtick to themſelves; and how deſtructive that reſolution might be to them all, he even trembled to think of, and left them to conſider. This concluding Menace, from that terrible Bug-bear, very much overawed the Houſe. Upon this they came to Vote, and the Queſtions being put, they Vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, No more Addreſſes or Applications ſhould be made to the King, carrying it in the Affirmative, there being one hundred and forty one Yeas and ninety one Noes. This was alſo aſſented to by the Lords and publiſhed, Reſolved by the Lords and Commons Aſſembled in Parliament, That no Application or Addreſs be made to the King by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſon whatſoever without the leave of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Reſolved by the Lords and Commons, &amp;c. That the Perſon or Perſons, that ſhall make breach of this Order, ſhall incur the penalty of high Treaſon. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by the Lords and Commons, &amp;c. That they will receive no more any Meſſage from the King; and do injoyn, that no Perſon whatſoever, do preſume to receive or bring any Meſſage from the King to both or either of the Houſes of Parliament, or any other Perſon.</p>
            <p>Upon this comes forth a Declaration from the Army. Among other things they declare, That they are reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtand by the Parliament, in theſe their Votes concerning the King, and in what ſhall be neceſſary for the Proſecution thereof, and for the ſetling and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of the Parliament and Kingdom, without the King, and againſt him, or any other that ſhall pertake with him. The Parliament alſo after this, put forth a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29574:9"/>
publick Declaration, about the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> 1648. in which were many ſtrange Invectives againſt the King, and his Government, raking in all the Errors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and remembring things done before his Reign. They alſo endeavoured to have fixed on him the Murther of his Royal Father King <hi>James,</hi> the Rebellion and Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other wicked and horrid Crimes lay'd to his Charge, and almoſt in every bodies Mouth, ſo that they were not only Content to take away the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from their King, and to uſurp the Royal dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but they went about to defame him, and to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Honour and Innocency, even before they had agreed to take away his Life from his Perſon, and to make him as odious as they could, in the Eyes of all men; to take off the Odium as much as they could from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for what they now intended to do, <hi>viz.</hi> The murther of their Prince, which began now to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the prevailing Independent Party, who had got the Army on their ſides and overawed the reſt.</p>
            <p>However, they could not carry things ſo, but that their Intentions began to be ſeen, altho they had procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Letters or Addreſſes of thanks, from ſeveral Counties, by their Agents, for their Votes againſt the King; yet for the moſt part the peoples Eyes being now every day more and more opened, began to ſee what a Brat they had nouriſhed up, under the notion of Liberty, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections were ſoon quelled, tho not without Blood, by the induſtry of <hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> and by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of divine Providence.

               <hi>Cromwell</hi> gives the Parliament, by a Letter to their Speaker, an account of his Victories, with Admonitions to them, not to hate God's people, who were as the Apple of his Eye, and for whom Kings were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, That they ſhould fulfil the end of their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, that all that would live quietly and Peaceably might have Countenance from them, and that they who were implacable, might be ſpeedily deſtroyed out of the Land. And to prepare the way for their Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ordered: That <hi>an Ordinance be Penned,</hi> and <hi>brought into the Houſe of Commons,</hi> to try all <hi>ſuch by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Law,</hi> in <hi>the City of London, as ſhall be found to Plot, Deſign, or Contrive any thing, to endanger the Parliament or City</hi>: Here again; you may ſee all the Common Laws of the Land laid aſide, and Martial Law made uſe of, in the Head City of the Land. Which was then no Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and by order of theſe Parliamentarians, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors of the peoples Liberties, Rights, and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>But however, the Army being at a diſtance from the City, ſubduing the Kings Friends, and the Parliaments Foes, the Independent Party in the Houſe of Commons, were not ſo prevalent, but that the other Party took Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and appearing, began to come more of themſelves, encouraged by ſeveral Petitions out of the Countrey, for a Treaty with the King, upon which they became inclinable, and begun to ſet themſelves to that Pious work, tho hindred all that could be, by the Clamours, Speeches, and Behaviour of the Independants. And thereupon the Earl of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> Sir <hi>John Hippesly,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bulkley,</hi> were ſent to the King, to let him know their Reſolutions; who returned, related the Kings rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Compliance thereto, as a thing he much deſired; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they Vote, That <hi>the Votes of Non-Addreſſes</hi> ſhould be <hi>repealed; That the King might ſend for ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> as <hi>were neceſſary for him</hi> in the <hi>Treaty; That he ſhould be in a ſtate of Freedom; That five Lords and ten Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,

be choſen Commiſſioners</hi> to <hi>Treat with the King at</hi> New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in <hi>the Iſle of</hi> Wight. Theſe Votes were ſent to the King, and Commiſſioners choſen; for the Lords, the Earls of <hi>Northumberland, Salisbury, Pembroke, Middleſex,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Say</hi>: for the Commons were, Lord <hi>Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peirpoint,</hi> Sr. <hi>Henry Vain</hi> the younger, Sr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottle Grimſton,</hi> Sr. <hi>Jo. Pots,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> Mr. <hi>Crew,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bulkly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hellis,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Glyn.</hi> Their Propoſitions were not much eaſier than their former, to which the King gave very Satisfactory Anſwers, conceding to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, for Peace ſake, againſt his Prerogative; the greateſt Difficulty being the buſineſs of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> which the King was unwilling ſhould be wholly aboliſhed. And now it was very likely, that the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had agreed, and a full peace had inſued, but in the mean time many Officers of the Army held their <hi>Cabals</hi> at <hi>Windſor</hi>; where they were Contriving the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the King, and the Diſſolution of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; which <hi>Cabals</hi> they alſo continued at <hi>London,</hi> and other places, under the name of Agitators in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Army. Theſe were framing a Government among themſelves, and drew up a Remonſtrance, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>That they were</hi> the <hi>Body of the People</hi> of England: That <hi>their Intereſt was the publick Intereſt</hi> of <hi>the People</hi>; That <hi>the People were the</hi> only <hi>Competent Judges</hi> of <hi>their own ſafety:</hi> That <hi>the ſupream Magiſtrates were the People Armed with ſupream Authority, and with the Sword.</hi> Theſe perſons concluded among themſelves; that ſome ſhould be choſen out of the Army, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the whole Body: Theſe not to exerciſe the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative</hi> power, but only to draw up the Foundation of a Government; which the people were to conſent to, which conſent or Agreement of the People, ſhould be above Law: That in the Agreement a day ſhould be ſet for the Diſſolution of the Parliament; and this to be drawn up in a Remonſtrance from the Army. This was incouraged by Major general <hi>Harriſon,</hi> who urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, there could be no ſafety for them nor the Nation, but by the cutting off the Kings Head, and the tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29574:15"/>
purging at leaſt, if not the Diſſolving the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Upon this the Army, now wholly at <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Devotion,
<q>ſends up a Petition to the Commons, for Juſtice to be done on the King, as a Capital Offender.

            <p>Thus have we briefly drawn to your View, the firſt Lineaments of an <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical Uſurpation,</hi> in very ſhort Draughts, ſhewing however the ways and means, whereby theſe Men, or <hi>Junto</hi> of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers, came by their Power and Authority, overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very Foundation of our Ancient and moſt glorious Monarchy, under the Notion of Liberty, and ſetting up a Tyrannical <hi>Democracy,</hi> or rather Oligarchy, under the Regiment of a few ſelected Fellows, who called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Parliament, and the Repreſentatives of the Nation, and in whom they pretend all Right of Power and Magiſtracy was to be placed.</p>
            <p>The very ſhadow of all legal Power was now gone, and this unparallel'd force put upon the Parliament, in excluding the Major part of their Members, by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary will of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> and his <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29574:17"/>
the Sword, imagined they ſhould keep it, when all this while, not having the Command of the Army, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ridden by the general Officers thereof, who deſigned, as ſoon as they had done their work, to pay them their Wages by diſmiſſing them, were but as the Cats foot, made uſe of by the Monkey, for the raking the Cheſnut out of the Fire, the benefit of which they intended to take themſelves, and this was the Murthering of their lawful Soverain, whom they had depoſed, which was the next main Deſign driven on by the Independent Army, and their <hi>Dromidaries</hi> this <hi>Junto</hi> of Men.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen theſe Men grown up into full Strength of <hi>Arbitrarineſs,</hi> and got into the Throne of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, we will now proceed, to Trace them by their Steps, in the Exerciſe of this their Tyrannical Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which we ſhall find to be according to the ſame unlawful Progreſs, and to be of the ſame bloody Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; for it is a certain Maxim, <hi>That what Power is got by unlawful means, muſt be kept by the ſame unlawful ways,</hi> notwithſtanding the ſpecious pretences of Liberty, and ſetling the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Junto</hi> of Men being met, and Voted as we have declared, That no more Addreſs ſhould be made to the King, nor any Meſſage received from him, they take Care in the next place, having got into the Saddle, to keep it; and to make the World believe, they had a right to it, if they could: for now an Ordinance was drawn up, that the Lords and Commons of England do declare. <hi>That by the Fundamental Laws of the Land, it is Treaſon in the</hi> King <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>to levy War againſt the Parliament.</hi> This preparative in making the King a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, and in placing the Supream Power in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe Repreſentatives they were, was in Order to their Deſign of Murthering the King.

            <p>The Army now the Lords of all, Garriſon <hi>Black-Fryars,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, turning the houſe of God into a Stable, and defiling it with Dung, robbing divers Halls (which they call'd borrowing) of ſeveral ſums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, by their Saint-like Prerogative, accounting the reſt Egyptians. In the mean time, the ſecluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſtill impriſoned, put forth a Declaration againſt this moſt horrid violence of the Army, done to their Perſons, and to the Fundamental Laws of the Land, the Rights of the People, and the priviledges of Parliament: this was dated 11<hi>th. December,</hi> 1648. This being complained of to the Houſe, both Lords and Commons put forth a Declaration againſt it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they declare, That the Declaration put forth, by thoſe Members of the Houſe of Commons, Excluded the Houſe, in which was theſe Words, <hi>viz: That all Acts, Ordinances, Votes,</hi> and <hi>Proceedings of the Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons, made ſince the</hi> 6<hi>th, of December</hi> or <hi>hereafter</hi> to <hi>be made, duering the reſtraint</hi> and <hi>forcible Secluſion from the Houſe, and the Continuance</hi> of the <hi>Armies force upon it, are no way Obligatory, but void and null, to all Intents and Purpoſes</hi>; was falſe, Scandalous, and Seditious, and tended to deſtroy the viſible, and fundamental Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom. And therefore ordered the printed Paper to be ſuppreſſed, and that all who had an hand in it, to be uncapable to bear Office, or to have any
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29574:18"/>
truſt, place, or Authority in the Kingdom, or to fit as Members of either Houſe of Parliament. Here again you ſee a moſt bold ſtroke of Arbitrary Sway, and what Noſes of Wax they made of all priviledes of Parliaments: O moſt excellent Conſervators of the Liberties of the Nation!</p>
            <p>The next thing they fell upon was the unvoting of all former Votes of the Houſe which tended to any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation with the King, and renewed again their old Vote of Non-Addreſſes in <hi>Terminis,</hi> and that the Treaty with him in the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> was highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable, and apparently Deſtructive to the good of the Kingdom. Thus forty or fifty of this Independent <hi>Junto</hi> undid, what was before done by at leaſt three hundred and forty before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> 14<hi>th.</hi> Major <hi>General Brown,</hi> Sr. <hi>William Waller,</hi> Sr. <hi>John Clotworthy,</hi> Major <hi>General Maſſy,</hi> Commiſſary <hi>General Copley,</hi> were all impriſoned by a Council of War at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> tho Members of Parliament, upon which, they put forth alſo a new Declaration, or Proteſtation, in the name of themſelves, and all the Free-born peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England, againſt the violent and illegal Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the General and his Council of War, againſt the Laws of the Land, and Liberties of the People, the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament; and that it was an higher Uſurpation, and exerciſe of an Arbitrary and unlawful Power, than hath been heretofore pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or attempted by this, or any other King, or other Power whatſoever, within this Realm.</p>
            <p>About this time came forth a Paper from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, called the <hi>Agreement of the People</hi>; being almoſt word for word, the ſame which formerly had been preſented in the Year 1647. by the Agitators of the Army, and one <hi>Gifford</hi> a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> buſie in promoting it, and then condemned by the Commons, as matter Deſtructive to the beings of Parliaments, and to the Fundamental Government of the Kingdom; and cauſed General <hi>Fairfax</hi> to condemn one of theſe Agitators, who promoted it, and cauſed him to be ſhot to Death at <hi>Ware.</hi> This was ill timed, and the buſineſs not yet Ripe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29574:18"/>
enough, and was a ſecond time by the Vote of the ſame Houſe condemned, as Seditious and Contemptuous and Deſtructive, &amp;c. and ſeveral were impriſoned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; but now the ſame being again obtruded upon this <hi>Junto,</hi> they cloſed with it, and followed it's Dictates, which were briefly: <hi>That the people ſhould agree,</hi> or did <hi>agree together, to take away the preſent Government, by King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lords and Commons,</hi> which they <hi>were now going about, as</hi> the Armies Journy-men, as faſt as they could.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> every day begins to grow more Conſpicuous, inſomuch as ſeveral Lords laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide their Honour and Greatneſs begin to Court and fawn upon him, and ſervilely to attend on him and do him Homage. The next thing the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons do, is to Curb the City, whom they ſuſpect; and to hinder them from a free Election of their City Officers; another mark of Arbitrary Power: For which end many Exceptions are made, for thoſe that were to be elected into any Office, that none who had bore Arms for the King, in the firſt or ſecond War, or that had joyned with the <hi>Scots,</hi> or had ſubſcribed the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement 1647. or were aiding in any Tumult, or Inſurrection in the City, with other Reſtrictions, by which they brought all thoſe under, that they believed not fit for their wicked purpoſes. This was thought yet too ſhort by <hi>Skippon,</hi> who moved it to have alſo, added, That none might bear Office that promoted the Treaty with the King, or endeavoured to have him brought to <hi>London</hi>: Which according to the deſire of the Saints was ordered as an Additional Ordinance; So that you now ſee, the very endeavouring of a Peace and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Nation, was become a notorious Crime, and made a perſon incapable of bearing any Office in the City.</p>
            <p>And to make themſelves ſure one of another, as Oaths, Declarations, and Proteſtations could make theſe Uſurpers, they cauſe their Members to ſign a new P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Gentlemen would paſs no ſuch Engagement, which ſeeing, he gave order for their releaſe, but with this Menace, That if they made any Diſturbance it ſhould be at their peril.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs they had now in hand, and were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on, <hi>viz: The King's murther,</hi> muſt be cloaked under a Religious Covering, as if they were about ſome Pious Work; and therefore they mock God, as well as delude man, and keep a Faſt at St. <hi>Margarets Weſtminſter</hi> where ſome few Lords and ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons aſſembled, to whom the Pulpit merry <hi>Andrew, Hugh Peters</hi> preached: <hi>Moſes</hi> leading the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> being the Subject which he applyed to the General and the Leaders of the Army, now lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people out of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage; and after ſome t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Council of War in the mean time, to humble his Majeſty, ordered, <hi>That all State and Ceremony ſhould</hi> be <hi>forborn to the King,</hi> and his <hi>Attendants leſſen'd.</hi> And now having made way for the moſt horrid and Bloody de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign that ever was heard of, the Motion is made in this uſurping Houſe, to proceed to the Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſo on the 28<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1648. <hi>Thomas Scot,</hi> brought in the Ordinance for the Tryal of the King, being read and Committed three ſeveral times, and all the Commiſſioners names inſerted, Conſiſting of divers Gentlemen and Soldiers. This Ordinance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſ'd the <hi>Junto,</hi> they ſend it up to the Lords Houſe, by the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Grooby,</hi> together with their Vote formerly made, <hi>Viz.</hi> Reſolved, &amp;c. <hi>That the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament; do declare, and adjudge, That by the Fundamental Laws of the Realm, it is Treaſon in the King of England for the time to come, to levy War againſt the Parliament and Kingdom of England.</hi> The houſe of Lords debate the matter, and firſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory Vote; againſt which, the Earls of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> with others, ſpake, and declared, There was none nor could be any ſuch Fundamental Law in <hi>England,</hi> whereby the King could be a Traytor, by leaving War againſt his People; and that thus to declare Treaſon by an Ordinance, when no law was extant to judge it by, was moſt unreaſonable. Upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29574:20"/>
which the Lords caſt out this Ordinance and Vote, and adjourned themſelves for ſeven days. This proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lords gave them no ſmall trouble, and ſtirr'd up the wrath of ſome of the Zealots, who threatned to hang a Pad-lock on the Lords door; and ſending up to ſearch their journal Book, they found the Lords had made theſe two Votes: <hi>That they</hi> do not <hi>Concur to the ſaid</hi> declaratory Vote. And Secondly, That <hi>they rejected the Ordinance</hi> for <hi>the Tryal of the King.</hi> Upon which theſe men reſolving to be rid of the Lords, as well as of King, they Vote, That <hi>they ſhould Act without</hi> them, (as well they might, according to their own Law) That <hi>all Authority was ſounded in the</hi> People, and <hi>that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of the People, <hi>all Authority lay in</hi> them. Some of them were for Impeaching the Lords, for favouring the grand Delinquent of the Land, as they called the King. And now to make all ſure on their ſides, that they may Act legally, On the 4<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> they Vote; <hi>That the People are, under God, the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of all juſt Power.</hi> That <hi>the Commons</hi> of England <hi>in Parliament aſſembled, being choſen by,</hi> and <hi>repreſenting</hi> the <hi>People,</hi> have the <hi>Supreme Power of this Nation. That whatſoever</hi> is declared or <hi>Enacted</hi> for Law, by <hi>the Houſe of Commons aſſembled in Parliament, hath the force of Law.</hi> This makes clear Work, and by this our Arbitrary U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers may do what they will, and cut off their Kings Head according to their own Poſition, legally; what need of Kings, Lords, Laws, Rights, Liberties, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, or fundamental Government, when the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Conſciences of ſuch men, may ſerve inſtead of all, and conclude thereby all the People of <hi>England,</hi> tho they declare againſt it, and tho oppoſed by the King or Houſe of Peers? And thus, notwithſtanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Lords, theſe Commons paſs their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and declaratory Vote by the name of An Act of Parliament of the Houſe of Commons (which was never before heard of) for the Tryal of <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> King of <hi>England.</hi> This being objected to <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> that there was no Preſident or Example, for the Tryal of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29574:20"/>
a King, by a judicial Court, he Prophanely applyed: That there was never any Preſident before the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> of a Womans conceiving and bringing forth a Child, without accompanying with a Man, therefore they might walk without Preſident, for this was an Age to make Examples and Preſidents.</p>
            <p>There was yet one thing that paſſed theſe men, which they had not foreſeen, which was, That it was a very improper thing, to make uſe of the Kings Seal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is ſtyled King of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>the Grace of God</hi>; to ſeal a Commiſſion againſt him for his Tryal. They were now in haſt, and could not ſtay for a new one, which they had not as yet thought on, therefore it was concluded, the Commiſſioners ſhould proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ordinance, without any Commiſſion under Seal, and that every Commiſſioner ſhould ſet his own Hand and Seal, to the Inſtruments of their Proceedings. All things being now in a readineſs for the Tryal, The King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is taken from <hi>Hurſt</hi> Caſtle, and brought to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> thence to <hi>Farnham,</hi> thence to <hi>Winſor,</hi> and thence to St. <hi>James,</hi> on the 19<hi>th.</hi> day of <hi>January.</hi> And they had cauſed for the greater Solemnity of the Buſineſs, their Serjeant <hi>Dandy,</hi> who was appointed Serjeant at Arms to the Commiſſioners, for the Tryal of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to proclaim it openly in Weſtminſter-Hall, with his Mace on Horſe back, with ſix Trumpets and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Officers attending, all bare, That the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were to ſit to morrow, and that all thoſe, who had any thing to ſay, againſt <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> might be heard. This was done in like manner in <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> and at the <hi>Royal Exchange.</hi> The ſame day the Houſe Voted their great Seal to be broken, and ordered a new one to be made.</p>

that the ſecluded Members, not only declared againſt ſuch Proceedings, but more eſpecially againſt this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Act of theirs for the Tryal of the King, ſhewing them, That by the common Law, and by the Statute of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and all other Acts concerning Treaſon it is high Treaſon for any man to Compaſs or Contrive the Death of the King, or his eldeſt Son, tho never Executed: That they were alſo bound to the Contrary, by their Oath of All<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſhifted it off from himſelf, and put the Act upon the Army and Parliament, declaring he had ſought God very much in the Buſineſs, but as yet had no return of his Faſting and Prayers about it, therefore he deſired till night to conſider of it, and promiſed that he ſhould hear from him before he went to Bed; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, about Twelve or One of the Clock, the Gentleman expecting his Anſwer, he ſent him word, That he might return, for he and his Officers had been ſeeking God, and that now it was Reſolved, the King muſt dye: this was but a night or two before the King's Murther.</p>
            <p>On the 20<hi>th.</hi> day of <hi>January,</hi> 1648. being <hi>Saturday,</hi> theſe bloody Commiſſioners met, called an high Court of Juſtice, for the Tryal of the King, who was brought before them, and with much Patience, and ſometimes ſmiling, he heard their long Charge; but denying the Jurisdiction of the Court, refuſed to plead, requiring them to ſhew by what Law or Authority, beſides their unjuſt Uſurpation, or power of the Sword, he was brought before them who were his Subjects. I ſhall not trouble the Reader with any farther Relation of this Tryal, it being at large ſo often printed; nor with the Names of the Judges and Officers of this pretended Court, it being to be had in every Bookſellers ſhop: I intending in theſe Collections only a brief Narrative of theſe Uſurpers Proceedings, that the World might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the true Picture of Arbitrary Government, and Tyrannical rule, and not an exact Chronicle or Hiſtory of thoſe times, tho I would not omit any Material thing that may give Satisfaction or Delight to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I ſhall obſerve that as an ill Omen, the Silver head of the King's Staff dropt off, as the Charge was read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which the King wondring at and ſeeing none ſo Officious as to take it up, he ſtoop'd himſelf and taking it up put it into his Pocket. At his going from the Court looking very auſterely about him without moving his Hat, he pointed with his Staff to the Sword, and ſaid; I do not fear that. As he went along the Hall ſome Cry'd out Juſtice, Juſtice, and others, God ſave the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:29574:22"/>On Sunday, <hi>Cromwell, Bradſhaw,</hi> and the reſt of the Commiſſioners kept a Faſt at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Joſhuah Sprigg,</hi> whoſe Text was, <hi>He</hi> that <hi>ſheds-Man's blood by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed.</hi> Then Mr. <hi>Foxley,</hi> whoſe Text was, <hi>Judge not leſt you be Judged.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> whoſe Text was: I will <hi>Bind their Kings in Chains, and their Nobles in Fetters of Iron.</hi> And thus by their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed application of the word of God, they endeavoured to juſtifie their moſt Execrable Murther of their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King. There was by ſome, who durſt to do any thing againſt theſe Cruel and powerful men, certain Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſcattered about, in which were ſeveral Queries; as, Whether a King of three Kingdoms, could be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by one Kingdom alone, without the Conſent or Concurrence of the other Kingdoms? Whether a King if try'd, ought not to be try'd by his Peers? And whether he could be ſaid to have any ſuch in his Kingdom? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if a King were Tryable, he ought not to be tryed in full Parliament, of Lords and Commons? Whether the 8<hi>th.</hi> part of the Members of the Commons meeting in the Houſe, under the force of the Army, the reſt being forcibly reſtrained from ſitting, can by any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of Law or Juſtice erect a Court for the Tryal of the King? And whether this could be properly called a Court of Juſtice, without the great Seal of <hi>England</hi>? Whether that thoſe men who by ſeveral Remonſtrances, Speeches, and Actions, have publickly declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Enemies to the King, can either in Law or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be his Judges, when it is Exception enough for the baſeſt Felon to any Jury-man, to hinder him from being his Judge? Whether this moſt illegal and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Tryal of the King, by an high Court of Juſtice, may not prove a moſt Dangerous inlet, to abſolute Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and bloody Butchery, and every mans Life be at the Arbitrary will of his Enemies, erected into a Court of Conſcience without limits or bounds?</p>
            <p>But words are nothing, and theſe paper Arms, tho furniſhed with the higheſt Reaſon, could not move theſe obdurate Men, who perſiſted in their bloody Buſineſs,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29574:23"/>
driven on by the ſecret and forcible Machinations of <hi>Oliver</hi> and his Cabal. The ſecond day being Monday the 22<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> the Court met again, and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor <hi>Cook</hi> urged extreamly for judgment againſt the Priſoner, unleſs he would own the Authority of the Court; which the King conſtantly denyed to do, and offered his reaſons againſt them, but they would not be heard. The 3<hi>d.</hi> day, being <hi>January</hi> 23<hi>d.</hi> the King was brought again before the Court, who had in the Painted Chamber the day before, Reſolved, That the King ſhould not be ſuffered to argue the Courts Jurisdiction, and had ordered, That in caſe he offer'd to diſpute the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Court, that the Preſident ſhould let him know that he ought to reſt ſatisfied with this Anſwer: That the Commons of England <hi>aſſembled in Parliament, have Conſtituted this Court, whoſe Power may not, nor ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to be diſputed by him.</hi> And that in caſe he ſhould refuſe to anſwer, or acknowledge the Court, the Lord Preſident ſhould let him know, his Contumacy ſhould be recorded. But the King ſtill perſiſted in the denyal of their Authority, upon which the Clark reads, <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> you are accuſed in the behalf of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> of divers high Crimes and Treaſons, which Charge hath been read unto you; the Court now requires you to give your poſitive and final Anſwer, by way of Confeſſion or denial of the Charge. But the King told them he could not acknowledge a new Court, ſet up contrary to the Priviledges of the People, to alter the fundamental Laws of the Land. The 4<hi>th.</hi> and laſt day was the 27<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1648. where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared about fifty ſix of thoſe Commiſſioners, who ſate when judgment was given againſt the King by their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> But the King having moved to be heard, before the Lords and Commons, in the painted Chamber, promiſing after that to abide the judgement of the Court, they withdrew for half an hour, and returning, they told the King This was but another denial of the Courts jurisdiction, and therefore if he had no more to ſay, they would proceed to Judgement. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29574:23"/>
this, after <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> had made a long Speech, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to juſtifie their Proceedings on this falſe point: <hi>That the People are the ſupream Power,</hi> whom <hi>the Commons repreſented, he</hi> commanded the Clark to read the Sentence, which was drawn up in Parchment, in theſe words.
<q>Whereas the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament, have appointed them an High Court of Juſtice, for the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> before whom he had been three times convented, and the firſt time a Charge of high Treaſon, and other Crimes and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors was read, in the behalf of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. Here the Charge at length was read, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the Clark proceeds, which Charge being read unto him, as aforeſaid, He the ſaid <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> was required to give his Anſwer, but he refuſed ſo to do: For all which Treaſons and Crimes, this Court doth adjudge, the ſaid <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murtherer, and a publick Enemy, ſhall be put to Death, by the ſevering his Head from his Body.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this wicked Sentence paſſed by theſe Miſcreants, the King was had away to Sr. <hi>Robert Cotten</hi>'s, and thence to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, the rude Soldiers in his paſſage by them blowing Tobacco in his Face, and one ſpit on it, which he wiped off with his Hand-kerchief without taking notice of it. But when he heard ſome of them to Cry out <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice,</hi> he ſaid, alas! Poor Souls, for a piece of Money, they will do as much for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders.

            <p>The Sunday before the King dyed, it is reported, that ſome of the chief of the Army and Parliament, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the King a paper to ſign with promiſe of Life, and ſome ſhew of a King, the Power being wholly inveſted on themſelves, and was Deſtructive to the Fundamental Laws of the Land, to the Religion eſtabliſhed, to the Liberties and Properties of the People; one Propoſition whereof was, To continue the Power of the Sword to the Army, and to have as a ſtanding Force, under the ſame general Officers, forty Thouſand Horſe and Foot; they to have the Choice of their own Officers among themſelves, by a Councel of War, and to ſettle a conſtant Tax upon the People, by way of a Land rate, for the payment of the ſaid Army, and to be collected and levyed by themſelves; and a Court martial to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected of an exorbitant Extent and Latitude. But his Majeſty, disdaining to read them all, flung them aſide, and told them, He ſhould rather become a Sacrifice for his People, and dye by their Hands, than ſo to betray their Laws, Liberties, Lives, and Eſtates, the Church and Honour of his Crown, and ſo to make all Slaves to the Arbitrary Will, and Tyranny of an Army!

            <p>The King after his Sentence, was lodg'd in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and the little time they gave him to prepare himſelf, he was diſturb'd with the noiſe of his rude Guards, filling all the Rooms with the ſmoak of their Tobacco, a thing extreamly offenſive to him, and they Rung in his Ears the clincking of Pots, and ſuch like Noiſes; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but he lay ſo near the place where he was to Dye, that he could hear every ſtroke of the Hammers of thoſe Workmen, that were erecting the Scaffold, and working all night: all which Barbarity was to mortifie him, but that would not bring him to their Bent: On Munday he was removed to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, whence he came the next day on Foot thorow the Park, to ſuffer his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom.</p>
            <p>And now on the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1648. was Acted the moſt unheard of Tragedy, that ever was Committed, and not to be parallel'd in Hiſtory, in any Countrey. A King convented, and Tryed, openly in a Court of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful

Judicatory, as a Capital Criminal, by the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his Subjects, under pretence of Law, and then publickly Executed on a Scaffold in the face of the Sun and the People, before his own Palace; by the hand of the common Hangman (as it hath ſince appeared) is ſo ſtrange a thing, that it will be the Admiration of ſucceeding Ages, as well as it hath been of our own, and I think, a moſt notable Diſplay of <hi>Arbitrary Uſurpation:</hi> For tho we have had ſome of our Kings murthered in our Land, yet there was ſome modeſty ſhewed in their Aſſaſſination, in that it was done Privately; and Acted by great Perſons laying claim to, or Ambitioning the Crown; nay, they were ſo Cautious, as in the Murthers of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, Firſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, and to take away their Crowns, or making them to reſign them by their own Acts, becoming thereby private men, accounting them elſe Sacred to be murthered; but thus I ſay; to be publickly put to Death, under the Colour of Law and Juſtice, and to juſtifie ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bloody Perpetration to the World as a legal Act, being ſo palpable againſt all Laws both Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, was a thing never to be found in any Age, or in any ſtory. I ſhall ſay no more of it, his Majeſties Speech and all the fatal Tranſactions of that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, being Printed at large; only I ſhall take notice, that this Royal Martyr, with much Conſtancy, Courage, and Reſolution lai'd his Head on the Block, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Ax, in refuſing to acknowledge the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of theſe bloody Uſurpers to be legal, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not betray the Liberties, Lives, and Properties of his people to an unjuſt and uſurping Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Government.</p>
            <p>Even whilſt he was on the Scaffold, he was pittied by ſome of his Perſecutors, the Officers of the Army, which <hi>Cromwell</hi> perceiving, he begun to play with them his uſual jugling Tricks, and made them believe that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with them, concerning the ſaving of the Kings Life; Seeming to pitty him himſelf, and blaming him for being Obſtinate, in not adhering to their Propoſitions, feigning

a Reluctancy for his Death, and therefore told them, He ſhould be very glad if it might be effected with the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Kingdom; tho what was done, was by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Parliament, yet he feared the <hi>Odium</hi> might be caſt on them; but ſays he, before we proceed in this weighty Matter, let us ſeek God; to which they agreed, and <hi>Oliver</hi> began a long-winded Prayer, which laſted ſo long, till News was brought them, that the King was Executed, which ſeveral not ſuſpecting, were ſurprized and amazed, but <hi>Cromwell</hi> holding up his Hands told them, he now ſaw clearly, that it was not the will of God that the King ſhould live, and therefore he was afraid they had done ill to tempt God to deſire it.</p>
            <p>This was the end of his Majeſty <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and now all the world believed, as moſt legally they might, that this <hi>Parliament</hi> was diſſolved of Courſe, by the Death of the King; by what Authority now can they pretend to ſit and Act? Even by the ſame unjuſt Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Sword, whereby they had committed ſo many illegal Acts, contrary to the Fundamental Laws of the Land; as now in continuing themſelves a <hi>Parliament,</hi> was againſt the moſt ancient Conſtitutions of <hi>Parliaments.</hi> But they lay hold of the <hi>Act,</hi> of 17. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. for the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of this <hi>Parliament:</hi> In which theſe words Were: And be it <hi>declared and Enacted by the</hi> King <hi>our Soveraign Lord, with the aſſent of the Lords and Commons in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> Parliament <hi>aſſembled,</hi> and <hi>by the Authority of the</hi> ſame, <hi>that this preſent</hi> Parliament <hi>now aſſembled, ſhall</hi> not <hi>be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, unleſs by Act of Parliament,</hi> to <hi>be paſſed for</hi> that <hi>Purpoſe.</hi> Therefore they declared, and believe, that they are ſtill a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and are not Diſſolved by the Kings Death, becauſe not diſſolved by <hi>an Act of Parliament.</hi> But it was anſwered, that it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath been, the undoubted Prerogative of the King, to Call and Diſſolve Parliaments, and that an Act for their Perpetuation, was a taking way one of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Flowers in the imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which the King could not grant, and give away, tho with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of both Houſes. But this Act was palpably againſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29574:26"/>
the King's inclination, being as it were forced to it by ſome Heady, violent, and turbulent Men. But that a Perpetuation or Extention of it beyond the Kings Death, was never then thought of, is moſt plain by the Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the ſaid Act, where it is expreſſed, That by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great Sums of Money, of neceſſity to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for the ſpeedy relief of his Majeſties Army and People, in the northern parts of the Realm, and that Credit might be had for the raiſing ſuch Monies, and to take away the Fears and Jealouſies of any that ſhould lend ſuch Monies upon their Credit, that this Parliament ſhould not be Prorogued or Diſſolved, before Juſtice be done on Delinquents, and publick Grieva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ces redreſſed, it was Enacted, &amp;c: <hi>That they ſhould not be Diſſolved, but</hi> by <hi>an Act of Parliament</hi>; ſo that by the very end and Scope of this Act, there could not be thought to be any Perpetuation of this Parliament: or that they ſhould not be Diſſolved by the Kings death: For elſe, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would have inſerted the like ſpecial Clauſe, as, <hi>That this Parliament ſhall not be Diſſolved by his Majeſties death, but only by Act of</hi> Parliament. But that the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> was Diſſolved <hi>Ipſo facto,</hi> by the Kings death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called by his Writ, to confer with him as his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>Arduis negot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For it is not natural to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and impoſſible, That the Lords and Commons ſhould be a Parliament, and make Acts and Laws with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King, as for a Body to move and Act without an Head; and therefore, had there been any ſuch thing intended to have been Enacted, it was void, becauſe impoſſible; for the Kings Royal aſſent could not be had after his Death, and there is no Clauſe in the Act that obliges his Succeſſor to Conſent, which clearly ſhews they never had any ſuch intention, at the making of this Act. And therefore on the death of the King all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions both of the Judges and others ceaſe, and all Proceedings determined, tho the King is ſaid to ſit in the Court of the Kings-Bench in his politick Capacity,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:29574:26"/>
which indeed never dyes ſo as to cauſe an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> but other wayes as to the Continuance of Commiſſions, Writs &amp;c. which muſt be renewed. Conſider alſo, that if theſe men after the Death of the King, could be a Parliament, they muſt be ſo either by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law and Cuſtom of Parliaments, which is clearly againſt them, or by this Statute which as little Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances them, for they would then be another thing, diſtinct from the Parliament which was ſummoned in the Kings Life; for the Country had no Power to elect their Repreſentatives, but by the King's Writ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could receive no more Power from them, than the Tenour of the Kings Writ granted, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining with the Kings Life, their Repreſentative-Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was alſo determined, and by Conſequence, they could be no longer a Parliament. If it could be thought they could be yet ſo, by that Act, then it follows, That a Parliament by their Act might create another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to <hi>exiſt</hi> after themſelves were diſſolved, which is moſt abſur'd, and alters the Root and Foundation of all the Liberties of the Subject; for they become no longer their Repreſentatives, but a Parliament by their own Act; and it will never be thought that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple intended to entruſt them with their Authority, to change the Government, and deprive them of their Fundamental Priviledges. The Parliament cannot <hi>De jure</hi> do any thing againſt natural Equity, <hi>quia jura natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae ſunt immutabilia.</hi> And alſo by the judgement of a Parliament this could not be, being againſt the Law and Cuſtom of Parliament, for <hi>Ro. Parl.</hi> 42. <hi>E.</hi> 3. no 7. it is declared, by the Lords and Commons in full Parliament, upon demand made of them, in the behalf of the King, <hi>That they</hi> could not aſſent to any thing in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>that tended to the</hi> Diſheriſion of the King and his <hi>Crown, to which they were Sworn.</hi> Now this Act of the 17<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Caroli Primi,</hi> is expreſly againſt the Kings Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors Prerogative, to call his own Parliament, and therefore they could not make ſuch an Act, to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriſion of his King and Crown. A <hi>Parliament</hi> may
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29574:27"/>
be three ways Diſſolved, by the Declaration of the Kings pleaſure, or for want of entring their Continuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or by the Kings death, whereby the Kings Writ, which gives them their Authority, is determined. Theſe words, That <hi>this Parliament ſhall not</hi> be <hi>Diſſolved, unleſs by Act of Parliament,</hi> is <hi>a general Negative, which cannot extend to all Cauſes</hi> of Diſſolution, but have a reſpect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that moſt uſually hapning, the Pleaſure of the King, till the pretended Grievances of the time were ſatisfied. Now in all Times, the judges have excepted particular Caſes out of the general Negative, or Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative Words of Statutes. By the Star. of <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> C. 11. 'Tis enacted, That <hi>Common pleas ſhall not follow</hi> or <hi>be ſued in the Kings-Bench,</hi> which is a general Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, yet it is holden to be clear in Law, That the King is not within theſe general Words, and may ſue in his Bench, or any other Court at his Pleaſure. The Statute of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> is a general Statute, <hi>That the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall make Satisfaction for all Robberies and Fellonies, within the Hundred,</hi> yet it is Reſolved, That the Hundreds ſhall make no Satisfaction for the Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of an Houſe, becauſe the Houſe was the owners Caſtle, and he might have defended himſelf, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his Goods. Beſides this Clauſe in the ſaid Act, That <hi>all and every thing done, or to be done,</hi> for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roguing or Diſſolving of this preſent Parliament, contrary to this preſent Act, ſhall be utterly voyd and of none Effect</hi>: By which it appears, That the cauſe of Diſſolution, which they intended to prevent, was ſomething that ſhould conſiſt in Action, by the words, Thing or Things done, or to be done; which words can only be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to an Actual diſſolution by the Kings pleaſure: And the King's death, is not a thing done, but a Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his perſonal being, and of the Dependants thereupon: And is not an Action, but a Termination or Period. So that it is moſt Clear, theſe men could no longer by any the leaſt Colour of Law or Reaſon, pretend to ſit and Act as a <hi>Parliament.</hi> But alas! What are Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to them, who had uſurp'd the Throne and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29574:27"/>
Power of their Soveraign? and had the vain and idle Hopes to keep it? And to the ſtrengthening themſelves, with all the Arbitrary and Tyrannical ways imaginable, they proceed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they iſſue out their ſpurious Act before ment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioned, againſt proclaiming the King, tho by the Law of the Land, inſtantly upon the King's deceaſe, the imperial Crown of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> was by his inherent Birthright, and by an undoubted Succeſſion and Deſcent, Actually veſted in our now Soveraign, eldeſt Son to the murthered King, and next Heir of the Blood to his Royal Father, and that before any Ceremony of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, as by Stat. of 1. <hi>Jacobi</hi> Ch. 1. And that all Peers of the Realm, Majors, Sheriffs, and other chief Officers in all the Cities and Corporations of <hi>England,</hi> are oblig'd by their places, and Allegiance, to proclaim him under pain of High Treaſon, and forfeiting their City and Corporation Charters. And notwithſtanding the <hi>Junto</hi>'s Prohibition, there were ſeveral Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons printed and ſcatter'd about the City, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and aſſerted the Right of the Prince, as next Heir to the Crown, and by Birthright to be the lawful King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> &amp;c. Dated the 1<hi>ſt.</hi> of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Then alſo in like manner was privately ſcatter'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, another Paper, in which were four Propoſitions briefly declaring: That the Houſe of Commons had no Power of themſelves alone, and without the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the King and Houſe of Lords, to make any Act of Parliament, Ordinance, or to impoſe any Tax, Oath, Forfeiture, or Capital Puniſhment, on any. Secondly, That the few Members now ſitting, were no Court of Juſtice in themſelves, and could Erect no ſuch Court for the Tryal of any perſon, nor had Power to hear and determine any Civil or Criminal Cauſes, and that all Acts, by Pretext of ſuch Power, were illegal, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging any Perſon to death, and Executing them was Treaſon, and wilful Murther. Thirdly, That the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons had no power to make any great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> and that all Commiſſions granted under their great Seal,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29574:28"/>
were illegal, and all Proceedings in Law upon ſuch Writs null and voyd, to all intents and purpoſes. Laſtly, That the denyal of the King's Title to the Crown, and the plotting to deprive him of it, and the ſetting it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Head of another, was High Treaſon, and within the <hi>Stat.</hi> 25<hi>th. Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. as likewiſe their Subverting the fundamental Laws of the Land, and introducing an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical Government,</hi> was High Treaſon at the common Law, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This was all the Loyaliſts could do at preſent, by theſe weak Indeavours, to aſſert the Kings right, and ſhew the people what Slaves they were become, but this affrighted not theſe Men, who in the next place, <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Vote, <hi>That all ſuch Members</hi> who <hi>aſſented to the Vote of the</hi> 5<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1648. That the <hi>Kings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions were a</hi> Ground for <hi>the Houſe to Proceed to a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould</hi> not be <hi>admitted into the Houſe, until they had declared their diſapproval of that Vote,</hi> before <hi>they ſit,</hi> and <hi>that ſuch</hi> as <hi>were now in</hi> the <hi>Houſe, ſhould enter their diſſent to that Vote,</hi> being only thoſe who had before Voted in the Negative.</p>
            <p>The Lords were yet ſitting, but no notice taken of them by the Commons, for having overthrown the Monarchy, they now lay aſide the Lords, and therefore Vote them dangerous and uſeleſs, <hi>Frebruary</hi> 5<hi>th.</hi> and ſo Voted them down, with this Proviſo, That they might be capable to be Elected Knights of the ſhire, and Burgeſſes, and ſo ſit among the Commons. Three of them only ſo debaſed themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> The Earls of <hi>Pembroke, Salisbury,</hi> and the <hi>Lord Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſtrick.</hi> The reſt of the Peers, put forth their Proteſtation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Proceedings, of the Commons; which came forth on the 8<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Frebruary,</hi> in which they aſſerted their own Priviledges, and the fundamental Laws of the Nation, diſclaiming the Votes of the Commons, for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting an high Court of Juſtice, for the Tryal of the King, and altering the Government, Law, Seal, &amp;c. and againſt their Traiterous murthering their Soveraign, and disinheriting the Prince, the Lawful Heir of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29574:28"/>
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and alſo proteſting againſt their Vote of the 6<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Frebruary,</hi> for the aboliſhing the Houſe of Peers, as deſtructive to the beings of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Fundamental Laws of the Realm, and the Lives, Liberties, and Properties of the people, whom they had made Slaves to their Tyrannical and Arbitrary Government.</p>
            <p>But this affrights not the Commons, and to keep the Lords from meeting, the Army ſet a Guard at their Doors of their Houſe, and the Houſe now proceeds to ſet up a Common-wealth, and to aboliſh Monarchy; and therefore they formed an Act intituled, an <hi>Act for the Exheredation</hi> of <hi>the Royal Line,</hi> the <hi>aboliſhing of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> in <hi>this Kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>ſetting up a Common-wealth,</hi> which they ordered to be publiſhed in all places. And to Vindicate theſe their moſt horrid Proceedings, they had their Pulpit-Trumpeters, who juſtified their Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Acts in all places: and <hi>John Godwin</hi> and <hi>Milton,</hi> to write in their Defence of putting the King to death, declaring in Print, That the King ſuffered on juſt Grounds, and according to his Demerits. And now inſtead of one King, theſe <hi>Common-wealth Rumpers</hi> ſet up forty Tyrants, as a Committee of State. But the people generally ſeemed diſpleaſed at this Alteration of the Government, and <hi>Reineldſon</hi> Lord Major of the City re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to publiſh their Act for aboliſhing of Monarchy, for wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of War, debated, Whether they ſhould not put to the Sword all that were of the King's Party, to ſecure the Nation to themſelves, and it was carried in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but by two voyces, ſo near were they to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Maſſacre. And many Petitions came from ſeveral Counties, that at leaſt three of the moſt eminent of the King's party, in each County, might be put to Death; to free the Land from Blood-Guiltineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromwell</hi> by this, as you may perceive, had gotten all the executive Power of the Kingdom into his own Hand, and into the hands of his own Creatures of the Councel of State, altogether ruled by him, and therefore it may be wondred at, that he did not immediately ſeize the Crown, and ſet himſelf in the Throne, which he now aſpired to: But things were not yet ripe, and the ſubtil Fox found ſuch a Levelling party in the Army, which he ſaw muſt firſt be Cruſhed, who would never indure it; for they were for dividing and ſharing all, as a Land ſubdued by them among themſelves, and for owning no Authority but the Saints, who were themſelves. Theſe begin to rip up the Miſcarriages of the Parliament; and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> to make them the more Odious, puts them upon all Things he believed would make them ſo to the People and Army. One of which was, the new Erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their moſt Tyrannical Court of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> for the Tryal of ſome of the Lords and others, whom they had ſtill impriſoned for their Loyalty. The firſt was Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who had invaded <hi>England</hi> as you have heard; with him they at firſt deal gently, hoping to have ſcrew'd out of him the Names of ſome Eminent men in <hi>England,</hi> that they thought might have invited him in. But he either not able or willing in that point to give them Satisfaction, and finding the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile</hi>'s party to hate him, and to deſire his Head, he was Condemned, tho he pleaded, he had Quarter given him by <hi>Lambert</hi> upon Articles, and would have given a hundred Thouſand pound to ſave his Life. After him was alſo tryed and Condemned the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> and that moſt Noble, and Heroick Peer the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> who
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29574:30"/>
had eſcaped out of the Tower, but was retaken by means of a perfidious Water-man, ever after hated for it. He plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Articles of ſurrender, but that was denyed him: then he pleaded to be tryed at Common-Law, put them in mind of <hi>Magna Char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He talk'd to deaf Statues, for he was too gallant a Man, and too Active, and Loyal, to be permitted to Live. On the 9<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> theſe three Lords Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> and this Noble Lord much lamented were put to Death, on a Scaffold in the Pallace-yard in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> by ſevering their Heads from their Bodies. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that this Lord dyed with much Courage and Chriſtianity, being nothing daunted at Death. The Earl of <hi>Norwich</hi> and Sr. <hi>John Owen</hi> were pardoned, by Vote of the Houſe, the Earl of <hi>Norwich</hi> having his Life by the caſting Voyce of <hi>Lenthal</hi> the Speaker only.</p>

            <p>This John <hi>Lilburn</hi> was tryed by a ſpecial Commiſſion

            <p>Their chief buſineſs now was to give one another E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, out of the Delinquents Lands, as they called the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Party, whom they now ſequeſter, and made an Order That no Malignant or ſuch as had been in Arms againſt them ſhould come within twenty miles of <hi>London,</hi> or go five miles from their own habitations.

About this time they ſend their Embaſſadors <hi>Oliver St. Johns,</hi> and <hi>Walter Strictland</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> for Satisfaction for Doctor <hi>Doriſlaus,</hi> who drew up the Charge againſt the King, his being Aſſaſſinated in <hi>Holland,</hi> by ſome <hi>Cavalier's,</hi> but they were there affronted and forced to return <hi>Re infecta,</hi> in great Diſcontent, which exaſperated our new States againſt the <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aſcham</hi> another of their Creatures was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered alſo in <hi>Spain.</hi> And tho the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſent afterwards their Agent <hi>Myn heer Joachim,</hi> with Complements and excuſes, our <hi>Junto</hi> could forget it, and by it took an occaſion to forgo their Friendſhip, and prohibited their Fiſhing upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts, and the importing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forrain Commmodities, except in <hi>Engliſh</hi> bottoms: or ſuch as were of the Countrey, whence the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities came. This brought on the enſuing War commenced the next year, between theſe two States.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, they have no ſmall umbrage of the <hi>Scots</hi> Proceedings; who had ſent to the King then at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and invited him into <hi>Scotland</hi> with ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in order thereunto.

fearing the <hi>Kirk</hi> Party would hold the King to hard Terms, ſhould he come in upon their Propoſitions, riſe in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but were ſoon ſuppreſt by <hi>Ker</hi> and <hi>Stranghan</hi>; upon this our <hi>Junto</hi> ſtrike in, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by their Letters ſeveral fair Temptations, that they might break with the King, promiſing to ſtand by them, and to defend their Liberty as they called it. But this took not. And about this time they make a new Act of Treaſon, ſuch as ſcarce was ever heard of before: That to kill the General, Lievtenant General, or any Member of that Houſe of <hi>Parliament,</hi> or Councel of State ſhould be Treaſon, was to have been put into it, but after long debate was omitted, betraying too much Cowardiſe in them, and having other ways ſecured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Act. For it was made Treaſon, to Act, Plot, Contrive, or ſpeak againſt this Fag End of the Parliament, or their Government, and all Endeavours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> and the Councel of State, to ſubvert them, as now Conſtituted, and that ſhall be hereafter Conſtituted by Parliament, (what an <hi>individuum vagum</hi> is here?) and for every ſuch Act, &amp;c. to forfeit Life and Eſtate: And alſo to move, and ſtir up the people againſt them, was declared Treaſon, nay ſo much as to endeavour to withdraw any Soldier, or Officer from their obedience to their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Officer, or from the preſent Government aforeſaid. Alſo to Counterfeit their great Seal is by this Act made Treaſons. Are not theſe in the mean time excellent Conſervators of the Liberties of the Nation? And a very free State? <hi>Lilburn</hi> in the Tower was kept from Pen, Ink and Paper, and all allowance for Meat and Drink taken from him, tho he petitioned for it, ſo that he was kept three days with half a Meals meat, and in a cloſe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, none ſuffered to come at him: This under a King had been Tyrannical, but is Prudence in this free State. About this time alſo orders were given to certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, to inquire upon Oath, and to Certifie the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved vallue of every mans Eſtate, both Real and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, which they intended thorowout the Kingdom, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

Theſe are the men that were ſo much troubled with the Oath <hi>ex Officio,</hi> and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Oaths againſt a mans ſelf: Nay, the Scriveners in <hi>London</hi> were commanded by theſe ſupream Governors, to ſhew their Books, that they might inſpect, what and whoſe Money they had in their Hands, the better to come at it themſelves. And that they might graſp at all, they were Contriving to ſeize all the Tythes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into their own Hands, and to make all Miniſters their Stipendary Lecturers, and to depend upon the State, that they might Preach no Doctrine, but what ſhould be agreeable to themſelves, or in juſtification of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

            <p>

Many Scruple to pay their illegal Tax of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thouſand pound a Month, for the Army, and therefore have their Goods taken from them by Violence, and ſold, tho they exclaim againſt it, as not done by Law.

            </p>
            <p>And now this <hi>Junto</hi> begin to think of adjourning themſelves according to <hi>Oliver</hi>'s deſire, and in the mean time, things to be left to his two Caballs or Councells, That of State, and that of War: but this was a bitter Pill, and they knew not how to leave their old Seats, where moſt of them were grown very warm, and tho urged to it by the Councells, and that ſome trouble was given to <hi>Lenthal</hi> their Speaker, by Articles drawn up by his Council of Officers; but they fearing, leſt they might not get together again, if once ſeparated, deſired time to finiſh ſome Acts they had upon their Hands, and then they would adjourn themſelves; by which you may ſee, how free theſe Keepers of the Kingdoms freedom were. Firſt down went the King, and his Power lapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the two Houſes, down went the Houſe of Lords, and then all Power was in the Houſe of Commons, now they are going down, and the ſupream Power is in a Councel of State, who muſt down too, and then the Wheel turns round, and all the Power will be in a ſingle Tyrannical perſon and Uſurper. Some of the Acts that lay yet on their Hands, and which they promiſed to diſpatch, were, That all Acts concerning Loans, Monies, Exciſe, Sequeſtrations, Goldſmiths-Hall, Haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſhers-Hall, Aſſeſſments for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> be paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that they intended a Continuance of the Peoples Slavery and Burthens.

But the King perſwaded, returns to St. <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> where the Committee of Eſtates being ſomewhat more Compliant, (thank <hi>Cromwell</hi> for that) many of the Kings friends were admitted to him. This made many diſſatisfied Miniſters withdraw themſelves into the Weſt, as <hi>Guthery, Gelaſpy, Rutherford,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where they put forth a Remonſtrance againſt the Proceedings of the Aſſembly, in the Admiſſion of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants</hi> to Power and Employment, and with theſe <hi>Ker, Stranghan,</hi> Laird <hi>Warreſton,</hi> Sr. <hi>John Cheiſley,</hi> Sr. <hi>James Stewart,</hi> and others, joyn in Confederacy.

He took <hi>Ken</hi> Priſoner, and <hi>Edenborow</hi> Caſtle was ſurrendred to him on the 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1650.

            <p>In the mean time <hi>Cromwell</hi> was very watchful and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and endeavoured all he could, tho not with any ſucceſs, to engage the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, which was drawn up at <hi>Sterling,</hi> where the King was with them.

This News gave <hi>Cromwell</hi> an allarm, and immediately he diſpatches a Meſſenger with Letters to his Maſters in <hi>England,</hi> to inform them of it; and to comfort them, believing they would entertain no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant thoughts thereat, giving them an account of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, and that they ſhould have confidence in God, and ſhould improve the beſt they could, what Forces they had in readineſs, and ſhould raiſe more, and not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid; for the Enemy was heart-ſmitten, and were in a deſperate condition, with ſuch like ſtuff. In the mean time, he orders Major General <hi>Harriſon,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Rich,</hi> who were on the Borders, to attend the motion of the King's Army, until he were able to come up to them with his Forces.

after, <hi>Cromwell</hi> himſelf follows, the ſame day the King enters <hi>England,</hi> which was on the ſixth of <hi>August,</hi> having departed from <hi>Sterlin</hi> the laſt of <hi>July.</hi> On his entring into <hi>England,</hi> he was proclaimed as he went; and pardon offered to all ſorts of perſons, excepting <hi>Cromwell, Bradſhaw, Cook,</hi> and ſome others the moſt immediate Murtherers of his Father. At the ſame time a Party in <hi>North-Wales</hi> began to riſe, to joyn with the Earl of <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> but were broken and diſappointed. The King with his wearied Men, on the two and twentieth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> comes to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> being beſet before and behind, by the new raiſed Forces, <hi>Cromwell, Lambert</hi> and <hi>Harriſon.</hi> The <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and of ſeveral Counties, flock to <hi>Worceſter</hi>; ſo that by that time <hi>Cromwell</hi> was come up to them, they had formed an Army of forty thouſand men, or more. The Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> brought to the King two hundred and fifty foot, and ſixty Horſe; and having rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about twelve hundred more in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and thoſe parts, he was engaged by <hi>Lilburn,</hi> and routed, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons of Quality taken. By this time, <hi>Cromwell</hi> had cloſe begirt <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and the King's Party beheld themſelves in a very bad condition, hemm'd in on all ſides with numerous Foes, and now too late ſaw their error, of not marching directly to <hi>London,</hi> which was dreaded by the <hi>Junto,</hi> and which was earneſtly deſired and expected by the <hi>Londoners,</hi> who wanted only a fuller ſecurity of ſhewing their inclinations for the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-awed, and hindered through fear from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring.</p>
            <p>But God did not ſee it good, that the King ſhould be brought to the Throne, by any other hand than that of Peace, and by his own Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> intending to ſhew him a more immediate care of his miraculous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in his preſervation, and that he might not be ſubject to the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> for their aſſiſtance, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to them for his Crown; he was reſolved to bring him in after a more glorious manner.</p>
            <p>Nothwithſtanding the great diſadvantages the <hi>Scots</hi> were in, they were reſolved with much courage to ſell

their lives as dear as they could, and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould not find it an eaſie purchaſe. The firſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Engagement was at <hi>Upton</hi> Bridge, on <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s ſide, who was Lieutenant General of the Army, where <hi>Lambert</hi> with five hundred Horſe and Dragoons, beat Collonel <hi>Maſſy,</hi> who endeavoured to maintain it. But the fatal day was on the third of <hi>September,</hi> auſpicious to <hi>Cromwell</hi> the laſt year in his fight at <hi>Dunbar.</hi> It is not my deſign to draw you the Scheme of the Battel, intending only in theſe Papers to ſhew more particularly things of another nature: this Action has been ſufficiently made known; therefore I ſhall only very briefly mention it. The <hi>Scots,</hi> to give them their due, and the little handful of <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were with them, fought bravely, and ſhewed great courage and reſolution, diſputing every Field with their numerous Enemies, and coming to the But-end of their Muskets, and Puſh of Pike with them, covering the Field, where they ſtood, with their Bodies. The King in perſon charged in one of the Sallies from the Town, ſhewing extraordinary Valour, Conduct and Courage; in which Charge, Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Brother to the Duke that was beheaded, was ſhot, and died ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after of his Wound. But towards the Evening, the Engliſh, charging moſt furiouſly, with <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> in the head of them, enter'd with the retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Scots</hi> into the Town, and poſſeſſed themſelves of the Fort Royal: Then it was the King, with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> and ſome others, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſixty Horſe fled, being narrowly miſs'd by <hi>Cobbet</hi>; but the Foot falling to plunder the Town, (which they did with great barbarity) kept out the Horſe, for fear they ſhould ſhare with them, which favoured his Majeſties Eſcape, who got that night to <hi>White-Ladies,</hi> where he was diſguiſed, and all the reſt departing ſeveral ways, he was committed to the fidelity of the <hi>Pendrills,</hi> being in the diſguiſe of a Wood-Cutter, with a Bill in his hand, and for ſome time lay hid in the Celebrated <hi>Oak</hi> in <hi>Boſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Briſtol</hi>: but miſſing a paſſage there, after many ſignal Marks of God's Providence, in his miraculous Eſcape, at leaſt fifty ſeveral perſons having been made privy to it, he at laſt, with the Lord <hi>Wilm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> loſt in this Battel, about two thouſand ſlain upon the place, and in the purſuit, and about eight thouſand Priſoners; very few of the <hi>Scots</hi> got back to <hi>Scotland,</hi> being known by their Tongue, and pick'd up in their return by the Country: moſt of the Nobility and chiefeſt Commanders were taken, and carried Priſoners to <hi>London,</hi> with all their Enſigns: many of the chiefeſt Priſoners of the Nobility were kept in <hi>Windſor-Caſtle,</hi> till the King's Reſtoration: the Colours were hanged up in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi>; and ſeveral of the common Soldiers ſold to Merchants, and ſent away as Slaves to the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and other Plantations. <hi>Comwell</hi> himſelf in great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph paſſes to <hi>London,</hi> being met at <hi>Acton</hi> by the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Members of the <hi>Junto,</hi> the Lord Mayor of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and <hi>Steel</hi> their Recorder, who in a flattering Speech applauded his great Atchievments, applying to him the words of the Pſalmiſt: <hi>To bind their kings in chains, and their nobles in fetters of iron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the way to the ambitioned Throne ſeem'd open, few Obſtacles remaining, except the <hi>Junto</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which he had made ſo odious to the people, by their bloody, tyrannous and arbitrary Actions, that he knew it would be very grateful to them, to have them diſſolv'd. <hi>Ireton</hi> was dead in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who had been a great Aſſiſtant to him in promoting him; but it was thought he was ſo true a Common-wealths-man, that he would not have ſuffered <hi>Cromwell</hi> to have graſped the Scepter, and to have ſet up himſelf in the place of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch he had pull'd down; and ſince he was now able to act himſelf without his Councils, he was but a Rub out of his way; almoſt all <hi>Ireland</hi> being ſubdued, and under

And now that he might yet make the <hi>Junto</hi> more odious, he puts them on the ordinary Drudgery, of taking away the lives of ſuch of the Royal Party, as he thought might be any hinderance to his Deſigns, by their arbitrary way of Tryal, in their High Court of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, or by a Court-Marſhal; and thus, as the ſaying is, he killed two Birds with one Stone, rid his Oppoſers out of the way, and made his Inſtruments odious, that he might with the more ſafety lay them aſide, when he ſaw his time.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> was the firſt that felt the bloody ſeverity of theſe Rulers at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who appointed a Court-Marſhal to ſit at <hi>Cheſter</hi> for his Tryal, and ſeveral others that were taken at the Battel of <hi>Worceſter</hi>; where he was ſentenced to be beheaded, tho he had ſurrendred himſelf upon Articles, and promiſe of his life to one Captain <hi>Edge</hi>; but notwithſtanding his plea, the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Court condemn'd him, and he was executed at <hi>Bolton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> the fifteenth of <hi>October,</hi> 1651. And by the ſame Court, Sir <hi>Timothy Fetherſtone-haugh</hi> was condemned, and for the ſame crime of Loyalty, for endeavouring to bring in <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> (as they called the King) and to poſſeſs him (of his Right) the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> who was beheaded at <hi>Chester,</hi> the twenty ſecond day of the ſame month: likewiſe by the ſame Court, Captain <hi>Benbow</hi> was condemned, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Sentence ſhot to Death at <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi>

And Captain <hi>Symkins</hi> in another place. Many more of note were put into the Tower, and reſerved for a further Exerciſe of their Cruelty.</p>
            <p>And now the way to the Crown did not ſeem very Difficult, for <hi>Jerſy, Iſie</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> and the <hi>Barbadoes</hi> yield to their Power; and <hi>Oliver</hi> in the next place bent all his thoughts to turn this <hi>

            <p>The firſt Engagement between the two Fleets of the two States, was on 19<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1652; off of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Road, <hi>Tromp</hi> having forty two Ships, <hi>Blake</hi> but fifteen Frigots, but after the fight was begun, Captain <hi>Bourn</hi>: came to his Aſſiſtance with eight Ships more, this fight laſted from two of the Clock till Night; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> getting the better, having not one Ship diſabled, tho they had on both ſides Exchanged above two Thouſand Cannon ſhot, one of <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships was Sunk, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

taken: the next Morning <hi>Van-Trump</hi> ſailed for <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The <hi>Holland</hi> Embaſſadors were yet in <hi>London,</hi> and diſ-avow <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Action in diſputing the Flag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Raſh and without Orders, or knowledge of their Maſters; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a Reſtitution of their Ship, but the people were ſo inflamed at the Relation of <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Cariage, that the Embaſſadors were fain to be Guarded to keep them ſafe from the Peoples rage: And upon this the <hi>Holland</hi> States diſpatch away an extraordinary Embaſſador, <hi>Myn Heer-Paw,</hi> to endeavour to make up the Breach, and to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the raſhneſs of their Admiral.

            <p>Admiral <hi>Blake</hi> with ſeventy Ships ſails to the <hi>Orkney</hi> Iſlands, to diſturb their <hi>Buſſes</hi> fiſhing upon our Coaſts, and Sr. <hi>George Aſcue</hi> coming from the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> with fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Ships is recruited and fitted for a reſerve. In the mean time <hi>Tromp</hi> gets to Sea with a hundred and twenty Ships, and endeavours to engage with <hi>Blake,</hi> but a Storm preventing them, they were forced both Home: <hi>Blake</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him about nine hundred Priſoners, which he had taken, and ſix men of War, which he took Guarding their <hi>Buſſes,</hi> This was the firſt Action after War was declared.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Engagement between theſe two States, was on the 16<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, off of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> between Sr. <hi>George Aſcue,</hi> who had forty ſail, and <hi>De Ruyter</hi> who had a Fleet of fifty men of War; and was conveying thorow the Channel their Merchant men which were about fifty ſail more. Sr. <hi>George</hi> engaged the <hi>Dutch,</hi> with nine of his foremoſt Ships, and Charged thorow their Fleet: the <hi>Dutch</hi> had the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-gage, and night coming on, and the reſt of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29574:45"/>
Fleet not coming up, Sr. <hi>George Aſcue</hi> drew off and ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> into the <hi>French</hi> Ports to repair their Ships. Sr. <hi>George</hi> had the better of it, and had the whole Fleet engaged, it was thought he might have had an entire Victory. This was ſo repreſented to the <hi>Rump</hi> to his diſadvantage, that they laid him aſide, and never after would employ him in their Service, but then General <hi>Monk</hi> was ſent for, and Voted by the <hi>Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> to be joyned in Commiſſion with <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Dean.</hi> This was the ſecond fight with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in this War. About this time <hi>Blake</hi> lighting on the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Calis</hi> took ſeven of their Ships, and aſſiſting the <hi>Spaniards</hi> beſieging <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> was a cauſe of the ſurrender of the Town by the Service he did.</p>
            <p>On the 28<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> was a Third fight, between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Dutch, Van-Tromp</hi> upon ſome diſcontent having laid down his Commiſſion, they made <hi>Wit Wittens</hi> Admiral, to whom they joyned <hi>De Ruiter: Blake</hi> had taken from the <hi>Dutch</hi> five weſt <hi>India</hi> Ships of great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and ſix Steights men Valued at 200000 <hi>l.</hi> which loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes enraged the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and put them into Fury to fight. <hi>Pen</hi> was Vice-Admiral, and <hi>Bourn</hi> Rear-Admiral of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, who began this Battel; great Courage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhown on both ſides: the Rear Admiral of the <hi>Dutch</hi> was taken, two of their Ships ſunk, and a Third blown up; the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> getting the better, <hi>Wittens</hi> got off with his Fleet, much ſhatter'd and Torn, being purſued within twelve Leagues of the <hi>Maze</hi>; and <hi>Blake</hi> returns into the <hi>Downs</hi> Victorious, having made the <hi>Dutch</hi> run for it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> much troubled at this miſ-fortune perſwade <hi>Van-Tromp</hi> to accept of the Command, knowing him to be an able Seaman; who at laſt yielded to their Deſires, and hopes to gain honour againſt the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> with eighty men of War, and ten fire Ships, he comes to the back of the <hi>Godwin. Blake</hi> had with him now not above forty ſail, yet with them reſolves to give Battel, and ſeeking his Enemy began a moſt furious and obſtinate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, on the 29<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1652. which laſted from two in the Morning till ſix at Night. <hi>Blake</hi> in the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29574:46"/>
               <hi>Tryumph,</hi> with two more of his Ships were ingaged at one time with twenty of the beſt Ships of the <hi>Dutch. Van-Tromp</hi> and <hi>De Ruyter</hi> were much ſhattered; one of their Flag ſhips was blown up, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> over-powering them, got the Victory, and had not Night favoured the retreat of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet they had endanger'd the whole. The <hi>Garland</hi> and <hi>Bona-venture</hi> were taken by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> three ſunk, and one burnt. <hi>Van-Trump</hi> kept the Sea, and took ſome inconſiderable Prizes; which pufft him up with ſo much Vanity, as to cauſe him hang a Broom at his main top Maſt; ſaying he would ſweep the Seas of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhip. This was the fourth Engagement.</p>
            <p>The maintaining of this War againſt the potent <hi>Dutch,</hi> gained ſuch Reputation to theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> States, as they were called, that the <hi>French</hi> by the Advice of <hi>Mazereen,</hi> ſent <hi>Monſieur Bourdeaux</hi> as an Agent from the <hi>French</hi> King, to acknowledge them. This Action of the <hi>French</hi> gave great diſtaſte to all the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Friends, but this Peace with <hi>England</hi> preſerved the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> being in ſome danger from the Princes of <hi>France.</hi> And now to maintain this War the <hi>Junto</hi> lay a heavy Tax upon the People of 120000 <hi>l.</hi> a Month.</p>

               <hi>Monk</hi> and <hi>Dean</hi> being come out of <hi>Scotland</hi> are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Blake,</hi> and the Fleet equipping with all Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which the <hi>Dutch</hi> States hearing of, ſent away to <hi>Van-Tromp,</hi> who was at Sea; Conducting home three hundred ſail of Merchant men, with ſeventy ſix men of War; and Commanded him to Block up the <hi>Thames,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet from coming forth; but to their great Amazement, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> got their Ships to Sea, and joyning thoſe at <hi>Ports-mouth</hi> made up eighty ſail, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt <hi>Portland</hi> lay half Seas over expecting the <hi>Dutch.</hi> On the 18<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>February</hi> they diſcry'd them, and about eight in the Morning the fight began. <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Dean</hi> who were in the <hi>Tryumph,</hi> with twelve Ships more, encounter'd the Groſs of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet; but was relieved at laſt by <hi>Lawſon,</hi> who performed his part exceeding Well. The Ship in which General <hi>Monk</hi> was, being a ſlow Sailor could not ſo ſoon come up to engage

as he would have had it, but he had a great ſhare in the Fight, and loſt many men aboard her. This Fight laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three days, and the <hi>Triumph</hi> wherein two of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals were, received ſeven hundred Cannon ſhot in their H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next day being <hi>Saturday,</hi> and the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1652. aſſoon as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the <hi>Dutch,</hi> they engaged them again in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, which was fought with much fury, <hi>Tromp</hi> ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſave his Merchant Men, fought retreating, putting them before him; but ſpite of his teeth he loſt many of them, which were picked up by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with ſome of his Men of War. The third day in the Morning, being the twentieth, the fight was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and continued very fierce till four in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; but the Wind being croſs to the <hi>Engliſh, Van Tromp</hi> got at laſt to <hi>Callais</hi> Sands, and ſo tyded it home. The <hi>Dutch</hi> loſt in the three days Fight eleven Men of War, and thirteen Merchants Ships, and had killed about fifteen hundred Men. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt but one Ship, but had not many leſs ſlain than the Enemy. This was the fifth Engagement in which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> got much the better. About this time they erected their High Court of Juſtice in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by which many of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſuffered; among the reſt the noted Rebel Sir <hi>Phelim Oneal</hi> was hanged at <hi>Dublin.</hi>

            <p>The year 1652 being worn out, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> being by their ſeveral loſſes humbled, the King's Party cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and impoveriſhed, now the Tax for the maintenance of the <hi>Dutch</hi> War coming in, and filling the Treaſury, 120000 pounds every month, the State owned by the <hi>French,</hi> and himſelf careſſed privately by <hi>Mazareen,</hi> with whom he had ſecret intelligence; but what was more, the arbitrary <hi>Junto</hi> perfectly hated by the People, he thought it now a convenient time to ſtep into the Throne, and to uſurp the ſupreme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:29574:47"/>
               <hi>Cromwell</hi> cajol'd them all; <hi>Lambert</hi> was deceiv'd in his hopes of ſucceeding <hi>Oliver,</hi> which he had made him to believe he intended. <hi>Harriſon</hi> was for pulling theſe old Repreſentatives out of their Seats, to make way for the Rule of the Saints. <hi>Cromwell</hi> knew how to pleaſe them all, that he might by them work his ends. All the Party <hi>Harriſon</hi> could make among the Congregations of <hi>Feak, Rogers, Simſon,</hi> and the reſt of that Gang, were for <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and all impatient to have the Parliament outed: and to help forward, there came forth dayly from the Army, Petitions, Addreſſes, Remonſtrances, and ſuch like Papers, for putting an end to this <hi>Parliament.</hi> But notwithſtanding all the ſpecious pretences, for the putting an end to this <hi>Parliament,</hi> many of the Officers very well perceived the drift of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and what all would end in, <hi>viz.</hi> his getting the Monarchy into his own hands, which troubled them much; and ſome of them made open proteſts againſt it; for they that could not endure the Rule of a ſingle perſon, in their Lawful Prince, could much leſs endure to be tyrannized over by the arbitrary power of their equal. The chief of them that oppoſed his deſign, were Collonel <hi>Venables,</hi> Scout-Maſter-General <hi>Downing,</hi> Major <hi>Streater</hi> and others; <hi>Streater</hi> went about to give his Reaſons to the contrary, telling them that <hi>Cromwell</hi> deſign'd to ſet up himſelf, and that it was a betraying of their moſt glorious Cauſe, for which ſo much Blood had been ſpilt: but <hi>Harriſon</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him, and told him, that he was aſſured, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral did not ſeek himſelf in it, and did it to make way for the Rule of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that he might have the Scepter. To whom <hi>Streater</hi> replyed, <hi>That unleſs</hi> Chriſt <hi>came very ſuddenly, he would come too late.</hi> For this oppoſition, <hi>Cromwell</hi> looks on him as his mortal Enemy, and claps him up into the <hi>Gate-Houſe.</hi> The <hi>Junto</hi> was very ſenſible of theſe Actings, but knew not which way to prevent them, yet they did what they could to make theſe Officers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the inconveniences that would happen, by a ſudden diſſolving them, and that it would be the only way to preſerve the Nation, to fill up the Houſe with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29574:47"/>
new elected Members, which would pleaſe the people, and their Acts would be received with greater Authority. But the Army anſwered them, they were grown ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and corrupt, that the people of God could expect no good from them, and that they would take care, that the ſupreme Government of the Land ſhould be placed in the hands of ſuch as truly feared God, and were of approved integrity.</p>
            <p>Theſe Debates between the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the Army ſpun out ſome time, at the <hi>Junto</hi> went about cunningly to ſecure themſelves, by preparing an Act for the filling up their Houſe, wherein ſuch ſpeed was made, that it was near paſſing the Houſe. <hi>Cromwell</hi> being nettled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to ſtay no longer; and to his Council of Officers he ſhewed, That if they ſhould let the people to chuſe new Repreſentatives, it was a tempting of God, who would ſave them by the hands of a few, as in former times, and that five or ſix godly upright men might do more in one day, than the <hi>Parliament</hi> had done, or would do in a hundred. Upon this he takes with him <hi>Lambert, Harriſon,</hi> and about eight more Officers of the Army, and on the three and twentieth day of <hi>April,</hi> 1653, he enters the Houſe, and there after a ſhort Speech, ſhewing them ſome reaſons for the neceſſity of their being diſſolved, he peremptorily declared them to be diſſolved. But the Speaker refuſing to leave the Chair, <hi>Cromwell</hi> began to huff, and fall into a paſſion, telling them they were a company of drunkards, whoremaſters, Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, Knaves and Oppreſſors, and commanded that the Bauble the Mace ſhould be took from them, and no more carried before them; and <hi>Harriſon</hi> taking the Speaker by the Arm, lifted him out of his Chair; and having thus turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them out of doors, he lock'd them up, and ſet a Guard of Soldiers at them, and at all the Avenues, that they might not meet again in that place; and thus <hi>exeunt Tyranni,</hi> one Devil driving out another, to make way at laſt for their Lawful Prince. This done, <hi>Cromwell</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his Council of Officers, told them of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, and let them know that now they muſt go hand in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29574:48"/>
hand with them, and juſtifie it by their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, they having adviſed him to it. He told them, that when he went to the Houſe, he did not think to do it, but perceiving the Spirit of God ſo ſtrongly upon him, he would no longer conſult Fleſh and Blood; for the Parliament intended to have perpetuated themſelves. This Action of his, tho arbitrary, illegal, and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, was generally applauded by all ſorts of people, theſe <hi>Rumpers</hi> were grown ſo very odious by their tyrannick Uſurpation. And the King's Friends both at home and abroad, were not a little joyful to ſee this Turn, and to behold them dethroned and trampled on, even in the midſt of their Laurels, obtained for their Victories over the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Grievous Muttering they kept for this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence done to them by their Servant, as they ſtiled him, thinking it none, when he did the like to thoſe ſecluded Members, that would not vote with them againſt the King: but as mad as they were, they ſaw no help for it, and it was not poſſible for them to get together, tho they would not own themſelves diſſolved; and thus our uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>Junto</hi> went out like a Snuff, with a Stink, ſmelling very unſavourly in the Noſtrils of the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>Thus far have I traced out to you, the Lines of the Image of Arbitrary, and Tyrannick Uſurpation, and how ugly and grim a Repreſentation it is, you who have ſeen it truly delineated may judge. You have ſeen this Titular Parliament unjuſtly ſeize upon the Government, by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering their King, and againſt all Laws thruſt out two of the States of the Land, the Lords Spiritual firſt, and then the Lords temporal, and having now graſp'd the Government with rapacious hands, with the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and Arbitrarineſs, turn the greater part of their own Members out of Doors, and rule by a few bloody and tyrannical Uſurpers. You have likewiſe ſeen after what manner they have ſwayed the three Nations, by their own Arbitrary Wills and Pleaſures, as ſo many law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Tyrants, upholding an Army only to cut the Peoples Throats, and to over-awe them, burthening them with Taxes, and oppreſſing them with a ſtanding Army, and

free Quarter, taking away their lives by an Arbitrary Court of Juſtice, contrary to the known Laws of the Land, and robbing and ſpoiling all men of their Eſtates, that oppoſed them, filling the Jayls thorowout the three Kingdoms with Priſoners: The Liberties of the Subject overthrown, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all the Laws and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Conſtitutions of <hi>Parliaments</hi> trodden under foot, and diſregarded, ſo as no man could call any thing his own: And in fine, all the People of <hi>England</hi> made Slaves, by theſe the <hi>Keepers of their Liberties</hi>; ſo that it was no wonder, that there was a general rejoycing at their fall, tho as yet it was but out of the Frying-pan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fire, having exchanged two hundred Tyrants for one, as Lawleſs, Boundleſs, and Arbitrary as they; or a <hi>Rump</hi> for an <hi>Oliver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould now proceed to give a further Diſplay of this Arbitrary and Tyrannical Government, under the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> who had pull'd theſe down, only to ſet up himſelf: but before I enter upon it, I think it will not be ungrateful to the Reader, and not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to my Deſign, to ſhew you what a ſort of men theſe were, who had thus long uſurped, by a brief Character of ſome of the chiefeſt of them, and what benefit they made of their pretended Godlineſs, giving one another Eſtates, out of the Kings, Queens, Biſhops, Deans and Chapters, and Delinquents Lands.</p>

He was obſerved in his Youth to be ambitious, willful and head-ſtrong, which improved with his years, and always, and upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions exerciſed the Impoſtor, under the mask of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. However, he was bred at School, where he got ſome ſmattering in the Rudiments of Learning, but was ſo violent and head-ſtrong, and ſo very prone to robbing Orchards and Dove-Houſes, that he grew the terror of the Country, and paſt his Tutor's Correction. It was about that time he dream'd he ſhould be King of <hi>England</hi>; if it were not more than a Dream, a ſuggeſtion of ſome evil Spirit; for he would often confidently report it in his Youth, tho rebuked by his Father for it, and flaſh'd by his Maſter <hi>Dr. Bernard,</hi> for his conſtant avouching it. And acting in a Play in the School, going beyond his Cue, he took a Crown, and put it on his own Head, and as if inſpired, ſpake ſome big words with great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Thence he was tranſlated to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he was more noted for Foot-ball, Cudgelling, and Wreſtling, than for his Studies, to which he little gave his mind; and after his Father's death left the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and returning home, fell to all manner of Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Debauchery, and grew ſo diſtaſtful to his Mother and Neighbourhood, that ſhe ſent him away to <hi>London,</hi> and enters him into <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> intending to make him a Lawyer; but finding this place not agreeable to his humor, he ſtayed not long before he returned back into the Country, where he fell to his old Trade of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, always fighting, and in Quarrels, tho with Pedlars, Tinkers, and ſuch like Fellows, skillful in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Quarter-Staff, ſo that none could over-match him. This kind of life he led till he had ſpent his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and almoſt ruined his Mother; hated by the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29574:49"/>
Country for his many Villanies committed, eſpecially by his Uncle and God-father Sr. <hi>Oliver,</hi> who could not endure to have him named. At laſt beginning to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his ruin, he feigned a Converſion; went to Church among the orthodox Divines, and ſo far inſinuated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with them, that they deal with his Mothers Uncle Sr. <hi>Robert Stewart,</hi> a Gentleman of a Competent Eſtate in the Country, to take him into Favour, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him his Heir, and who dying ſoon after, left him an Eſtate of five hundred pound a year; which quickly mouldred away, he having left of it not above forty or fifty Pounds a year. He then falls in with the Non-conformiſt Miniſters; entertains them at his Houſe, has Lectures, and exerciſes himſelf in Preaching and Praying, about which time he marries the Daughter of Sr. <hi>James Boucher</hi>; her name <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and Kins-woman to Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> of <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> and turns Farmer for five years with ill ſucceſs, but ſtill continuing his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Praying, was ſo much follow'd by the Faction; that they by a wile got him to be choſen a Burgeſs, for <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in the <hi>Parliament</hi> of 1640. when he was at his laſt Gaſp, and thinking to have Tranſplanted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to New-<hi>England,</hi> and raiſed Mony for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which enabled him to ſtand a Candidate for Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament man. And now joyning with <hi>Hambden, Pym,</hi> and the reſt of them, he began to blow up the Coals of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and to be noted amongſt them, tutored by them, till he grew quickly able to out-Wit them in their own Pernicious deſigns. But now having ſpent the utmoſt farthing of his Eſtate, and run in Debt, he was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged from Arreſts, by being a Member of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; and now he betakes him into the Army, where he was a Captain under <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and where he became ſo Active and buſie, that he ſoon advanc'd himſelf, to be Lieutenant General to the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter.</hi>

            <p>I crave Pardon of the Reader for this Digreſſion, for I intend not to write his Life, but what I have related, may let you ſee what this great Man was <hi>ab origine,</hi> and therefore I ſhall ſay no more of his Actions in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29574:50"/>
they being ſufficiently known in Story, and how gradually he came to his Command of General, in the Army; part of which, as far as came within my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that I have undertook, appears by the aforegoing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diſcourſe, whereby it is plainly manifeſted, by what Methods he attained his Greatneſs and Uſurpation. I could ſay no leſs of this their Ring-Leader, who deſerves a more particular Character, being ſo Notorious through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſtendom, and Famous for his Actions and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation; I ſhall not be ſo prolix in the reſt, but only name them to you. They ſay his Family deſcended from a branch of that <hi>Cromwell,</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> dayes, who ruined the <hi>Abbies,</hi> and was fatal to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy, as this was to the <hi>Proteſtant Epiſcopacy</hi>; and that the Lineal deſcent, was from one <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Glamorgan-ſhire,</hi> who marrying the Daughter of that <hi>Cromwell,</hi> took on him the Name and transfer'd it to his Poſterity; but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Line of that <hi>Cromwell,</hi> is continued in the Lord <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Arglaſs</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> This our <hi>Oliver</hi> was a man, (as you have found by what I have related of him) of many Vices, of deep Diſſimulation and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and tho no great Schollar, of great improved Parts; of a ſtrong robuſt Conſtitution, and naturally Martial, of deep reach, and a great Politician, after he had Converſed with <hi>Ireton</hi> his Son-in-Law, who taught him his Art. He had ſome Spice of Generoſity in him, which he ſhewed on ſome Occaſions, whether it was in his Nature, or Deſignedly, is to be doubted. But for his Courage and Reſolution, and ſkill in Martial Diſcipline, that is not to be queſtioned; and tho I cannot think he real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced any Religion, as his particular Judgment, yet he embraced all that he found ſubſervient to his Ends, as may be perceived by his Actings and Intreagues, with the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants,</hi> and all the other Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which were all alike to him; and no doubt <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> it ſelf, would have been as pleaſing to his Conſcience, could he have Eſtabliſhed his Uſurpation by it. It was not therefore his Love of Vertue or Religion, that made him thruſt out all Vice from his Army; but that he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29574:50"/>
knew it would naturally ruin it, and that a ſtrict Diſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and the Face of ſome Religion, would preſerve it; ſo that he never permitted among his Souldiers, Swearing, Drunkenneſs, Profaneneſs, Murther, Rapine, or Uncleanneſs; but puniſhing them Severely, his Camp was like a well regulated Common-wealth, and had he not been a Rebel, and employed his Parts to ſo wicked an end, as the Deſtruction of his King and Country; for the ſetting up himſelf, he might have paſſed among the Worthies of this Nation, and lawfully have become eminent in his Generation. He had two Sons, <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> (beſides one that dyed young) and four Daughters, one married to <hi>Ireton,</hi> afterwards to <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> one to the Lord <hi>Fawkenbridge,</hi> one to Mr. <hi>Cleypool,</hi> which he much lov'd, and was his ſecond Daughter, and one to the Lord of <hi>Warwicks</hi> Grand-child Mr. <hi>Rich,</hi> which was his youngeſt. <hi>Cromwell</hi> as well as the reſt had a ſhare in the Spoil, before he came to graſp all into the Paws of his <hi>Protector-ſhip,</hi> to which we have brought him, but we now conſider him as a <hi>Rumper,</hi> and by an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of that <hi>Parliament</hi> was conferred on him, out of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Worceſter</hi>'s Eſtate 2500. pounds a year; a good Competency, tho ſome ſay the ſaid Lands ſo ſettled upon him, at their improved Vallue, were worth to him five Thouſand if not ſix Thouſand pounds a year; beſides four or five pound a day coming in as Lieutenant General, and Collonel of Horſe in the Army.</p>

               <hi>Ireton</hi> the Scribe, as ſome called him, being excellent at drawing Declarations, Petitions, and ſuch like things, to ſerve his politick Ends, was a man of a deep Reach, of much Diſpatch, of very dexterous and able Parts, he was <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s right Hand, and was a great Contriver of his greateſt Deſigns, and Stratagems; He was a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi>'s man of the trueſt Stamp, and it is thought, had he lived, <hi>Cromwell</hi> had not aſſumed that Power to himſelf, which he had helpt him to mount to, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Government, which Advantage, <hi>Cromwell</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death laid hold on: He married <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s eldeſt Daughter, and tho poor before the Wars, liv'd very

ſplendidly kept his rich Coach gilt, that coſt two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds; and four gallant Horſes: He lick'd his Fingers with the reſt, and had he liv'd, no doubt, had got more; he died at <hi>Limrick</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the Plague, being Deputy there, and was brought over into <hi>England,</hi> and by the <hi>Junto</hi> buried in great Pomp.</p>

               <hi>Ireland,</hi> had the full and ſole Authority, Power and Government, of the Three Nations in his hands. Yet this would not ſerve his turn, he muſt have ſome ſplendid Title, and Royal Enſigns, to ſhew he reigned not by the Power of the Sword, which would render him odious to the People, though in effect it was the ſame thing: But there is much in State and Ceremony, eſpecially where lawful right is not, to give a luſtre; and the name of King, with the Ornament of a Crown, is the thing ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or ſome thing like it is to be had, if the other could not be obtained. But this is not yet to be reach'd, he muſt proceed methodically, and like the Tyrant <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, intreated much to accept of what he greatly deſired. The firſt thing <hi>Oliver</hi> does, after he had thruſt the <hi>Rump-Parliament</hi> out of doors, was to put forth a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> of the Reaſons for Diſſolving the Long Parliament, who had deſigned to perpetuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, deſiring all good people to ſeek God for him, that he might not doe any thing to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Name, and that they ſhould peaceably follow their Vocations, as when the <hi>Parliament</hi> was ſitting, and that all Judges, Sheriffs, Juſtices of the Peace, Mayors, Bayliffs, and other Civil Officers and Publick Miniſters whatſoever, ſhould proceed in their Offices and Places, and that the Writs ſhould run in the ſame ſtile as before, of the Keepers of the Liberty of <hi>England.</hi> And then out of his Chief Officers of the Army, and his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, he Creates a Council of State, who were to manage all affairs, till a Parliament could be called. Thus the Laws and Liberties of the People, and the whole Civil State and Government of <hi>England,</hi> depended upon the Sword, and the Arbitrary Will and Pleaſure of a General, and ſome few of his Military Officers. Theſe men, to ingratiate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the people, leſſen the Monthly Tax from 120000 <hi>l.</hi> to 90000 <hi>l.</hi> a Month; and to keep

But this <hi>Parliament</hi> called <hi>Barebones</hi> Parliament from a Leatherſeller a Member thereof, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting as I have ſaid of ſuch obſcure Perſons, that moſt of them were hardly known in the Counties where they were born, began to make ſuch ridiculous Acts, and ſo diſpleaſing to the people, that ſome thought <hi>Cromwell</hi> had called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether this little Parliament to bring Parliaments into contempt, the better to devolve the Ruling Power on himſelf as a Monarch. One of their Acts was, that none ſhould be married without a Juſtice of Peace, and the Banes asked in the Market-place three ſeveral Market-daies. Thus the Prieſthood was invaded, and placed in the Civil Magiſtrate. Then, they took off the Penal Law of the Engagement to acknowledge the late <hi>Rump,</hi> whereby it was ordered, that no man ſhould be admitted to ſue in Law, in any Court, that had not taken it. They voted againſt Tythes and the Univerſities as <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi> They alſo were going in hand with cancelling the Law, and all Law Books, and ſo make a new Code more beſitting their own turns, and for the eſtabliſhing of the Saints, as they called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They were alſo upon making an Act, that one Parliament ſhould upon their diſſolving, have power to call another, and ſo to make Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments perpetual. This was not to be endured by the <hi>Oliverian</hi> Party, who expected now to ſolace themſelves under the ſhadow of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And on the twelfth of <hi>December</hi> this Party in the Houſe with the Speaker, made a Motion for their diſſolution, declaring that their ſitting any longer would not be for the good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Many of the Committee Blades hardly warm in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29574:58"/>
their ſeats were ſtartled at it, theſe began to ſtand up, ſtifly pleading for the Cauſe of God, as they called it, and ſhewing they could not leave the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> and the People of God committed to their charge ſo ſoon, which would leave them to utter ruine: and <hi>Hariſon</hi> and <hi>Squib</hi> a great Sequeſtrator, were very zealous in defence of their own Authority. But <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Party, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greater, aroſe, and with their Speaker <hi>Rous</hi> left the Houſe, and the Fifth-monarchy Saints ſitting in it, who having ſought God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to continue ſitting. <hi>Rous</hi> in the mean time with the Mace before him, and his Followers, go to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and there reſign to <hi>Oliver</hi> the Inſtrument of Power he had given them, that made them a Parliament, with notice how they had left their fellows ſitting. <hi>Oliver</hi> returns them his thanks, and kindly receives their Preſent, and preſently diſpatches a Confident of his, Colonel <hi>White,</hi> with a Guard of Red-coates, to turn the fag end or <hi>Rump</hi> of this little Parliament out of the Houſe; who entring the Houſe commanded them in the name of the General to depart, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring them to be diſſolved; but they told him they were upon earneſt buſineſs, and therefore deſired that he would not diſturb them; for they were ſeeking God: to which he replied <hi>piſh, is that all? 'tis to no purpoſe, for God has not been within theſe walls this twelve years,</hi> and ſo fairly compelled them to go out of the Houſe, and to ſeek God ſomewhere elſe.</p>
            <p>About four days after, the Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, had prepared an Inſtrument of Government, on which foundation they erected their new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in a ſingle Perſon, entreating their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to accept of the Government, under the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Protector</hi> of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; and thus a Rotation is, made from a Republick, to a ſingle Perſon; and

Arbitrary Tyranny, not the Monarchy is reſtored, and inſtead of the many Tyrants, one as bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is conſtituted by a Military Power. Good man, with his uſual diſſimulation and Hypocriſie he refuſed it, with much ſeeming modeſty, what he ſo long had ſought and ambitioned, but being preſſed, and by being made ſenſible of the great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, for the upholding the Nation, he at laſt accepts it, and is inſtalled with great pomp in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> attended by the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the great Seal, all the Judges in their Robes, the Serjeants and learned Counſellors at Law, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> in their Scarlets, and all the chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army: Being ſeated in a great Chair of State, and the Inſtrument read unto him, this Oath was adminiſtred. <hi>I promiſe in the preſence of God, not to violate or infringe the Matters and things contained in the Inſtrument, but to obſerve and cauſe the ſame to be obſerved; and in all things, to the beſt of my underſtanding, govern the Nation according to the Laws, Statutes, and Cuſtomes thereof; and to ſeek their peace, and to cauſe Juſtice and Law to be equally adminiſtred.</hi> But how well he kept this Oath you may perceive by the ſequell of his Reign. Having taken this Oath, putting on his Hat, the Commiſſioners ſurrender into his Hand the great Seal, and the Lord Mayor the City Sword, and Cap of maintenance, which he reſpectively returned to them again, and then returned in the ſame pomp to <hi>Whitehall.</hi> The chief Heads of this Inſtrument (as they called it) of Government were. Firſt, That a Parliament ſhould be called every three years. Second, That the firſt ſhould aſſemble the third of <hi>September,</hi> 1654. Third, That no Parliament ſhould be diſſolved till they had ſate five Months. Fourth, That ſuch Bills as ſhould be offered to the <hi>Protector</hi> by the Parliament, if he aſſented not in twenty dayes ſhould be Laws without him.

Here is a prerogative granted beyond any of the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> Tenth, That in the Parliament ſhould be four hundred Engliſh, thirty Scotch, and thirty Iriſh. The ſummons for the Parliament to paſs under the Great Seal to the Sheriffs of the Counties, and Elections to be made more equally than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. If the <hi>Protector</hi> deny to iſſue out Writs at the time appointed, then the Commiſſioners of the Great Seal to doe it without him, under the pain of High Treaſon. No Royaliſt, Iriſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, or Papiſt to be elected, and if they were, they were to forfeit two years Revenue, and three parts of their Goods. None to be elected but ſuch as feared God: and none were capable to elect that were not worth two hundred pound. A Revenue to be raiſed for the conſtant mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ten thouſand Horſe and fifteen thouſand Foot, and the Navy not to be leſſened. All for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Lands unſold to belong to the <hi>Protector.</hi> All Places of Truſt to be in his diſpoſal. All Laws in favour of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> to be abrogated, and beſides them, a tolleration to be granted. And preſently upon this he puts forth a Proclamation, declaring the diſſolution of the Parliament, and his being made Lord <hi>Protector</hi> of the three Nations, commanding and ſtrictly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all Perſons of what quality or condition ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

and to take notice thereof, and to conform and ſubmit themſelves to the Government ſo eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed: And that all Sheriffs, Mayors, Bayliffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are required to publiſh this Proclamation, to the end none may have cauſe to pretend ignorance in this behalf. Now he begins to ſhew his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were rather tollerated than countenanced; yet ſome few of them that would comply and fawne on his Greatneſs, he ſhew'd ſome favour to, though he boaſted he had brought under the Pride and Arrogancy of that Sect: The <hi>Independents</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> were more in his favour, being then of moſt command in the Army, and moſt ready to ſupport his Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation: yet the Fifth-monarchy Men, who had helpt to raiſe him, he could not endure, and therefore he impriſoned <hi>Feak</hi> and <hi>Rogers</hi> in <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, where he kept them for a long while: Then he ſet <hi>Feak</hi>'s Party, and <hi>Kiffins</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> one in his favour, together by the ears, and raiſed equal diviſions between the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> and the <hi>independents,</hi> as a ballance, the better to ſecure himſelf. Theſe Tryumphs of <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> ſo diſguſted <hi>Hariſon</hi> that he turn'd Preacher, or Railer, openly againſt him and his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: All the old Commonwealths Men were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced, as <hi>Vain, Hazelrig, Bradſhaw, Scot</hi> and others, ſo that he was at this time to ſtrengthen himſelf with the Sectaries whom he courted. His firſt Council were Colonel <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, Lambert,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Liſle, Desborow</hi> made one of the <hi>Generals</hi> at Sea, Sir <hi>Gilbert Pickering,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Aſhly Cooper,</hi> Sir <hi>Ch.

thought, they could never have been able to have ſet out another Fleet, though they had made <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> Admiral in the place of <hi>Van Trump:</hi> and therefore they ſend over <hi>Newport, Youngſtal, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,</hi> and <hi>Vander Perre,</hi> Ambaſſadors to his Highneſs, with whom he made peace, they own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Right that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of theſe Seas, and acknowledging it by ſtriking their Flag, the reſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships taken by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and ſome compenſation for the charges of the War. Thus he proſpers, <hi>Spain, Portugal</hi> and <hi>France</hi> courting him by their Ambaſſadors. His Son <hi>Henry</hi> he ſends into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with <hi>Fleetwood</hi> Lieutenant, and ſome time after made him <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of that Kingdom, where he lived in great ſplendor. Lieutenant General <hi>Monk</hi> he ſends into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Nation in obedience. <hi>Whitlock</hi> he ſends Ambaſſador to <hi>Sweden,</hi> who concluded a League with that Queen. Then <hi>Maynard, Twiſden, Nudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> and <hi>Windham,</hi> were made Serjeants. A private Article alſo in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Peace was, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſhould never be reſtored to his Dignities, Offices and Charge, his Anceſtors had enjoy'd.</p>
            <p>On the eighth of <hi>February</hi> being <hi>Aſhwedneſday,</hi> of all dayes of the year, the <hi>Protector</hi> is feaſted in great ſtate by the Lord Mayor, at <hi>Grocers Hall,</hi> the Streets being railed from <hi>Temple Bar</hi> thither, the Liveries, and Gownmen, and ſeveral Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſtanding waiting on him.

At his return about Saint <hi>Clements Church,</hi> a Brickbat was flung at him, which light upon his Coach, but did no hurt, except affrighting him. Search was made after him who did it, but he could not be found.</p>
            <p>And now, as uſually Tyrants doe, he began to entertain fears and jealouſies of all perſons, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Royal Party, and therefore to affright

them, and ſecure himſelf, he will coment his Throne with their blood: And by cunning tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panning Agents, he had formed a Plot againſt his Life, and ſeveral perſons were laid hold on, and accuſed for a deſign of murthering him. This was one of the <hi>Machivilean</hi> Policies of him, and his Secretary <hi>Thurlo,</hi> by whoſe means he drew in ſeveral Gentlemen, as if they were to have aſſaſſinated him, though no ſuch thing was really intended, they diſavowing it at their deaths. One of which was Colonel <hi>John Gerard,</hi> brother to Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerard</hi> who was alſo impriſoned in the Tower about it, and his Brother Mr. <hi>Charles Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> a very young man, one Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> a School-maſter, and one <hi>Fox.</hi> Theſe men being taken and examined about it, much adoe was made, and ſome were ſuborned to ſwear againſt them, but <hi>Cromwell</hi> contrary to the Oath in his Inſtrument, durſt not try them by a legal way, but ſet up the Arbitrary Court of Juſtice, which the <hi>Junto</hi> had been condemned for; of this Court <hi>Liſle</hi> was made preſident, a man fit for the work, for die ſome of them muſt, out of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick <hi>Terror.</hi> Mr. <hi>Charles Gerard</hi> upon promiſe of life confeſſes the fact, out of fear, and accuſes his Brother, and <hi>Fox</hi> doth the like, who are both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but Colon. <hi>John Gerard</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> were condemned; and a blind man brought in evidence againſt Mr. <hi>Vowel,</hi> being only words caſually in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, concerning the coming in of the King, which they had ſo aggravated and perverted, that at the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, upon their recital, the blind man utterly denied them to be his, which gave a great trouble to the Court, till at laſt (though the innocency of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner appeared, and the juggle amongſt them) <hi>Liſle</hi> told them, that the blind man had been tamper'd with, and that though he now denied his evidence, yet his former examinations ſhould ſtand, and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this moſt excellent Arbitrary Law, againſt the mind of the Witneſs, the Court proceeded to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:29574:61"/>
ſentence, and <hi>Vowel</hi> was condemned and hanged at <hi>Chairing-Croſs,</hi> much pitied and lamented; and a Ladder not being able to be procured, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to mount him on a Joynt-ſtool, and hang him after that faſhion, where he dyed with much innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and reſolution on the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1654. And on the ſame day Col. <hi>Gerard</hi> was beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> preſently after <hi>Emanuel Say</hi> the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambaſſadors brother, put to death for killing one in a fray in the <hi>New-Exchange,</hi> this Col. <hi>Gerard</hi> being the chief man that oppoſed the ſaid Ambaſſadors brother at that time, with the hazard of his life, yet both came to ſuffer in one day, upon one Scaffold, for different Crimes; For this Colonel ſuffered onely for the Crime of Loyalty, and was ſacrifiſed to <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Fear and Policy. He dyed with great bravery, courage and undauntedneſs.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s firſt bloudy remarke, and like an Uſurper; who muſt maintain his illegal greatneſs, by illegal Arts. But dominion founded in innocent bloud, cannot long ſtand, before the Avenger for bloud viſits it in his wrathfull Juſtice. About this time he takes care, there ſhall be a faithfull miniſtry, to his intereſt he means, therefore he ſets up a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Tryers, the chief of which were <hi>Nye, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win, Hugh Peters, Manton,</hi> and others named as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners. Theſe make a Reformation among the Miniſtry, for humane Learning was rather a Crime than an help to any, for the queſtion was, <hi>had they Grace in their hearts?</hi> Many good Livings were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened of their Paſtours, and others of more Grace, and leſs Knowledge put in. I heard of one who had been <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> Reader, in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and knowing in all the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Tongues, put out of a good living for inſufficiency: He had it ſeems not Grace equal to his Learning, or his Living had more Grace than he. But ſuch as agreed with <hi>Nol</hi>'s Principles, and were ready to maintain his Government, to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> were put into the

            <p>In <hi>Ireland</hi> all was ſubdued, and he ſent <hi>Cook</hi> over as a Judg, who with a kind of Itinerant Court of Juſtice, hung up many of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels at <hi>Dublin, Waterford, Kilkenny</hi> and in <hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Cromwell</hi> was jealous of <hi>Lambert,</hi> and of the Love he had among the <hi>Sectaries</hi> of the Army; ſo that as yet he was forced to careſs him, and to delude him with vain hopes of ſucceeding him in the <hi>Protectorate,</hi> and therefore made him Commander in chief, of the Army, next himſelf, with the allowance of 10 <hi>l.</hi> a day.

He retires into <hi>Germany,</hi> where all his deſigns, and private Councils in his Cabinet, were betray'd to <hi>Cromwell</hi> by one <hi>Manning,</hi> who was Clerk to his Secretary, bribed by the Uſurper, who had a knack that way, of expending vaſt ſumms for intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and by this means, many of the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in <hi>England</hi> came to be diſcovered, and many brought into trouble about it, but at laſt the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour was detected, and ſhot to death for his perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.

            <p>And now according to the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> on the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> was to meet, and great care was taken by <hi>Oliver,</hi> that none of the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> ſhould be choſen: Writs were iſſued out in his name, and Elections made as heretofore, onely the Burrows ſent but one Burgeſs, and there were 6 or 7 Knights for ſome Shires, all of them under ſure qualifications: <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> alſo, according to the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> ſent their number, moſt being <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commanders. The day came, they meet, and in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abby <hi>Marſhall</hi> gave them a Sermon: The next day, the <hi>Protector</hi> went to them in great ſtate in his Coach, attended by <hi>Cleypool,</hi> Maſter of his Horſe, <hi>Strickland,</hi> Captain of his Guards, bareheaded on both ſides, and at his entrance, <hi>Lambert</hi> carried the Sword, and <hi>Whitlock</hi> the Purſe, and in the painted Chamber he made to them a Speech after his old method, with God in his mouth. He told them <hi>this was an healing day, for before there was neither Nobleman, Gentleman, nor Yeoman known by any diſtinction, nor was there any bore rule or authority, but the Magiſtracy, and Chriſt's Ordinances were had in contempt; that the fifth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy was highly cry'd up, by ſuch perſons as had a mind to aſſume the government to themſelves.</hi> Then in an
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:29574:63"/>
extolling way, he ſhewed what great things he had done during his Government, <hi>and then he told them they were upon the edge of</hi> Canaan, <hi>and that he ſpoke not as their Lord, but Fellow-ſervant</hi>; And ſo diſmiſt them to chooſe their Speaker, which they did, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to him his name. Their Speaker was <hi>Lenthal,</hi> the Speaker to the old Long Parliament. This <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> began to be very brisk upon the Government, and fell upon the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> on which they made ſo bad muſick, queſtioning <hi>Oliver</hi>'s power, that he could not indure it, and immediately ſent them a <hi>Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for every Member to take, before they ſat, whereby they were not to meddle with the Government, as it was ſettled in a ſingle perſon, and the Parliament, nor with the militia, nor with perpetuating <hi>Parliaments,</hi> nor taking away Liberty of Conſcience. He told them alſo, that a Free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was but a term of Reciprocation, for that power which made him <hi>Protector,</hi> made them a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and therefore he was ſorry, they went about to deſtroy the Settlement, and was forced to ſend them a <hi>Recognition,</hi> for every Member to ſign and ſeal, to prevent it. This ſtartled moſt of them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Commonwealths</hi> men, who all flew off, and of 400 ſcarce 200 appeared, though at laſt ſeveral came dropping in, and made up 300, but they fell again upon the ſame diſputes, notwithſtanding the <hi>Recognition.</hi> A little before their ſitting down, <hi>Oliver</hi> publiſhes ſeveral Ordinances of his own, which bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing date before, paſt as Authentick Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances by the <hi>Inſtrument</hi>; one was for the payment of monies into the Treaſury, raiſed for the propagation of the Goſpel in <hi>Wales.</hi> Another for the turning forth of Scandalous Miniſters, that is, ſuch as had uſed the Common Prayer, and had good Livings: Another for making Souldiers free of Corporations; Another for ſurveying the King's Lands, and for doubling upon Deans and Chapters.

            <p>
               <hi>Lambert</hi> was very buſie in this Convention, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring tooth and nail to have the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them, for that the <hi>Protectorſhip</hi> being made elective, he himſelf ſtood moſt fair to be the next Candidate, but finding they would not drive, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be as unruly, as <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s <hi>German</hi> Horſes, that flung him out of the Coach-box, he threatned them, that he would call 4 or 5 Parliaments one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but it ſhould be done, following <hi>Oliver</hi>'s mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſteps to the <hi>Junto.</hi> There were ſome Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth Officers in the Army, that had deſigned to have ſeiſed on <hi>Lambert,</hi> but Col. <hi>Pride</hi> betray'd them, who was privy to the buſineſs; and <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſeeing he could doe no good with his Parliament, aſſoon as ever the 5 months were out, diſſolves them; and then he takes from theſe, who had conſpired againſt <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> their Commiſſions, and ſeiſes on ſeveral others Commonwealths men, and Royaliſts, among whom was Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> who was drawing up a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſhew the lawfulneſs of taking up Arms againſt <hi>Cromwell:</hi> and of the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> there were Sir <hi>John Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kington,</hi> Sir <hi>John Littleton</hi> and others, which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned for a new Conſpiracy (as he ſaid) againſt his Life: and Sir <hi>Tho.

bloudy and arbitrary way of proceeding, as all Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants are forced to doe.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſuppreſt this Inſurrection, which he knew of beforehand, and was prepared for, ſeveral of the chief that were taken, were brought to their trials, the chief of which were Mr. <hi>Penruddock,</hi> who was a Captain, and Mr. <hi>Grove</hi> another Captain, 16 more were executed, of which 9 at <hi>Exceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both <hi>Penruddock</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> when taken, ſurrendred themſelves to <hi>

They were both condemned at the Aſſizes at <hi>Exceſter,</hi> being indicted for Treaſon againſt the Uſurper, and endeavouring the bringing in (of their lawfull King) <hi>Charles Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> and on the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1655 were both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in that City. Mr. <hi>Penruddock</hi> at his execution ſpoke very boldly, and with much zeal againſt the iniquities of the Times; and told them among other things, that Treaſon was in that Age become an <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduum Vagum,</hi> like the wind in the Goſpel, that blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where it liſteth. And Treaſon was then what the Ruler pleaſed to make ſo, and lighted upon whom he would have it: And by this (ſaid he) you may ſee, what a condition you are in, when you have no Law to protect you, no Rule to walk by; with many other bold Truths, which made them ſuppreſs his Speech and forbid it to be publiſhed, that they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceil as much as they could, their illegal and arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Proceedings: For indeed one of the <hi>Jury,</hi> that found him guilty, being demanded afterwards, for what reaſon they brought in their Verdict guilty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Penruddock</hi> and <hi>Grove,</hi> Anſwered; <hi>That they had reſolved to hang them, before they ſaw them.</hi> A pious Reſolution. His Judges were <hi>Liſle, Glin, Roles</hi> and <hi>Nichols</hi> who denyed to give him their advice in point of Law, becauſe they ſaid they were Parties;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:29574:64"/>
and if ſo (as indeed they were) it was contrary to all Law, for a Judge being a party to ſit upon the Bench. But theſe were lawleſs Times. Some others ſuffered at <hi>Chard</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> one beheaded at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and 3 hang'd, and thus this Inſurrection was quaſh'd. But not long after, he crowded the Tower with many Perſons of note Priſoners, upon ſuſpicion of having an hand in this Plot, or Treaſon as he called it, and among the reſt were the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> The Lords <hi>Willowby</hi> of <hi>Parham, Newport, May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, Faulkland, Lucas, Petres,</hi> Sir <hi>Frederick Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis,</hi> Sir <hi>Jeoffery Palmer,</hi> Sir <hi>Rich.

               <hi>Cromwell</hi> now the <hi>Dominus fac totum,</hi> beholding himſelf mounted in the Throne of the Monarchy, makes Leagues, and War and Peace abroad as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and as we have ſaid, having made an impolitick Peace with <hi>France,</hi> loſing thereby the ballance he had in his hand, and giving too much to that Growing Monarch, he deſigns a very unjuſt War, without any provocation, againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> having a thirſt after that King's Gold and Treaſure at <hi>St. Domingo,</hi> in the Weſt <hi>Indies:</hi> But this deſign was kept very ſecret, and a great Fleet was equipped, to the wonder of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; yet that he might not loſe his wonted exerciſe of Hypocriſie, he gives out, that it is for the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion; though beſides the inſatiate hunger of Gold, he might have ſome poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Reaſons to move him to this diſhoneſt breach, which might be, by this means, a getting rid of a great many of the troubleſome Sectaries in the Army, whom he found ſtill pecking againſt his power, and endeavouring to alienate the minds of the Soldiers from him: But now he ſhewed his Art in draining them for this expedition, whereby he might ſit the quieter at home. <hi>Venables</hi> was made Commander in

The Hopes of this Gold had made <hi>Oliver</hi> King it very much, being ſerved with much State and Ceremony. He had his Halberdeers in garded grey Coats, over whom <hi>Strickland</hi> was Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: His Lord Chamberlain, who was Sir <hi>Gilbert Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering.</hi> Two Maſters of Requeſts, Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sadler,</hi> and the Maſter of his Horſe, his Son <hi>Cley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool,</hi> and all other Officers of Honour both to his own Perſon and his Wives, who very finically acted the Princeſs, <hi>White-Hall</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> he had ſaved from ſale, for his own convenience.</p>
            <p>The baffle at St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> and the loſs of his hopes of his Gold, made him now project ſome other ways to fill his Cofers, to maintain his Greatneſs: his merry devil left him, and he began daily to grow more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere and tyrannical, being full of fears and jealouſies, as he had reaſon; for he had not only the Royal party againſt him, whom he kept under with much cruelty, but the Commonwealths-men of his own party, and the Fifth-Monarchy-men, countenanced by <hi>Hariſon,</hi> were highly diſpleaſed with him, and began to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:29574:65"/>
againſt him. He therefore lays <hi>Hariſon</hi> and <hi>Rich</hi> aſide, and not long after he Committed them, with <hi>Carew</hi> and <hi>Courtney</hi> into ſeveral remote Caſtles: <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was ſeized in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with <hi>Bramſtone, Holmes</hi> and other Officers who were caſhiered, fined, and good ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity taken for their good behaviour: <hi>Overton</hi> was ſent to the Tower, and his Regiment given to Col. <hi>Morgan. Okey</hi>'s Regiment alſo was taken from him, and given to another. <hi>Joyce</hi> had the confidence to upbraid his Highneſs to his face, but eſcaped unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſaying he was a Mad-man. About this time he began to intereſt himſelf for the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> abroad, and to be their <hi>Protector.</hi> The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> in the Vallies of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> having been cruelly treated by that Prince for their Religion, <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſends to make application in their behalf; but his Meſſengers being ſlighted, he cauſed Contributions for their relief to be made throughout <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Viner</hi> and <hi>Pack</hi> were made Treaſurers for the Money; by which means a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſumm was Collected, but what ſhare they had of it, is not known. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> War now Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced apace, <hi>Cromwell</hi> reſolving not to hearken to Peace, nor to the reſtitution of three Ships he had taken of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s before he had declared War, pretending them <hi>Hambourgers,</hi> and Confiſcating them, being laden with pieces of Eight, to the ſum of Four hundred thouſand pounds Sterling, which was minted in the Tower, though the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This ſum of money being ſpent, he had with his <hi>Privadoes</hi> thought of another way of recruit, which like their Uſurpation, was the moſt Barbarous and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29574:66"/>
Arbitrary as ever was heard of. See now what was become of the Liberties of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, when he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Example of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> ſet over the Land a company of <hi>Baſhaws,</hi> with the ſame power, under a new title of <hi>Major-Generals.</hi> He had Canton'd <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> into 11 Provinces, joyning the Counties together for the convenience of this <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſway, over every one of which he appointed a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour or <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> called by him a <hi>Major-General.</hi> The Names of theſe Tyrannick Princes were, <hi>Kelſy, Goff, Desborow, Fleetwood, Skippon, Whaly, Butler, Berry, Worſley, Lambert</hi> and <hi>Barkſtead,</hi> who was alſo Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Tower. Theſe in their reſpective Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, lived like petty Princes or <hi>Baſhawes,</hi> domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering and lording it over both Nobility and Gentry, and according to the Command and Order of their <hi>Grand Seignior Oliver Cromwell,</hi> (which was then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed Law) all the poor <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> that is, all ſuch who had ſerved in the Wars, for King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, and alſo all thoſe that had declared themſelves for his Son, King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond (our now Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign) were by theſe <hi>Baſhaws</hi> to be decimated, that is, the tenth part of their Eſtates were to be taken from them, beſides baniſh'd from <hi>London,</hi> and within 20 miles of the ſame, diſarm'd and prohibited to be Elected into any Parliament. And as for the Clergy, they were turned out of their Livings, and kept from all other way of livelihood, unleſs they would work with their hands, ſo that many were ready to ſtarve, for they were prohibited any Cure, or to be Chaplains to any, or to keep School. The power of theſe Decimators was great and boundleſs, Oppreſſing, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, Spoyling and Decimating whom they pleaſed, according to their own Arbitrary Will; for none durſt ſay, Why do you thus? They kept a Roll of all perſons within their Precincts; and if they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected any to favour the King, he was called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by theſe Military-Lords, and Caution taken by them, to keep them from acting againſt the State,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:29574:66"/>
binding them to reveal all Plots that ſhould come to their knowledge, and made them engage the like for their ſervants. They alſo hindred them from their diſports, and prohibited all Horſe-races, Cock-fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Bull-baiting, or any thing that ſhould cauſe a Concourſe of People: and thoſe who refuſed, were preſently impriſoned and decimated; ſo that the free people of <hi>England</hi> were become as abſolute Slaves as thoſe living under the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Government, where none can call any thing his own. By this means the Uſurper eaſily informed himſelf of the value of all the Eſtates in <hi>England,</hi> and of the behaviour and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of every Perſon of Quality throughout the Kingdom. Such vaſt Powers were given to theſe <hi>Major-Generals,</hi> that there was nothing they might not doe, and indeed did not doe; they uſing it to the full. And for this purpoſe theſe <hi>Major-Generals</hi> had an office in <hi>Fleetſtreet</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> as other Courts had, where their Recognances were enter'd, and all other concerns and dependances belonging to them recorded or regiſter'd. Of ſome they took yearly the 10<hi>th</hi> penny, of others they took a ſum of money for Compoſition, uſually at three years purchaſe, which many were willing to pay, who had money, rather than to be continually troubled with them.</p>
            <p>And now the year 1656 Commencing, which by the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> was a Parliamentary-year, in <hi>July Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> iſſues out his Writs for his ſecond Parliament, to ſit on the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> following. But in the mean time Rear-Admiral <hi>Stainer,</hi> with ſix other Ships of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, met with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet near <hi>Cadiz,</hi> returning from the Weſt-<hi>Indies</hi> with Plate, where he ſunk ſeveral of them, with great treaſure, and took others, which he brought away, with two Millions of pieces of Eight, which amounts to 400000 pounds Sterling. There were ſeveral Noble men and <hi>Dons</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> taken Priſoners, whom <hi>Cromwell</hi> treated handſomely, and after a little while generouſly ſent them home without Ranſom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:29574:67"/>And now on the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1656, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time for the Meeting of the Parliament, thoſe who were Elected met, and choſe for their Speaker Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington.</hi> The <hi>Major-Generals</hi> had a great hand in chuſing this Parliament, who by their Arbitrary Power and Authority, cauſed whom they pleaſed to be choſen, and it was thought it was one of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s policies to Conſtitute them for that end, wanting a Parliament that might give him money: And alſo by their moſt tyrannical ſway they had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themſelves ſo odious to the Royaliſts, that they deſired rather any other Government ſhould be than theſe <hi>Baſhaw's</hi>; and it was indeed thought to be one of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s policies in their Conſtitution, that their tyranny might cauſe his Iron yoke alone to ſit more eaſie about their necks, for he gave them up to the Parliament who aboliſh'd them.</p>
            <p>His deſign of making himſelf King, and of wearing the Imperial Crown, and of becoming a legal Monarch, and of tranſmitting it to his poſterity, now plainly was manifeſted, though God did not ſee it good, to let the Iniquity of the Nation run on ſo far, as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherit the right line, having in his Wiſedom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to continue it, to the poſterity of <hi>Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>les</hi> the Martyr; for though <hi>Cromwell</hi> knew, he had more Power, and greater Dominion, and was more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute than any King of <hi>England,</hi> yet the glorious Title of King, and the wearing of a Crown, was the deſire of his ambitious ſoul, not that it could add more to his Power, but he imagined, that by that means, he ſhould be accounted more legal, for that the Crown takes away all attaint, and that perhaps he might be able to tranſmit it to his poſterity, and make it he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary in his own line. He knew his tyrannick Uſurpation was againſt all the Laws of the Land, and that he could hold what he had got, no longer than the Army pleaſed to ſtick to him, who, like an head-ſtrong beaſt, was grown ſo skittiſh, he had much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe to maſter it; but by ſetling the Crown on his own
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:29574:67"/>
head, he thought to reduce every thing to its old channel, the race of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> only changed, for that of <hi>Cromwells</hi>; and for this end he now began all he could, to court the Nobility and Gentry of the Royal Party, after he had ſufficiently humbled and cruſh'd them, and made them poor, all to ſweeten them againſt his aſſuming the Crown, having got, as he hop'd, a Parliament for his purpoſe: for none were admitted into this Parliament, after their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but ſuch as the Council allowed of, and many perſons, that <hi>Oliver</hi> durſt not truſt, were in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and that he thought not fit to ſit, till ſome Laws were firſt made, for the ſtrengthning his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and carrying on of his deſign.

            <p>At firſt this Parliament went on very ſmoothly, and to the content of their <hi>Protectorian</hi> Maſter; the firſt thing was, they made a Vote declaring his War with <hi>Spain</hi> to be juſt and honourable, with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of aſſiſting him in it: Then as a Grand ſtep for him to Mount the Throne, they make an Act for the renouncing the title of <hi>

the Nations peace, which was bound up in it. And this laſt Act was made by reaſon of a Plot then diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered againſt his Perſon, by one <hi>Syndercomb,</hi> or rather a Contrivance of his Secretary <hi>Thurlo's,</hi> to further his deſigns. This <hi>Syndercomb</hi> was a Leveller, or Fifth-Monarchy-man, and disbanded by <hi>Monk</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who being a reſolute fellow, and diſguſted, was drawn in by two of <hi>Thurlo</hi>'s Creatures, one <hi>Cecil</hi> and <hi>Toop</hi> of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Life-guard, who pretending a Male-contentedneſs, eaſily drew him in to a deſign of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Tyrant, there being about that time, a book printed and publiſhed, with the name <hi>Allen</hi> to it, a disbanded Leveller, called <hi>Killing no Murther,</hi> which with notable Arguments proved the Lawfulneſs of Killing <hi>Cromwell,</hi> as an Uſurper and Tyrant, which book almoſt ſcared him out of his wits, and made him ever after afraid of every ſtrange face that came near him; and made him betake himſelf to theſe artifices, to affright aſſaſſinates by his ſeverity. <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dercomb</hi> being thus trepann'd and drawn in, by his Inſtruments, had prepared a Blunderbuſs, and had placed it to ſhoot him in his Coach going to <hi>Hampton-Court</hi>; and if that failed, he was to have fired <hi>White-Hall,</hi> by placing a Basket of combuſtible matter in the Chapel, with a train, all which is diſcovered; <hi>Syndercomb</hi> and his Companions ſeized, the Life-guard men confeſs the Plot, and are pardoned, <hi>Syndercomb</hi> is tryed for it at the upper Bench-bar, (as they then called it) and convicted by the Witneſs of his fellow Conſpirators, he was Condemn'd to be Hang'd, Drawn and Quarter'd at <hi>Tyhurn,</hi> but before his Execution he was found dead, and poyſoned in the Tower, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the <hi>Inqueſt</hi> of the <hi>Coroner</hi> found it, though by others ſuſpected to be a fineneſs of <hi>Thurlo's</hi>; however, as a <hi>felo de ſe</hi> he was drawn at an Horſes tail to <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> and there put into the ground under the Scaffold, and a Stake driven thorow his Body.

            <p>The horrible licentiouſneſs of theſe times, had ripened the birth of ſtrange and monſtrous Opinions and Hereſies, and all places ſwarm'd with theſe kind of creatures, of an hundred different perſwaſions: The <hi>Ranters</hi> grew numerous, and committed their beaſtialities under the notion of Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence publickly, turning debauchery and all manner of wickedneſs into a Religion; ſome lying with their Wives, or other women openly in the Market-place, ſeveral, both men and women running ſtark naked, without the leaſt rag to hide their ſhame, about the ſtreets, and into Churches, pretending a Command from the ſpirit for theſe Actions. Then the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> encreaſed, who denied the Divinity of Chriſt, one <hi>Biddle</hi> being infamous for thoſe Opinions: and one <hi>Erbery,</hi> once a Miniſter, for <hi>Ranting.</hi> Then the <hi>Quakers</hi> began to grow numerous, under <hi>George Fox</hi> their head, and ſo troubleſome, that they diſquieted <hi>Oliver</hi> himſelf, who liked not their Antiminiſterial principles. But above the reſt, <hi>James Naylor</hi> was at this time remarkable, who grew to that height of deluſion and phrenſie, as to perſonate our Saviour, and procured a divine worſhip or adoration to be given to him, by ſome women attending him. He had been formerly a Soldier under <hi>Lambert,</hi> who ſtickled much to ſave him from puniſhment, but the Parliament now ſitting, take the matter into their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29574:69"/>
cogniſance; being ſent up from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where he was, he appears before them with a compoſed counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, his hair hanging after the faſhion of thoſe pictures made for our Saviour, and with a forked beard, often anſwering the queſtions put to him with <hi>Thou ſayeſt it.</hi> He was accuſed of Blaſphemy, and for aſſuming to himſelf divine Honours, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had <hi>Hoſanna's</hi> ſung before him, and ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions uſed to him, as the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed towards our Saviour, when he rode into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a little before his Crucifixion. He uſed ſeveral evaſions, but the Houſe ſentenced him, to be, both at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> publickly Whipt, through both the Cities, to ſtand in the Pillory, to have his Tongue bored thorow, and to be ſtigmatized in the forehead with the letter B, for a Blaſphemer; and then to remain in <hi>Bridewell</hi> during pleaſure: which ſentence was with great ſeverity inflicted upon him, and which he underwent with a more than ordinary patience and reſolution.</p>
            <p>The Parliament having made an Act, for <hi>Preventing of Multiplicity of Buildings, within ten miles of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>and that every houſe within that compaſs, built upon a new foundation, ſhould pay a years Rent to the Protector</hi>; they fall upon <hi>the Petition and Advice.</hi> In the mean time, <hi>Cromwell</hi> deſigning the Succeſſion of his Uſurpation for his Son <hi>Richard,</hi> begins to ſhew him to the World; but that he might give <hi>Lambert</hi> no Umbrage of his Intentions, he keeps him for ſome time in the Country in <hi>Hamſhire,</hi> where he had Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Daughter of one <hi>Major,</hi> with whom he had a plentiful Fortune. Here he grows familiar and kind to the Royaliſts, inſinuating into them by his <hi>debonare</hi> Carriage, and ſerving many of them in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral requeſts to his Father, endeavouring to get their good liking, by his Civilities, and af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able Diſpoſition. The firſt publick Honour done him, was in making him Chancellor of <hi>Oxford,</hi> which his Father had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for that purpoſe; then he was Sworn a Privy-Counſellor,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:29574:69"/>
and made a Colonel in the Army, that he might have an Intereſt in all Parties, and not long afterwards was made the firſt Lord of the other Houſe, after the re-meeting of the Parliament, and ſtiled the Noble Lord <hi>Richard. Cromwell,</hi> to prepare his way, had likewiſe his News-writer <hi>Marchiamount Needham,</hi> who tells the people there is no everlaſting principle in Government, which is but a temporary expedient, and that in the hazard of a Common-wealth, the next ſhift might be made uſe of; which was a King, as moſt agreeable and neceſſary. He had likewiſe an ill Poet, <hi>Pagan Fiſher,</hi> who in a <hi>Rodomontado</hi> ſtile, ſung his Atchievements in <hi>Latin</hi> Verſe, together with the Vertues of the pious <hi>Bradſhaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oliver</hi> having prepared things for them, as well as he could, the Parliament proceed hotly upon <hi>the Petition and Advice,</hi> which was their new Model of Government, and with which on the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1657, the Parliament having deſired a meeting with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, they wait upon him in the Banqueting-houſe at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington</hi> in a ſet Speech commended the office of a King, as ſetled here ever ſince Chriſtianity, approved by our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, agreeing beſt with our Laws, and temper of the People; a Model of which Government, as moſt proper for the good and ſecurity of the Nation, he there preſented him with. The old Fox returns, That 'tis a weighty Matter, and therefore deſired time to ſeek God in it; for without his Aſſiſtance, the charge would be too great for him to bear. That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were the beſt people in the world, and therefore all tenderneſs imaginable ſhould be ſhewed to them, and nothing done without due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their benefit: with much more of the like nature. The next day a Committee was appointed to attend him for his Anſwer; which being delivered after a dubious manner, they reſolve to force it upon him, and adhering to their Petition, frame a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of near half their Houſe to attend him, both
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:29574:70"/>
to hear and give ſatisfaction to his doubts and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in this caſe. The chief of theſe were <hi>Whitlock,</hi> Lord Chief <hi>Juſtice Glyn,</hi> Lord <hi>Broghill, Lenthal, Liſle, Philip Jones, Fiennes, Strickland, Thurlo,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Onſlow</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Wooſley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now it might be wondred at, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> having this fair opportunity, did not accept of this proffer, ſo much urged; no doubt but he moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly deſired it, yet was he ſo cautious and fearfull, leſt that, like the Dog in the Fable, he ſhould ſnatch too greedily at the ſhadow of Royalty, and ſhould loſe the boundleſs power or ſubſtance of his Tyranny, or in ſeeking to fortifie his title, loſe his tenure: for he well underſtood the temper of the Army, and that by the means of <hi>Lambert</hi> (who began to ſmell out his deſign, and fearing to loſe the Succeſſion promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him) was ready to Mutiny; which if he ſhould l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe, he were undone, knowing all his title was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by the power of their Swords, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt wear ſuch title, as they pleaſe, or would be contented with; therefore conſidering, that it would not be ſafe for him at this time to accept it, he was forced with reluctancy to put it off to a more convenient ſeaſon. Many meetings and debates how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had about it, and many Arguments held <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> between them: The Committee alledged that the title of King had been confirmed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for above 1300 years, and that neither the Perſon or Name of King had been diſpleaſing to them. That it was interwoven with the Laws, and was moſt neceſſary to be aſſumed: For that the Title ought to be accommodated to the Laws, not the Laws to it; as they muſt if he continued the name of <hi>Protector.</hi> That new titles were ever ſuſpected, and that the name of <hi>Protector</hi> had ſtill been unfortunate to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to themſelves: That it being given him by the Soldiers, it ſmelt too much of Conqueſt: That the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire never thrived ſo well, but was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ys full of confuſion, under the titles of <hi>Conſuls,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:29574:70"/>
Dictators</hi> or <hi>Prince of the Senate,</hi> as it did under the title of <hi>Kings,</hi> untill <hi>Caeſar</hi> came to ſettle the <hi>Empire:</hi> they alſo lay'd before him the reaſons for the changing the Title of Lord to King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> for the better and more regular Government of the Nation. But their main Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was drawn from the Statutes of 9 <hi>Edw.</hi> 5. and 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. by which all perſons were indemnified that took up Arms for the King in being, and would be a great ſecurity to himſelf and the people, to have it thus ſetled upon him by Act of Parliament: But for all this, for the Reaſons aforeſaid, his fears ſurmounted his Ambition, he at laſt gave them a peremptory Refuſal, telling them that it was againſt his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that he could not offend ſo many Godly men and Officers of the Army, who had declared againſt the title and office of King; but he deſired that the Title of <hi>Protector,</hi> and the Government by a ſingle perſon, might be confirmed by conſent of this Parliament.</p>
            <p>Upon this his refuſal, which was cryed up as a great Vertue, and ſign of his Humility, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confirm him in his former title and dignity, and an explanatory part to the <hi>Petition and Advice</hi> was prepared, in reſpect of the Protector's Oath, his Counſels, Members of the Houſe of Commons, and of the other Houſe (as they called it, inſtead of the Houſe of Lords) which were to ſit, and to conſiſt of 60 odd Lords of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s making. The chief heads of the <hi>Petition and Advice</hi> were, 1. That he ſhould exerciſe the Office of Chief Magiſtrate under the Title of <hi>Protector</hi> of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to govern according to the <hi>Petition and Advice,</hi> and that in his life-time he ſhould appoint his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. 2. That a Parliament ſhould be called every three years at fartheſt, and that it ſhould conſiſt of two Houſes. 3. That the Members of Parliament legally choſen, ſhould not be ſecluded the Houſe, but by conſent of the Houſe (notwithſtanding this he did
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:29574:71"/>
not re-admit the ſecluded Members of this Houſe which he had caſt out) 4. Shewed certain quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications for the Members to be choſen. 5. The power of the other Houſe was declared. 6. That no Law ſhould be altered, repealed or made, but by Act of Parliament. 7. That the conſtant yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Army and Navy be ſetled, and that to be a Million of Pounds Sterling, and 300000 <hi>l.</hi> more for the ſupport of the Government, beſides other Temporary ſupplies, as the Houſe of Commons ſhould ſee neceſſary and fit. 8. That the Protector's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſhould not exceed the number of 21, nor to be under 9, and 7 of them to be a <hi>Quorum.</hi> 9. That the chief Officers of State to be choſen or approved by the Parliament. 10. That his Highneſs ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage a Godly Miniſtry. 11. That the Proteſtant Religion ſhould be profeſſed, and that he ſhould cauſe a Confeſſion of Faith to be made, and that none ſhould be permitted to reproach it, or revile it by words or writings. With ſome other matters of leſs importance.</p>
            <p>With this, the aforementioned Acts, with an Act for Aſſeſſment of 60000 <hi>l.</hi> a month, for three months: Another Money Act for 50000 <hi>l.</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> 6000 <hi>l.</hi> for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and 9000 <hi>l.</hi> for <hi>Ireland,</hi> with ſome others concerning Trade, were preſented to <hi>Cromwell</hi> to Sign by the Parliament: To whom, returning them many thanks, he ſaid, That he perceived that among thoſe many Acts they had made, that they had taken great care to provide for the juſt and neceſſary ſupport of the Common-wealth, by thoſe Bills for Levying of Money, and underſtanding that it had been formerly the practice of the chief Governours, to acknowledge with thanks to the Commons, their care and regard to the Publick, therefore he very heartily thank'd them, and acknowledged their kindneſs therein. And after he had ſigned theſe Bills, and the <hi>Petition and Advice,</hi> and Articles therein, He told them, <hi>That he had undertaken one of the greateſt burthens that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:29574:71"/>
ever was laid upon the back of any humane creature, and therefore he asked their help and prayers to God, that he might have the divine Aſſiſtance, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of this great truſt. And that for his part, nothing ſhould have induced him to have taken upon him this unſupportable burthen to fleſh and blood, but that he had ſeen in the Parliament a great care of thoſe things, that might make clearly for the Liberty of the Nations, and for the Intereſt of ſuch as feared God: And if that the people were not thank full to them for their great care, it would fall as a ſin upon their heads.</hi> With much more of the ſame nature.</p>
            <p>This being done, they prepare for the Solemnity of his Inauguration or Inveſture anew, for though he was before ſolemnly inaugurated into the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorate,</hi> as you have heard, according to the <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet it was thought fit that it ſhould be done again, for the greater confirmation of the buſineſs, becauſe the Articles of this <hi>Petition and Advice</hi> were different from the former <hi>Inſtrument:</hi> For now there was to be another Houſe; and whereas before his Council was to name his Succeſſor, he had now power to doe it himſelf, ſo that he was an abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and might leave the Succeſſion to his Son if he pleaſed. A Committee being appointed for this purpoſe, on the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1657, before a great aſſembly of people, and with much more Ceremony than before, he was inſtalled in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great Canopy of State, in great pomp and much magnificence, too long for me here to relate; the Great Seal being carried by the Lord Commiſſioner <hi>Fiennes,</hi> and the Sword by the Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi> The City Sword by the Lord Mayor <hi>Tichbourn,</hi> all bare-headed: The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo preſent. The Speaker of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons preſenting him with a Robe of Purple Velvet, a Bible, a Sword and a Sceptre, making a Speech to him in preſenting them: Telling him, that the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:29574:72"/>
Purple Robe was an Emblem of Magiſtracy, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Righteouſneſs and Juſtice: The Bible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Holy Scriptures, was Chriſt Veiled and Revealed, and contained both Precepts and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for good Government: The Sceptre not unlike a Staff, was to ſhew he was to be the Staff of the poor and weak, of ancient uſe; for that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays, <hi>The Sceptre ſhould not depart from Judah,</hi> and that Kings and Princes were called by <hi>Homer</hi> Sceptre-bearers: That the Sword was not only a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, but a Civil Sword, a Sword rather of defence, than of offence, to defend himſelf and his people: Upon which he would preſume to write this <hi>Motto, Ego ſum Domini Protectoris ad protegendum Populum Meum. I am the Lord Protectors, to protect my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> This being ended, he gave the <hi>Protector</hi> his Oath on the Bible, and Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> made a Prayer, wherein he recommended the <hi>Protector,</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Army and Government to God: which done, the Trumpets ſounded, and the Heraulds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him <hi>Protector</hi> of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Dominions thereunto belonging. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he returned in great State, the Lord <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> and the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> his eldeſt Son carrying his Train. The Pageantry being finiſhed, the Houſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done like good Boys, have leave to play, for returning to their Houſe, they adjourn themſelves to the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> following.</p>
            <p>Being thus ſetled in his Dignity, he began to live more ſplendidly, and like a King, having a very full Court, and after a Monarchical Manner, all his Officers of State. <hi>Steel</hi> was made Chief Baron, and <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> Warden of the Cinque-Ports; but that would not ſatisfie him, for he was not a little diſguſted, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> had power given him to nominate his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and he now plainly perceived his Intentions of ſetling the Succeſſion in his Children, for which he now reſolves, if he can, to ruine him with the Army. But <hi>Cromwell</hi> is vigilant, and had on the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:29574:72"/>
19<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> at a certain houſe in <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> taken ſeveral of the Champions of the Fifth-Monarchy men, among whom was one <hi>Venner,</hi> a Preaching Wine-Cooper, <hi>Aſhton, Gowler, Hopkins,</hi> and <hi>Gray</hi> their Scribe, theſe were to have riſen, and with them was taken a conſiderable quantity of Arms, and their Standard, with a Lyon-Couchant, <hi>Guiles,</hi> in a Field <hi>Argent,</hi> with this <hi>Motto: Who ſhall rouſe him?</hi> The late Vice-Admiral <hi>Lawſon</hi> and Major <hi>Danvers</hi> were ſecured: As alſo Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> who was taken at <hi>Marlborow</hi> drawing up a Declaration againſt him, and clapt up in order to his Tryal. And hearing of private Subſcriptions to Petitions and Addreſſes to the Parliament, carrying on in the Army againſt Kingſhip, he peremptorily ſent to them to deſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their peril, and ſo over-aw'd and daſht them, that they durſt not go on with their attempt. There was no body now very conſiderable of their own party, that could give him any diſturbance but <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>; and to ſecure himſelf againſt him, he followed the example <hi>Lambert</hi> had ſet him before, in ſecuring himſelf againſt the <hi>Rump Parliament,</hi> and cauſed all the Army, by his <hi>Privado's,</hi> Regiment after Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſubſcribe Addreſſes, Congratulating his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Authority, and declaring their readineſs to ſtand by him with their Lives and Fortunes.</p>
            <p>This year, on the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1657, that great action of General <hi>Blake</hi> was performed againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> at <hi>Santa Cruze,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Tenarif,</hi> where he burnt their whole <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Ships, being 16 in number; notwithſtanding they were barraca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do'd in the Haven, and defended by a Caſtle well fortified, and 7 Forts, and got forth of their Haven without any loſs; for which conſiderable ſervice the Protect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r and Parliament ordered him a Jewel of 500 <hi>l.</hi> and gratuities to the other Officers and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But this Valiant and Renowned Seaman did not long out-live this his memorable exploit, dying at Sea, as he was entring the ſound of <hi>Plymouth:</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:29574:73"/>
Never any Seaman performed ſo many Actions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding to the Glory of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, as he did; and it was his only misfortune, that he ſerv'd not a lawfull Prince.</p>
            <p>And now the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> being come, at which time the Parliament was to re-aſſemble, they met accordingly, but they now were quite another thing, than what they were before; for according to the Clauſe in <hi>the Petition and Advice, That the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons legally Choſen ſhould not be ſecluded, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Houſe</hi>; thoſe Members that <hi>Cromwell</hi> had before kept out by force, were now re-admitted, though againſt his mind; who preſently gave him a diſturbance. Then according to their new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, there was the other Houſe, for as yet they did not dare to call it a Houſe of Lords, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of his chiefeſt Favourites of the Army-Officers and others, and many pick'd out of the Houſe of Commons, ſome of them being of the excluded Commonwealths-men, whom he hoped to draw to his party by this obligation, about half a ſcore like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the old Nobility were nominated, thinking to draw them in, but they refuſed to come. The Houſes being thus altered in their Conſtitution, quickly let <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſee he was deceived in his hopes, for <hi>Hazelrig</hi> and others diſdaining his proffer'd Baronage, took their ſeats in the Commons Houſe, where they thought they ſhould doe more good; and by which means the Commonwealths-men grew ſo high, that the other Houſe was not taken notice of, but fell to queſtioning all their fellows had done, during their Secluſion, and had the Meſſages of the other Houſe in contempt and deriſion. And now the <hi>Humble Petition and Advice</hi> was like to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. The news of their proceedings ſo inraged the mind of <hi>Oliver,</hi> ſeeing his great Hopes of being King ſo ſuddenly daſht, that contrary to the advice of his Council, he goes to them, and for haſte takes an Hackney-Coach, and entring into the other Houſe,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:29574:73"/>
and ſtanding under a Canopy of State, he ſends for the Commons to come to him; who being come, with much eagerneſs made them a long Speech; which being remarkable, I ſhall recite ſome few heads:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Lord was his witneſs; his deſires of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the affairs of the Nation, were for the ends of Mercy, Truth, Righteouſneſs and Peace, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired might be improved. That there was not a Man or Woman treading upon</hi> Engliſh <hi>Ground, could ſay that he ſought the place of</hi> Protector, <hi>but he thought the Nations happy therein. But that he was Petitioned thereunto by them, who had the Legiſlative Power, to take up a burthen too heavy for any creature, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did look they ſhould make it good to him. That he could ſay in the preſence of God, before whom they were all but poor creeping Ants upon the Earth, he had rather have kept ſheep, than undertook ſuch a place of Government as that was. That he had told them he would not undertake it, unleſs he might have men that ſhould go between him and the Houſe of Commons, to prevent tumultuary ſpirits; which was granted, and he had named another Houſe, and that it was not Titles or Lords that they valued, but a Chriſtian and</hi> Engliſh <hi>Intereſt, who would be a ballance to them and themſelves, and of their own rank and quality, whilſt they loved</hi> England <hi>and Religion. That he thought he had been doing his duty, and that they would be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but if they were too high and too low, they would not be ſatisfied. That God knew he had taken an Oath upon condition, expreſſed in the Government, and thought he had been upon a ſure foundation, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence had been confuſion if he had not done it. That there were no hereditary Lords or Kings ſetled, the power conſiſting in the two Houſes and himſelf, and that God would judge between them and him. God was his witneſs, that there was a ſeeking of a new ſettlement in the Army, that he ſpake not to thoſe Gentlemen, (meaning his Lords) or what they would call them,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:29574:74"/>
but to them the Commons that adviſed him to that place; yet that inſtead of owning him, ſome of them muſt have they did not know what. And that they were running the Nation into confuſion again; by their intention of deviſing a Commonwealth, that ſome of the people might be the Men that might rule all, and that thoſe things were not according to God and according to Truth; pretend what they would, it was a playing a game for the King of</hi> Scots, <hi>if he mought call him ſo, and therefore he thought himſelf bound before God to doe what he meant to prevent it. God was his witneſs, he told them what was true, the King of</hi> Scots <hi>had an Army at the water-ſide, ready to be Shipt for</hi> England, <hi>and that he had the knowledge of it from an eye-witneſs. That they had not only been endeavouring to pervert the Army, to draw them to a Commonwealth, but ſome of them, while ſitting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had been liſting of perſons by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from</hi> Charles Stuart, <hi>to joyn with any inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that ſhould be made; that if this was the end of their ſitting, and that if theſe were their carriages, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, he thought it high time to put an end to their ſitting; and therefore, by the living God, he declared to them, that he did Diſſolve that Parliament.</hi> To which many of the Commons cry'd out, <hi>Amen.</hi> And thus ended this Parliament croſſing and vexing <hi>Oliver</hi> to the heart, for he expected more ſupplies of Money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oliver</hi> having thus diſmiſt this Parliament, and rid himſelf of that fear, begins to fortifie himſelf againſt the Royaliſts, who had indeed formed a new Plot, for the bringing in their King, but were betray'd by <hi>Willis</hi> and one <hi>Corcar</hi> a Miniſter of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> who had been long employed by <hi>Cromwell</hi> for that purpoſe: The <hi>Royaliſts</hi> were glad the Parliament was diſſolved, for they feared a Commonwealth much more than <hi>Cromwell</hi>; not that he was leſs Tyrannical, or had uſed them more favourably, but for that the other ſort of Government had rendred it ſelf formidable, and was in danger to have been more permanent
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:29574:74"/>
than <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Kingly <hi>Protectorſhip</hi> could, for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, as they well might, that King <hi>Oliver</hi> would never be long endured by the people, whoſe eyes muſt needs be opened, and ſee that he was got into the Throne, and exerciſed the ſame power, and far more than the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ever did, and whom they had flung out only to make way for a Tyrant, and that they would never ſuffer a man of their own quality and rank thus to play the King amongſt them, and to be their Lord, without endeavouring to fling him out. Beſides, they found <hi>Lambert</hi> and the Army ſo much diſguſted, that they would rather have ventur'd all than not to have ſeen the downfall of <hi>Cromwell:</hi> ſo that the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> thought all things to be favourable to their deſign: But <hi>Cromwell</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving timely notice of all things by his Agents, among them, he takes care to prevent them, and ſending to his right hand <hi>Tichbourn,</hi> Lord Mayor, cauſes him to double the City-Guards, and to make great chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Militia, turning out all he ſuſpected, and preſently ſeizes on Sir <hi>William Compton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi>'s Brother, Mr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s Brother, Sir <hi>William Clayton</hi> and many more: The Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> who on the deſign had lain hid for ſome time in <hi>London,</hi> hardly eſcapes his hands. Alſo he ſeizes on Mr. <hi>Mordant,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>'s Brother: Mr. <hi>Manley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baron,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stapely,</hi> Mr. <hi>Manſel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Woodcock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carent,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jackſon,</hi> and one <hi>Mallory,</hi> who was thought to be a decoy to the reſt, being pardoned after Condemnation.</p>
            <p>And now, to give more terror to the Royaliſts, <hi>Cromwell</hi> reſolves again to new dye his hands in Blood, by the old Arbitrary and Tyrannical way: Up goes the High Court of Juſtice, and its bloody Preſident <hi>Liſle,</hi> who on the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1658 ſat. <hi>Cromwell</hi> had pickt out two Eminent Men to begin with, one Lay-man Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby,</hi> impriſoned ever ſince the Weſt-Riſing, and one Clergy-man, the Reverend Dr. <hi>Hewet,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29574:75"/>
(though falſly) to have endeavoured to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray <hi>Hull,</hi> whilſt a Priſoner there, and for holding Correſpondence with <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> for which he was Condemned for a Traytor, and ſentenced to be be-headed, which Death he ſuffer'd on <hi>Tower-hill</hi> on the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> following, though great applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſave his life had been made to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> by his Nephew, and <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Son-in-law, the Lord <hi>Faulconbridge</hi>; but the Tyrant was inexorable, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before-hand with <hi>Thurlo</hi> reſolved on the Death of theſe two men. The next was Dr. <hi>Hewet,</hi> who was accuſed before the ſame Court, for Conſpiring againſt the Government, and holding intelligence with the King. But the Doctor Demurred to the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Court, citing divers Law-Caſes, and giving many Reaſons againſt their authority, deſiring them to evince to him the legality of their Court, and he would plead to his charge. But this they would not, nor were able to doe; and whilſt he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with them, they took the advantage of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Plea three times; after which, though he then deſired it, ſeeing they would record him a Mute, they would not admit, for being deſigned for ſlaughter, had they admitted him to plead, he would have eſcaped them, for want of Witneſſes, which it ſeems failed them at that time. The Doctor had an Eloquent Tongue, was of great eſteem and abilities, and Preached long at St. <hi>Gregory's,</hi> where he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times could not forbear to deplore the miſery of the Kingdom, ſo that <hi>Cromwell</hi> had a particular deſire to rid him out of the way, as a moſt dangerous man, and took this occaſion to doe it; upbraiding the Doctor with very bitter and unbecoming lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, when he was brought before him to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. However, though he was Condemned as a Mute, yet he had the favour to be beheaded, and ſuffer'd the ſame day with Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi>; where he prayed almoſt an hour with great zeal and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſpirit, having his head ſevered from his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29574:75"/>
body, he dyed with much Chriſtian Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>The next that came to his Tryal, was Mr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> who at firſt denied the Juriſdiction of the Court, but was by his friends at laſt perſwaded to plead, and was quitted by one voice only, for very fortunately Col. <hi>Pride</hi> being taken with a fit of the Stone, went off the Bench, to the ſaving his life. Then Mr. <hi>Woodcock</hi> and Sir <hi>Humphrey Bennet,</hi> were tryed and acquitted: <hi>Mallory</hi> confeſt, was condemn'd, but not executed. Then Mr. <hi>Carent</hi> was try'd and acquitted. Mr. <hi>Henry Frier</hi> was condemned by them; but when going to be executed in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> he was reprieved: the like hapned to <hi>John Summer,</hi> who was condemned to dye in <hi>Biſhopsgate-ſtreet,</hi> and <hi>Oliver Allen</hi> in <hi>Gracechurch-ſtreet,</hi> who had their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieves brought them: <hi>Baron, Manly, Manſel,</hi> with one <hi>Seymour</hi> and <hi>Carlton,</hi> all impriſon'd on the ſame account, made their eſcape, but were arraigned, though abſent, and condemned.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Edward Aſhton, John Bettely</hi> and <hi>Edward Stacy</hi> were alſo tryed before this Court, for the ſame Crime, of raiſing War, and ſeeking the Death of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> where all three were Condemned, with little or no proofs againſt them; Col. <hi>Aſhton</hi> was a known Cavalier, and a Priſoner for Debt in <hi>Newgate</hi>; but being permitted by favour to go abroad, fell into the company of one of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Trepanners, who went ſtroling about for prey, who informs the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of dangerous words ſpoken by this <hi>Aſhton,</hi> for which he was tryed and condemned, though he denied them at his Death, and was hang'd, drawn and quarter'd in <hi>Tower-ſtreet,</hi> the Tyrant making all parts of the City his Shambles, of humane fleſh, for the greater terror: this was his bloody policy. Mr. <hi>Bettely</hi> was in like manner betray'd, and falſly accuſed by theſe Ruffians, the Emiſſaries of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> and <hi>Thurlo,</hi> condemned upon their Oaths, though he proteſted his Innocency, and was executed in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29574:76"/>
the midſt of <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> being hang'd, drawn and quarter'd: After he had been a long time dead, as they thought, on a ſudden he lift up his hands, and pulling off his Cap, looked upon them, ſtaring with his eyes, to all their amazements, till the Executioner diſpatch'd him. Theſe ſuffer'd on the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1658. and two dayes after Mr. <hi>Stacy</hi> was only hang'd: Many more, who were impriſoned and deſigned to death, eſcaped by <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Death, which was not very long after.</p>
            <p>He was no ſooner rid of the fear of this Plot, by theſe Executions, but he was again troubled by <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>'s Cabal, who had inveigled both <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Desborow, Cromwell</hi>'s near relations, with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth Principles, though <hi>Lambert</hi> intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſetting up of himſelf, in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s ſtead. But <hi>Cromwell</hi> now dallies no longer with them, but takes away <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Commiſſion, and lays him aſide, and diſpoſes his Regiments to others, whom he could better truſt, and ſends into the Army ſeveral Spies and Eves-droppers, to let him know the temper and behaviour of the Officers, and of their inclinations, whereby he might the better reform them.</p>
            <p>This bloody Tyrant, becoming Sanguinary, (as all other Tyrants doe) grows very fearfull and ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and began to dread every ſtrange face that came near him, which he would fix his eyes upon, and intentively view, for fear of an aſſaſſination; for that Book of <hi>Killing no Murther</hi> ſtill ran dreadfully in his mind, and made him to take all the care he could of himſelf, oftentimes ſhifting his Lodgings; to which he paſſed by twenty ſeveral locks, and uſually had four or five ways out of them: He ſeldom went and came the ſame way between <hi>White-Hall</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and always by private and by-ways, and in a great hurry, his Guards before and behind, ſtill on the Gallop, and his Coach (eſpecially the boots) filled with armed men, and began to be of very difficult acceſs to all perſons. Yet this year he had
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29574:76"/>
ſucceſs in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was ſurrendred into his hands, and <hi>Lockhart</hi> General of the Forces there, and his Kinſman made Governor thereof.</p>
            <p>And now the <hi>Exit</hi> of this great Tyrant and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per draws near, being uſhered in with a Prodigy three Months before; for on the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>June</hi> a great Whale came up as far as <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and was there killed. His beloved Daughter <hi>Cleypool,</hi> not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him alſo dyed, with an Ulcer in her Bladder, which cauſed ſuch acute pains, that put her into a Feaver, and in her raving Fits ſhe much call'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that bloody Tyrant her Father, for ſhe had been a Suitor for Dr. <hi>Hewet</hi>'s life, knowing his Innocency, but was denied, which gave her a great diſturbance, being ſenſible of her Father's Tyrannick ſway, and Murtherous projects, and of the Peoples hate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. Her Death, as they ſay, went near his heart, being about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which, with the troubles he ſaw were about to riſe from the Officers of the Army, fomented by <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> who had Married his Daughter; and <hi>Desborow,</hi> who had Married his Siſter, gave him a fit of ſickneſs, being at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> which he thought at firſt would paſs over, being only a <hi>Tertian</hi> feaver, and his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chaplains faſted and prayed with him; and <hi>Goodwin</hi> openly declared, that <hi>God had heard his prayers, for him, and he was aſſured he ſhould not dye that bout</hi>; but he was a falſe Prophet, for his Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver continuing with very ill ſymptoms, the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans not ſo confident as the Prieſts, cauſed him to be removed to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and he had been there but few dayes, when they ſaw very plainly, that he had but few dayes to live; and this being made known to his Privy-Council, they were all very much ſtartled; he finding himſelf now drawing towards his end, on the 31 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he cauſed all people to go out of his Chamber, but <hi>Goodwin</hi> and <hi>Thurlo,</hi> to whom he declared, that he nominated his eldeſt Son <hi>Richard Cromwell</hi> to ſucceed him; but theſe thinking it too
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:29574:77"/>
great a thing to be communicated to them alone, adviſed him to have more Witneſſes, leſt they ſhould not be credited in ſo great a concern: He then bid them to ſend for the Council of 9, which were thoſe he privately managed his more ſecret concerns by, and theſe were <hi>Fleetwood, Fiennes, Desborow, Whaly, Thurlo, Lawrence, Berry, Cooper</hi> and <hi>Goff</hi>; moſt of this <hi>Junto</hi> being come to him, he declared that it was his will; that his Son <hi>Richard</hi> ſhould ſucceed him as <hi>Protector: Fleetwood</hi> bit his lips, having been fool'd into hopes of the <hi>Protectorſhip,</hi> as well as <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> but little was then ſaid, and on the 3<hi>d</hi> day of <hi>September</hi> 1658, memorable to <hi>Oliver</hi> for two great Victories, <hi>Dunbar</hi> and <hi>Worceſter,</hi> he yielded to the great Victor Death, and march'd off the Stage of this World in peace, after he had trod it in Blood, War, Rapine, Oppreſſion, Cruelty, Uſurpation and Tyranny. Though the report went, the Devil fetch'd him away in the ſtorm, which the night before his Death was ſo violent, that many of the great Trees in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park were blown up by the Roots, and that he had ſeven years before made a Compact with the Devil, that he might obtain the Dominion of the three Kingdoms, and not be prevailed againſt: but theſe are Stories, and God's Providence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable.</p>
            <p>I have already given a character of this Man, and a ſhort account of ſome paſſages of his Life, before he aſcended to his Greatneſs. He was, no doubt, a man of extraordinary parts, and raiſed up by God for ſuch great undertakings, as a ſcourge to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was full of evil humours, and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a ſpirit of Rebellion againſt both God, the Church, and the King; and that they might behold their errors by thoſe diſmal effects that followed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their unnatural Rebellion; and perceiving them, might not in the ſame age, at leaſt, run into the like, nor pull the like fatal conſequences upon their heads,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29574:77"/>
as Uſurpation, and Arbitrary Rule and Tyranny ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in many, or in one, which God avert, and ſend peace and tranquility in our dayes. But yet the Memory of this Man is adored by many to this day, and he is the Idol of ſome, who will yet ſpeak great things of him, though without reaſon, and putting our decay of trade upon the preſent ill management of affairs, when indeed it is but the conſequence of our Civil Wars, and the great expence of Money, drained away from the <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> the vaſt ſums raiſed on the people by Taxes, Aſſeſſments and Exciſe, which coming into the Soldiers pockets, they ſet it going into motion; which with the vaſt ſums raiſed on the ſale of the Kings, Queens, Princes, Biſhops and Delinquents Lands, made a flood of money for the preſent, and nothing of want then appeared, which was the effect rather of the Tyrant's rapacity, than good management; for when this glut began to fall again into the private ſinks of rich men, who lived by the uſe of money; and others who had any great ſums fallen to their ſhares, fearing the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the times, and knowing no man could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe himſelf to be long maſter of his own, eſpecially money, where the Will of the Tyrant was Law, and whom to diſoblige was fatal, they remitted vaſt ſums for their ſecurity into the bank in <hi>Holland,</hi> making them rich, by trading with our money, whilſt we ſat contented with 3 <hi>l. per cent</hi> for to be ſecure; ſo that our trade fell, and in ſome time after a ſcarcity of money appeared, which ſuch who only look on the preſent time, and conſidered not truly the reaſon, attributed to the ill management of the preſent Governour, or of thoſe who ſat at the Helm. And therefore we may ſay, that the low ebb of Trade in our time had its beginning in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time. And we may likewiſe conſider, that in his ſhort Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was but four years and nine months, there was ſhewn ſo much Tyranny, Oppreſſion and Injuſtice, as (excepting the time of the Rumps
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29574:78"/>
ſitting) was not to be parallell'd in any of the Kings ſince the Conqueſt. Beſides in his latter dayes, when his fears began to render him cruel, he valued neither honeſty or honour, when they ſtood in the way of his Ambition, and therefore to me 'tis a wonder, for what it was they admired this Man; and muſt be cauſed either by partiality or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. As for his Politicks, his Peace with <hi>France,</hi> and his War with <hi>Spain,</hi> was certainly againſt the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> in leſſning the latter, and making the former too great for Chriſtendom, and looſing the ballance which <hi>England</hi> ought carefully to keep between thoſe two Monarchs, And then his impoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> on ſo eaſie terms, when brought with great expence of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood and Treaſure, to that extremity, that <hi>England</hi> mought have had what terms they would, ſo that the whole world thought him infatuated, in loſing ſo great an opportunity of doing good to this Nation. Then there is nothing more certain, that all the Perſecution that hath ſince hapned in <hi>France,</hi> of that King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Subjects, was the effects of his joyning in a League with <hi>France</hi> at that time; by which means that King humbled <hi>Spain,</hi> and made way for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in <hi>Flanders</hi> ſince atchieved, and inabled him to ſubdue all Factions at home, which were then ariſing, and brought him into a condition, to need none of them, being grown ſince the ſcourge and terrour of Chriſtendom. His ſhamefull defeat at <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> with the loſs of 1500 Merchants Ships to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in that War, as was made appear to <hi>Richard</hi>'s Parliament, and in his ſpending ſuch vaſt ſums of money, and yet leaving a vaſt debt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Kingdom, as appeared by the Accounts brought into <hi>Richard</hi>'s Aſſembly, may ſtand in bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance againſt his Victories, and ſhew that he was not always ſucceſsfull, and that he had not managed his affairs with that frugality and wiſedom, as ſome have thought he did, when as by his own accounts it
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29574:78"/>
appeared, notwithſtanding the great incomes he had, and the many Parliamentary ſupplies, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a debt of no leſs than 1900000 <hi>l.</hi> As for his Tyranny and Oppreſſion, 'tis needleſs to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it, that may be ſeen throughout this Hiſtory. Yet I cannot but inſtance here, that injuſtice of his to <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> who had been tryed for his Life by the Long Parliament, and acquitted, and by them diſcharged; yet becauſe <hi>Oliver</hi> knew him a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous man, and one that might give him a trouble, cauſed him to be tryed a ſecond time; and though then alſo cleared by the Law, yet according to his own Arbitrary Will, againſt Law, and with all inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and cruelty imaginable, kept him cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſo long, that he was almoſt conſumed by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he turned him out only to dye. Again, What greater injuſtice could there be, than that ſhown to Mr. <hi>Cony,</hi> who being a Priſoner at <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Suit; and being brought to the King's or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Bench-bar, as they call'd it, by an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> cauſes his Counſel to be violently taken from the Bar, and ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> for no other reaſon, than the Pleading his Clients Cauſe; ſuch an Act of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as cannot be parallell'd in all the Hiſtory of <hi>England.</hi> Yet this bleſſed man is admired. As for his ingratitude that appeared to Sir <hi>Henry Vain,</hi> who above all perſons in the world was the cauſe of his advancement, and had long eſpouſed his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, yet he ſtudied to deſtroy him both in his Life and Eſtate, becauſe he would not adhere to his perjury and falſeneſs: And becauſe <hi>Vain</hi> oppoſed him, he impriſon'd him, and would have proceeded farther againſt him. In <hi>Richard</hi>'s Aſſembly, upon the complaint of ſeveral Priſoners, kept cloſe in the <hi>Tower,</hi> many being ſent away moſt inhumanely, and ſold for Slaves beyond Seas; the Lieutenant being ſent for, and demanded by what Authority he had kept thoſe in his cuſtody ſo long Priſoners, he produced a Paper written all with <hi>Oliver</hi>'s own hand; in which

            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> ſeeing the many Addreſſes made to him from the People and Army, and the careſſes and flatteries of great ones, being a man of no great reach, thought all had been real, and now began to form to himſelf an Imagination of ſetling himſelf in his Uſurpation, and to look ſomewhat ſhy on thoſe of the Royal-Party he had before careſſed, and done kindneſs for, ſhewing more ſtate and greatneſs than formerly, and growing more reſerved to his familiars. But moneys growing ſcarce, his Council adviſes him forthwith to call a Parliament, and accordingly Summons are iſſued out for this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29574:81"/>
to meet at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> on the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January.</hi> Elections being made after the uſual manner, tho ſome would have oppoſed it, and by ſending Writs to the ſeveral Boroughs, they thought they ſhould get a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to their minds, but were deceived. <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo ſent each 30, according to the Model of Government, and for the upper Houſe the chiefeſt Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army were pitch'd upon, but many of them were of ſuch baſe extraction, that the Commons could hardly be brought to own them. <hi>Richard</hi> began to have ſome jealouſie of the Army, and finding many of his Council too great favourers of them, and of their power, he began to caſt about to have brought in others of his friends to ballance them; but he found ſuch oppoſition, that he could not bring it about. On the other ſide, the Army and Sectarian Officers began to be afraid of the enſuing Parliament, and therefore ſome of them adviſed him to follow his Father's ſteps, who was accuſtomed at ſuch a time to cauſe the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Officers of the Army to come up to <hi>London,</hi> and to be aſſiſtant to him on ſuch occaſions. This ſtartled <hi>Richard,</hi> being as much afraid of the Army, as they were of this approaching Convention, yet wanting his Father's courage and reſolution, he ſent for many of the Army to Town from their Commands, where they had the opportunity of Caballing and laying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for his deſtruction. Beſides, <hi>Lambert,</hi> by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> was got again into Command, and had a Regiment given him, and was as much in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Sectaries as ever. <hi>Richard</hi> was as yet Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, when <hi>Desborow</hi> and others would have perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, that the Army being diſcontented, and ready to mutiny, the beſt way for him would be to ſettle it on ſome known Officer amongſt them, and nominated <hi>Fleetwood:</hi> but <hi>Richard</hi> it ſeems was not ſo very a fool as to diveſt himſelf of that Command, but told them, that by his Father's example, he would keep that for a ſecurity both to them and to himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he could not protect them, and that the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29574:81"/>
Parliament which was ſuddenly to meet, would give them ſatisfaction as to their Grievances, to whom he ſhould remit them.</p>
            <p>And now at the time prefixed, the Parliament meet, conſiſting of two Houſes, the other Houſe beginning now to be called the upper Houſe; for the Commons was choſen, Mr. <hi>Chute</hi> a Lawyer, as their Speaker; who ſickning, <hi>Long,</hi> Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> was choſen <hi>pro tempore</hi> in his ſtead; and for the upper Houſe, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel Fiennes,</hi> Lord Keeper of the Great Seal was their Speaker. The firſt fortnight was taken up about the <hi>Recognition,</hi> with which they were awhile intangled, but at laſt they Vote; and it was Reſolved on <hi>Monday</hi> 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February, That it be part of this Bill to Recognize and declare his Highneſs,</hi> Richard, <hi>Lord Protector, and chief Magiſtrate of the Commonwealth of</hi> England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and the Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging.</hi> Reſolved, <hi>That before this Bill be Committed, the Houſe do declare ſuch additional Clauſes to be part of this Bill, as may bound the power of the chief Magiſtrate, and fully ſecure the Rights and Privileges of Parliament, and the Liberties and Rights of the People; and that neither this, or any other previous Vote, that is, or ſhall be paſſed in order to this Bill, ſhall be of force and binding to the people, till the whole Bill be paſſed.</hi> This done, a Committee of Inſpections is ſetled, to take a view of the Accounts and the Revenue of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: of which Mr. <hi>Scowen</hi> was Chair-man. The Commonwealths-men, who were conſiderable in this Convention, cunningly put in many Debates to gain time; which they did, though the <hi>Protectorian</hi> party were the major, and ſo could effect little; yet they had hopes of the infection of the Army, which they knew by means of their Emiſſaries ſpread much; for at <hi>Wallingford</hi>-houſe <hi>Fleetwood, Desborow</hi> and <hi>Lambert,</hi> with ſeveral others, held their Conſults for the diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing of <hi>Richard,</hi> and <hi>Fleetwood</hi> was courted to take the Protectorſhip upon him: <hi>Richard</hi> had notice given him of their proceedings, and ſome of his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:29574:82"/>
friends adviſed him to cut them off, and profer'd to do it if he would be Reſolute, and ſtick to them; but <hi>Richard</hi> was timerous and fearfull, and had not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage enough to give them ſuch a Commiſſion, and ſo loſt his opportunity of ſetling himſelf.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King had ſent a Commiſſion to <hi>Arthur Anſlow,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Angleſie,</hi> to <hi>John Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> Brother to the Earl of <hi>Peterborow,</hi> Sir <hi>John Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. Peyton</hi> and <hi>William Leg,</hi> giving them power as his Commiſſioners, to treat with any of his Subjects of <hi>England</hi> (excepting the Regicides) and to offer them his pardon, if they would now joyn together for his Reſtauration, and alſo to aſſure them of Rewards and Recompence, for any ſervice done for the future towards the bringing in of his ſaid Majeſty, and that whatever thoſe his Commiſſioners ſhould promiſe in his name, he would ratifie and confirm. This was da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Bruſſells</hi> 11 <hi>March</hi> 1659. By this means, and by the wary management of theſe Gentlemen, the King's deſigns began to thrive better than formerly, being ſtill betray'd by <hi>Thurlo</hi>'s Agents. So that now there were ſeveral Intereſts at work, and bringing ſeveral deſigns to the Anvil: The King's for his juſt Rights and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration. <hi>Richard</hi>'s for the ſetling himſelf in his unjuſt Uſurpation. The Commonwealths-men to regain their loſt Dominion and Tyranny; and the <hi>Army</hi> to keep their Rule, and the people in ſlavery, and to ſet up a Governour of their own, and that might be only ruled by their Power. Theſe have all their ſeveral cloſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, and all ſtrenuouſly buſie one againſt another.</p>
            <p>Upon a report made by Secretary <hi>Thurlo,</hi> concerning the State of the War betwixt <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Parliament ſend General <hi>Mountague</hi> with a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fleet into the Sound, but ſo ſtraiten'd in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, that he did little good. The Military-Council of Officers were very high, and favoured much by the upper Houſe, which much diſtaſted the Commons; and made them Vote, <hi>That during the ſitting of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, there ſhould be no general Meeting or Council of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:29574:82"/>
Officers of the Army, without direction, leave and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Protector, and both Houſes of Parliament. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> upon this, by advice, ſends for the Council of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and diſmiſſes them. And the Commons proceed to a farther Vote: Reſolved, <hi>That no perſon ſhould have or, continue Command in any of the Armies in</hi> England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>or</hi> Ireland, <hi>&amp;c. that ſhould refuſe to ſubſcribe, That he will not diſturb or interrupt the free meeting in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; of any of the Members of either Houſe, or their freedoms in their Debates or Counſels.</hi> This was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the other Houſe, who now began to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of a Combination between <hi>Richard</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, againſt the power of the Army, and that they ſought to weaken and divide them, ſo that they did not readily aſſent to this Vote. Beſides, they were not a little diſpleaſed at another Vote of the Commons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Tranſacting with them as another Houſe; which was, <hi>That the acknowledgment of that Houſe for another Houſe of Parliament, ſhould not prejudice the Peer-age of the Land, or their Privileges.</hi> And further the Commons Voted, <hi>That they would receive no Meſſage from thoſe of the other Houſe, but by ſome of their own number.</hi> Neither would they treat with this upper Houſe, as an Houſe of Lords, but found out a new word, to tranſact with them, and that upon tryal, and during this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Parliament, which they foreſaw would not be long, in continuance. The chief of the Officers of the Army were for the <hi>Protector,</hi> but the more numerous being Sectaries or Phanaticks were for <hi>Fleetwood, Desborow</hi> and the <hi>Wallingfordians</hi>; who had made them to believe, that <hi>Richard</hi> had an intent to caſt them out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, and that he would put the Army into the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and Gentries hands, who would bring in the King, and deſtroy the Liberty of the Goſpel they had ſo long fought for.</p>
            <p>Thus all parties being highly jealous one of another, none knew how it would end; but ſince the Power of the Sword, and the Arbitrary and Tyrannick ſway of the Army was greateſt, it might be well expected they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:29574:83"/>
would prove the ſtrongeſt party for the reſt, having not an <hi>Oliver</hi> to deal with. However the Commons like <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, went on, reſolving for many good Acts, mought they have been permitted to ſit to finiſh them. One was (as they thought) pleaſing to the Army, that care might be taken for the payment of their Arrears. They began to aſſert their Intereſt in the <hi>Militia,</hi> and had under their Conſideration an Act <hi>for the taking away of the Exciſe and new Impoſt, and concerning Cuſtoms, Tonnage and Poundage after three years.</hi> Likewiſe they Vindicated the Peoples Liberties, by ſetting <hi>Overton</hi> and other Priſoners at liberty, impriſoned by <hi>Oliver,</hi> and declared againſt the illegality of ſending men away to Foreign Plantations, out of the reach of the Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> whereby an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject could not have the benefit of the Law. And a ſtrict Bill was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring againſt it, with an intent to have puniſh'd that cruel Jaylor <hi>Bark ſtead</hi>; alſo they had ordered an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment to be drawn up againſt <hi>Butler,</hi> one of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s <hi>Baſhaw'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, to maintain the Conqueſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> more than its Revenue was expends 163619 <hi>l.</hi> Theſe people acted fairly and ſquarely, and mought they have ſat, would have done much good; they gave one another no Gratuities, nor Offices, nor granted any Money from the People, which was more than could have been ſaid of any Parliament for a long time before them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Actings of theirs, and ſeeing the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:29574:83"/>
to have them in eſteem, cauſed now the <hi>Protector,</hi> as well as the Army, to grow jealous of them, as well as of one another, ſo that conſtant Guards were kept by <hi>Richard</hi> and the Army, for fear of one another; and though the Houſe expected a Diſſolution, they could not yet tell which way it would come, or which party to fear moſt: In the mean time they give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for the drawing up an Act of Indemnity to quiet peoples minds. But on the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>April, Fleetwood, Desborow,</hi> and other chief Officers, follow'd by a great part of the Army, repair to <hi>Richard</hi> at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> with a Commiſſion ready drawn, and directed to <hi>Fien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> for Diſſolving the Parliament, giving him ſeveral Reaſons for their ſo doing, but for ſome time he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately refuſes, and was adviſed by ſome of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents to cauſe his Troops to be drawn up, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the head of them; but he was fearfull and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and the other party violent and inſolent; for his Uncle <hi>Desborow</hi> told him, that unleſs he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they would doe it without him, and ſo by threats and importunities he ſigned the Commiſſion for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving this Parliament. This is ſent to <hi>Fiennes,</hi> who twice ſent the Black Rod to the Commons, who ſcorn'd the Meſſage, and would not admit him; but hearing there were Guards of Horſe and Foot drawn up in the <hi>Palace-yard,</hi> and that there was like to be a force put upon them, they adjourned themſelves for three days, and the Speaker was attended by all the Houſe to his Coach, through all the Soldiery. Upon this they cauſe the Proclamation, which they had ready for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the Parliament, to be publiſhed, and declared them Diſſolved: and thus <hi>Richard</hi> dethroned himſelf; and though <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Desborow</hi> did not think to go ſo far, as utterly to deject him, not having yet agreed what Government to ſet up; yet after this was done, the more numerous, though inferiour Officers of the Army would not hear of a <hi>Protector</hi> any more, crying that vaſt allowance allotted for him, would go a great way in the maintenance of the Army, but reſolve for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:29574:84"/>
the preſent that <hi>Fleetwood</hi> ſhould have the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Army, and to diſpoſe of all vacant Offices till further order, and till they could conſider of a fit Model of Government. Thus <hi>Richard</hi> fairly is laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and quietly marches off the Stage, not long after retiring into the Country, having a promiſe from them, that they would take care for the payment of his debts, which by reaſon of his Father's Funeral charge, were very great.</p>
            <p>This was a kind of <hi>Interregnum,</hi> all was in confuſion, and no man knew what to doe. The Parliament after three days repair to their Houſe, but they find the doors lock'd, and guarded by Red-coats, and all the Avenues ſtopt with Soldiers, who denied them entrance, telling them <hi>Richard</hi>'s buſineſs was at an end, as well as theirs, by whoſe power they ſat: and thus ended this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who were not able to ſtruggle with armed Power. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Desborow</hi> had their hands full, and they had, as they ſay, pull'd an old houſe upon their heads; for <hi>Lambert,</hi> tho at firſt he appeared for <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and his party, deſigned nothing leſs than the ſerving of them; and ſince he was not able, but by ſome other Authority to get into the Supreme Command of the Army, which he aimed at for a further advance of himſelf, by his party he cauſed the <hi>Rump</hi> Parliament to be propoſed again, to a great Conſultation of the Officers of the Army meeting at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, where they were ſeeking God for a Government, with Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> and other Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Miniſters amongſt them, which affected them very much. But this alarum'd <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and his party, who found the Army mutinous and troubleſome, and not to be governed now by their Commands, and the few days they reigned, the Government lying like an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then upon their ſhoulders, they were forced to comply, and follow the ſtream; and in order thereto, the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorian</hi> Colonels, as <hi>Ingoldsby, Howard, Falconbridg, Bridg, Whaly, Goff, Norton, Smith</hi> and others were put out, and Commonwealths-men or Rumpers put in their ſtead.

the Government might be a free State and Common-Wealth, without a ſingle Perſon, Kingſhip, or Houſe of Peers. That there might be a due regulation of the Laws. That an Act of Oblivion might be paſſed. That the Laws and Ordinances made in the ſeveral changes of the Government, and not to repealed may be good in Law. That the publick Debts might be paid. That a Liberty of Conſcience be granted to all, excepting Papiſts and Epiſcopiſts. That a godly Miniſtry be incouraged. That Univerſities and Schools of Learning be countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and Reformed. That all Royaliſts be diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced and not ſuffered to have any place of Truſt. That none may have places of Truſt, but ſuch as are eminent for Godlineſs, Conſtancy, and Faithfulneſs to the good Cauſe and Intereſt of the Nations. That a proviſion be made for Succeſſion of Parliaments. That <hi>Fleetwood</hi> may be the Lieutenant-General of the Army. That the Legiſlative power may be in the Repreſentatives of the People, conſiſting of an Houſe ſucceſſively choſen by the People. That the executive power may be in a Council of State, conſiſting of a certain number of qualified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. That the Debts contracted by his late Highneſs and his Father, might be paid; and that a Revenue of 10000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> might be ſetled upon the late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and his heirs for ever; and 10000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> more during his Life, and 8000 <hi>l.</hi> upon his honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mother during her Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was the Armies project of Government, for which they receive the thanks of the Houſe by their Speaker, and are told there are many weighty things contained in it, which they would take into their Conſideration. And upon this, before they would make any ſettlement upon the late Protector, they ſend to him for an Acknowledgment of his ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Government, which he formally ſent them in hopes of the Settlement, with a Schedule of his Debts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But they refuſe to pay them, and delay making any Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement either on Him or his Mother, for they were a ſort of Perſons who never lov'd to give away money from themſelves. Yet to pleaſe him, and to remove him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:29574:86"/>
from them, they give him 2000 pounds to diſcharge ſome part of his Debts, and required that he and all his Dependences remove from <hi>Whitehall</hi> in ſix days. <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> began to grow diſcontented at this ſlighting his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but to pleaſe him, they Vote him to be the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief of all the Armies and Land-Forces in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> for one year; and, that he ſhould have power to Sign Commiſſions, and nominate Officers under him, as ſhould be approved by the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament. But upon the ſecond Reading of the Bill for this purpoſe, they altered their minds, and ordered all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions for the Land and Sea-Forces to be Signed by the Speaker, and delivered to the Officers <hi>Gratis.</hi> They alſo Order the Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> to be by Commiſſioners, and <hi>Henry Cromwel</hi> to be removed. 'Tis thought if he had ſtirred at that time, being much beloved by the Officers of his Army there, he might have diſappointed this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of any further proceedings, but being over per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, he quietly left his Authority. <hi>Scotland</hi> was yet a trouble to them, which they knew not how to get into their hands: for General <hi>Monk</hi> kept all things in ſo great Order and quietneſs there, and was ſo prudent in all his Actions, that they could not find fault with him, nor miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt him, but believed him really their Friend.</p>
            <p>They now begin to proceed vigorouſly, and cauſe the Protector's Seal to be broken, and confirm their own old one: of which <hi>Terryl, Fountain,</hi> and infamous <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> are made Commiſſioners, very buſie they are of preferring one another to places of proffit: and about the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> keeping cloſe to their <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> of Gain, they ordered a Bill for publick Sales to be brought in. And now <hi>White-Hall, Somerſet-Houſe, Hampton-Court,</hi> and all that <hi>Cromwell</hi> had kept for himſelf, are ordered to be ſold for ready money. And beginning with the Deer, they fall to ſelling them, by five or ſix Brace at a time. And that no Stone might be unturn'd, for the getting of money, they project to make all ſuch perſons, who had aſſumed Dignities or Titles of Honor, heretofore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on them by the late King, taken away by Act of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:29574:87"/>
Parliament, to pay the ſumms forfeited by the ſaid Act. Then they offer at an Act for the makeing all honours conferred by <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> voyd and null. Then they fall to their old trade of raiſing monies by Aſſeſſments, and continue the Exciſe and Cuſtoms to the 1 ſt. of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> And that they may hook in all they can, they autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the collecting of an Aſſeſſment granted by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament 1656 for 3 years, one year of which was yet behind and uncollected, this was 35000 <hi>l.</hi> a month on <hi>England,</hi> 6000 <hi>l.</hi> on <hi>Scotland,</hi> and 9000 <hi>l.</hi> a month on <hi>Ireland</hi>: thus they owned not the authority of that Parliament, yet they owned their mony Aſſeſſed by them, and put it into their own pockets. They next revive their Committee of plundring Miniſters; and make an order for impreſſing of Seamen which they wanted. Then they make their ſpeaker <hi>Cuſtos Rotulorum</hi> of Oxford <hi>ſhire</hi> and <hi>Berks.</hi> Sir <hi>Hen Mildmay</hi> of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and ſeveral other places to the cheif of their members; following their old voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſhareing all among themſelves. The Government of <hi>Jerſay</hi> to <hi>Coll. Maſon; Cooper, Zanker, Sadler,</hi> and <hi>Lawrence</hi> have Regiments given them in <hi>Ireland.</hi> All things ſeem to ſubmit to their power, and <hi>Fleetwood, Lambert, Desberow,</hi> and the reſt, are forced to receive their Commiſſions from their General Mr <hi>Speaker,</hi> which tho' diſſatisfied, diſſemblingly they ſubmit to.</p>
            <p>It was very much admired that the Parliament ſhould imagine, that the Armie would be true to them, or that any Oaths would hold them, when they had ſeen them ſo often break their former Allegiance to themſelves, and to their late Protector: and on the other ſide, it was as much admired, that the Armie would thus truſt this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament or <hi>Junto,</hi> they had ſo groſly abuſed: for they could not believe, that the <hi>Junto</hi> would not remember their doings, and ſo provide for their own ſecurity and eſtabliſhment, as to ruine the Armie if they could. But out of all this evil God was now a forming good. For the Government of the Armie under the Speaker the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, they made 7 Commiſſioners, namely Lieutenant General <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> Sir <hi>Hen. Vaine,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Hazlerig</hi>;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:29574:87"/>
Colonels <hi>Lambert, Desborow, Ludlow,</hi> and <hi>Berry.</hi> Theſe were very active in their authority, placeing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing many Officers in the Armie, by the Parliaments conſent. All things ſeem ſucceed to very fortunatly to them, and <hi>Lockchart</hi> Governour of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> ſubmits to them, to whom they ſend over <hi>Peirſon, Aſhfeild,</hi> and <hi>Packer,</hi> Colonels. To <hi>Ireland</hi> they ſend their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners <hi>Steelones, Thomljnſon,</hi> and <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and for the command of the Armie Colonel <hi>Ludlow</hi> with the title of <hi>Lieutenant General.</hi> Embaſſadors from the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces come over to congratulate them, and to offer their amity, as alſo from many other places were coming; ſo that they now began to think themſelvs ſure. They had a mind to new model <hi>Monk's</hi> armie in <hi>Scotland</hi> and were provideing to doe it, which <hi>Monk</hi> had timely notice of by his Agents in <hi>London,</hi> which made him write to the Parliament, in which he told them, that he thought himſelf fit to be credited in the qualifications of his own Officers, whom he aſſured them, were honeſt and ſtout men, and for whoſe fidelity he would be ingaged. This letter troubled them, being the firſt rub they had met with, yet they hoped to get over it: for they were now more eagre to have creatures of their own ſtamp in that Armie, and think with good words to pacifie <hi>Monk,</hi> letting him know as to his own Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they would make no alteration. But <hi>Monk</hi> was not ſatisfied with this, but ſent up ſome Officers to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite at <hi>London</hi> in behalf of themſelvs and the reſt. Then the <hi>Junto</hi> made an Order, that ſuch Officers as were in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Commiſſions of the Parliament, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them from the hand of certain Commiſſioners named for the civil Government of both Kingdoms. But thoſe for <hi>Scotland</hi> were not yet named, and <hi>Monk</hi> ſtill continued his old Officers.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Somerſet Houſe</hi> was expoſed to ſail, at the yearly value of 233 <hi>l.</hi> the groſs value of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials at 5545. <hi>ſt.</hi> 1 <hi>ſ.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> to he had not under 13 years purchace.

            <p>And now theſe Tyrants who held their fellow ſubjects in ſlavery had ſome inck'ling of a Cavalier-plot, which made them very jealous of every body; ſo that few could meet upon any occaſion but they were diſturbed and ſome of them clapt up, for Conſpirators. In <hi>July</hi> they put out their Act of Indemnity; but none were to have the benefit of this mock Act, but ſuch who being above 16 years of age ſubſcribed an Engagement againſt a ſingle Perſon, Kingſhip and Houſe of Peers. And all <hi>Cavaliers</hi> as would not take it were to be baniſh'd out of <hi>England</hi>; and if afterwards ſeen there to be proceeded againſt as Traytors, and 10 <hi>l.</hi> reward to the diſcoverer of ſuch perſon, or perſons.

            <p>The Harveſt was great and the labourers few, and in <hi>Auguſt</hi> the weather being ſultry hot, many of the <hi>Junto</hi> were retired into the Country; ſo that they could hardly make an Houſe: upon which they make a ſtrict Order that all (rotten) members attend the Houſe, and that none depart without leave of the Houſe.

And now having given ſuch a killing blow to the ſouldiery, and made the breach irreconcileable, they-voted that the Commiſſions of <hi>Lambert, Desborow, Berry, Kelſey, Aſhfeild, Cobbet, Pucker, Barrow,</hi> and <hi>Creed</hi> (all <hi>Colonels</hi> excepting the laſt who was a Major) to be voyd; and conſtitute 7 Commiſſionners to govern the Armie, Viz.

This made them very brisk, and now beleiving there might be ſome oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition made by the Armie, they cauſe <hi>Morly's</hi> and <hi>Moſſel's</hi> Regiments to be drawn up into the Palace yard, for a Guard to the Parliament. It was now high time for <hi>Lambert</hi> to look about him, and not being idle, thought it beſt to play his part while he had power: and therefore he, on the 13 of <hi>October</hi> with the other diſcharged Officers, drew a part of the Armie into Kings ſtreet, and poſſeſs themſelvs of all the avenues to the Houſe, and the Speaker <hi>Lenthal</hi> going thither at his uſual time in his coach, was ſtop'd, and after ſome expoſtulations, was forced to return. And thus their ſitting was prevented. Both parties of the ſouldiers kept their ſtations moſt part of the day, and every minute it was expected they would have engaged, whilſt the amazed inhabitants dreaded the iſſue. But <hi>Lambert</hi> having effected what he intended, procured an Order
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:29574:91"/>
from the Council of State, then ſitting at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> for all to draw off to their quarters, which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done, and ſo this periculous adventure, of a ſecond time unneſting theſe <hi>Rumpers</hi> was finiſhed.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, ſome more bold touches of Arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Uſurpation, and Tyranny in this ſecond, though ſhort, Reign of theſe Rumpers, who ſate only from the 7th of <hi>May</hi> to the 13th of <hi>October</hi>: in which time they diſcovered themſelves to be the ſame Covetous and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious Tyrants they were before in all their Actions, and had they time, would have appeared to have been as bloody; for they were preparing to bring the late Delinquents, as they called thoſe ingaged in Sir <hi>George Booths</hi> Riſing, to a Tryal, and they had got Liſts of moſt of the perſons, Nobility, and Gentry throughout <hi>England,</hi> that were engaged in it, whoſe Eſtates were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated and ſold, and out of whoſe Eſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now again the Kingdom is without any kind of Civil-Government, for the Uſurpation was divolved on a few O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For noble General <hi>Monk,</hi> whoſe Study to repare his Countries Breaches, was as great as <hi>Lambert's</hi> to oppreſs it, only waited for a fit opportunity, and judged this to be a moſt convenient time to beſtir himſelf, in ſo honourable a Cauſe, and whom the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army in <hi>England</hi> had neglected to put into their Council of State, believing he would, as he had hitherto, ſtill ſubmit to the Change of the Government; and by his ſtopping of the Packets they had not heard as yet, how he had forbid the getting of Subſcriptions in his Army, as they had done in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Though his Deſign then was the bringing in the King, and the reſtoring the three oppreſſed and enſlaved Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from the Arbitrary Rule, of Tyrannical Uſurpers, of the ſcum of the people; and alſo from the power of the Sword and Arbitrary Sway of the Army; yet he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cloſe in all his Carriage, and few were acquainted with the thoughts of his Heart: but taking this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to oppoſe the ſtrongeſt Power, the Army, he ſeems averſe to their doings, and appears wholly concerned for the <hi>Rump,</hi> or <hi>Parliament</hi> ſo called; and therefore that their Emiſſary might not corrupt or do any hurt among his Soldiers, he ſecures him, and by Letters ſignifies his diſlike of the Armies proceedings in <hi>England</hi>; tells them of their violation of Faith to the Parliament, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Reſolution of endeavouring to reſtore them to

their Powers; this arrived to them on the 28th of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> in the Evening, which put them to much Confuſion. <hi>Fleetwood, Desborow,</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> meet about it, and about midnight ſend for <hi>Clarges,</hi> to expoſtulate with him about it, who was wary, and could ſay little to it; however they order him with one Col. <hi>Talbot</hi> to repare preſently to <hi>Monk,</hi> that they might prevail with him for a Treaty, to prevent effuſion of blood, of which <hi>Clarges</hi> was glad, being deſirous to get out of their power fearing a worſe treatment.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Council of Officers meet at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> in order to Setlement as they called it, and of frameing a Government, that ſhould be laſting and againſt all attempts whatſoever: but having found moſt of the Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> to be one way or other involved for the King's Int'reſt, they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting to ſeize all their Eſtates, and to divide them among their own Party, and ſo to put the riches of the nation into the hands of perſons irreconcileable to Monarchy; and then to have ſet up <hi>Harrington's</hi> model of a <hi>Common Wealth,</hi> or ruled themſelvs by the ſword, or thought of ſome other way, they knew not what: This adviſe if followed, had been very fatal, and might have laid ſuch a foundation of ſlavery, never to have been ſubverted.

            <p>The news of General <hi>Monks</hi> actions in the North, allarm'd them, at their firſt ſiting, for he had caſheir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all thoſe Officers in his Armie; who would not joyn with him, and impriſoned ſome of them; and, had ſeized <hi>Berwick,</hi> and ſeveral others ſtrong Holds, and was likely to march into <hi>England,</hi> which put them to their wits ends, knowing how highly the people were incenſed againſt them; and about the ſame time, as a preſage of their dying power, <hi>Brad, ſhaw</hi> who had paſſed the trayterous Sentence upon the King, departed this life, the laſt day of this month, to receive ſentence himſelf from the King of Kings.

By the way meeting <hi>Lambert</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> they gave him ſo full ſatisfaction in hopes of concluding all things amicably, by this Treaty, that he advanced no farther northwards. The Commiſſioners on both ſides meet at <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Wilks</hi> not following his directions, went beyond his, Commiſſion, and being overforward to end the Treaty, concluded upon certain Articles very
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:29574:93"/>
diſtructive to <hi>Monks</hi> deſigns. They were breifly theſe. 1. That the pretended title of <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> or any other clameing from that family ſhould be utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. 2. That the Government of theſe Nations ſhould be a free State or Common Wealth, and not be a ſingle Perſon, King, of Houſe of Lords. 3. That the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry ſhould be mainteined and encouraged. 4. That the Univerſities ſhould be reformed and countenanced, 5. That the Officers and ſouldiers, and other perſons, on either ſide, ſhould be indemnified for things paſt, and all unkindneſs between them buried in perpetual oblivion. 6. That the Officers which were made pris'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhould be forthwith ſet at liberty. 7. That the Armies be preſently diſperſed into quarters, 9. And a Committee of 19, whereof to make the <hi>Quorum,</hi> ſhould meet about qualifications for ſuceeding Parliaments. 9. That the proportion of mony out of the Aſſeſſments of <hi>England,</hi> formerly appointed for the ſupply of the forces in <hi>Scotland,</hi> be duly paid. The ratification of which Articles by <hi>Monk's</hi> Commiſſioners, ſtrangely amazed the City, who had had private aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances from the General of other things, and made them not to believe ſome later letters ſent them, to continue their Hopes, but flung them away at fictitions, and cauſed the meſſenger to be impriſoned. <hi>Monk</hi> was alſo as much perplex'd when he had the news of it, and when his Commiſſioners returned impriſoned <hi>Wilks,</hi> for going beyond his Commiſſion, and by advice from his Officers demurred to one clauſe in the 6 Article, which was, That all the Officers diſplaced by General <hi>Monk,</hi> might be in a capacity of being reſtored to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and all thoſe put in by him, in their places, to be removed; by which means he ſhould ruine and diſarm himſelf. And therefore The treaty was not wholy diſaprov'd of, but wiſely <hi>Monk</hi> deſired, that two more might be added to the former Commiſſioners, to meet with the like number of theirs, to put a more abſolute period to their differences; for that there were certain poynts to be treated on not yet agreed to, and others
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:29574:94"/>
wanted explanation. This letter ſubſcribed by <hi>Monk,</hi> and many of his Chief Officers, and ſent to <hi>London,</hi> put <hi>Fleetwood, Lambert,</hi> and the reſt to much confuſion; ſeing <hi>Monk</hi> thus refuſe to ratifie the Treaty: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many expoſtulatory Letters paſſed between them, which gained time, the thing <hi>Monk</hi> intended: he having ſent letters and meſſengers into <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whom he had favourable returns, which encouraged him to proceed. And this alſo put new life into the City, who now began to revive their Hopes. He alſo had privatly letters from the Lord <hi>Fairſax,</hi> and other perſons of quality in <hi>England,</hi> of their reſolutions of ſtanding by him; tho' upon all this, he ſtill kept himſelf reſerv'd, and very few knew his inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions, which made many of his friends very doubtfull of him: but by this artifice and cloſeneſs he effected his buſineſs, and got into the opinion of the <hi>Rumpers,</hi> whoſe quarrel only he ſeemed to eſpouſe: And being thus encouraged by his actions, nine of the old Council of State get privatly together, viz: <hi>Scot, Morley, Reignalds, Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, Nevill, Hazlerig, Walton, Cooper,</hi> and <hi>Berners,</hi> who ſend a letter to <hi>Monk,</hi> aſſuring him, that his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was highly acknowledged by them, in aſſerting their Liberties, and alſo was extreamly well reſented by all the ſober and unintereſted perſons in the nation, that love a Common Wealth; aſſureing him they would adhere to him, and ſtand and fall with him, and that they would aſſiſt him with all their might, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveing of the force was put upon them by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Armie, thIt they might ſit in freedom; praiſeing his wiſdom and conduct, and the like. This was no ſmall incouragement to the Officers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for they might rationally conclude, that their party was increaſed in <hi>England,</hi> or elſe that they would not have ſo openly acted. This before-mentioned Council of State, framed a Commiſſion, wherein they conſtituted General <hi>Monk</hi> abſolute Commander in Cheif of the Armies in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> dated 24 of <hi>November</hi> ſealed with their ſeal, and given to <hi>Clarges</hi> to ſend by a ſafe meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to <hi>Monk.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:29574:94"/>And now General <hi>Monk,</hi> upon <hi>Lamberts</hi> advance into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> ordered a conſiderable part of his forces towards <hi>Berwick</hi>: and then cauſed an Aſſembly of the Nobles and Gentry, to convene at <hi>Edenburg</hi> to whom he made theſe propoſals. That he having a call from God and man, to march into <hi>England</hi> they would therefore, during his abſence, preſerve and ſecure the peace of that Nation. That they would ſupply him with ſome mony for his undertakeing, which he enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon his honor ſhould be to their ſatisfaction; and that if any troubles ſhould ariſe, they would aſſiſt him in the ſuppreſſing thereof. That they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and raiſe what mony they could for his entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe before hand. To theſe they returned anſwer by their chair-man, the Earl of <hi>Glencarn</hi>; that they were not in a condition to engage for preſerving the peace of the Country in his abſence; becauſe they wanted Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: Yet they would endeavour it with all faithfullneſs: That they thought it not prudent to engage themſelves in a war, which if unſucceſsfull would be their ruin, or if proſperous they knew not what advantage ſhould thereby accrew to them. But to ſhew their good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his fair intendment, they were content to levy monies, and to advance a year's Tax before-hand. Hereupon the General impowred the Lords and Gentry to arme themſelves; and ſome of them he privately ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his deſign, and thankfully accepted the year's Tax. But yet to win time, he holds a ſecond Treaty with <hi>Lambert's</hi> Commiſſioners at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine</hi>; where he ſtill inſiſted with a ſeeming zealouſneſs, upon the readmiſſion of the <hi>Rumpers</hi>: And this produced its wiſhed effects. For whilſt <hi>Lambert</hi> trifles away his time unprofitably, <hi>Monk</hi> poſts himſelf at <hi>Cold-ſtream,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table paſs upon the <hi>Tweed,</hi> where he kept his head Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and being winter, where <hi>Lambert</hi> could not, without danger, come to diſturb him. And on the other ſide <hi>Hazlerig, Morly</hi> and <hi>Walton</hi> get into <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> where they prevail with the Governour Col. <hi>Nathaniel Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> and the Gariſon, with the Town, to declare for

he <hi>Junto,</hi> againſt the <hi>Safety men</hi> and Armie Officers, and no Contribution could be gotten from the Country; who armed themſelvs with the late Act of the <hi>Rumpers</hi> before their excluſion by <hi>Lambert</hi>; and the Counties every where bodly meet to draw Remonſtrances; but eſpecially the City was ſo highly incenſed, that the Lord Mayor, <hi>Allen,</hi> was hardly able to reſtrain them from flying to armes; which ſo perplexed him that not knowing whom to pleaſe, and fearing bad effects if he ſhould diſpleaſe either, he went to <hi>Wallingford</hi> Houſe to repreſent the poſtures of affairs to the <hi>Gang,</hi> to try if he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to reaſon: But he was affronted all along as he paſt in his coach, in the ſtreets; by the Common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who called him a deſerter, and told him he was not like Sir <hi>William Walworth</hi> in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond; which was a notable evidence of the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Generality.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, that we may ſee and be aſtoniſhed at the impudence of theſe men, or monſters, called the <hi>Safety men</hi>: they had ordered a Committee (whom we nominated before) as mad as themſelves, to ſit at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> to find out a new Government; whoſe wits being not ſo accute as their ſwords were quickly confounded in the building of thir <hi>Babel.</hi> Sometimes they would have a <hi>Senate,</hi> and another time they were for <hi>Conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ingsſordians,</hi> which muſt needs be as unalterable as the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> Theſe are, 1 That no Kingſhip ſhall be exerciſed in theſe Nations 2 That no ſingle Perſon ſhall exerciſe the Office of Cheif Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate here. 3, That an Armie be continued, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and conducted, ſo as it may ſecure (that is impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)

            <p>But theſe Gimcraks would not ſatisfie at all. But the Treaty ſtill being in hand, they were lulled into a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and began, after the old manner of the <hi>Rumpers,</hi> to ſhare among themſelvs the Cheifeſt Offices and places of Truſt and proffit; and to his end <hi>Fleetwood, Desborow, Sydenham, Saloway, Holland, Clerk,</hi> and <hi>Blakwell,</hi> or any two of them are appointed Commiſſioners of the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and to manage the publique revenue, with power as large as they could wiſh or deſire. But being diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with the peoples drawing up of ſeveral Petitions, and getting Subſcriptions, iſſue forth a Proclamation againſt all ſuch petitioning, and call their petitions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and dangerous papers, and prohibit all perſons to ſubſcribe any ſuch papers, and if offered to ſuppreſs them, and to cauſe all perſons ſo endeavouring to get ſubſcriptions to be apprehended, upon account of being enemies and diſturbers of the peace. Thus you ſee, theſe very men, who had ſet examples of this nature ſo frequently by geting Subſcriptions to Petitions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, to the Autority then in Being, could not endure it, now it twarted their humors and intereſt; and what in themſelvs they indulg'd and pleaded for, as their right, they will abhor and will puniſh in others. Mind therefore the Juſtice of theſe men.</p>
            <p>But this Prohibition of theirs did but the more enrage the people, and the <hi>Londoners,</hi> eſpecially the Apprentices, were in an uproar, and readye to mutine; whereupon <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woſn</hi> the one ey'd cobler, hath order with his Regiment of foot, and ſome horſe to march into the City: where he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:29574:96"/>
ſo that the Citizens ſhut up their ſhops; yet rather madded than daunted thereat, there were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall bickerings between them and the ſouldiers; neither could <hi>Desborows,</hi> canting ſpeech at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> work upon them, but that ſometimes multitudes would flock toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and affront the ſouldiers, and tho' they were often diſperſed yet they would gather head again. And now the Common-Council, in which at that time were many ſtout and honeſt men, began to give ear to the Apprentices petitioning for a free Parliament; being thereunto encouraged by an offer of 3000 valiant Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to aid them, from Vice Admiral <hi>Lawſon</hi>; who in this juncture was come up the <hi>Thames,</hi> and had ſurprized all the Forts and Blockhouſes in the way: <hi>Vaine</hi> and <hi>Salmon</hi> were ſent to confer with him, but nothing would prevail with him, unleſs the <hi>Wallingfordians</hi> would readmit the <hi>Rumpers</hi> to ſit again.</p>
            <p>And beſides all this, <hi>Hazelrig, Morley,</hi> and <hi>Walton,</hi> at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> had ſo wrought upon thoſe Regiments which were ſent againſt them, that they all came over to their ſide. The <hi>Safety men</hi> and Officers at <hi>White-Hall</hi> perceiving themſelvs to be generally hated and ſlighted, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mony to pay their ſouldiers and uphold their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, being withall beſet on every hand with enemies; both City and Country being ready to riſe upon them, found a neceſſity of ſubmiting to the <hi>Rumpers,</hi> for fear, leſt while the two <hi>Currs</hi> ſtrove for the bone of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Royal <hi>Lyon</hi> ſhould come in and deſtroy them both; they finding the pulſe of the whole nation (tyred with the various fits of arbitrary ſway) beating towards the return of the King, and to their old and equal way of Government; and the late reconciliation between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> (in which his Majeſty was very inſtrumental) ſeeming to preſage ſome danger to them; the Cheif of them then go to the Speaker <hi>Lenthal,</hi> and cry <hi>peccavimus</hi>; where tender-hearted <hi>Fleetwood</hi> meekly weeping, gave a full teſtimony of his ſorrow for his rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated defection, ſaying: <hi>That the Lord had blaſted their Councells</hi> and <hi>ſpit in their Faces</hi> ('tis his own rhetoric) and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:29574:96"/>
therefore deſires, him and the reſt of the members, to return to the exerciſe of their Truſt, for the Government of the Nation. And the ſame day the ſouldiery being drawn up in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-feilds</hi> owned the <hi>Junto</hi> again for the ſupream authority, now they ſaw thy could keep it no longer themſelves. The Speaker went preſently to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> the care of which &amp; Government whereof, he committed to Sir <hi>Antony Aſhly-Cooper,</hi> Mr. <hi>Weaver,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Berners,</hi> and two dayes after, being the 26th. of <hi>December,</hi> this never dying <hi>Rump</hi> reſumed their old places; and thus ended the Government of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, which laſted only from the 13th. of <hi>October</hi> to the 26th. of <hi>December</hi> following.</p>
            <p>And now, almoſt tyred with relateing, tho breifly, the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and tyranical uſurpations, we are come to the laſt Act of our <hi>Tragedy</hi> or <hi>Trage-comedy</hi> ſince it ends happily, and after the tryall of ſo many ways of Government, almoſt to the ruin of the Nation, they return to the <hi>good old way</hi> of <hi>Monarchy</hi>; as the onely juſt, equal, and legal way of <hi>Government</hi> for theſe Nations, and for the eaſe and free-dom of the people But let us purſue our ſtory, and ſee the laſt ſtruggle &amp; gaſp for life of this <hi>Monſter,</hi> or <hi>Dragon,</hi> of a <hi>Common Wealth</hi> ruleing by their <hi>Arbitrary</hi> wills, back'd by the power of the ſword, of a ſtanding Armie, who like the <hi>Turks Janizarie</hi> Keept both the people and their Maſters in awe; tho hey knew the one, was not able to ſtand the other.</p>
            <p>Soon after this revived <hi>Junto,</hi> to their great joy, had met, <hi>Hazelrig, Morley,</hi> and <hi>Walton,</hi> came to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, being attended from <hi>Portſmouth</hi> by thoſe forces, that were led by <hi>Desborow</hi> to reduce them; who being then deſerted by them, haſted back to <hi>London,</hi> and from thence to St. <hi>Albans</hi>; whence he wrote an humble letter to his reſtored Maſters, craveing pardon, and telling them, that he had procured his own Regiment, which was at that time quarter'd there, to return to their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. From S. <hi>Albans, Desborow</hi> went into <hi>Yorkſheir</hi> to <hi>Lambert,</hi> who was now in a declineing condition.</p>

               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:29574:97"/>
now broke of the treaty he had yet continued at <hi>York,</hi> and had planted his armie very advantageouſly along the River <hi>Tweed,</hi> on the <hi>Scotch</hi> ſide, in ſuch a prudent manner, that in a few hours he could have all his Forces together; and lay ſo well poſted, that the enemie could not make their way to him without extraordinary diſadvantage: and if <hi>Lambert</hi> ſhould have attempted to have got to him by the way of <hi>Carlile,</hi> he would by that means have gained ſeveral days march before him towards <hi>London</hi>; being alſo well aſſured, the Country would come in a pace to him. <hi>Lambert</hi> was about 13000 ſtrong, and far ſuperior to General <hi>Monk</hi> (in numbers) eſpecially in Horſe; which made that famous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced commander decline engageing.</p>

            <p>A third part at leaſt of their Council of State refuſed this Oath, ſaying it was a ſnare and a confining of Providence, and ſo were not permitted to ſit.</p>

The General came to St. <hi>Albans</hi> upon the 28 th. of <hi>January,</hi> and there made an hault, ſending from thence a letter to the <hi>Junto,</hi> which he had framed before-hand as <hi>Nottingam,</hi> in which he deſired to have his quarters aſſigned him, according to the liſt he had ſent, ready drawn in his letter, and that thoſes forces that were now there, might draw forth and march to ſeverall Quarters, far enough a ſunder, as he had alſo by his liſt incloſed appoynted or deſired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> telling them he did it upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſideration, of the preſent poſture of their affairs, that thoſe places he had aſſigned to them, who were to march out, might be ſecured for them, he having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of their diſtemper'd condition, and that he preſumed with ſubmiſſion, that it would not be for their ſervice, that thoſe ſouldiers then in <hi>London</hi> lately in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt them, ſhould mingle with thoſe of his approved faithfull Regiments, till they ſhould, by their new Officers put over them, be reduced to a more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

obedience to them. Colonel <hi>Merley's</hi> and Colonel <hi>Fagg's</hi> Regiments were excepted, he having an aſſurance of them. This letter was ſent by Colonel <hi>Lydeot,</hi> who was allyed to the Speaker. This letter cauſed a violent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, which laſted from 8 in the morning, till 12 at noon, the reſult of which was; That the Parliament did agree with the diſtributions of the ſouldiers according to the Liſts, and that the Souldiers be forth with diſtributed accordingly. The General was not a little glad to hear of this, for by this he did his buſineſs, and it was of great conſequence as to his deſign, in thus getting the ſole poſſeſſion of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> into his power: <hi>Fleetwoods</hi> armie marched out of <hi>London,</hi> having a months pay aſſigned them, but this did not ſatisfie, nor keep them from grumbling, and ſome of them <hi>mutined</hi> at <hi>Somerſte-houſe,</hi> but at laſt were fain to follow their fel-lows. The <hi>Junto</hi> would have given the General a 1000. pounds a year out of Sir <hi>George Booths</hi> eſtate, but he refuſed it; and then they grant him St <hi>James's</hi> park dureing their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Upon the 3d of <hi>February,</hi> having ſent his Lady and family before him, he marched into <hi>London,</hi> with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, entring by the way of <hi>Grays Jun-lane</hi> and ſo thorow <hi>Chancery lane</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> bar, into the <hi>Strand,</hi> where, about <hi>Somerſet</hi> Houſe he was met by the Speaker, where they complemented one another, and becauſe he would not fall more under the ſuſpition of his Jealous Maſters, he is content to accept of the Lodgings they had appoynted for him at <hi>White-Hall.</hi> Goeing to the Parliament Houſe on <hi>Munday</hi> the 6 of <hi>February</hi> he received the thanks of the <hi>Junto,</hi> and afterwards made a ſpeech to them, ſtanding at the back of a velvet chair they had placed for him within the Bar, in which he thank'd them for the Honour they had done him, and among other things, after he had give them an account of Affairs, he humbly deſired them to ſatisfie the expectation of the Nation, in the eſtabliſhment of their Laws, Liberties, and Properties, to remove the Conceit, which the people had of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to perpetuate themſelves, by their determining thir own Seſſion, and for providing for future Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

and the fewer qualifications the better; intreating them to uſe the Nobility and Gentry civilly, and telling them that the <hi>Phanaticks</hi> were as dangerous as <hi>Cavaliers.</hi> This ſpeech of his was no good Muſick in their ears, and ſome of the haſty raſh ones among them, had much adoe to forbear interrupting him, however, tho' galled, they diſſembled a while, for that the City ſtill continued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory, and had paſſed a Vote in Common Council Feb. 8. <hi>Not to pay</hi> or <hi>levie any Taxes till they had a full and free Parliament.</hi> Upon which the <hi>Junto</hi> thinking this to be highly derogatorie to their Authoritie, the Council of Sate order the General, the next morning to go into the City with a part of the Armie, and to ſeize on 11 of the moſt active of them, and to pull down their Poſts and Chains, to unhinge their Gates, and take away their porculliſſis. The Generae was ſurprized at this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, knowing it would render him odious to the Citizens, and ſuſpected that they deſigned by this means, to make an utter breach between the City and Him, that they might tye him the ſurer to their own party. He was one of the Council of State, but did not ſit among them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he denyed to take the Oath, yet he went to them, &amp; debated the buſineſs with them, til mid-night, divert but he found nothing he could ſay would their reſolutions. They alſo ordered him to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ſouldiers upon them, till he had brought them to obedience. He ſaw he was now forced to obey, or quit his Command; and to do the latter at this time, would ſpoyle all he had labour'd for; and openly to make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption had then been equally dangerous, being not yet fully aſſured of his ſouldiers: wiſely therefore he reſolves to obey theſe orders, and by this means to try the ſpirits of the ſouldiers, and of the Citizens, and alſo to quaſh the ſuſpitions of his Maſters. His Commiſſion being now expireing.

Parliament,</hi> which they had not, for they had no Burgeſſes in the Houſe. Upon this refuſal, the General ſeiſes 9 of the 11 they had appointed him, and to the amaſement of the Citizens, who had thought him their friend, and to the ſouldiers; who obeyed his orders very unwillingly. He pull'd down their Poſts and Chains; and applications being made to him by ſome of the moſt ſober of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, he could not but reſtifie how ungratefull the Action was to him, but that he was under Maſters, whom he was bound to obey, but promiſed he would write to them the next day about it, as he did, giving the <hi>Junto</hi> an Account, how he had obeyed their orders, as to ſeiſing the perſons they had commanded him to ſeize, and had pulled down their Poſts and Chains, but had not as yet medled with their Gates, becauſe the Common Council were appoynted to meet that morning, and he doubted not, but that all things would be compoſed to their ſatisfaction, and the Aſſeſſment paid. But the <hi>Junto,</hi> upon the reading his Letter, grew higher and more violent than before, and without other anſwer, ſent him a peremptory order, not only to unhinge their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and take away the portculliſies, but to break them all to pieces and likewiſe order'd, That the preſent Common Council of the City, ſhould be diſſolved, and declared them nul and voyd, ordering him not to let them meet. Vext at his noble Heart the General was, to ſee himſelf, made the <hi>Junto's</hi> Executioner; but leaſt they ſhould at this time vacate his Commiſſion, which he thought they ſought at preſent for; he fully executed their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to the great Grief of the City, and for a time to the utter loſs of their Affection, and he perceived alſo the temper of his own ſouldiers, who many of them utterly refuſed; tho' they told him they would dye for him in Battell: but this was a work unworthy of ſouldiers, to a Citty that was their friend.

            <p>The Letter they ſent to the <hi>Junto</hi> ſitting, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly march into <hi>London,</hi> to ſhake hands with the City: on the 11 of <hi>February</hi> the Armie is drawn up into <hi>Fins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> feilds and the General being invited to dinner, by the Lord Major, who at firſt was very ſhie, not knowing how to believe what ſome of <hi>Monks</hi> friends had told him of the General's Letter to the <hi>Junto,</hi> and of his reſolving to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for a free <hi>Parliament,</hi> but before they parted, the

General himſelf gave him, and the reſt of the Citizens, ſuch ſatisfaction of his Integrity, that, overjoy'd, they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſouldiers to be feaſted, and Quarters in the City to be provided for them, the Bells in all the Churches to ring, and at night Bonfires to be made in every ſtreet, declareing for a free <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Junto</hi> read the Generals and his Officers Letter, which cauſed a very great diſorder in the Houſe: however they thought it beſt to diſſemble, and ſecretly reſolve to ruine Him, if they can, tho' openly they Vote him the thanks of the Houſe, and ſend away <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinſon</hi> to give it him, and to let him know they were about qualifications for members to be Choſen, for the filling up their Houſe. But when they heard of what was done in the City, the <hi>Rumpers</hi> gnashed at it, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry they were, that they could not take revenge on the ſubſcribers of the late Remonſtrances for a free <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> whoſe Eſtates they earneſtly longed to be dealing with. And now in the nick of Time comes a Declaration from <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they had ſecured Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller</hi> a Rumper, which was of the ſame nature with thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Counties; but more bold and reſolute, ſpeaking their Minds freely, the Lord <hi>Broughill</hi> being one of the Cheif promotors of it. His Excellency having waited ſome days for an anſwer to his Letter, and receiving none, but what <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinſon</hi> brought him, who durſt not ſtay in the City, for fear of being ſtoned; and finding nothing done in reference to the filling the Houſe, he ſet himſelf about conſidering ſome way to diſſolve the <hi>Junto,</hi> without force or violence. In this juncture, many of the ſecluded Members were in and about the City; Some of whom ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed themſelves to the General, who procured a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between ten of them, and ten of the <hi>Junto</hi>; where, the one party challenged admiſſion as Members of the Houſe, unjuſtly forced from it before; the others refuſed it, unleſs they would confirm all that was done ſince by them, or at leaſt ingage as they had done againſt a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon, and Houſe of Lords; but when they could not agree about theſe poynts; <hi>Monk</hi> who was preſent both

times, (for they had two meetings) clearly diſcerning more of ſelf-intereſted wilfulneſs than any Reaſon in what the <hi>Rumpers</hi> urged, a day or two after ſent for the Secluded, and demanded if they were of the ſame mind, and reſolved not to engage againſt a ſingle perſon, to which they anſwering affirmatively, and profeſſing to be immoveable therein, he got above fourſcore of them together to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where recommending the care of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the State to them, and telling them how ſuteable Phyſick a full and free <hi>Parliament</hi> would be for the crazed body of this Natton, he told them the Houſe was open to them, and prayed for their good ſucceſs, and ſo on the 21th of <hi>February</hi> they went and took their places in the Houſe; which was managed ſo ſecretly, that the <hi>Junto</hi> knew nothing of their comming, till they appeared; which ſo ſurpriſed them, that they could not tell whether they had beſt ſit ſtill, or leave their places. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate among them ſtayed, but the grand ſticklers for a <hi>Common Wealth,</hi> knowing now they ſhould be out-Voted; and that they ſhould be able to do no good, or rather further miſcheif, quitted the Houſe.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were tranſacting, the <hi>Junto</hi> had endeavoured all ways poſſibly, to have gotten <hi>Monk</hi> out of the City, that they might have had him in their power; inviteing him to fit in the Council of State, and had ſent Colonel <hi>Alured</hi> to perſuade him; but he was too wiſe to truſt them, for he had ſecret intelligence of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſending him to the Tower, or of ſerving him worſe; for they foreſaw their own ruine: he excuſed himſelf by his care of ſecureing the City by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, who were full of diſturbance, and ready to mutinee. But now the ſecluded Members, having gotten in, eleven years after they had been kept out, being double the number of the former ſitters, out-Voted them ſtill, ſo as there was no interruption. They had long been ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by, and had ſeen more than the Gameſters, and now they mean to improve their animadverſions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to the doeing of a great deal in a little time. They fall to work preſently, where they were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:29574:103"/>
forced to break off <hi>December</hi> 1648, confirming their Vote made then by another now. That <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of his Late Maieſty, were a ſufficient Ground to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on, for ſetling the peace of the Kingdom.</hi> Hereby Vacateing all that had been done contrary thereunto, dureing their Receſs. Brave <hi>Monk</hi> is by them conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted <hi>Captain General</hi> of all the forces in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; and He with General <hi>Mountague,</hi> made Admirals at Sea. Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> is made Leiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General of the land forces: Colonel <hi>Edward Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiter</hi> General of the Horſe, and Vice Admiral <hi>Lawſon</hi> Continued in his Command. Severel Gentlemen committed by the <hi>Rumpers</hi> order were then releaſed, and among others Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> who took his place in the Houſe, and the City Gates, Portculliſſes, Poſts, and Chains, were ordered to be repaired at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique charge. Then they provided to ſecure the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by two ſeaſonable Acts, the one for an Aſſeſſment, the other for the Militia, and paſt ſome Acts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Miniſters. Laſtly they conſult about diſſolving themſelves, to which the <hi>Rump</hi> party, were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, and therefore many of them intended to be abſent, when that buſineſs ſhould be debated, becauſe they would not give their conſent: But the others ſmelling their deſign, watched a convenient time, and iſſuing out writs in the name of <hi>the Keepers of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,</hi> &amp;c. for a full and free <hi>Parliament,</hi> to convene on the 25th. of <hi>April</hi> following, ſaveing to the Houſe of Lords their Rights, notwithſtanding the Commons in this Juncture had been neceſſitated to proceed without them: They upon <hi>Friday</hi> the 16th of <hi>March</hi> 1659, when the greateſt number of the <hi>Rumpers</hi> were preſent, diſſolve themſelves by Act.

            <p>But before they diſſolved themſelves, they ſettled a new Council of State, to govern in the intervall of

            <l>Well, God did hear us, and into the heart</l>

            <l>What think you now, was't not a goodly thing?</l>
