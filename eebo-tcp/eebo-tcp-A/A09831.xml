         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

into which hee had (and so farre as I can indge

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no exercise (most deare
and worthie Brethren in the
Lord) more needfull, nor
more conuenient for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
man, then to call vpon
his Creator and Sauiour. For
sith that hee receiueth from
his hand all manner of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
aswell for this present life, as for that which is
to come, he is therefore bound continually to inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and call vpon him for aide,<note place="margin">Iames 1. 17.</note> who is <hi>the Father of
lights, from whom commeth downe euery good giuing,
and euery perfect gift.</hi> Beside, it is also that marke by
which the children of light are discerned from the
children of this world, who, as it is written in the 14
Psalme, haue no care to call vpon the Lord. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
it is one of the parts of that Christian ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement,
whereby wee make profession to
beleeue that <hi>God is, and that he is a rewarder of them
that seeke him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> as the Apostle witnesseth in the 11.
Chapter to the Hebrewes, and sixth verse. It is a
sweete communication and a familiar discourse
with God, whereby wee freely declare to him our
<pb facs="tcp:981:5"/>
necessities, and beseech him to returne an answere
to our petitions in due time. It may also be called
an ambassage, or a trusty Post, which swiftly moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp to heauen, knocketh at the gate of Gods pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
there to present before him all our requests.
Finally, it is the very soule of our soules, and like as
our bodies cannot liue, nor subsist without our
soules; so likewise cannot our soules perseuere in
the faith and hope of the grace of God, which is the
fountaine of life, without the exercise of prayer.
Which point the Fathers of the old Testament
considering, ere they betooke themselues to any of
their affaires, began them euermore by calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the name of God,<note place="margin">Psal. 124. 8.</note> saying, <hi>Our helpe is in the name
of the Lord which hath made heauen and earth.</hi> Which
also the Iewes from the godlinesse of their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hold yet vnto this day, and obserue it so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
that they addresse their prayers to none, but
to that sole Creator of all things. Wherein these ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
people, which neither know the Sonne, nor
the Father, shew themselues farre more wise and
religious, then the Papists, which call themselues
Christians and Catholikes, and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
are so blockish and superstitious, that in stead
of addressing themselues to the only God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
&amp; immortall, they implore the aide of the dead,
and their Idols, not considering what the Lord
speaketh by his Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> in the 42. chap. and 8.
verse,<note place="margin">Esay. 42. 8.</note> 
               <hi>that his glorie he will not giue to another, neither
his praise to grauen Images.</hi> But what? the diuell
(sworne enemie against the honour of God, and
mans saluation) hath with such an efficacy breathed
this impiety into the hearts of those lying Doctors,
<pb facs="tcp:981:5"/>
that albeit they are conuicted by an infinit number
of sentences of holy Scripture, by which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
forbiddeth vs not to worship any but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
yet they obstinately maintaine the contrarie,
and that oft times against the feeling of their owne
consciences, withholding the truth in vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and shutting their eyes and eares against this
admonition of the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13. 8.</note> chap. 13. vers. 8. <hi>That wee
cannot doe any thing against the truth, but for the truth.</hi>
Which (Truth) although that in these latter daies,
it is represented vnto vs more cleerer then euer it
was; yet notwithstanding of many it is vnknowne
and abandoned, which follow on apace the foolish
deuotion of their blind leaders, and who to please
and obey them, rather then our Soueraigne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
and Master Iesus Christ, will not vouchsafe to
take so much paines, as to informe themselues of
this truth, by reading of the holy Scripture, but like
better to depend wholly vpon the Traditions of
their Teachers, despising through their voluntarie
ignorance the exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the Apostle. S <hi>Iohn</hi>
giueth vnto al Christians in his first epistle, 4. vers. 1.
<hi>Dearely beloued,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Epist. chap. 4. vers. 1.</note> 
               <hi>beleeue not euery spirit, but trie the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
whether they are of God: for many false Prophets are
gone out into the world.</hi> Now, the more furiously the
Truth is assaulted by Satan and his slaues, so much
the more couragiously ought it to be maintained
and defended by the zealous louers of pure reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
but especially by the Ministers and Pastors of
the holy Gospel, who according to that rule which
the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> prescribeth them in his Epistle
to <hi>Titus,</hi> 1. 9, ought to employ themselues diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:981:6"/>
to exhort with wholesome doctrine those which
are willing to bee instructed, and to improoue the
gainsaiers. I then being called by God into the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of his holy Ministerie, haue employed my self
amidst you (according to that talent which it hath
pleased him to bestow vpon me) for the space of
sixteene yeeres on these two parts of my vocation;
and hauing respect to the multitude, and sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of my predecessors, who haue taken penne in
hand to instruct the ignorant, and to refute false
Teachers by their writings, I haue contented my
selfe hitherto to follow their traces in my publique
Sermons and priuate Conferences, with such as
were desirous to profit with me in knowledge of
the fundamentall points of our Christian faith, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the occasions which were presented.
But of late hauing seene an Epistle written by a
certaine Doctor of the <hi>Augustins</hi> Order, touching
the inuocation of Saints, sent vnto one of my Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
to seduce thereby the sheepe which our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
Shepheard Iesus Christ hath recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to me; I held it my dutie to returne it backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to <hi>Leige</hi> with my answere, to satisfie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of one of his disciples; by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the said Doctor
hauing receiued my answere, promised him that
shortly after he would write back vnto me againe,
and that effectually. But seeing there are almost two
yeeres past since he held my refutation, and that in
all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> time he could not make some small Treatise to
fulfill and accomplish his promise, his silence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
me to thinke, that he hauing considered well,

with hope that I shall see it bring foorth
some fruite, if not in the abouesaid Doctor, or in
some of his obstinate scholars, yet at least in such as
are teachable, and especially in you my most deare
and worthie brethren, of whom I haue conceiued
this hope, that whereas heretofore ye haue willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heard me to entreat of this subiect aswell in my
Sermons, as in my familiar discourses with you, so
ye will now take no lesse delight in hearing me to
discourse of it in this small booke, which here I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
you as appertaining vnto you by a double
right. For first of all being consecrated to your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
from the beginning of my ministerie, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie
of euery instruction (which through Gods
grace I propound vnto men) is wholly yours. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
seeing that the intention of my dispute is, to
shew the difference between a true, and a false ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and to perswade euery man by all possible
meanes to stand fast in the true, and to reiect the
false; to whom could I better appropriate it then to
you, to whom aboue all things I am bound to teach
the first point and fruit of our faith, which is, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ in
spirit and truth, and to call vpon none but him in
our necessities? Whereunto, as I seeke to giue you
some helpe by this present Treatise, so doe I giue
thankes to the Lord, for that alreadie ye are so well
grounded and instructed in this principle of true
<pb facs="tcp:981:7"/>
religion, assuring my self that he which hath sowne
this good seed in your soules, wil make it abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to grow vp, and to fructifie in such a sort, that
thereby his name shall be glorified, your neighbour
edified, and your hearts fortified against all manner
of tentations. Finally, if I perceiue that this small
Treatise, which I publish vnder your names, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
and pleasing vnto you, your courtesie will
serue as a spurre to pricke me more cheerfully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in my commenced Career, and one day here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to entreat more at large vpon this subiect,
through the grace of our blessed God and heauenly
Father: to whom I recommend you, beseeching
him with all my heart, that it will please him (most
deare and worthy Brethren) to maintaine you euen
to the end in the profession of his truth, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish
you with his temporall and eternall

            <head>AN EPISTLE
WRITTEN BY A CER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINE
DOCTOR OF THE
AVGVSTINS ORDER WITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IN
THE CITIE OF LEIGE, AND
sent to a Leigois Merchant
at DORT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter my most humble salutations: this
present may serue (according to my
small power) for to make cleere vnto
you, some certaine doubt which I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
you haue, to wit,<note place="margin">The summe of the demand.</note> 
               <hi>Whether it is
true, or, how it is possible that the Saints,
which are aboue in heauen, can heare our
Prayers, which we make to them here beneath on earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better cleering then of your demand,<note place="margin">The answere thereof diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two parts.</note> wee will
here handle two points as briefly as wee can, beseeching
you at your leisure you will be pleased to reade them ouer
attentiuely. The first <hi>will shew that it can be no otherwise then
very good to pray and recommend vs to the Saints.</hi> The second
<hi>will declare the maner how they may heare our praiers and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications.</hi>
For the first, you must know, that this hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
been the doctrine of the Catholike Church, to say
and teach, that this was a thing more then reasonable, yea
and most profitable for man to inuocate the Saints, which
the Church hath taught for the space of 1605 yeeres, euen
vnto this day. But you must know this also, that certaine
heretikes which are sprung vp within this fortie or fiftie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:981:9"/>
yeeres, haue meant to teach and preach the cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rir,
to wit, the Lutherans and Caluinists, (who within a
few yeeres, seeking to ouerthrow so ancient a doctrine)
say that we must not pray vnto the Saints, but vnto God
onely. Now let vs see whether these nouell Doctors haue
been cleerer sighted, wiser, or better replenished with the
spirit of God then all the Ancients. The reason and most
ordinary argument which they bring against this doctrine,
is this; It is (<hi>say they</hi>) to doe wrong and iniurie vnto God,
to addresse our selues to any other then to him. Loe this is
that great peece of Canon wherewith they thunder against
the walles of the towne and citie of God, which is his
Church. For proofe whereof, they alleage Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his
first Epistle to <hi>Timotheus,</hi> the second Chapter, and fifth
verse, saying, that he calleth Iesus Christ our one and onely
Mediator, our Intercessor, and our Bishop. Let vs cite the
words of the Apostle: For, <hi>There is</hi> (saith he) <hi>one God, and one
Mediator betweene God and man, which is the man Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
These words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> will say, that there is one so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
Mediator, which is Iesus Christ, in that he is man:
but that hindereth not but there may bee moe which
are subordinate, and not soueraigne, though that Iesus
Christ be truly our onely Mediator, sole Aduocate, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Redeemer. My masters, the Ministers and Preachers will
reply and answer vs; But how can these things agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that Iesus Christ should be the onely Mediator, and
sole Intercessor for vs; and yet neuerthelesse wee should
haue some others, namely the Saints? If he be alone, how
hath he so many companions? To answere this obiection,
we euermore confessse, that Iesus Christ is our true Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and Intercessor vnto God for vs: but we say also on the
other side, that the Saints may be likewise Mediators and
Intercessors for vs.<note place="margin">Although that Christ be our only mediator, yet the Saints are called me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators for three reasons.</note> And if you aske me againe; If the Saints
may also be called Mediators, (and be so indeed) how is it
then, that wee call Iesus Christ the onely Mediator? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
thereunto, that it is for certaine causes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which my masters the Ministers are either ignorant
of, or malitiouslie hide and conceale them from the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:981:9"/>
people. They are three in number.</p>
            <p>The first cause why our Lord Iesus Christ is called the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
onely Mediator, though the Saints be likewise after their
manner, is, because he alone hath trod vpon the grapes in
the wine presse, and with the price of his bloud hath paid
our ransome, and hath reconciled vs vnto God his eternall
father, not only in praying, (as the Saints may doe) but also
in paying that which wee did owe, which the Saints haue
not done, nor cannot doe: for he alone hath redeemed vs.
And for this cause we call him the only Mediator, that is,
of ransome and of redemption. And this is that which the
Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would haue said in the place alleaged.
For after he had said, that we haue one Mediator betweene
God and man, which is the man Christ, he (explaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe)
presently addeth these words, <hi>Qui dedit redemptionem
semetipsum pro omnibus:</hi> that is to say, <hi>Who gaue himselfe a
ransome for all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second cause wherefore our Lord Iesus Christ is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the only Mediator, is, because he is not onely such by
reason of the office whereby he mediats for vs, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileth
vs to God; but also by reason of his nature, for he is
in the midst betweene God and man, being both God and
man together, which the Saints are not. And for this cause
he is called the only Intercessor, like as the good and holy
Fathers haue in times past taught vs, to wit, S. <hi>Austin</hi> in his
9. booke of the Citie of God, and 17. Chapter, S. <hi>Cyril</hi> in
his 12. book, S. <hi>Fulgence</hi> in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 2. booke <hi>ad Petrum,</hi> chap. 2.
and S. <hi>Theodoret</hi> vpon that very place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> with many
others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Iesus Christ is called the only Mediator, because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
that he is Mediator for all men in such a sort, that he hath
no need of any other Mediator either for himselfe, or for
other men. Now the Saints as well in this world, as in the
other, although they be mediators and intercessors for vs,
in reconciling vs vnto God through their praiers, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
haue had need of Iesus Christ to be reconciled
vnto God themselues through his intercession, and in his
name they obtaine all whatsoeuer they doe obtaine for vs.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:981:10"/>
But Iesus Christ, saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> of himselfe without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of any man, approcheth vnto God, to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
for vs.
This reason hath beeen noted by S. <hi>Austin,</hi>
that great Doctor of the Church, when he speaketh thus;
<hi>The Christians</hi> (saith he) <hi>pray for one another, but he for whom
no man maketh intercession, and who maketh intercession for all
men, is the onely and true Mediator,</hi> We then which are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
doe confesse, that according to these abouesaid
significations, Iesus Christ is truly the sole and true Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
onely Aduocate and Intercessor. But wee say also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and that with all truth against these heretikes, that
that hindereth not, but the Saints liuing or departed, may
be so also after their manner. For truth whereof, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
my selfe to the holy scripture. For in the fifth Chapter
of Deuteronomie, <hi>Moses</hi> calleth himselfe a Mediator, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus;<note place="margin">In French Sequestre.</note> 
               <hi>I haue been an vmperer, and a Mediator, betweene
God and you:</hi> that is, speaking of the Hebrewes. Vnto which
words, S. <hi>Paul</hi> making an allusion in the 9. Chapter of the
Hebrewes, calleth Iesus Christ, Mediator of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
to make a difference betweene him and <hi>Moses,</hi> which
had been so of the old. And S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzenus</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the Martyrs, <hi>Mediators betweene God and vs:</hi> and Saint
<hi>Cyril</hi> saith the same of the Apostles and Prophets. For more
ample confirmation thereof, is it not certaine that we haue
but one Sauiour of the world, which is the same Iesus
Christ? Verily, there is nothing more sure. And neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the scripture (which cannot lie) giueth the same title
of honour to others, (though it be not for the same reason)
without doing wrong or dishonour to Iesus Christ; as
namely to <hi>Othoniel</hi> in the third chapter of the booke of
Iudges: and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> also in the 9. Chapter of his booke
confirmeth the same. King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> likewise (as appeareth
in the 41. Chapter of the booke of Genesis) calleth <hi>Ioseph</hi>
in the Egyptian tongue, not onely Sauiour, but Sauiour of
the world. Therefore by these three small reasons, it is easie
to be vnderstood, how the Saints may also be Mediators
and Intercessors vnto God for vs. And if they are so, wee
may and ought to call vpon them in our necessities and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:981:10"/>
miseries. Neither will follow from thence, that we
doe reiect the Sonne of God, seeing we alwaies giue vnto
him the first ranke of being the true and only Mediator, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the fashion aboue said, and the Saints in their
sort and maner. So then it can be no otherwise then excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
good to call vpon them, as euermore they haue done
in our Catholike Church, which we will shew you by the
authoritie of generall Councels, and by the holy Fathers
and Doctors, which haue all approued the inuocation of
Saints. Let vs come to the Councels.</p>
            <p>First in the Epistle sent to all the Bishops of Europe,<note place="margin">Other proofes taken from the authority of Councels.</note>
which is annexed to the Councell of Chalcedonie, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized
vnder the Emperor <hi>Leo;</hi> you snall there finde
these words; <hi>We put the most holy Father Proterius into the
ranke of the Martyrs, crauing the mercy of God.</hi> Secondly, in
the eleuenth Action of that Councell, the holy Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there assembled and treating vpon <hi>Flauian</hi> the Martyr,
say all with one consent as followeth: <hi>Flauian Martyr,
which liuest after thy death, pray for vs.</hi> Thirdly, in that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councell, cap. 7. it is thus said; <hi>The Christian hauing
adored one onely God, let him pray vnto the Saints, that they
might vouchsafe to make intercercession for him to the diuine
Maiestie.</hi> Furthermore, in the seuenth general Councell the
holy Fathers speake in this maner: <hi>Let vs do all things with
a conuenient feare, crauing the intercessions of the most pure
mother of God, of the holy Angels, and of the Saints. Behold,
therefore we say the Letanies, which are certaine praiers, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
our selues to the Saints: first to the most holy Trinitie,
to the glorious Virgin Mary, to the Apostles, to the Martyrs,
to the Confessors, and to the Virgins.</hi> And these aboue said
Letanies, haue been commanded by many generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
as by that of <hi>Gerund,</hi> by the fifth and sixth of <hi>Toledo</hi> in
Spaine, by the eleuenth of <hi>Brachara</hi> in Portugall, by the
first of <hi>Orleans</hi> in France, and finally, by that of <hi>Magence</hi>
in Germany, which was solemnized vnder <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great. All which Councels (being graced with a number
of excellent and learned personages) commanded for the
good and vtilitie of the Christians, to say these aboue said
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:981:11"/>
Letanies three daies before our Lords ascension, and also
at other times appointed. Which commandement and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
is for vs that are Catholikes, a cleere, euident, and a
generall testimonie of the inuocation of Saints, as a thing
which for a long time hath been beleeued, receiued, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued,
and practised in the Church of God. For as much as
these aboue said Councels haue all of them been solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
almost a thousand yeeres agoe.</p>
            <p>Let vs now shew, that the holy Fathers and Doctors of
the Church, haue all of them with one consent taught the
same. Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> the disciple of S. <hi>Paul, cap. 7. Eccle. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarc.</hi>
saith thus; <hi>He which requireth the intercession of Saints,
and will not imitate their holy works, is like vnto the man that
putteth out his eies, and yet would be partaker of the beames of
the Sunne.</hi> The same doctrine S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> teacheth in his 5.
booke against <hi>Haeres.</hi> cap. 19. treating of the virgin <hi>Mary</hi>
and <hi>Eue.</hi> S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> in his most deuote sermon <hi>de a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunt.</hi>
of the most glorious Virgin, praieth thus vnto her;
<hi>Mary incline thine eare to our praiers, and forget not thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
And presently after he saith; <hi>We cry vnto thee: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
vs most holy Virgin.</hi> And a little lower he addeth; <hi>Make
intercession for vs, our Mistris, our Lady, our Queene, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of God.</hi> Saint <hi>Basil</hi> in his sermon of the Martyrs, saith;
<hi>If any man be in tribulation, let him haue his recourse to these
Saints. He which is in ioy, let him call vpon them also; the one
to be deliuered from his euill, the other to bee confirmed in his
good.</hi> And S. <hi>Iohn Chrysostome</hi> in his 66. Hom. <hi>ad Populum;
The Emperor</hi> (saith he) <hi>which is clothed in scarlet, commeth
for to imbrace the sepulchers, and laying aside all pompe, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vp to intreat the Saints to make intercession for him; and
hee which marcheth crowned with a diademe, praieth vnto a
tent-maker, and a fisher-man, as protectors of the diademe,</hi>
Saint <hi>Iohn Damascenus, lib. 4. des fide, cap.</hi> 16. treating of the
profit and benefit that commeth vnto vs through the inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Saints, saith; <hi>By the Saints, the diuels are chased a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
the sicke healed, the blinde see, the leprous cleansed, tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and vexations ouercome; and by them, euery good thing
commeth from the Father of lights, in fauour of those that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:981:11"/>
craue it with a stedfast faith.</hi> Furthermore, S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith
in his booke <hi>Deviduis,</hi> that, <hi>It behoueth vs to inuocate the
Angels, which are giuen vs for our sauegards; and to pray to
the Martyrs also, whose fauour we pretend through the alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the same nature, that they make intercession for our
sinnes, hauing by their owne blood washed off those which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
might haue. These the Martyrs of God are our Prelats,
and beholders of our liues and actions. Let vs not then be afraid
to take as Intercessors, those which in the midst of their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
knew their owne infirmitie.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> in his Epitaph
to <hi>Paula,</hi> inuocating this holy Lady <hi>Paula,</hi> said; <hi>Farewell O
Paula, helpe by thy praiers the later age of thy deuoted seruant:
thy faith and thy works associat thee with Iesus Christ, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there present, thou maiest more easily obtaine thy request.</hi>
And the most learned and most deuout Doctor S. <hi>Austin</hi>
in his Mediations, cap. 40. calling vpon the Virgin, saith;
<hi>Holy and immaculate Virgin, mother of God, Mary the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our Lord Iesus Christ, deigne to make intercession for
mee vnto him, of whom thou hast been made the holy temple
through thy vertues and merits.</hi> And afterward, hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocated
all the Saints in order, he concludeth; <hi>I am become
so bold to beseech thee, that it may please thee to pray for me; to
the end that I may merit to bee plucked out of Satans throte,
and from eternall death.</hi> I let slip many other excellent spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
which this Doctor hath written in his 18. sermon
made of Saints. I will not here recite S. <hi>Leo</hi> and S. <hi>Gregory</hi>
(which were) Popes, neither S. <hi>Gregory</hi> of Tours, S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felmus,</hi>
S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and many moe, which teach the same in
this matter, for the confirmation of our faith; of whom the
halfe were more then too sufficient, to make all Lutherans
and Caluinists to blush, if they had any bloud in their
hearts. I will let passe in silence the many miracles done
through the inuocation of Saints, which the holy Father
S. <hi>Austin</hi> (of whom my masters the Ministers so willingly
doe helpe themselues, but would to God it were to a good
end) setteth downe before vs in his 22. booke of the Citie
of God, <hi>cap.</hi> 8. I cite the booke because they might reade
them, and to the intent they would cease from calling vs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:981:12"/>
Idolaters, seeing we doe it after the example of all these
holy and wise Doctors, with whom these new Doctors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
not to be compared. In the yeare two hundred and
twentie, when Doctor Origen prayed vnto the holy <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Iob,</hi> was he an Idolater? In the yeare three hundred
and sixtie, when <hi>S. Gregory Nazaanze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> prayed vnto <hi>S. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi>
in the Oration which he made for him, was he an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
At that time as S. <hi>Basil</hi> cryed to the 40. <hi>Martyrs,</hi> when
S. <hi>Hierome</hi> recommended himselfe to the prayers of the
holy Lady <hi>Paula,</hi> and likewise S. <hi>Austin</hi> to those of the
<hi>Virgin Maries,</hi> were all these excellent and learned men
Idolaters? I beleeue no. Why then should these new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,
or rather deformers of the Church call vs Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
seeing we do the same after all these holy Doctors?</p>
            <p>But there is one thing (you will tell me) which troubleth
much these <hi>Heretikes,</hi> that is, that they cannot vnderstand,
nor imagine that the Saints can heare vs, affirming it is
impossible, that a man which is praying vpon the earth can
be heard of them into Heauen. Behold this is the second
point which in the beginning of this Epistle we haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded:
let vs now come to examine it. Know then, that
the Ministers and Preachers, among some of their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which in them I haue noted, and in their writings
this, of all other, they esteeme the most strongest, and
that which they most set by. Their Captaine <hi>Caluin</hi> in the
third booke of his <hi>Institutions,</hi> Chap. 20. sect. 24. thinking
to alledge some rare and new-found thing against vs, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
downe one thing which is most ridiculous, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete,
I say not of a Doctour in Diuinitie, but euen for a
simple Scholar, discoursing in this manner: <hi>Who hath reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to vs</hi> (saith he) <hi>that they haue eares so long as to reach
downe vnto our words, and eyes so sharp that they can consider
of our necessities?</hi> By these words he would say, that the
Saints to vnderstand our prayers ought not only to haue
both eyes and eares as they had vpon the earth, but besides
that, they must haue long eares, and great eyes, which
should penetrate downe vnto the earth. Wherin this good
Doctour shewes, that he hath failed as well in Philosophie
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:981:12"/>
as in Diuinitie; and that he himselfe neuer had either eyes
or eares in his soule to know the truth. It was pitie that he
had not spoke this in some of the ancient Philosophers
Schoole; how had he bene mocked! For what a folly, or
what an ignorance is it, to thinke that Soules being separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from their bodies, cannot vnderstand without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of the bodie? Men neuer yet found Philosophie,
which acknowledgeth not euen by naturall light only,
that the soule being freed from the body, knoweth more,
yea better, and much more easily, then when it was within
the bodie. Therefore, to account that one should haue long
eares to heare the better, it is to bring Asses eares into great
request. And if so be that all Asses could speake, as well as
that Asse which was the false Prophet <hi>Balaams,</hi> I beleeue
they would confesse, that the length of their eares makes
them neuer a whit the quicker of hearing; but would say
that such as thinke it so, are greater Asses then themselues.
So then this great Doctor Master Caluin hath abused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in his doctrine. And since his time, his and Luthers
schollers, to shew themselues wiser then their Masters,
haue begun to require of the Catholiques some expresse
texts and examples taken out of the holy Bible, whereby it
might appeare that the Saints which are aboue in Paradise
can vnderstand and heare our prayers. But he that will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
them well, should demaund also of them (because
they referre the deciding of euery question to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
some certaine places and texts, by which the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
might appeare, to wit, that the Saints cannot heare our
prayers: and were not this enough? would they not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
and ouerthrowne? yes vndoubtedly, for they
could neuer be able to produce so much as one onely text
either out of the old or new Testament, let them reade ouer
the Bible as oft as they list; and this were an excellent way
to conuict them, by answering them in this maner. But to
the end they should not thinke that we would vse shifts (as
they do in this point, and in all other occurrences) rather
then by giuing a good answere, we will shew them, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:981:13"/>
the Scripture faileth vs not in this point, and that it maketh
for vs, seeing they will haue it so. Note then how this is
one expresse text of Scripture, that the Angels in heauen
vnderstand our prayers, considering they are the reporters
of them to the Diuine Maiestie. Now this is also another
expresse text of Scripture, that the Saints in heauen shall be
like to the Angels according to the saying of the Sonne of
God in the holy Gospell. We must then conclude, that the
Saints heare our prayers, seeing the Angels (vnto whom
they are likened) heare them.</p>
            <p>Me thinks I heare alreadie my Masters the Ministers
to answere and say, that this similitude of the Angels and
Saints of which our Lord speaketh in the Gospell, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
but only in their felicitie and blessednesse, and not in
their nature or office, that is, our Lord would say that the
Angels and the Saints should be equall, and like to each
other in heauen, because both of them should be blessed,
enioying one selfesame glory and felicitie. But let vs sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that the case were so, let vs grant and admit that the
answere of these my Masters be true; yet notwithstanding
euen by the same we can ensnare and entrap them. For, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the estate, and happines of future life, hindreth not the
Angels from hearing the prayers of mortall men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or how can it be, but the Saints, being in the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
felicitie as the Angels are, may not also heare our
prayers as well as they? this text then of Scripture sheweth,
that the Saints heare our prayers: they heare vs, they see
vs, neither are ignorant of that which is done vpon the
earth, which once more I will shew you out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For, the holy Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> being dead and in
Limbo, knew many things, which were done among the
children of Israel, as you may see in the sixteenth Chapter
of S. Luke. First, he knew that the people had the bookes of
Moses and the Prophets, of whom the auncientest was
Moses, who had written more then foure hundred yeares
after the death of Abraham. Secondly, he knew the life
that the rich Glutton had led vpon the earth, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:981:13"/>
which poore Lazarus had there endured. Thirdly, he
saw and knew the estate and condition of that vnhappie
wretch, and heard his prayer (though he was not heard)
when he cryed, <hi>Father Abraham haue mercy on me, and send
Lazarus &amp;c.</hi> And yet neuerthelesse there was a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
betweene the one and the other, as Abraham plainly
told him. Finally, the rich Glutton, though he was dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
saw he not Abraham? heard he not his answere? gaue
he not his replyes? for all there was the distance of a great
Gulfe betweene them? Now (I hope) there is no man that
dareth deny all this, for it is written in the holy Gospell,
and is a historie pronounced by the mouth of him which
cannot lye, but is the truth himselfe, euen Iesus Christ.
If this thing and story be true (as it is) I then charge all the
Caluinian, and Lutherian Ministers, and say vnto them in
this manner: If Abraham (my masters) shut vp in <hi>Limbo,</hi> not
enioying at that time the sight of God, and being not yet
blessed but through hope, notwithstanding knew the
things of this world,<note place="margin">An Argument from the least to the greatest.</note> knew the state and miserie of that rich
Glutton, and heard him make his prayer and request, will
you thinke then that the Saints in Paradise beholding
God and enioying his most bright sight, are lesse priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
then Abraham? therefore the father S. Austine saith
excellent well, <hi>Quid non vident qui videntem omnia vident?</hi>
that is, <hi>What is it</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the Saints aboue in heauen
see not, seeing they see him that seeth all things, which is God?</hi>
And that which seemeth more, If the damned themselues
heare those speake which are afarre off from them, as the
rich man heard Abraham, and by those words shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
mindfull and carefull of his brethren which were yet
in the world, being afraid lest they should come into the
same place of torment wherein he was, as you may see
what he spake vnto Abraham in the Gospell; shall we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that the Saints and all those which are in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen see and know not that which we do vpon
the earth? And if the Saints, and all the blessed ones that
are departed this life, know the things of this world, what
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:981:14"/>
ought they to heare or know more then the prayers which
are made vnto them? And if they vnderstand and can heare
the voice of the damned, is it possible in your opinion that
they should not vnderstand the prayers and requests of
those which desire to be saued? If the damned themselues
(as appeareth by the story of the rich Glutton) would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
that no harme might happen to their brethren and
friends, will those which are saued be lesse charitable? will
not they aduance, and help forward (as much as in them
lieth) the saluation of their friends and Christian brethren?
and that so much the more, if they see and heare that one
requireth them thereunto.</p>
            <p>Sir, now you may demaund of me and say, If so be I
should conesse that the Saints heare our prayers, yet faine
would I know, how and in what manner they heare vs? To
say the truth, this is a very hard thing to be vnderstood,
and neuerthelesse it is true. The father S. Austine acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the hardnes of this question, and through humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
the small capacitie of his spirit (though it was very
great) in his booke which he hath made and intituled, <hi>De
cura pro mortuis agenda,</hi> c. 16. saith, that <hi>In truth this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
surpasseth the force of my vnderstanding, being not able
to conceaue after what a fashion the Martyrs help those which
we know to be entirely helped by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these words S. <hi>Austin</hi> acknowledgeth well, that it is
hard for him to vnderstand how they know the things of
this world; neuerthelesse, he beleeueth that they know
them, and that indeed and certainely (as he saith) wee are
succoured by them. Wherein it may please you to note
one difference among the rest, that there is betweene our
Catholicall Doctours, and the Hereticall Doctours, that
is, Ours if they cannot attaine to the totall and perfect
knowledge of that matter or question which they handle,
they will not dispute it so farre, as to denie the question
and thing because they find it hard and surpassing their
vnderstandings; but admitting of the thing with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
they acknowledge only the smalnes of their capacitie,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:981:14"/>
as with very great modestie the most learned father S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin
hath done in this point. But these new hereticall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
which are come vp with and after Luther and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,
though the thing or question disputed be true, and
grounded vpon good reason, because they cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
nor compasse it within their vnderstandings, flatly
denie and reiect the thing, as we see them daily doe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other points and articles of religion, seeking alwaies to
reduce them within the capacitie of their spirits (which
very often is but small) and ruinating the nature of faith,
which consisteth in beleeuing things that surpasse the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and vnderstanding of man. And the like they do euen
in this subject whereof we now intreat. And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot conceaue how the blessed ones do heare
vs, they say and preach they cannot heare vs. They must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
then deny, that God of nothing hath created this world;
for it is impossible to comprehend how God was able to
create of nothing so huge a frame as this whole world is;
and yet notwithstanding both they and we stedfastly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that God euen of nothing was able to create it,
though our vnderstandings cannot conceaue a iot of it.
Let them then also denie the generall resurrection of the
dead, if one must denie all things which they cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand;
or let them shew me how God is able to restore
againe vnto man his owne flesh, his owne bones, and the
rest of the parts of his body (and not anothers) after it hath
bene eaten vp of wormes so many thousand yeares before,
and yet neither we nor they make doubt thereof, though
we vnderstand it not. The like could I say vnto them of
the mysterie of the holy Trinitie, and many other things
contained in the holy Scripture, that albeit they are hard
to be beleeued, yet they cease not to be true. Therefore it
were much better for my masters the Ministers to confesse
with humilitie their weaknesse with the good father Saint
Austine, and with him and vs to beleeue that the Saints can
heare and assist vs. But what? Heresie is too proude, and
the Heretikes will neuer be ouercome, they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:981:15"/>
(as Saint Bernard saith) but not ouercome, because
they are too passionate in maintaining their errours. One
may confound them rather then make them confesse their
fault, and as the prouerb saith, <hi>Rather breake then bend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to the end the <hi>Caluinists</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> (because
we say with our father S. <hi>Austine,</hi> that this is a very hard
demaund to be vnderstood) should not thinke that wee
seeke an escape through the boggs, and that the truth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not for vs, we wil let downe before them the doctrine
of that same Doctour S. Austine in his abouesaid booke
<hi>De cura pro mortuis agenda.</hi> For S. Austine minding par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to declare how Abraham knew that the rich glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
had taken his pleasure in his life time, and that Lazarus
had suffred so much, giueth vs three maner of waies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the soules departed may know and vnderstand that
which is done in this world.<note place="margin">Three reasons whereby the dead vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</note> First, by the arriuall of those
which depart out of this life, and goe from hence vnto
them, who (to wit) may aduertise them of the things which
happen vpon the earth, and especially of that which most
of all concernes them. The second, by the report of the
Angels, which on a sudden mount vp into heauen, and on
a sudden againe euen in a trice are about vs. The third, by
the reuelation of Gods spirit, which may beare it selfe
towards the blessed departed into heauen, euen in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as heretofore it bore it selfe towards the Prophets vpon
the earth, reuealing secret things to them, and such as
should be done a long time after them, as the Scripture
witnesseth, so that God who seeth and knoweth all things
whatsoeuer we do, say, and thinke, may reueale vnto them
our prayers. <hi>S. Gregory</hi> (lib. 12. <hi>Mor.</hi> c. 13.) giueth vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
these another sort or manner, saying, that the Saints
beholding the face of God, see all that which in any sort
and manner appertaineth vnto them, and consequently,
that they also heare our prayers. So then by the doctrine
of these holy Fathers we may somewhat gather how the
blessed Saints heare vs when we call vnto them. I wil make
one more small argument against all these Heretikes, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:981:15"/>
therewith I will conclude the whole. All the holy Fathers
and Doctours of the Church haue inuocated and prayed
vnto the Saints; they heare then our prayers. The <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
hath bene alreadie prooued, when we cited a great
number of those which haue called vpon them. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence</hi>
is cleare: for seeing that so godly and learned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages
prayed vnto them, it is a signe and followeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily,
how they beleeued with the Church that the
Saints could well heare our prayers, otherwise they would
not haue bene so simple as to haue prayed vnto them. To
say (as sometimes the Ministers say against vs) that they
were men, and as men might haue erred, that were too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
to answere vs. For could it be possible that among so
great a number of admirable, vertuous, and wise Doctours
all of them should faile, and that not one of them should
haue thought whether the Saints could heare them or no?
Could it be possible that the whole Church should be in
errour for a thousand and so many yeares, and that in so
many ages the Church should haue bene ignorant of that
which the Lutherans and Caluinists pretend to know
since so small a time? Could it be possible that all the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers, and such excellent personages, as <hi>S. Denis,
S. Athanasius, S. Basil, S. Iohn Chrysostome, S. Iohn Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenus,
S. Ambrose, S. Hierome, S. Gregorie, S. Austin,</hi> and
many other lights of the Church, haue presented so many
prayers and petitions to those which neither had eares to
heare them, nor eyes to behold their necessities, and so
consequentlie haue cast their prayers into the wind, into
the aire, and at randome? Shall we beleeue that of them?
Shall we beleeue that all haue erred, and that our Ministers
onely say well? That all haue ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> blinde, and that our
Ministers onely are cleare sighted? That all of them haue
bene simple Schollers and disciples, and our Ministers their
Doctours and Controllers? No, we will neuer beleeue
any such thing. Wee had rather heare the voice of our
auncient, godly, and wise Doctours, then the voice of
new and vnlearned, which for this cause deserue not the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:981:16"/>
name of Pastours and Shephards, but Mercenaires onely,
suffering their sheepe to be deuoured vp, yea themselues
through their pernicious doctrine casting them into the
throat of that infernall wolfe; from whom (Sir) I pray God
through his infinite mercie to preserue you: beseeching
you to take in good part this which in haste I send you,
though vnknowne vnto you: protesting before God, who
knoweth the hearts of all men, that all this which heere
I haue spoken is only for his glory, and your soules health.</p>

whereof the first is, That it can be no otherwise then very

<hi>That this hath alwaies beene the doctrine of the Christian
Church, to say and teach that this was a thing more then reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and most profitable to man, to inuocate the Saints, yea,
that the Church hath taught the same for the space of 1605
year unto this day.</hi> The other, <hi>How certaine Heretikes
which are sprung vp within this fortie or fiftie yeares, haue
meant to preach and teach the cleane contrarie; to wit,</hi> those

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:981:17"/>
to your opinion) <hi>haue said and say still, that we must
not call vpon any of the Saints, but vpon God onely.</hi> I say that
your first foundation is false, because (as <hi>Eckius</hi> one of
your principall Doctours plainely confesseth in his booke
of the worshipping of Saints) that it is impossible for you
to alledge one onely text either out of the old or new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
whereby you can prooue that either Christ, his
<hi>Euangelists</hi> or <hi>Apostles</hi> haue commanded vs to adore the
Saints, or haue recommended this seruice to vs, as very
profitable or reasonable. Also <hi>Petrus à Scoto</hi> confesseth,
that the inuocation of Saints, is not taught in the bookes
of the Prophets and Apostles, but is there insinuated. And
likewise some of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> say, that it is not manifestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in them, but obscurely and mystically, or by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
consequences which are pretended, and not well
grounded. And for this cause the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
it vnto the Christians, makes no mention of the
authority of the holy Scripture, but of the ancient custome
only, of the consent of fathers, and of the decre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of inuocating the Saints, hath not bene giuen to the
Christians (as you write) a thousand sixe hundred and fiue
yeares ago or thereabouts, but hath bene a long time after

who haue made no conscience to teach for doctrine of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
their owne traditions, and humaine inuentions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Which hauing shewed, your second foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil tumble

none for our soueraigne Doctour and Master, but our Lord
Iesus Christ, the only perfect wisedome, and essential word
of his Father; who hath spoken heretofore to our Fathers
by the auncient Prophets, and since being manifested in
our flesh,<note place="margin">We are not of Paul, nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo, but of Christ.</note> hath spoken himselfe by his sacred mouth to his
Disciples, and after his Ascension by his Apostles, who as
faithful Secretaries, and dispensators of the secrets of God,
haue left vs in writing the fundamentall points of pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:981:17"/>
and touching this point haue taught vs, that God
only (and no other) ought to bee called vpon by vs in our
necessities. And although this is as cleere, as the Sun shine
in a bright day at noone, yet because you are blinde, and
leaders of the blinde, as your predecessors the Scribes and
Pharisies were in the time of Iesus Christ, wee will alleage
against you some certaine proofes for that which is aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
to the end they may serue as a cleere light to those
which wink not with their eyes, that they might not see in
seeing, but open them with a holy desire to behold this
light. When God saith in the first Commandement of his
law, giuen by <hi>Moses</hi> to our Fathers,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod</hi> 20. 3. A particular refutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the authoritie of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> 
               <hi>*Thou shalt haue none*
other Gods before me:</hi> what doth hee signifie by this prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
but only that we ought not to acknowledge any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God and Sauiour but him, nor to attribute to any one,
that honour which is proper to him? that is, to call vpon
him only in our anguishes, according to that expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
which he giueth vs in Deuteronom.<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shall

<hi>Asaph</hi> in the 50 Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 14. 15.</note> verses 14. 15. <hi>Offer vnto God praise,
and pay thy vowes vnto the most high, and call vpon me in the

me.</hi> And to stirre vs vp the more thereunto, he denounceth
by the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isaiah 42. 8.</note> chap. 42. and 8 verse, <hi>I am the Lord,
this is my name, and my glorie will I not giue to another, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my praise to grauen Images.</hi> And in the 45 chap. and 21
verse,<note place="margin">Isaiah 45. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Haue not I the Lord? and there is none other God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
me, a iust God and a Sauiour; there is none beside me.</hi> And
in the 22 verse: <hi>Looke vnto me and yee shall be saued: all the
ends of the earth shall be saued: for I am God, and there is none
other.</hi> If hereupon you object against me, that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
not by these places that wee should only worship
him, and none other beside him:<note place="margin">Anticipation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> The answere is cleere, to
wit, that this commandement of God was so interpreted
by the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> and in the fulnesse of time by our
Soueraigne Doctor Iesus Christ himselfe. For therefore
you may see how the Prophet warneth all the house of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
in the 7 chapter of his booke and third verse, where he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:981:18"/>
saith: <hi>If ye be come againe vnto the Lord with all your heart,
put away the strange gods from among you, and Ashtoroth, and
direct your hearts vnto the Lord, and serue him only, and hee
shall deliuer you out of the hand of the Philistims.</hi> By which
you may see, that the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> sheweth vnto the
children of Israel, that the meanes and way to conuert and
direct themselues vnto the Lord with all their hearts, is to
serue him only, and to take away from before his eyes the
Idols of the Heathen, which hee calleth the gods of the
<hi>strangers.</hi> Euen so also our Lord Iesus Christ, being temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the wildernesse by the wicked spirit, which had
transported him vpon a high mountaine, and shewed him
all the kingdomes of the world, and the glorie of them,
with promise, that he would giue them all vnto him if so be
he would fall down and worship him, he alleageth against
Satan that which is written in the sixt chapter of the book
of <hi>Moses</hi> called <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> expounding the intention
of his father, as he which is his Counsellour (witnesse the
Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> in his ninth chapter and fifth verse) he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
thereto this word (<hi>only</hi>) when hee answereth Satan,
that in that place it is written,<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord
thy God, and him only shalt thou serue:</hi> as though he would
haue said, That the seruice which is due vnto God only, is
to worship him, and to prostrate our selues before him.
And to this end and purpose the sonnes of <hi>Korah,</hi> who
composed the 44 Psalme, teach vs, in the 20 and 21 ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that to call vpon any other besides God, is to forget
and denie him.<note place="margin">Psal. 44. 20. 21.</note> 
               <hi>If</hi> (say they) <hi>we haue forgotten the name of
our God, and holden vp our hands to a strange god, shall not
God search this out? for hee knoweth the secrets of the heart.</hi>
And when the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> maketh this demaund in his
Epistle to the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom, 10. 14.</note> 
               <hi>How shall they call on him in whom
they haue not beleeued?</hi> he sheweth thereby, that as man is
forbidden to beleeue in any other but in God only,<note place="margin">Inuocation ought to haue the same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as faith.</note> so is he
not permitted to pray vnto any other then to the Creator
of heauen and earth, seeing that inuocation is the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of faith. And therefore King <hi>Dauid</hi> in his Psalmes
addresseth his prayers to none but onely vnto God, with a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:981:18"/>
full assurance of faith, oftentimes calling him, <hi>his buckler,
his shield, his retreat, his foundation, his deliuerer, his tower, his
fortresse, his defender, and the horne of his saluation.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to which the Prophet <hi>Asaph</hi> (in the 73 Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 25.</note> and
25 verse) signifieth, <hi>That God only is his refuge</hi> in his distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
<hi>For</hi> (saith hee) <hi>whom haue I in heauen but thee? and I
haue desired none in the earth with thee.</hi> Also it is written in
the 2. of the Chron. 20. 9. that King <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of the Moabites and Ammonites which were come
to assaile him, disposed himselfe to pray vnto the Lord, and
in the prayer which he made in the temple in the name of
his people, saith:<note place="margin">2. Chron. 20. 9.</note> 
               <hi>If euill come vpon vs, as the sword of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house and
in thy presence (for thy name is in this house) and will crie vnto

come now vnto your Argument, which scornfully you call
<hi>The great peece of Canon, wherewith wee thunder against the
walles of the towne and city of God which is his Church;</hi> this it
is, That whosoeuer addresseth himself to any other but to
God, doth wrong to God. For proofe whereof you adde
that which wee alleage out of the first Epistle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to
<hi>Timotheus,</hi> the second chapter and fifth verse:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> That as <hi>there
is</hi> (but) <hi>one God,</hi> so <hi>there is</hi> (but) <hi>one Mediatour betweene God
and men, to wit, the man Christ Iesus.</hi> You shuffle together,
either through ignorance,<note place="margin">Transition for the examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of our Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</note> or malice, the Questions that are
distinct, and seuerally handled by our Diuines. The first is,
Who is it that we ought to call vpon? whereunto wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
God only. The second, In whose name? whereunto
we answere, In the name of Iesus Christ, who is our onely
Aduocate and Intercessor. For confirmation not of the
first, (as you presuppose) but of the second answere, wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage
the abouesaid text out of the first Epistle to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi>
in the second chapter and fifth verse: which I pray
you against an other time to note, and to take better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
and consideration vpon our Arguments, that you may
propound them more sincerely. Touching your exception,
though the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs in that very text
which I haue named, that there is but one Mediatour, yet
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:981:19"/>
(you say) that <hi>That hindreth not but there may be some which
are subordinate and not soueraigne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The distinction of Mediatours subordinate and not soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, refuted as vaine,</note> It shewes from what a
spirit it commeth foorth, euen from the spirit of lying and
contradiction. Of lying, because you adde thereto, that
which is not found, nor can bee gathered from that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouesaid
text of the Apostle, to wit, that Iesus Christ is the
soueraigne. Mediatour onely in regard of others which
are inferiour. Of contradiction, because you your selfe say
thus: <hi>Though that Iesus Christ be truly our only Mediatour,
sole Aduocate, and only Redeemer, that that hindreth not but
there may be moe which are subordinate and not soueraigne,</hi>
For, to be only Mediatour, &amp; to haue some others besides,
as subordinate, are things contradictorie. And if you will,
that we should admit of such a glosse, you must then grant
to vs, that out of this very text will follow, that when the
Apostle saith, There is but one God, he meaneth one soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
God; and albeit that verely hee is onely God, yet
notwithstanding there be others subordinate, which one
can neither speake nor thinke without blasphemie. Heereupon
you alleage two replies of our Ministers: The first,
<hi>How can these things agree together,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phists first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> 
               <hi>that Christ is our onely
Mediatour, and sole Intercessor for vs, and neuerthelesse there
are some others besides him, to wit, the Saints?</hi> The second, <hi>If
the Saints may also be called Mediatours (and are so indeede)
how then is it that Iesus Christ is called the only Mediatour?</hi>
To speake properly, these two replies are but one: now let
vs see your answere vpon the latter, and the answere which
you alleage therein with share reproch, that our Ministers
are either ignorant of them, or maliciously hide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
them from the people. Now what are they? The first,
is<note place="margin">Although that Christ onely hath redeemed vs with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, it followeth not from thence, that he is only the Mediatour of redemption,</note> that <hi>Iesus Christ is called the only Mediatour, because that
hee alone hath tro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de vpon the grapes in the wine-presse, and
through the price of his blood hath paid our ransome, and hath
reconciled vs vnto God his eternall father, not only in praying,
but also in paying that which wee did owe: which the Saints
haue not done, nor cannot doe.</hi> All this is true, but that which
you adde is false, that Iesus Christ is the onely Mediatour,
that is to say, only of Ransome and Redemption, and this is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:981:19"/>
that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> meanes in the place alleaged: for after
he saith, We haue one Mediatour betweene God and men,
which is the man Christ Iesus, in explaining himselfe hee
presently addeth these words: <hi>Quit dedit redemptionem se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metips<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m
pro omnibus,</hi> that is, <hi>who gaue himselfe a ransome for
all men.</hi> For although the Apostle maketh no mention in
this place, but of the first effect: of the mediation of our
Lord Iesus Christ; it followeth not from thence, that his
intent was to exclude the second, which he setteth downe
elsewhere expressely, and namely in his Epistle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
and 8. chapter, vers. 34. where hee ioyneth together
those two fruites of the mediation of our Redeemer: for
when he first demaudeth this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Who shall condemne vs?</hi> and
answereth himselfe; It is <hi>Christ which is dead, yea, or rather
which is risen againe,</hi> to wit, for to deliuer vs from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
in those words he setteth downe the first effect and
going forward in answering,<note place="margin">A forcible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to shew that Christ is our only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, aswell of intercession as of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
               <hi>who is also at the right hand of
God, and maketh request also for vs,</hi> hee likewise setteth
downe the second, and giueth vs sufficiently to vnderstand,
that Iesus Christ is our Mediatour and Aduocate towards
God, not only in so much as he hath redeemed vs, but also
in so much that hee maketh intercession vnto God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for vs, and presents to him our supplications. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
that the Apostle in the abouesaid text to Tim. chap. 2.
speaketh nothing of the intercession of Iesus Christ, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
S. <hi>Austin</hi> hauing respect to that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle admonisheth vs of in the verses going before, that
is, to make requests vnto God for all men, and that in the
name of his sonne Iesus Christ, he expounded it, as though
the Apostle had there made an expresse mention of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
intercession, as you may perceiue by those words of
his second booke <hi>contra Parm. cap. 8. The mutuall prayers</hi>
(saith he) <hi>of all the members which yet labour vpon the earth,
ought to ascend vp to the Head, which is gone before into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in whom we haue the remission of our sinnes. For if S. Paul
were a Mediatour, the other Apostles would be so also, and so
there would be many mediatours, which would not agree with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:981:20"/>
that, which elsewhere he saith, That there is one mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second cause,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phist second reason by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</note> 
               <hi>why you confesse that Iesus Christ is
called the only Mediatour,</hi> is because he is not only so, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of that office whereby he mediates for vs and reconceleth vs
vnto God, but by reason also of his nature, for he is in the midst
betweene God and man, being both God and man together,
which the Saints are not. And for this cause he is called the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Intercessour, like as the good and holy Fathers in time past
haue taught vs, to wit, S. Austin in the ninth booke of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of God, and 17. chapter, S. Cyril in his 12. booke, S. Fulgence
in his second booke ad Petrum, chap. 2. and S. Theodoret vpon
that very place of S. Paul, with many others. <hi>We grant you
this second reason, and besides we say that it maketh whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for vs. And</hi> Tertullian, <hi>or as some thinke,</hi> Nouatianus,
<hi>which in those daies was Priest to the Romane Church,
proposeth vs this reason incommunicable to the Saints in
the booke of the</hi> Trinitie, <hi>chap 13. 16. to shew vs that if
Christ were only Man, as the Saints are, he could not be out
Mediatour, not heare and succour vs vnto God his father
through his intercession.</hi> If <hi>(saith he)</hi> Christ were man only,
how is he present every where being called vpon, seeing it is not
the nature of man, but of God, that he can be present in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
And if Christ were man only, why is a man inuocated in
our prayers for a Mediatour, seeing the inuocation of a man is
iudged to be forcelesse to performe saluation! If Christ also be
only man, why is confidence put in him, seeing that the hope
which is placed in man is accursed? Wherefore hee which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be made Medtatour betweene God and men, is found
to haue vnited in himselfe both God and Man.</p>
            <p>The third reason which you alleage that Iesus Christ is
called the only Mediatour is, <hi>because that he is mediatour in
such a sort for all men, that he hath no neede of any mediatour
either for himselfe or for others. Now the Saints aswell in this
world as in the other, though they are Mediatours and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
for vs, in reconciling vs to God through their prayer,
haue neverthelesse needs of Iesus Christ themselues to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:981:20"/>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all that which they doe obtaine for vs.<note place="margin">The examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the third reason.</note> But Iesus Christ
(saith S. Paul) without the interposition of any other goeth
vnto God of himselfe to make intercession for vs.</hi> This reason
hath been noted by Saint <hi>Austin</hi> that great doctour of the
Church,<note place="margin">Partly by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and partly by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note> when he saith thus: <hi>The Christians pray one for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
but be for whom no man maketh intercession, and who
maketh intercession for all, is the true and only Mediatour.</hi> We
also admit of this third reason, that Iesus Christ is the only
Mediatour, because that he hath no need of any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,
either for himselfe or for others. But we denie
that which you affirme without any proofe out of the holie
Scripture, to wit, that the Saints aswell in this world as in
the other,<note place="margin">Anticipation.</note> are our mediators and Intercessors. For albeit,
the Scripture commandeth the Saints liuing in this world
to pray the one for the other; yet you can in no wise from
thence conclude that they are our mediators and interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
but that they are our companions and fellow-helpers,
who to assist vs, ioyne their prayers with ours, to mooue
(as much as in them lieth) our heauenly father to mercie, as
being fellow-brethren, and members with vs of one selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
spirituall bodie, whereof Christ is the head. And this
is that which S. <hi>Austin</hi> vnderstood in saying, <hi>That all the
members pray the one for the other, but the head is Mediatour
for all.</hi> Now touching the Saints departed, I am astonished
that you dare maintaine they are our mediators; seeing
the holy Scripture expresseth nothing thereof; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contrariwise,
<hi>S. Iohn</hi> (including himselfe in the rancke
of all the other faithfull members dispersed in this world,
for whom Iesus Christ was made a Propitiation, and for
whom he maketh intercession to God his father) teacheth
vs in his first epistle, second chapter and first verse: that
<hi>If any man sinne wee haue an Aduocat with the father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Iohn 2. 1.</note> 
               <hi>to wit,
Iesus Christ the iust.</hi> And our Lord Iesus Christ calling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<hi>The way, The truth</hi> and <hi>the life,</hi> saith expresly that <hi>No
man commeth vnto the Father but by him:</hi> in the Gospell
written according to <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> c. 14. and 6. v. Whereunto the

of Intercession, but also of ransome and redemption. Doe
you not teach in your Catechisme made by the authoritie
of the Councell of Trent,</hi> That men ought to inuocat the
Saints, inasmuch as God through their merit and grace doth
vs good? <hi>Approue you not that which</hi> Barnardine de Busto
<hi>writeth in his Marial of the virgin</hi> Mary, That first of all she
is Mediatrix of our saluation: 2. Mediatrix of our coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and vnion: 3. Mediatrix of our iustification: 4. Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix
of our reconciliation: 5. Mediatrix of our intercession: and

for vs, both by their merits, in that they supply the defect

they might make intercession for vs, to wit, that their merits
may be allowed vs, and that they might wish our good, because
that they wishing it, Godwils it also. <hi>See now how your owne
words, and those of your Doctors, conuince you of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
and manifest falsehood. As for the other part of
your Conclusion, it is weakly grounded, and euen by your
owne reasons is easie to bee ouerthrowne; that is, seeing
with vs you confesse, that Iesus Christ only hath redeemed
vs, through the merit of his death and passion, and that hee
is only true God and true man, that he alone hath no neede
of any other Mediatour, either for himselfe or for others:
you cannot maintaine against vs with truth, that the Saints
liuing or dead, are in any fashion our Mediatours and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessors:
yet you seeke neuerthelesse to proue it by some
texts out of the Bible.</hi> For truth whereof <hi>(say you)</hi> I referre
my selfe to the holy Scripture; for in the fifth Chapter of De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terenomie,
Moses calleth himselfe a Mediatour,<note place="margin">Sequestre.</note> saying, I haue
been an Vmperer, and a Mediatour between God and you, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to the Hebrewes. Vnto which words S. Paul making an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion
in the 9. Chapter and 15. verse to the Hebrewes, calleth
Iesus Christ the Mediator of the new Testament, to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between him and Moses which had been of the old. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
this example of</hi> Moses <hi>will not serue your turne as a

               <hi>but to the first part of your Affirmation, to wit, that
the liuing are Mediatours and Aduocates for others. I tell
you moreouer, that in this lense,</hi> Moses <hi>neuer calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a Mediatour betweene God and men: but, as himself
hath well interpreted it, hee bore messages betweene both
the parties, that is, between God and the children of Israel.
For in the Hebrew tongue you shall there finde these very
words of</hi> Moses,<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 5.</note> 
               <hi>saying:</hi> At that time I stood betweene the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:981:22"/>
Lord and you, to declare vnto you the word of the Lord. If you
replie hereupon, that <hi>Moses</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> (that is, a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour)
in the Epistle to the Galathians, the third chapter
and nineteenth verse: I answer, that sometimes this Greek
word signifieth an Interpretour, which goes and comes to
and fro betweene two parties, and that in this signification
it is said by the Apostle to the Galathians, that the Law
was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediatour, to wit,
<hi>Moses</hi> who twice went vp to the mountaine, and came
downe againe with the two Tables of the law of God, to
reade and expound them to the Israelites. In which sense
wee grant you, that hee, the high Priests, and the ancient
Prophets, who haue interpreted the will of God, and haue
offered vp vnto him in the name of our Fathers, may be
called Mediatours, and the Apostles also: but not in that
sense in which heretofore we haue declared, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth Iesus Christ the onely Mediatour, in the
first epistle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> the second chapter and fifth verse,
where the Apostle taketh this word of Mediatour for a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler,</hi>
as himselfe expoundeth it, saying, <hi>That hee gaue
himselfe a ransome for vs:</hi> in which sense this title besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
none properly, but Iesus Christ onely, neither can it
be attributed (without blasphemie) to the members of his
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But let vs examine a little your proofe that followeth:</hi>
Is it not true <hi>(you demand me)</hi> that wee haue but one Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the world, which is Iesus Christ? <hi>Wherunto you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,</hi>
that there is nothing more true. And neuerthelesse the
scripture which cannot lie giueth the same title of honor to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
without doing wrong, or dishonor to Iesus Christ: as to
Othoniel in the third chapter of the booke of Iudges, and ninth
verse. And Nehemiah in the ninth chapter of his booke confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the same, King Pharaoh also, as appeareth in the 41.
chapter of Genesis, calleth Ioseph in the Egyptian tongue,
not onely Sauiour, but Sauiour of the world. <hi>From whence
(with a long circumlocution of words) you conclude, that</hi>
by these three small reasons it is easie to be vnderstood how the
Saints may also be mediators and intercessors vnto God for v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that you should reiect the sonne of God; for as much as you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
giue to him the first rancke of being the true and on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r. So then it will be exceeding well
done to inuocate them, as they alwaies haue done in your catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
church.</p>
            <p>It goes well with you, when you your selfe tearme your
reasons small, and confesse beside, that the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
giueth this title of honor to others then to our Lord
Iesus Christ, though it be neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
for some other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
And indeed those which you haue named in the old
Testament are called sauiours or deliuerors; yet was it in
regard that God had ordained them as instruments of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance
for his people, and for types and figures of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
which was to come. But the holy scripture in no
maner calleth the deceased Saints mediators: neither doth
it teach vs, that they are established by God for instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of mediation betweene God and vs; so that this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of yours drawne from the name of sauiour, makes
nothing for your cause. As touching your Anticipation
and excuse: <hi>that although you pray vnto the Saints yet neuerthelesse
you doe not reiect the sonne of God,</hi>

commandeth <hi>Moses</hi> and his Prophets continually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate

also, making large promises to his Apostles, and in their
names to all Christians, to abide with them, through the
communication of the wholesome gifts of his holy spirit
euen to the end of the world, putteth them oftentimes in
minde of this condition; If yee loue me, if yee keepe my

Doctors of lies, who flattered the said King, and counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him all with with one consent to make warre against
the Syrians, haue not erred? The Historiographer shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vs that all of them were possessed with the spirit of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,<note place="margin">1. King. 22.</note> and that onely <hi>Michaiah</hi> resisted them couragiously:
and although he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, smitten, and cast into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that the King notwithstanding would experiment it,
and that euen with the perill of his life, hee was deceiued
by the lying spirit of his foure hundred Prophets. You
Catholikes will also graunt me, that the Councell of the
chiefe Priests, the Scribes and the Elders of the people, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
in the hall of the high Priest called <hi>Caiphas,</hi> erred
greatly when they held a Councell, and consulted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
how they might take Iesus by subtiltie and kill him,
according as the Euangelist S. <hi>Matthew</hi> teciteth it in the
26. chapter of his Gospell, the third and fourth verses. If
you suppose that the successors of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
of our Lord Iesus Christ haue receiued the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that they could not erre, you abuse your selues. For
the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> aduertiseth all Christians, in his second
Epistle to the Thessalonians, of an Apostasie and generall
reuolt, which should come to passe in the Church of the
New Testament; and declareth to them, that this mysterie
of iniquitie began to worke in his time, and should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
by the comming of the sonne of perdition, which
exalteth himselfe against God, euen to be set as God in the
Temple of God, bearing himselfe as if he were God.<note n="*" place="margin">As humane infirmitie is perpetuall, so men at al times haue been and will be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of error.</note> Now
as this seducement of sinne glided by little and little into
the Primitiue Church, through the craft and malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:
so hath it by many degrees discouered it selfe more
and more, and one day hath added error to another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in the beginning there was no heede taken to the
Councels and assemblies of the ancient Bishops, who haue
not alwaies followed the true paterne of the wholesome
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:981:28"/>
words, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> receiued from the Apostles, and
from their purer predecessors, but giuing eare to the lying
and ambitious spirits of their companions, which pleased
them in their inuentions, are gone astray from the truth.
Euen so the Fathers assembled in the Councels of <hi>Neocesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi>
and <hi>Laodicea</hi> haue there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, that by the doctrine
of the Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> it was permitted to the Christians to
take in mariage a second wife: but according to reason
and the rule of truth, it is a kinde of whoredome: and for
this cause they forbad the Priests not to bee present at the
feast of any second wedlocke, and enioyned those which
were married to their second match, to doe penance for the
same. Whereupon you must needes grant me one of these
two things, either that the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath erred in
that he hath not onely permitted a second marriage in the
first Epistle to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 27. 28.</note> chap. 7. verses 27. 28. where
hee shewes <hi>to him that is loosed from a wife, that he sinneth
not in marrying himselfe againe,</hi> but giueth counsell also to
the widowes in his first Epistle to Timoth.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 14.</note> chap. 5. vers. 19.
saying, <hi>I will therefore that the younger women marrie, and
beare children, and gouerne the house,</hi> &amp;c. Or that the Bishops
of the aforesaid Councels haue erred,<note place="margin">Councels are subiect to the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, and to no doctrine contrary to them.</note> in that they held the
couenant of second wedlocke for an vnlawfull thing and
fornication, forbidden by God in the seuenth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his law. I presuppose that you will grant me rather
that there was no error in the instruction of the Apostle
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which was diuinely inspired into him, but in the
Bishops assembled in the Councels aboue said. In confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
whereof, I will come vnto the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi>
which imposed three yeeres penance vpon the Christians,
who hauing abandoned their Armes, afterward returned
to the warres againe: which rigour is condemned by S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist, who did not commaund souldiers to forsake
their Armes, but exhorteth them to content themselues
with their payes, and to demaund nothing beside that
which was ordained for them. The Fathers assembled in
the <hi>Arelatan</hi> Councell, haue prohibited the admitting of a

similitude of things that are in heauen aboue, neither that

earth: thou shalt not bow downe to them, neither serue them.</hi>
In the Lateran Councell which was held vnder Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius</hi>
the third, it was decreed that men should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that the bread and wine was changed into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the bodie and blood of Iesus Christ, by the vertue
of these fiue words, <hi>Hoc est enim corpus meum.</hi> Which is a
false opinion and easie to be ouerthrowne by many places
of holy scripture,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and especially by the 11. chapter of Saint
<hi>Pauls</hi> first Epistle to the Corinth. where after he had reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the institution of the Lords Supper, and treated of the
consecration of the bread and wine, by these very words
of our Lord Iesus Christ, <hi>This is my body,</hi> &amp;c. he retaineth
those same words of bread and wine. <hi>For</hi> (he saith) <hi>as often
as ye shall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ye shew the Lords
death till he come.</hi> Againe, <hi>Whosoeuer shall eate this bread:</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
<hi>let a man therefore examine himselfe, and so let him eate
of this bread, and drinke of this cup.</hi> By which manner of
speech he teacheth vs, that there is no transubstantiation in
the holy Supper, but that the bread remaineth bread, and
the wine keepeth it owne naturall propertie. They also
which were present in the Councell of <hi>Toledo,</hi> haue they
not iudged that he which in stead of being espoused to any
honest woman, kept a concubine; ought neuerthelesse not
to bee cast out of the communion of the Lords Supper?
Doth not this sentence ouerthrow the institution of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Matrimonie, which by the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> is called an
vndefiled bed, and honourable among all men? Heb. 13. 4.
Doth it not also fauour whoremongers, which possesse the
vessels of their bodie in dishonour, and are condemned by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:981:29"/>
God as well in the seuenth Commandement of his law, as
by many holie remonstrances of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?
Moreouer, the 72 Canon of the 6. generall Councel,
approued by Pope <hi>Adrian;</hi> doth it not say that men ought
to breake the promises of Mariage, which the Catholikes
haue made with heretikes, and to hold them for nought,
as though they neuer had been made? Is not this too too
dangerous a Canon, forged by the spirit of disloyaltie and
dissension? For the spirit of truth, which guided the penne
of the Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> doth it not signifie to vs in the first
Epistle to the Corinthians, the 7. chapter and 15. verse, that
God hath called <hi>the married in peace,</hi> and that to entertaine
and keep it?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 12.</note> 
               <hi>If any brother haue a wife that beleeueth not, if she
be content to dwell with him, he ought not to forsake her: and if
any woman hath an husband that beleeueth not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">verse 13.</note> 
               <hi>if hee be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to dwell with her, she ought not to forsake him neither.</hi>
Whereunto the Apostle addeth this reason as most worthy
of consideration, namely, <hi>the vnbeleeuing husband is sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the wife,</hi>
               <note place="margin">verse 14.</note> 
               <hi>and the vnbeleeuing wife is sanctified by the
husband,</hi> and that through this coniunction their children
are holy, which else would be vncleane. The Councell of
<hi>Wormes</hi> abusing that admonition of the Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> (in
the 1. Epistle to the Cor. chap. 11. 28, where he saith: <hi>Let a
man therefore examine himselfe, and so let him eate of this
bread, and drinke of this cup</hi>) thought it a matter of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to admit theeues and other scandalous persons vnto
the Lords holy table, vpon the trial and testimonie of their
owne consciences. These are the Councels very words:
<hi>It oftentimes happeneth, that the Monkes in their Cloisters doe
commit some crime of theft: behold wee therefore iudge, that
these brethren being accused of such a fact, ought to cleere
themselues thereof, and ordaine to this effect, that the Abbat, or
some one among them of their brethren, celebrate the Masse,
and that all trying and prouing themselues doe participate the
same.</hi> And in another Canon: <hi>If any one hath charged the
Bishop or Priest, with some mischieuous deed, he ought to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the Masse, and to shew thereby, that he knowes himselfe
innocent and guiltlesse of that crime which is laid vnto his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:981:30"/>
charge.</hi>
               <note place="margin">All these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, shew how necessarie it is to trie the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note> This canon hath not only been approued, but also
put in practise by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the seuenth, named before
his popedome <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who being aduertised by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that he was accused of sorcerie and simonicall heresie,
answered, that to satisfie euery man, according to that
good canon of the Councell of <hi>Wormes,</hi> and to take away
that scandalous report of him out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catholike Church,
he would receiue the body of our Lord in token of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie.
True it is that afterward (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> writeth)
the Bishops thought good to abolish that pernicious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
whereby their predecessors had prostituted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the bodie and blood of our Lord Iesus Christ
to all sorts of leaud persons, to be vnworthily trampled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their feete and prophaned. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is driuen to confesse so much, that it was receiued
and allowed for some time in your Church.</p>
            <p>To come now vnto the errors of some other Councels.
The Councels of <hi>Carthage</hi> and of <hi>Florence</hi> haue inrolled
for canonicall bookes,<note place="margin">The Papisticall Doctors agree not among themselues, and neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they hold vnitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent for the marke of their Church.</note> and as diuinely inspired, to serue all

               </note> S. <hi>Ierome. Charles</hi> the Great speaking of
the two Councels of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and of <hi>Nice,</hi> in a book
made at the Councel of <hi>Franckford,</hi> touching the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Images, blameth the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> of impietie
and idolatrie forbidden by God in his holy word; when
he complaineth, <hi>that not only the Kings of the Easterne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces,
but also the Priests and Prelates (reiecting that which
is said by the Apostle, that if any one preach otherwise, then that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:981:30"/>
which hath been preached, though he were an Angel from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
let him be accursed) haue sought to bring into the Church
through Councels, fond and infamous, things one knowes not
what, which neither the Sauiour, nor any of his Apostles haue
euer brought in,</hi> that is, as hee himselfe expoundeth them,
<hi>Nouelties of words, and the foolish inuention of the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of Images;</hi> and afterward hee rebuketh the temeritie
and boldnes of <hi>Irene.</hi> mother vnto <hi>Constantine</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
in that she had borne the chiefe sway in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Nice,</hi> saying, <hi>The Empresse did there all in all; a woman,
vnto whom it was forbidden to teach in the Church, hath
taught and ordained; she there intruded her selfe with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and all Ecclesiasticall Orders, teaching things vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</hi>
Thirdly, he accuseth that Councell in that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
thereunto <hi>Tharasius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
and gaue too much credit vnto him, <hi>who</hi> (as he speaketh)
<hi>was at a iumpe come from the vulgar conuersation, into the
dignitie of Priesthood, from the life of a Souldier, to a religious
life, from the noise of the market, to the preaching and distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of holy mysteries,</hi> and that in summe, <hi>hee was of an ill
iudgement, and spake not well concerning the holie Ghost.</hi>
Whereunto hee addeth beside, that <hi>for the rest of all this
Councell they were ignorant, barbarous, insufficient, fond and
vnapt both in their sense and in their words, and neuerthelesse
proud beyond all pride: which durst command that which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Apostles, nor their successors ordained, and in one part
of the Church, to condemne and accurse all the Churches in the
world;</hi> which he proueth in that they made it to bee called
<hi>a vniuersall Councell held for the worshipping of Images;
without the consent of many other faithfull and Catholike
Churches of God, and were so audacious euen rashly to accurse
so many and so great Churches, which are the body of Iesus
Christ, and to attempt to establish the worship and seruice of
insensible things against the institution of diuine scripture.</hi>
Now like as <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, who was present in the
aforesaid Councell of <hi>Franckford</hi> assaulted the Councel of
<hi>Nice;</hi> so likewise S. <hi>Austin,</hi> with many other of the ancient
Fathers, haue reprooued oftentimes the writings of their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:981:31"/>
companions in the work of the Lord, and the ordinance of
their Councels, in calling them back to be tried by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, and admonishing them, that through many
of their false conclusions they were gone astray from the
same: which S. <hi>Austin</hi> testifieth (in his second booke and
third chapter of Baptisme) against the Donatists. <hi>The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
(saith he) <hi>of the particular Bishops, are corrected by the
Prouinciall Councels, and the Prouinciall Councels by the

                  </gap>r Councels.</note> This is the cause
wherefore one Councell hath oftentimes retracted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed,
that which a former had decreed. As for example,
the generall Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> permitted the Priests to
marrie, which afterward the Councels of <hi>Neccesarea,</hi> of
<hi>Magence,</hi> and the second of <hi>Carthage</hi> forbad them to do.
The Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
decreed that such as were baptized by Heretikes
should be rebaptized; which was shortly after broken and
disanulled by another Councell of <hi>Carthage.</hi> The second
generall Councell of <hi>Ephesus</hi> approoued the error of <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
who acknowledged but one only nature in Christ, to
wit, the diuine; but the general Councel of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
and condemned that heresie. You are not ignorant
also how the Bracharean Councell condemned and accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
those which abstaine themselues from eating of flesh,
and how the third Councell of <hi>Toledo</hi> hauing confirmed
that decree; the cleane contrarie was ordained by the
Councell of <hi>Rome,</hi> forbidding the vse of flesh vpon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
daies i the yeere. The Councell of <hi>Constantinople</hi>
decreed that they should throw and breake downe all the
Images which were put vp in Churches; but this ordinance
and decree was ouer throwne againe by the second Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Nice,</hi> assembled by <hi>Irene</hi> mother vnto <hi>Constantine</hi>
the Emperour; in which was commanded to reestablish
and set vp those Images againe. These examples may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to shew that Councels may erre, and that oftentimes
there hath been great dissension betweene Councels, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:981:31"/>
contrarietie in the articles of the ancient Synods, and that
many things haue been proposed, receiued, and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in them, without and beside the holy scripture: which,
<hi>as</hi> S.<note place="margin">Truth is one, and that which is one cannot be contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith in his Treatise against <hi>Praxeas, is not
in danger of saying things contrarie,</hi> but alwaies is conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and agreeth in it selfe, as appeareth by the mutuall

lying,</hi> as Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> also himselfe teacheth you in
his Annals, tom. 2. This warre, and manifest contradiction
of the ancient Councels, doth it not aduertise vs as it were
of it selfe that we ought not to equall the canons of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
with the rules of holy Scripture? and yet neuerthelesse
your ancestors haue done it, who haue equalled the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretall

S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the decrees of the foure Councels, of <hi>Nice,
Constantinople, Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> with the bookes of
the foure Euangelists. Now in this great diuersitie of
Councels, to which, I pray you, shall we haue our recourse
to assure our consciences, but to the word of God which is
the touchstone and ballance whereby wee must proue and
weigh all the traditions of men? As S. <hi>Austin</hi> did in his

the Pope: <hi>No particular man</hi> (saith he) <hi>not the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
neither the Bishops can make a proposition which is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
to be catholicall, or which is catholicall to be hereticall.</hi>
And againe, in the triall of doctrines, <hi>Consider. 5. Tom.</hi> 1.
<hi>That in case of doctrine more credit is to be giuen to one simple
lay man, excellently skilfull in the Scripture, then to the Popes
declaration; insomuch as it is certaine that one ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
the Gospell rather then the Pope.</hi> Also <hi>that such a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
man ought to oppose himselfe against a whole Councell, if he
be there present, and seeth the greater partie to be inclined ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through malice or ignorance to that which is contrarie to
the Gospell, according to the example of S. Hilary.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
doth agree that which the Abbat <hi>Panorma</hi> wrote in
his chapter, intituled, <hi>Significat extra de Elect.</hi> to wit,
<hi>that in things which concerne faith, the saying of a priuate
person, ought to be preferred before the saying of the Pope, if
so be it is fortified with better reasons out of the old and new
Testament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franciscus Picus de Mirandula</hi> saith, <hi>If in a whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,

                  </gap>ontrarie to the holy Scriptures, and against things that are
not lawfull to bee violated: the other which are of the lesser
number, opposing themselues against the greater, wee must ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cleaue vnto the lesser number, as it happened in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of Rimini, and the second of Ephesus. Yea euen a simple
countriman, a childe, or an old woman, are more worthie to bee
beleeued, then the Pope and a thousand Bishops, if they should
speake against the Gospell.</hi> Now that which wee haue spoken
of the authoritie of Councels, ought to be appropriated to
the censure of our fathers &amp; pastors of the ancient Church,
to wit, that wee ought not to receiue their writings, with
such a reuerence and obedience of faith as wee receiue the
doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, but to iudge and
examine them by the Scriptures, according to that good
counsell and example of some faithfull Doctors of the
Primitiue Church:<note place="margin">Our faith is not of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> 
               <hi>We ought not</hi> (saith S. <hi>Ierome inter. cap.</hi> 9
on the 98. Psalme) <hi>to follow the errors of our Fathers; but the
Scriptures authoritie, and the commandements of God, which

                  </gap>nctruct vs. Euery other thing which shall be spoken after the
Apostles time ought to bee cut off; let it haue no authoritie
then, though the author thereof be holy or eloquent. Reade me
those things</hi> (saith S. <hi>Austin</hi> in his booke of the Church,
chap. 6.) <hi>in the Law, in the Prophets, in the Psalmes, or in the
Epistles reade them there, and we will beleeue them. All others</hi>
(saith he) <hi>how holy, or learned soeuer they be, I may reade them,
not to beleeue what they say is true, because they say it; but in
so much as they proue it by those canonicall authors, or by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
reason.</hi> And in his epistle to <hi>Fortunatus; We ought not</hi>
(saith he) <hi>to esteeme of all disputes, though they proceed from
praise worthie, and catholike men, as the canonicall Scripture;
but that in such a sort, as is lawfull (with the honour due vnto
such men) to gainsay them, or to reiect some things in their
writings; if per aduenture we finde they iudged otherwise then
stands with the truth found out through the helpe of God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by others or by our selues. For I am such a one in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of other men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">We must trie the spirits.</note> 
               <hi>as I would they should be in mine. Doe not
stand</hi> (saith he in his preface of the third booke of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie)
<hi>vpon my words and writings as vpon the canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:981:33"/>
What soeuer in them thou shalt finde, beleeue it without
doubting; but in my writings that which thou holdest not for
very certaine, or if thou vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dest it not; hold it not as firme.</hi>
The like saith he of S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> bookes in his second booke
against <hi>Crescon</hi> chap. 32. <hi>I hold not S. Cyprians bookes for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall:
that which agreeth with the authoritie of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
I receiue it with his praise; but that which agreeth not
with them, I reiect by his good leaue: and we doe him no wrong,
to make a distinction betweene his writings and the canonicall.
For this wholesome canon of the Church was not without cause
established, whereunto were brought certain bookes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apostles, which wee dare not at all iudge, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vnto which we freely iudge of all other bookes either of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers
or Infidels.</hi> The like saith he also of S. <hi>Ieroms</hi> books,
of S. <hi>Ambroses,</hi> and of the rest of the Fathers, which haue
written since the Apostles time, in his epistle 112, and 11,
booke against <hi>Faustus Manichean. cap. 5. I would not bring
in the opinions of those great personages, lest thou shouldest
thinke, that it behoueth me to follow the iudgement of any man,
as the authoritie of the Scripture. In all their bookes, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or hearer hath a free iudgement to approue or reiect them,
without the necessitie of beleeuing them, but with freedome to
iudge thereof.</hi> From thence it commeth that hee exhorteth
<hi>Vincent</hi> his friend in his 48. epistle, that hee should take
heed of gathering against so many holy, cleere and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
testimonies, some cauils out of the writings of
the Bishops, <hi>whether</hi> (saith he) <hi>of our owne, or of Hilaries,
Cyprians or Agrippines: for such writings ought to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from the authoritie of the canon, for men reade them
not so, is it were to draw any testimonie from them, contrary to
which it should not be lawfull to deeme, if peraduenture their
opinion were otherwise then the truth requires.</hi> Wherewith
the sentences of our Fathers agree!<note place="margin">Godly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent texts out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> 
               <hi>We haue no commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<hi>to beleeue in humane doctrines; but in those which his Apostles
haue preached and himselfe hath taught. Therefore euery man
must haue his recourse to the Scriptures, that he may finde as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
in all things. Wee haue</hi> (faith <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his third
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:981:33"/>
booke, chap. 1.) <hi>knowne the disposition of our saluation by no
others, but by those by whom the Gospell is come vnto vs, which
in their time they also preached, and afterward through the will
of God haue giuen it to vs in the Scriptures, to the intent it
might be the pillar and foundation of our faith.</hi> Againe, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
the Martyr saith in his exposition of true faith, <hi>that
among the children of the Church, diuine things ought not to
be comprehended within humane reasons and discourses; but
that diuine words ought to be expounded, according to the will,
instruction, and doctrine of the holy Ghost.</hi> S. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in like
manner in his dispute, touching the flesh of Iesus Christ,
saith, <hi>I receiue not this which thou bringest of thine owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the Scripture; if thou art Apostolicall, then follow the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
doctrine.</hi> Likewise S. <hi>Ierome</hi> in his Annot. vpon the
fifth chapter of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle to the Galathians, saith
plainly: <hi>Nulli kne verbo dei esse credendum,</hi> that is, <hi>We must
not giue beleefe to any one without the word of God.</hi> Also S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,</hi>
which was Bishop of Ierusalem, Cath. 4. saith, <hi>That it is
not necessarie to teach any thing rashly touching the secrets of
faith without the holy Scripture. If then I should teach thee
these things simply, and without any proofe, beleeue me not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
thou receiuest some demonstration thereof by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
for the saluation of our faith proceedeth not from a well
composed discourse, but from the demonstration of diuine
Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these sentences our Fathers reduced themselues to
the holy Scripture,<note place="margin">We ought not to be ashamed to subiect our selues vnto that which the Apostles and the Angels are subiect vnto.</note> commanding vs seriously to examine
their sayings and writings by them, and if wee found them
not agreeable and correspondent to that vniuersall rule of
all sorts of Ecclesiasticall doctrines, to hold them in suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and without any difficultie to reiect them: wherein
wee cannot bee too rigorous, seeing that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> with his
companions and the Angels make themselues subiect to
that ballance, saying in his epistle to the Galathians, the
first chapter and 8. verse,<note place="margin">Galath. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Though that we, or an Angel from
heauen preach vnto you otherwise, then that which we haue
preached vnto you, let him be accursed.</hi> Whereupon the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
<hi>Vincent Lirinensis</hi> made an excellent obseruation in his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:981:34"/>
Treatise of the holy Scriptures Canon, chap. 22. That the
Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> would spare no man, no not himselfe, nor
<hi>Peter,</hi> nor <hi>Andrew,</hi> nor <hi>Iohn</hi> nor all the rest of the Apostles,
but hath denounced, that <hi>all those which would publish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
that which the Apostles haue published,</hi> (these are the
Abbats very words) <hi>should be accursed, thereby to maintaine
the first faith stedfastly and strictly.</hi> Wherein, according
to the very iudgement of your owne Doctor <hi>Canus,</hi> we do
no wrong to our Fathers. For hee confesseth freely in the
Centur. 3. that al the Saints, except those which haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the canonicall bookes, haue spoken by a humane spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and at sometimes haue erred both in word and in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
euen in the points of faith,<note place="margin">The Papists are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by those which they cite against vs as aduersaries.</note> what learning or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
soeuer wee might conceiue in them. Behold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
some of your Doctors make no bones to reproue our
Fathers, whensoeuer they are of an opinion, that they are
gone neuer so little astray from the naturall sense of the
holy Scripture. Without going any further; <hi>Robert Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
reiecteth the opinion of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> expounding that
which S. <hi>Luke</hi> writeth of the fruite of the vine, and saith
therein he hath not well obserued the Euangelist text. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
he accuseth <hi>Durand</hi> and <hi>Rupert</hi> of error, as appeareth
by the 13. and 15. chapters of his third booke <hi>de Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia.</hi>
Whereunto I will adde some of the ancient Fathers
directly contrary to yours, whereby they wholly reiect
the inuocation of Saints as superstitious, and hauing no
ground in the holy Scripture. To begin then with <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
the disciple of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> he giueth this exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
in his sixth epistle to the Philadelphians:<note place="margin">A gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to pray only vnto God.</note> 
               <hi>Virgins set
before your eyes in your prayers one only Iesus Christ, and his
Father, being illuminated through his holy spirit.</hi> And in his
third epistle to the Magnesians: <hi>Assemble together to pray
in one place; let your prayer be common, one spirit, one hope in
charitie and faith without spot in Christ: runne together as it
were one man, to the temple of Christ, the high priest of God.</hi>
Also <hi>Eusebius</hi> reciteth in his historie, <hi>lib. 4. cap.</hi> 14. that the
other disciple of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> named <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> being bound
to a stake there to be burned for the name of Iesus Christ,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:981:34"/>
he calleth not to minde his master in Christ S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>

of the Martyrs or holy men, which had been before him,
to pray them to make intercession for him, but hee prayed
vnto God alone, through Christ the only Mediatour and
high Priest betweene the iustice of God and the sinnes of
his people, saying, <hi>Father of Iesus Christ thy Sonne, by whom
we haue had knowledge of thee, God of Angels and Powers,
God of euery creature and of all the righteous, and of all sorts of
races, which liue before thy face: I giue thankes that thou hast
vouchsafed to grant vnto me this happie day, and this blessed
houre wherein I shall be in the number of the Martyrs, and
made partaker of the cup and passion of thy Christ vnto the
resurrection of eternall life, both in soule and body through the
immortall vertue of thy holy spirit;</hi>
               <note place="margin">An excellent prayer.</note> 
               <hi>among which Martyrs I
pray thee that I may be received before thy face, as a fat and
pleasant offering. And for all these things, I praise thee, I blesse
thee, and I glorifie thee through Iesus Christ thy most deare
Sonne, and high priest, through whom vnto thee, with him, and
with thy holy spirit, be glory now and for euermore.</hi> Also this
same Historian sheweth vs in his 4. booke and 14. chapter,
that the Iewes and Gentiles came to pray the Gouernour
<hi>Nicetes,</hi> not to deliuer the bodie of <hi>Polycarpus</hi> to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
lest in forsaking their Christ crucified, they should
religiously begin to honour him: Whereunto the author
answereth, that these sillie superstitious men had therein
through their ignorance deceiued themselues, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
not that true Christians can neuer forsake Iesus
Christ, who suffered for the saluation of the world, neither
will they honour religiously any other as God; because
they know the true God, and him which alone (as hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth)
ought to bee serued religiously.<note place="margin">The pietie of <hi>Clement.</hi>
               </note> Likewise <hi>Clement</hi>
(according to your opinion) successor vnto the Apostle
S. <hi>Peter,</hi> teacheth vs in his recognitions and Apostolicall
institutions, that it is not lawfull for the Christians to pray
vnto the departed, as the Heathen did, but that all our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
and prayers ought to bee addressed onely vnto
God, and that no man is permitted to come vnto him but
through his Sonne and our Aduocate Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:981:35"/>
Also <hi>Irenaeus</hi> testifieth in his second booke,<note place="margin">A testimonie of <hi>Ireuaeus.</hi>
               </note> and 57. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that in his daies the Church was exercised in workes of
pietie and charitie, and not by the inuocation of Angels
and Saints departed, nor in inchantments, or any other
wicked curiositie, but addressing purely and manifestly
their prayers to the Lord, who made all things, and in the
name of Iesus Christ, according to the necessitie of euery
one. <hi>Clement Alexandrine</hi> treating vpon this subiect, was
sore grieued at the Christians, which worshipped the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the deceased,<note place="margin">A reproch of <hi>Clement Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrine.</hi>
               </note> saying in his 7. booke, <hi>that it is a great
brutishnes to craue any thing of those which were not Gods.</hi>
And hereupon hauing respect vnto the true rule of inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
the which hee followeth with the rest of all the
Christians, after the imitation of the Angels, hee addeth,
<hi>That whereas there is but one only good, that is God, both wee
and the Angels pray vnto him either to giue vs or to let vs
haue such blessings, as he knoweth to be healthfull for vs.</hi> And
in his first booke of Pedagogie, chap. 7. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> (saith
he) <hi>is our schoolemaster, who as children hath led vs vnto
euerlasting life, and hath taken care of vs. And if we suffer our
selues to be instructed, by this schoolemaster and conductor, we
shall obtaine all things of God, which we can iustly demaund of
him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tertullians</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie.</note> The Church also with S. <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath followed
this rule, who speaking of his fashion, and of all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church in his Apologie, chap. 3. <hi>We pray</hi> (saith he) <hi>for
the welfare of Emperours, vnto the eternall God, the true God,
the liuing God, and lift vp our hands to heauen for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching
God that it would please him to giue vnto them a long
life, and empire without feare, a safe Court, a strong armie, a
faithfull Magistrate, a loyall people, and a peaceable world.
These things can I demand of none in my prayers, but of him
from whom I know I can obtaine them, because hee only hath
made them, and I am his seruant which lookes vp to him alone,
and vnto whom he will grant them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Testimonie from <hi>Origen.</hi>
               </note> The like also saith <hi>Origen</hi>
against <hi>Celsus, lib. 8. We present</hi> (saith he) <hi>the first fruits only
vnto him, to, whom wee addresse our prayers, to wit, vnto God,
hauing an high Priest which is entred the heauens euen Iesus
Christ the Sonne of God, and we shall hold constantly the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:981:35"/>
of this faith, so long as through the blessednesse of God,
and of his Sonne who hath manifested himselfe amongst vs, we
doe remaine aliue: And although we know that not the diuels,
but the Angels ouer see the abundance of fruites, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
of cattell, yet neuer thelesse wee must not giue vnto
them that honour which is due only vnto God: for God will not
haue it so, nor they vnto whom such charges are committed;
but they loue vs, because wee offer no sacrifices vnto them, nor
haue they any need of his odours; and we are but to pray vnto
one only God and to appease him, who is the Lord of all things,
and to seeke only his fauour through pietie and other vertues.</hi>
In that prayer which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath composed,<note place="margin">An example of <hi>S. Cyprians.</hi>
               </note> and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so many times in memorie of the benefit of the death
and passion of our Lord Iesus, he betaketh himself to none
but to God the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghost,
without making any mention therein either of Angels or
of Saints. I should be too long and troublesome to recite
it at length, only wee will content our selues to propound
briefly the conclusion thereof to the Reader, to the intent
he may censure thereof: <hi>Through thy name Lord Iesus</hi> (saith
this good Father in the end of his prayer) <hi>deliuer me from
the power of the aduersarie, thou that are a mightie deliuerer,
and the aduocate of our prayers for the requests of our soules,
solicite night and day for my sins, present my prayer to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and thou Lord O holy Father deigne to behold and looke
vpon my prayers, as vpon the offerings of Abel. Vouchsafe to
deliuer me from fire and eternall paine, and from all torments
that thou hast prepared for the wicked, through our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Iesus Christ, through whom be all praise, glorie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to thee for euer and euer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">An example of S. <hi>Hilaries.</hi>
               </note> In that most excellent prayer
which S. <hi>Hilarie</hi> made vnto God, to beseech him to giue
him his grace to expound well the great mysterie of the
holy Trinitie, he addresseth himself to none but vnto God,
building vpon his promise, that to him which asketh hee
shall receiue, to him which seeketh hee shall finde, and to
him which knocketh it shall be opened. Also <hi>Eusebius</hi> in
his bookes of preparation, sheweth that in his daies the
Christians worshipped only God in spirit and truth. For
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:981:36"/>
what writeth hee thereof in his 4. booke of Preparation?
<hi>We are taught</hi> (saith he) <hi>to serue religiously the only God of
all creatures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Forcible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> to proue that wee are to inuocate none but God.</note> 
               <hi>and for this cause wee attribute to him alone, the
worship that appertaines vnto him, seruing him only by way of
religion.</hi> Afterward, treating in another place of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
wherefore the Christians call vpon God, in the name
of his only Sonne, first he rehearseth that it is because hee
being become man, and taken our flesh vpon him, hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for our sakes all manner of wrongs and reproches.
Secondly, because hee prayeth vnto his Father for vs, and
through his request which hee makes vnto his Father for
vs, repulseth behinde vs all our enemies both visible and
inuisible. Thirdly, because neither S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any
of the other Saints haue been crucified for vs, but our only
Redeemer Iesus Christ: from whence he concludeth, that
the intercession which he maketh vnto his Father is proper
to him, and incommunicable to the Saints, seeing he is the
only high Priest, who once hath offered himselfe in a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to God his Father, both for vs, for himselfe, and for
man which he had taken out of the earth, who is ascended
vp into heauen, there to celebrate for vs the spirituall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
to wit, our supplications which hee presenteth vnto
God his Father, praying him with vs, that for his sake hee
will be mercifull and fauourable vnto vs. According to
which he giueth vs this testimonie of S. <hi>Denys</hi> Bishop of
Alexandria in his Ecclesiastical storie, <hi>lib. 7. cap.</hi> 10. who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called before <hi>Aemilian</hi> Gouernour of Egypt to render
an account of his faith, and to answere vnto his demands,
and among the rest vnto this, vnto what God he and the
other Christians addresse their prayers? He answereth him
freely, that himselfe, nor the rest of the Christians did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worship, or serue religiously any other, but that God
which only is hee who hath created of nothing, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
the sea, the earth and all things which are in them.
Moreouer, he repeateth in this very historie, <hi>lib. 10. cap.</hi> 4.
that <hi>Paulin</hi> Bishop of Tyre, taught publikely both by
mouth and writing, that Christ is our only Aduocate, the

only author of life, the alone giuer of light, our great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,
our King, our only Lord, and the Christ or anointed
of God his Father, who alone is capable to make interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in heauen for vs, as hee who hath borne our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and sorrowes vpon him, who only hath established

vs, contrary to our owne hope and expectation. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
that none of those which are in heauen had that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to reestablish mankinde, and to deliuer him from the
perdition whereinto hee was fallen, but this only Sauiour
Iesus Christ. Therefore to this intent it is written of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the Emperour in the fourth booke of his Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
Historie, chap. 21, that he was so zealous at his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and calling vpon the name of God, that euery day for
certaine houres hee locked himselfe into some secret place
of his palace, falling downe vpon his knees and speaking
vnto God, crauing of him that which he had need of. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,<note place="margin">A testimonie giuen by <hi>Constatine,</hi> not to addresse our prayers but to God only.</note>
that hee commanded his officers and souldiers
daily to pray for him and the prosperitie of his kingdome,
and to call only vpon God, according to the rules and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
of holy Scripture, and in praying to say, <hi>Lord we
acknowledge no God but thee, thou art our King, wee call vpon
thee for our succour, through thee wee haue obtained victories,

            <p>Moreouer, because the Christians should not only inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
God the Father, but also his sonne Iesus Christ, S. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi>
disputing against the Arrians, to proue the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
of our Lord Iesus Christ, groundeth principally his
argument vpon this holy and commendable custome of
the ancient Church: <hi>Neuer any</hi> (saith he, ser. 4.) <hi>hath prayed
to receiue any thing of God and of the Angels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A necessarie doctrine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the seruice of Angels.</note> or of some other
creature: and neuer any man hath conceiued such a forme of
words, as, God and the Angels grant it thee, but contrariwise
from the Father and the Sonne, because of the vnion, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
reason of giuing. And as touching that that Iacob,

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:981:37"/>
fod me all my life long vnto this day. The Angel which hath
deliuered me from all ouill, blesse the children, &amp;c. He hath not
ioyned with God the Creatour, andy of the created Angels, and
which of their owne nature were Angels; he hath not for saken
God his nourisher to craue his blessing of an Angel vpon his
little sonnes: but insomuch that he exprosly spake of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
which had deliuered him from all euill, he hath shewne suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently,
that his meaning was not to speake of any one of the
Angels created, but of the Sonne of the Father, whom he ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as a companion with his Father in his prayers, by whom
God deliuereth such, as it pleaseth him; for hee had acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him for the Angel of the great Counsell, and hath not by
his words signified any other then he alone which blesseth and
deliuereth from euill. For he meant not, that the blessing which
be craued of God, should be giuen to him and his little sonnes
by an Angel, but by him only which elsewhere he prayeth vnto,
saying,<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 26.</note> I will neuer forsake thee except thou blesse me. And he
was God, as Iacobs words make mention when he saith, I haue
seen God face to face: and vnto him (say I) Iacob prayed for to
blesse his children. For Iacob called vpon no other then God,
saying, Lord deliuer me from the hands of my brother Esau,
&amp;c. Nor Dauid also called on no other for his deliuerance,
saying, Lord I haue cried vnto thee in my tribulation, and thou
hast heard me; Lord deliuer my soule from lying lips, &amp;c. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Apostle S. Paul: God in whom we haue hoped, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
me from euill, and will deliuer me, &amp;c. And thereby
thou maist perceive that it appertaineth to none but vnto God,
to blesse and deliuer: for no other could deliuer Iacob but God,
and Iacob called only vpon him as his deliuerer. It appeareth
then that this Patriarch did not couple with God any one is
his prayers, but the Word of God, (of whom S. Iohn writeth, to
wit, that in the beginning it was God &amp; with God.) which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
he calleth an Angel, because it is he alone which reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
and sheweth God vnto vs: and which thing the Apoctl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
S. Paul doth also oftentimes, when he saith, Grace be with you,
and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus
Christ. And in his second sermon it is written: Be my prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
O God, and a fortresse for my refuge, to the end thou maist

defend me. Item, The Lord is made the refuge of the poore, and
all the rest which is found semblable in the holy Scripture. But
if our aduersaries maintaine, that these words haue been spoken
of the Sonne, as it is most likelie, let them then know, that the
Saints doe not intreat of a creature, that he should be their aid,
and hereafter let them referre these words (he hath been made,
he hath made, he hath created) to Christs comming in the flesh,
when he hath taken vp to the crosse our sins vpon him and said,
Come vnto me all ye which are laden, and I will ease you.</p>
            <p>In like manner <hi>Arnobius</hi> in his dispute against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,<note place="margin">A graue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of <hi>Arnobius.</hi>
               </note>

the Godhead it sufficeth vs to worship the chiefest God,
who is the soueraigne Father, the supreme Lord, Creator
and conductor of all things, and that in him only we serue
whatsoeuer is to be serued religiously, and worship what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
is to be worshipped. And in the end hee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
speaking to the Gentiles of the intercession of our

<hi>that soules cannot receiue the force of life and saluation from
any, but from him, which this great king hath established in this
charge; because the almightie Emperour was willing that hee
should be the way vnto saluation, and, as I may say, the gate of
life; through him there is an entrance into light, for by no other
way can we attaine, or enter in by force, all other be shut vp, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible,
and fortified with an inumcible fortresse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these prayers and exhortations of the first successors
of the Apostles are as so many faithful witnesse,<note place="margin">The inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God hath remained en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, after the natiuitie of Christ, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the assaults of Satan.</note> which all
with one consent doe testifie, that these ancient Fathers
haue maintained carefully the adoration of one only God,
to wit, of the Father, the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost,
more then for three hundred yeeres after the natiuitie of
our Lord Iesus Christ. And although that shortly after
some Monkes and disciples of the Gentiles, newly come
foorth of Egypt and Syria, with the old leauen of their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries,
sought to bring vp the inuocation of Angels and
Saints departed, into the Christian Church; yet was it not

               <hi>&amp;c. Those</hi> (saith <hi>Theodoret) which

long time in Phrygia and Pisilia, till that the Councell assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in Laodicea, the capitall citie o' Phrygia, forbad them by
an expresse law not to pray vnto the Angels: so that yet vnto
this day is to be seene among their neighbours the Oratories of
S. Michael. Now because they counselled the Christians vnder
the cloake of humilitie to worship the Angels, S. Paul comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them the contrarie, that they should beautifie all their say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and deeds with the remembrance of our Lord Iesus Christ.

            </p>
            <p>Now it resteth in vs to see whether our Fathers haue not
taken great paines to haue plucked vp the rootes of this
darnell and dangerous weede,<note place="margin">Not to erre in points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we must not giue eare but to the pure word of God.</note> which the diuell (sworne

among the good graine of the pure inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lords
name. True it is that in the beginning some haue sowne
this wicked seede vnder the shadow of deuotion: others
haue receiued it to a good end and intention; and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
not seeing to it before hand, giuing it too long a time
of growth, it sprouted vp higher and higher, and finally
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:981:38"/>
would haue ouertopt the truth and haue stifled it; they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it to grow for a time with the good graine: but when
they perceiued that this banefull weed began to ouer grow
and choake that which by the Apostles had been planted
in the Church, and watered by their successors, they then
were constrained wholly to roote it out,<note place="margin">The doctrine of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> an ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor for the true inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> beginning this
holy labour first in the East, and went forward with it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the West. For <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> and diuers others of the
seruants of God in the Easterne Churches, hauing vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that some superstitious women presented certaine
cakes to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> tooke occasion from thence to
reproue this abuse, and to admonish them thereof in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
that they should not honour the Saints beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but to honor their Lord, and so consequently such as
had been seduced ought to renounce their errors, and to
consider that <hi>Mary</hi> is not God, nor hath any celestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
but that she is of the conception of man and woman,
who (as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> saith in his Treatise of Heresit) <hi>steepeth
in honor, is dead in charitie, and hath receiued her crowne in
virginitie: let none then</hi> (concludeth he) <hi>offer vp in her name,
for if he doe, he loseth his soule.</hi> Moreouer, he condemneth
these women of heresie by these words: <hi>In them is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
that which was foretold, some shall reuolt from the
wholesome doctrine, betaking themselues to fables and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of diuels: for there shall be some</hi> (saith he) <hi>which shall
giue diuine honors to the dead, as heretofore they honored them
in Israel. And the glorie of the Saints in their time in opposition
to God, was an error for others which saw not the truth. And
this little haue we considered and written to such as will learne
the truth in the Scripture, and not to braue it out through vain
discourses, neither to arme themselues with a blasphematorie
tongue; so that if some will not suffer them, nor receiue these
profitable things, but rather the contrarie, we must say to him,
how little soeuer we are, that hee which heareth, let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
and hee which is disobedient, let him disobey, and let him
trouble vs nor the Apostles no more. For we haue spoken of the

himselfe to these women,<note place="margin">A graue cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</note> and rebuketh them, in that they
had decked a chariot or a foure squared chaire, spreading a
linnen vaile ouer it, and set it once a yeere before the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary,</hi> and presented thereon to her certaine loaues of
bread for the space of some daies. He calleth this supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a heresie, and the roote of all idolatrie, womens rage,
a false opinion, <hi>Eues</hi> maladie, who by the serpent was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
the promise of error proceeding from that wicked
beast, which bringeth forth no goodnesse, neither accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisheth
the things promised, but calleth those which are
not as though they were, the cause of death, the mistris
and guide vnto disobedience, and reuolt from the truth it
selfe: Item, a diabolical enterprise, a cursed affection to the
forging of Idols inspired of the diuell, which vnder the
cloake of righteousnesse ordinarily creepeth into the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of men, and through diuers cunning sleights deifieth a
mortall nature. Also hee compareth the idolatrie of these
women vnto the adulterie and whoredome of common
strumpets, which heate themselues in the superfluitie of
many beds; and trample vnder their feete the chast compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of one legitimate husband.<note place="margin">The virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but not de fied, and ought to be honoured, but not worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</note> Hereupon hee confesseth
that which these superstitious women were able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
vnto him, namely, that the bodie of the Virgin was
holy: whereunto he answereth, that she was not therefore
God; that she was a virgin worthie of all honour, but not
giuen vs from God to be adored, but that euen she herself
hath worshipped him, who of her was borne according to
the flesh, and who is descended from heauen out of the
bosome of his Father. <hi>Therefore ye may see</hi> (saith he) <hi>why the

               <note place="margin">None was able to know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Iesus Christ how much the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ought to be glorified.</note>

not yet come. To the intent that none should presume of more
then appertaineth vnto this holy virgin, neither should attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
too much excellencie vnto her, he calleth her woman, as
prophecying of the things which should come to passe in the
world, by reason of partialities and heresies, lest that some in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
her too much, should fall into the romings of this he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie:
for the whole discourse of this storie is but trash, and, as I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:981:39"/>
may tearme it an old womans tale.</hi> Moreouer, to take away
the occasion of all excuses and replies, he cleanly cutteth it
off, and saith, that neuer any Scripture hath taught vs this
kinde of adoration, nor that any of the Prophets haue euer
commanded vs to worship a man, much lesse a woman. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
she is</hi> (saith <hi>Epiphanius) an excellent chosen vessell,</hi>

               <hi>yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
she is a woman, whose nature hath not in any

vp, as the body of the Saints; and if more may be said in her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
like as Elias a virgin from the belly of his mother, which
alwaies kept his virginitie, was taken vp into heauen, and saw
no death: or as Iohn whom the Lord loued, and who leaned
vpon his bosome, or as holy Thecla; but Mary is to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
much more then these, because of the dispensation of that
secret whereof as worthie she was reputed. But Elias, though he
yet be liuing, ought not to be worshipped, nor Iohn; albeit that
by his owne prayer he made his death to be admired, or receiued

not suffer vs to adore the Angels, much lesse her that is borne of
Anna, who to Anna was giuen by Ioaechim, she that through
prayers and all deuotion was giuen according to the promise
made to her father and mother: and who in that respect is
borne no otherwise, then according to the nature of others,</hi>

               <hi>but
as all of the seed of man, and out of the wombe of a woman. For
although the storie of Mary and the traditions doe report, that
it was said to her father Ioachim in the wildernesse, Thywife
hath conceiued, yet was it not said, that it should be without
copulation, or without the seed of man. But the Angell which

not enter into doubt, because of that which in truth hath been
done, as alreadie it had been ordained and promised to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous:

it to be so God then being descended out of heauen hath formed

himselfe of the Virgin, as of earth, the Word hauing taken his
flesh of the Virgin Mary: neuerthelesse, not to that end that
the Virgin should be worshipped, neither to the intent that hee
would deifie her, nor with meaning that wee should offer vp in
her name.</hi> Hereupon returning to the first originall of the
error of these women, hee crieth out, saying, <hi>From whence

Counsels renewed? let Mary be in honour, but let the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Sonne, and the holy Ghost be worshipped; let none wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
Mary, nor any other woman, no nor a man likewise, for this
mysterie is due only but to God. The Angels themselues are
not capable of such an honour, therefore let the couetousnesse of
the tree be taken away from before your eyes: let the creature
returne vnto his Creator,</hi>
               <note place="margin">She which is bound to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being worshipped.</note> 
               <hi>let Adam with Eue come againe to

Serpents voice; but let her abide in the commandement of
God, Thou shalt not eate of the tree. This tree was not the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
but by the tree came the disobedience of error: let none
then eate of the error, which is for the Virgin Maries sake; for
although the tree be faire, it is not therefore good to be eaten.
And though that Mary be exceeding faire, holy, and to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
yet is she not to be worshipped. But these women renew
a mixtion at hab nab, and prepare a table not for God, but for
the diuell; let Ieremy stay and withhold these peeuish women,

vs in his sermons, and vpon the exposition of the formular
of the prayer which Iesus Christ gaue vnto his Disciples,
that God requireth not of vs, that wee should addresse our
prayers to any other, but only vnto him, and to his Sonne
Iesus Christ our sole Mediatour, to induce him to receiue

hee sheweth vs, that to purchase the fauour of God,
wee haue no neede of any other helpe, then by addressing
our selues to our only Sauiour Iesus Christ, we haue free

he in his fifth sermon vpon the 8. chapter of S. <hi>Matthew</hi>)
<hi>will not grant vs so much of his grace, at the request of them
which pray for vs, as when wee our selues pray, to the end wee

when she her selfe prayed.</hi> In like manner, in his 16. sermon
vpon certain texts of the Gospel, according to S. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
he saith, <hi>Is God farre from thee, that thou goest to seeke him
in some place? He is not shut vp in any place, but alwaies he is

<hi>God only</hi> (saith he) <hi>can cure the heart, who hath made

He then can enter into our consciences</hi> (which is not
possible for the Angels and Saints departed) <hi>to touch our
spirits, and bow our soules. Knowing then these things, let vs
haue our recourse vnto God, who will and can separate our
vexations. For when wee haue to doe with men, to obtaine any
thing at their hands, we must first meete with porters, then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
flatterers, and oftentimes take a great iourney. With God
there is no such thing, without either mediatour or spokesman
he is inclined to heare thee, without either money or charge he

               <hi>It is sufficient if thou criest only to him

then is the principall time in which he will heare thee, for euen
so did he with the Canaanitish woman: when Peter and Iames
came vnto him, he did not grant her request, but when she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, then he gaue her that which she craued.</hi> From whence
he draweth this conclusion, in his sermon of the profit and
aduancement of the Gospell: <hi>Thou hast no need of any aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates

               </gap>, that we ought not
to worship, neither Reliques, Angels, nor any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
whatsoeuer. And so oft as he treateth of prayer, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
vs not to haue our recourse to any creature, but
vnto God only: and to follow in our prayers that forme of
prayer and instruction of our Lord Iesus Christ, which hee
recommendeth vnto vs in his 14 Sermon vpon S. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
where hee saith, that hee which prayeth not as Christ hath
taught,<note place="margin">None can doe more with the Father then the Sonne.</note> is none of Christs disciples, and that the Father wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
heareth the prayer, which his Sonne hath indited,
because the Father knoweth the intention and words of
his Sonne; neither receiueth any thing but what his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
hath expounded, reiecting all that men haue inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and followed through custome and vsurpation. So is it
then, that Iesus Christ the only Sonne of God hath taught
vs to call vpon our heauenly Father, but in his name. And
S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> expounding the fifth verse of the first Epistle
to <hi>Timothy,</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and man, which is the man Christ Iesus,</hi> noteth
vpon this place that Christ to be our Mediatour, ought to
be ioyned with God and Man, and that if hee were separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the substance of the Father, and had no naturall
communion therewith, he could in no wise be our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.
And to the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee should not thinke that God is
pleased with doing vs good, and giuing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the sake and merit of any other Saint, he signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
to vs, that all men (except our Redeemer Iesus Christ)
haue been defiled here with some sinne. <hi>God</hi> (saith he, in his
40. Sermon on Genesis) <hi>permitted that sometimes the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
through their owne will should fall into sinne, to the intent
that he alone should be without sinne. From hence it chanced
that Abraham hath sinned through infidelitie, and Moses
through ingratitude, not glorifying God, who gaue him water

out of the rock.</hi> And in his 45. Sermon vpon S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> he
maketh mention of the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> ambition, which

And vpon this sentence of the 14. Psalme and third

for confirmation hereof, the vices and imperfections of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and of all the Disciples of our Lord Iesus

            </p>
            <p>Among other arguments, which your Doctors vse to
verifie that which you haue proposed in the beginning of
your Epistle, to wit, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Church hath taught &amp; approued
the inuocation of Saints for the space of 1605. yeeres: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
one of the principall saith, namely, that the Gentiles
(into which number <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate ranked himselfe)
called the Christians Idolaters, aswell for the veneration
of Saints, as for that of Angels. But to refute your proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to discouer the falsehood thereof, I will here cite
that answere which S <hi>Cyril</hi> Patriarch of Alexandria gaue
expressely to <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate,<note place="margin">A lie giuen to <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</note> vpon that false accusation
and reproch: <hi>It is not so as thou thinkest</hi> (replied S. <hi>Cyril</hi> to
<hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour) <hi>that we deifie a man, and that we should
not giue the honor of adoration to him which by nature is God;
but we say rather, that the Word proceeded from the Father, by
whom all things haue bin created, and who ordained to saue
mankinde hath taken flesh, and hath bin made man. He is not
worshipped (as thou saist, and wouldest beleeue) in that he is
man; for why should we say so, but acknowledging that this man
which appeared to vs is the Word of God? we goe vnto him in
as much as he is also God, and who came from God the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Father. As for the Martyrs, we reckon them not as Gods,
neither haue we accustomed</hi> (note this word) <hi>to worship them:
we only praise them and honour them with great honours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
valiantly they haue fought for the truth, and in that they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eld the puritie of their faith, euen to despise their owne liues.</hi>
Besides, <hi>thy Plato saith of such as haue liued well and died ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:981:43"/>
that they are made Demons,<note place="margin">To depriue the Saints of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not to frustrate them from their due reuerence.</note> that is to say,</hi> Gods, <hi>and
that after their death they ought to be serued, and their sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres
worshipped. But as for vs, we say not that the holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
are made Gods, but haue accustomed to honour them as
much as may be, yeelding them euery where in recompence of
their noble vertues, a memorie that neuer perisheth, Neither
shall you euer proue, that we worship men, or should attribute to
them the glory of God.</hi> He sheweth the like in his bookes of
the Trinitie, and in his Commentaries vpon the Gospell of
S. <hi>Iohn: We come not vnto God</hi> (saith he in his first booke of
the holy Trinitie) <hi>otherwise then by Christ.</hi> And in his third
booke: <hi>Our faith iustifieth, and maketh vs familiar with God,
and aduanceth vs neere vnto him. This faith is not simply in
the man, but in the nature of God; and in as much as the Word
was in the flesh.</hi> And in his Treatise of true faith: <hi>Our faith,
and hope is in God, when Christ then said, beleeue in me, doth he
not manifestly shew that he is God? And if in the Spirit of the
Sonne, we haue confidence in calling vpon the Father; how is
not Christ then god also, after that the Word was made flesh?</hi>
Which he more amplie and cleerely expoundeth in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
vpon the exhortation, which Christ made to his
Disciples before his departure out of this world, to pray
vnto the Father in his name, oftentimes promising to them,
that they should obtaine whatsoeuer they demanded of
his Father in his name.<note place="margin">Seeing Christ commandeth vs to pray vnto the Father in his name, he excludeth all other names.</note> 
               <hi>He addeth, In my name,</hi> (saith S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi>)
<hi>to shew that he is the Mediatour, and that the Father
communicateth his blessings to vs, through the Son, by whom
wee haue accesse to the Father in the Spirit, as it is written.
Therefore hee calleth himselfe the gate, and the way; because</hi>
(saith he) <hi>no man commeth vnto the Father but by me. For in
as much as he is the Son &amp; God, he giueth vs his blessings with
the Father.</hi> Which S. <hi>Paul</hi> minding to shew vs, said, <hi>Grace
be with you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord
Iesus Christ, But in so much that he is Mediatour, High-priest
and Aduocate, he presenteth our prayers to God, for he alone gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs libertie and boldnesse vnto the Father. We must then
pray in the Sauiours name, if wee will be heard of the Father.
None can be made holy or sanctified by the rule of liuing well,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:981:43"/>
but through the helpe and intercession of Christ,<note place="margin">The Father wil neuer yeeld vnto any, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and promiseth that his Father will readily grant it vs.</hi> And
in his fourth booke vpon the Prophet <hi>Esay: All prayers are
directed by Christ, for by him we make our demaunds to God
his Father, and by him we make our prayers, confessing also that
God is in him.</hi> And in another place: <hi>To whom behoueth it
better, to grant vnto the Saints their desires, and to giue them
that which they require, then to him which only is naturally
and verely God?</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Saints haue receiued the crownes of righteousness, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not giue them.</note> 
               <hi>The Saints who haue bin sanctified through
the communication of God, which sanctifieth them, may well
preserue this gift, if so be they keepe his commandements: but
they cannot sanctifie others. For no man sanctified through the
communication of the holy Ghost, hath the power to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
this grace to others. There is none but the only fountaine
of holinesse, which of it selfe can giue this holinesse to all. The
Saints then who haue receiued this gift through grace and
through communication, cannot distribute it to others at their
pleasure: but the Sonne, who is the fountaine of holinesse, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth
his Disciples, saying, Receiue yee the holy Ghost.</hi> All
which are arguments worthie to be noted, whereby Saint
<hi>Cyril</hi> rebuketh the folly of such as forsake the well-spring
of liuing waters, to search broken cesternes which will
containe no water. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth no lesse vpon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
in his sermons and discourses. For in his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
vpon the Epistle to the Romanes, hee mocketh those
greatly, who in stead of praying personally to God, and
should not speake to him but in the name of his wel belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
Sonne, doe betake themselues to the Saints deported,
as to his faithfull vassals and familiar friends to approch
vnto his diuine Maiestie, and to obtaine his grace through
their intreatie and intercession. He compareth them to the
Heathen and Idolaters of whom the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in his first chapter of that said Epistle, <hi>counting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
wise</hi> (saith he) <hi>they became fooles; and when they were
ashamed that they had forsaken God, they accustomed to vse a
miserable excuse for themselues, saying they had accesse vnto
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:981:44"/>
God through them, as in a Court by the Earles and Lords one
hath accesse vnto the King. But I pray you is there any man so
foolish,<note place="margin">Whosoeuer is called ought to come vnto God without waiting for any other name.</note> and so carelesse of his preseruation, as to attribute to an
Earle, the honour of his King, sith that in vsing him so, it is by
right high treason? and will not those men think themselues to
be guiltie, which attribute to the creature, the honour due vnto
his Creator, and abandon their Lord, to adore their fellow ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants?
For surely the reason why men come vnto the King, by
officers or Earles, is, because the King is a man, and knoweth
not whom to trust vnto in his Common-weale. But to procure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
God to be fauourable vnto vs, from whom nothing is hid, and
who knoweth what is in euery one of vs, there is no need of any
intercessor or spokesman, but of a deuout spirit: for in what
place soeuer such a man will speake vnto him he answereth him.</hi>
And in his third booke of the Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">The sighes of the heart pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.</note> and 12. chapter,
<hi>We must not adore any thing beside God; for it is written, Thou
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serue.
If then the mysterie of the incarnation is to be adored, as a
worke of the holy Ghost, according as it is written, The holy
Ghost shall come vpon thee, and the power of the most high shall
ouershadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be
borne of thee shall be called the Sonne of God; without all doubt
the holy Ghost also ought to be worshipped, seeing wee worship
him, who according to the flesh was conceiued by the holy Ghost.

spoile you through Philosophie, and vaine deceit, through the
traditions of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and
not after Christ.</hi> Hee declareth that through vaine deceit
and traditions of men, we must vnderstand the superstition
which serueth the world for a Religion, and not God,
which is one, and which leadeth vs not to Iesus Christ, in
whom is the perfection of the Godhead. Moreouer, Saint
<hi>Ierome</hi> in his disputes against <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> speaking gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

neither in this present world, nor in the world to come, lest wee
should rather serue the creature, then the Creator, which is

his fifth Sermon of such as are falne: <hi>Cursed is the man which
putteth his hope in man. We must pray vnto the Lord, and call
vpon God the Father in the name of his Sonne Iesus Christ:</hi> as
he himselfe expoundeth it, in his excellent discourse vpon
the Lords Prayer: where he admonisheth vs, that there is
no prayer more certaine, or more pleasing to the Father,
then that which by the mouth of his Sonne hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
who is the Truth, and that to pray otherwise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hee hath taught vs, is not only ignorance,<note place="margin">The sinne of those which pray in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name then Iesus, partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates not so much of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as of scorne.</note> but an absurd

that they did reiect the commandement of God, to
establish their owne traditions. <hi>Let vs pray then</hi> (saith hee)
<hi>euen as our Lord hath taught vs. Prayer is acceptable to God,
when as we pray with a prayer which is his owne, and that wee
send vp into his eares the words of his Son. The Father knowes
the language of his Sonne, when wee make to him our prayer.

Likewise S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> That those which forsake the liuing
God, to seeke after the dead, are accounted among the

<hi>The same author noteth the words of the Apostle S.</hi> Iohn,
1. <hi>Epistle, chap. 2. vers.</hi> 1. If any man sin, we haue an aduocate
with the Father, Iesus Christ the iust. <hi>Where this Apostle ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
heed of making himselfe a companion with our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate
Iesus Christ,</hi> Surely <hi>(saith he)</hi> he was a iust and a great
man, who dranke out of the Lords bosome the secrets of his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.
Being notwithstanding such a man,<note place="margin">The Apostle saith we haue, and not you haue, to shew that he himself hath need of a Mediatour.</note> he hath not said, ye
haue an aduocate with the Father, but, If any man hath sinned,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:981:46"/>
we haue an aduocate. Neither did he say, ye haue, nor did he not
say, ye haue me, nor likewise ye haue Christ: but he propoundeth
Christ, and not himselfe, and said, we haue, and not, ye haue. He
chose rather to ranke himselfe in the number of sinners, to the
end that Christ might be his aduocate, then to place himselfe
an aduocate in stead of Christ, to be accounted among the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
proud ones. Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>(saith he)</hi> we haue an aduocate with
the Father, Iesus Christ the iust, he is the propitiation for our
sinnes; who so holdeth that committeth no heresie, nor hath
made any schisme or partie. For from whence are diuisions
come? from hence that men say, wee are iust, we sanctifie the
vncleane, we iustifie the wicked, we pray, we obtaine. But what
said Iohn? If any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Iesus Christ the iust. <hi>Againe, in his disputation against</hi>
Parmenian, lib. 2. cap. 2. If the Apostle S. Iohn had said, He is
the propitiation for your sinner, it should haue seemed that hee
would haue separated himselfe from sinners, as if he had had no
need of that propitiation which by the Mediatour is made, who
sitteth at the right hand of the Father, and maketh request for
vs. Which if hee had said, hee had said it not only proudly, but
falsely.<note place="margin">The dignitie of the Apostles hath not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted them from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe at the feete of God.</note> Also if hee had said, I haue written to you, that yee
might not sinne: and if any man sinne, ye haue me for a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
with the Father, and I obtaine the remission of your sins,
as Parmenian, who in some place hath made the Bishop media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
betweene the people and God; what good and faithfull
Christians could haue borne it? who would haue respected him
as the Apostle of Christ, and not rather as Antichrist? For
Christian men <hi>(saith he)</hi> recommend one another vnto God
through their mutuall prayers; but hee which prayeth for all
men, and for whom none prayeth, is the true and only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.
And for that his figure was represented to vs, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the High-priest of the old Testament, it is not found that
any should pray for the Priest. Likewise S. Paul recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himselfe to the prayers of the faithfull, as one of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ,<note place="margin">The Apostle desired to be assisted with the prayer of the Saints, for asmuch as they were addressed to him, who is the head of the Saints.</note> neither doth he make himselfe any mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and the people, but hee requireth that all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the body of Christ pray for him; because that the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

which the members make, that yet are labouring on the

earth, mount vp to the Head, which is gone before into heauen,
in whom is the propitiation for our sinnes. <hi>Moreouer, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Martyrs and other Saints departed, in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of true Religion, he expressely faith, that the seruice of
the dead ought not to be reckoned among Christians for
religion, and that wee ought to honour them by way of
imitation, and not to adore them by way of religion. His
words are:</hi> Honorandi sunt propter imitationem, non adoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di

them <hi>(saith he)</hi> through charitie, and not through seruice.
<hi>And to the intent we might not think that we doe wrong

behold <hi>(saith he)</hi> the holy men, which were like to the Angels:
when thou hast found out a holy man which is the seruant of
God, and if thou wouldest worship or serue him for God, hee will
hinder thee from it, because hee will not be to thee in stead of
God, but with thee vnder God. Euen so did Paul and Barnabas
for it, tearing their cloathes told them, Men and brethren
what doe you? we are men subiect to passion as ye are. Consider
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:981:47"/>
then these examples which shew that godly men hinder such as
would serue them by way of religion for Gods: and had rather
that one only God be serued, one only God worshipped, and that
to him alone oblation be made. And so all Saints and Angels
seeke not, but the glory of this only God whom they loue. They
haue no other study then to inflame vs, and to draw by force all
those that they loue to his seruice, to his contemplation, and to
the inuocation of his holy name. The Angels declare this alone
God, and not themselues. For, for that cause are they called An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
that is to say, messengers of God, because they are his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
they seeke nothing but the glory of their Captaine: if they
seeke after their owne glory they are as tyrants condemned;
and such the diuels haue been, who haue filled the Temples of
the Heathen, and haue seduced them to set vp Images for them,
and to offer them sacrifices. <hi>And therefore he reproueth the
follie and rashnesse of such, who seeking to returne vnto
God, and were not of themselues able, had attempted this
way to come vnto God through the mediation of Angels
and Saints departed: of whom he saith in his tenth booke
of his Confessions, chapter 42. that they were deceiued
through the craft of Satan, and through the iust iudgement
of God were fallen into the desire of curious visions. At
which he taking an occasion, describeth to vs in that same
place and many others the personall vnion of two natures,
to wit, diuine and humane, which is to be found but only
in our Redeemer Iesus Christ, and prooueth besides, that
without this vnion Iesus Christ himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not haue

euen in the true religion, and so much giuen to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
that they haue forgotten what they promised vnto God: I
know there are many which adore the sepulchres, &amp;c. And it is
no maruell among so many people. Leaue off in time then, I pray
you, from detracting the Catholike Church, in blaming the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions
of such as it selfe doth condemne, and daily seeke to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them as vnto ward children.</hi> And in his answere to the
false accusations of a certaine Philosopher called <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:
To answere thee briefly</hi> (saith he) <hi>because thou mightest
pretend no ignorance, and that it should not draw thee into a
scandalizing s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>criledge, know this that the Christian Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
(of whom euen in your town there is a Church established)
doe not serue religiously any of the dead, nor worship in stead of
the Deitie any thing which by God hath been made and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but the only God who hath made and created all things.</hi>
From whence appeareth, that the inuocation of Saints bore
not any sway in those daies, nor any degree or title of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
seruice in the Christian Church, in the time of Saint
<hi>Austine</hi> and his predecessors. True it is hee complaineth
that in his daies the Church began to lose her virginitie,
and that they obscured not those most wholesome things
which in the diuine books are commanded; but that there
were instituted some other ceremonies beyond the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.
He confesseth also, that the Church being setled
among much chaffe and tares, did beare with many things,
which themselues durst not reproue nor condemne, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid
the scandals of some persons, whereof some were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:981:48"/>
and others seditious. But howbeit on the other side hee
declareth, that neither hee nor the Church hath allowed
the things which were against the faith and a godly life.
<hi>There is a difference</hi> (saith he, in his 119 epistle to <hi>Ianuarius</hi>)
<hi>betweene the things that we teach,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce cannot take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, patience doth beare withall.</note> 
               <hi>and the things which we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
betweene the things that wee are commanded to teach, and
between the things that we are commanded to amend, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to support them till we haue reformed them.</hi> And yet
notwithstanding ye would make vs beleeue, that <hi>S. Austin,
S. Ierome, S. Ambrose, S. Chrysostome, S. Basil, S. Athanasius,
S. Origen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> S. Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Denys</hi> the disciple of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
haue not only approued the superstition of those, which
worshipped the departed Saints, but that euen themselues
haue recommended it to the people, aswell by their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
addressed to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and some other Saints, as
by the recitall of their vertues and merits. Whereunto first
of all I answere, that many sentences haue been falsified,
and many annexed to the writings of the Fathers against
their intention. Which was easie to bee done, because in
their time the Art of Printing was not found out,<note place="margin">Satan letteth slip no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to sow his cockle.</note> but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
only in written hand. Secondly, where as many books
haue bin falsely published vnder the names of the Apostles,
which had been receiued, if the Apostle S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who surui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the others, (according to the testimony of S. <hi>Tertullian</hi>
and <hi>Ierome</hi>) had not foreseene it; so many Treatises haue
been deceitfully attributed to their successors, as by their
complaints appeareth.</p>
            <p>To begin then with the writings of S. <hi>Clement</hi> Bishop
of Rome, S. <hi>Ierome</hi> in his Apologie against <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> saith
of him, that hee made some bookes intituled <hi>Recognitions;</hi>
among which, although there was a doctrine truly Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall,
exposed in many texts vnder the person of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
S. <hi>Peter,</hi> yet they had mixed among them the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Heretike <hi>Eumonius.</hi> So that it seemed in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
places of them, there is none but he that speaketh. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>
also saith in his third booke and 35. chapter, that it
cannot bee cleerely knowne that the second Epistle, and
the Commentaries which are attributed to him be his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:981:49"/>
the ancient Fathers made no vse of this Epistle, and
that these Commentaries kept in no wise neither the stile
nor the forme of the pure doctrine of the Apostles, and
containe in them the communication betweene <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Appion,</hi> of which the ancients make no mention. S. <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
addeth, that the Ebonians did vse certaine bookes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
The Peregrinations of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> written by S. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
stuffed with falsehood, and that S. <hi>Clement</hi> himselfe
controlled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his owne epistles, written to the Enocly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.
<hi>Eusebius</hi> speaking of the booke intituled the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
in his third booke and third chapter, saith, That it is
Apocrypha, and that they were deceiued, who thought
that that <hi>Hermes,</hi> which the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> greeteth in his
16. chapter of the Epistle to the Romanes, was the author
thereof.<note place="margin">Satan seeke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h euermore to authorize his Ragins, to the preiudice of the truth.</note> So likewise <hi>Erasmus</hi> of Roterdam saith, that many
bookes badly patched together, haue bin annexed to S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi>
bookes, to wit, the Treatise of the Reuelation of
S. <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> head; which is full of fables, and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that reciteth sundrie things happened a long while
after S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time: The treatise of Sina and Sion against
the Iewes, which in no wise representeth, neither the
knowledge, nor zeale of S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> They haue also ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
among S. <hi>Austins</hi> bookes, the booke intituled, The true
and false penance; which containeth that fine fable, how
S. <hi>Andrew</hi> seeing that the people would haue taken him
away from the crosse whereunto they had bound him;
began to make this prayer to God: Lord it is time that
thou laiest my bodie in the graue, suffer them not to take
me downe aliue from this crosse: It is time that my bodie
should be interred, &amp;c. In like manner, <hi>Lewes Viues Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
(one of your best Catholikes) complaineth in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations
vpon the bookes of the Citie of God; that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sentences are annexed to them, which are not S. <hi>Austins.</hi>
They haue put into the books of S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> the Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of some of the Epistles of the New Testament, which,
as S. <hi>Austin</hi> testifieth, was composed by a Monke and a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ike
called <hi>Pelagus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Robert Bellarmine</hi> also maintaineth
in his disputations, that the booke written to <hi>Orosus</hi> and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:981:49"/>
attributed to be Saint <hi>Austins,</hi> is not his. And many other
bookes base and illegitimate, and which euen your selues
confesse to haue been falsely fathered on our Fathers, and
in no wise receiueable.</p>
            <p>But to answere more particularly to your allegations:
You deceiue your selues in that you thinke (your) S. <hi>Denys
Areopagite</hi> was the disciple of the Apostle S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The time wherein S. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys Areopagite</hi> liued.</note> For in
the booke of Celestial Hierarchies, which you attribute to
him, he speaketh of his predecessors <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
which liued and suffered martyrdome vnder <hi>Traian</hi> the
third persecutor of the Christians after <hi>Nero,</hi> and the 14.
Emperor, which began to raigne about the yeere of Christ
100, and the thirtieth yeere after the decease of the Apostle
S. <hi>Paul;</hi> according to the calculation of your Bishop <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culphus.</hi>
This booke we haue also in suspition, because wee
finde in it no marke of the true disciple of the Apostle S.
<hi>Paul,</hi> neither in his language, nor in his doctrine. For there
is no mention made therein for the abolishing of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ceremonies, of which the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> very often
disputeth in his Epistles; neither doth hee say in any place
thereof, that that which he wrote, he did it by his masters
authoritie. Therein hee doth but sport himselfe with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
discourses, to teach the doctrine of the holy Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
by obscure subtilties, vaine speculations, and very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate.
He there treateth of Popes, Prelats, Priests, Monks,
and of many other Orders, which in the Apostles time
were not in the Church, nor a long while after. Likewise
to shew that he did dissent from the Apostles, he applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
therein the Order of Monkes as the highest and most
excellent of all others. Causes wherefore <hi>Laurence Valla</hi>
one of your chiefest Doctors flouts at such as thought this
S. <hi>Denys</hi> to be the disciple of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the author of this
booke. As <hi>Erasmus</hi> of Roterdam noteth in his Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vpon the 17 chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. Now
as for that which you cite out of the 7. chapter of his said
booke, he himselfe expoundeth it, and exhorteth the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to seeke after (not the Saints departed, but) the Saints
conuersant in this world, to make request for them. <hi>I iudge</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:981:50"/>
(saith he) <hi>with the diuine Scriptures, that the prayers of the
Saints in this life are very profitable, and in this manner, to
wit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of some is charitable, but it is impietie to pray vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
               <hi>if any man desire diuine gifts, and acknowledging his sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie
and infirmitie, let him go finde out some holy personage,
and pray him to assist and succour him through his prayers.</hi> I
grant you, that hee recounteth in the third chapter of the
same booke, that they made mention of the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
when they celebrated the Sacrament of the vnion of
Iesus Christ with his members; because they are one part
of the Catholike Church, and of the companie of those
which are elected to eternall life. But there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene the recitall of the vertues of the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
this world, and the inuocation of them. And you
will not shew vs that S. <hi>Denys</hi> propounding to vs the end
wherefore mention is made of their good liues, doth there
speake of the inuocation of Saints, but of the imitation of
their godlinesse, and perseuerance in the Christian faith,
saying, that they prayed those which holily and religiously
had liued in this world; to the end that their suruiuers
might by their examples learne to liue, and die well in
God, and might bee admonished that they which die in
him liue out of this world in a better life, and that God
hath them in his memorie, according as it is written, That
God knoweth such as are his, and that the death of the
Saints is precious before him. Secondly, you produce the
comparison which S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> maketh betweene <hi>Eue</hi> and
the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in his 5. booke and 16. chapter. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
why you represent not heere vnto vs S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> words,
which according to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> iudgement, doe cleerely
shew, that S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> beleeued and taught that the Virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> ought to be adored by vs as an Aduocatesse of our
first Mother <hi>Eue</hi> towards God. Therefore to encounter
you with your owne weapons, I will here make S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
to speake. <hi>As Eue</hi> (saith he) <hi>was seduced by the words of the
wicked angel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nce of these words of S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> with that which the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite imposeth, discouereth more plainly his impudency.</note> 
               <hi>to flie from God in transgressing his word: so the
Virgin Mary receiued the good tidings by the word of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
to beare God in being obedient to his word: and as this
(Eue) was seduced to flie from God, so was this (Mary) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:981:50"/>
to obey him, to the intent that the Virgin Mary might
be made an Aduocatesse of the Virgin Eue.</hi> What man is it
that perceiueth not, that by this comparison S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the male diction come vpon all mankinde through
<hi>Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> transgression, to the blessing which afterward is come
to them by the faith and obedience of the Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi>
Touching this word Aduocatesse, from whence <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
draweth his argument against vs, yee know well that it
commeth not from <hi>Irenaeus</hi> who wrote in Greek, but from
the translator of his booke. And albeit yee may take heere
this name for a Mediatrix, yet you are not ignorant that
this Greeke word <hi>paracletos,</hi> signifieth sometimes also a
Comforter, and is so interpreted by S. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and many
others of the Fathers by the name of an aduocate in the
same signification, as appeareth by the translation of those
which haue tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated the promise of our Lord Iesus Christ,
described by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 14. chapter, and 16. verse: I will
pray the Father, and hee will giue you another Aduocate,
that is to say, another Comforter. So, whosoeuer will take
heed vnto the meaning of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and his translator, and
to the proper signification of this name Aduocate, in this
place shall perceiue that the author meant to say no other
thing, but that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was chosen by God, to
beare the Redeemer of the world, and brought foorth the
Consolation to <hi>Eue,</hi> according to the promise which God
made to her in paradise, that the seed of the woman should
breake the head of the Serpent, who had seduced her.
Thirdly, you are not ashamed to vtter the Sermon of the
Virgin Mother of God, imprinted vnder the name of Saint
<hi>Athanasius,</hi> calling the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Lady, Mother, Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratrix
and Mistris, saying besides, <hi>Incline thine eare to our
prayers, and forget not thy people; wee crie vnto thee, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of vs,</hi> &amp;c. An euident signe, either that you haue
not read the first volume of his writings, wherein he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by many examples and testimonies of the Bible, that
none ought to haue his refuge neither to the Angels, nor
any humane creature, but only to God, through the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
of his Sonne Iesus Christ; or if you haue read them,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:981:51"/>
that you make lesse account of his first volume, which was
approued and receiued by the ancient Church, then of the
third which containeth, as you confesse, this prayer made
to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> In which volume to conuict you by
your owne Doctors, <hi>Petrus Nannius</hi> Professor in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
of Louain, hath annexed a preface; whereby hee
aduertiseth the reader, that hee hath put into this second
tome the bookes suspected of falsehood, and which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his judgement were not composed by S. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi>
Fourthly, you cite the prayer which S. <hi>Basil</hi> made to
the fortie Martyrs, and you annex to it false Glosses and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations.
For S. <hi>Basil</hi> commandeth not there the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
(as you affirme) to haue there recourse vnto these
holy Martyrs, nor to call vpon them, but declareth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
of those Martyrs what they did in his time.
<hi>He which is</hi> (saith he) <hi>in affliction goeth to those fortie Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;

of the custome of the vulgar people an expresse

that vpon this holy Father, which neuer he thought
to say! His intention was not so, as to stirre vp the hearts
of his auditorie, to inuocate these Martyrs; but admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
them contrariwise, to moue one another through
the remembrance of the Saints to imitate their zeale, and
to worship and implore God in the assembli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of many, to
appease him, and to render him thanks for his benefits, and
to edifie each other by sermons of exhortation. You al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage

prayeth to a Text-maker, and a Fisherman.</hi> These words you
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:981:51"/>
attribute to S. <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> Neuerthelesse, sundrie of your
Writers haue attributed them vnto S. <hi>Austine,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to a certaine man called <hi>Theodore Daphnopath;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leasings would faine couer themselues.</note> in such
sort that you are not of one accord with your fellowes, nor
of one and the same opinion touching the author of these
words, from which you cannot conclude that S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
was of that minde, to recommend to the people
the inuocation of Saints, as a seruice approued by God.
For he speaketh not in this discourse of that which ought
to bee done, according to the rule and instruction of
the holy Scriptures, but of what was done by the people
through their indiscreet zeale after the imitation of the
Grecians, which yeerely made an assemblie about the
graues of those which were slaine in the battell of Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon,
to celebrate their Feasts, and to recount their praises,
as S. <hi>Cyril</hi> noteth in his sixth booke against <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.
And albeit that S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> did beare with this
custome of the vulgar people, as many other corruptions
and abuses of the like nature, which he could not remedie,
without hurting the weake: notwithstanding hee often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
made his complaints thereof: <hi>See</hi> (saith he in his 12.
Homily on the first to the Corinthians) <hi>how the iudgements
of the common people are corrupted, vnprofitable, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
partly by foolish men, and partly by children that doe suck.
The Martyrs</hi> (saith he in his 45. Homily vpon S. <hi>Matthew)
take no delight to be honoured with money, for which the poore
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Gospell: <hi>When thou hearest that the Lord is risen naked from

For to what end is it good, seeing it bringeth but lesse to such as

citie of Syria, about the yeere of Christ 730. Among
other bookes which are attributed to him, wee haue foure
touching the tradition of the Christian faith, which haue
been translated out of Greeke into French, by a certaine
Philosopher named <hi>Iacobus Faber Stapulensis.</hi> You affirme
that in the 16 chapter of his last booke concerning the
Christian faith, he saith, <hi>That through the Saints, the diuels
are chased away, the sicke are healed, the blinde see, the leprous
are clensed, tentations and vexations are vanquished, and that
euery good thing commeth by them in fauour of those which
craue them with a stedfast faith.</hi> Although that superstition
is chiefly come forth of the heads of the Monks, yet there
is great likelihood, that this sentence was juggled in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his writings. For though he liued in those daies,
when superstition had her full sway and vigour, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Grecians were not so soone corrupted,
as the Latins. And <hi>Emericus</hi> one of your writers, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
a long while after him, reproueth the Grecians for this
opinion, that men ought not to inuocate the saints, nor the
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> likewise, but one only Mediatour, which is
Christ, and that to offer gifts to them, was to present sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
to the Diuels.</p>
            <p>Let vs now come to the booke <hi>de Viduis,</hi> composed by
S. <hi>Ambrose: When Peters mother in law</hi> (saith he) <hi>had a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
Andrew and Peter prayed vnto the Lord for her: And
thou widow, hast so many neere friends which pray for thee (to
wit) the Apostles and Martyrs, if thou commest to them in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of deuotion. It behoueth then to pray vnto them, &amp;c. For
they can pray for our sinnes, sith they haue washed away their
owne with their owne blood.</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> &amp;c. haue passed their limits, and we ought to note, but not to imitate that which they haue said.</note> Without searching any further,
<hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi> one of your writers confesseth, that S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
and some others of the Fathers, haue suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be transported in such a sort, through the heate
and vehemencie of their Orations, that sometimes they
made Hyperboles, that is to say, and speake more cleerely,
they surpassed the bonds of truth. <hi>Erasmus</hi> of Roterdam in
his preface vpon this booke intituled, <hi>de Viduis,</hi> saith, that
in this fertill matter so pleasing to the eares of the vulgar
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:981:52"/>
people, he hath let loose the bridle of his tongue, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his discourse with the colours of Rhetorike, in such a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort that the ignorant people could not well iudge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
but the learned only. In fine, that he thought he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to set foorth his language by some artificiall drafts, to
make a shew &amp; florish of the ornaments of his eloquence.
Howsoeuer, if hee were the author of this booke, hee hath
wandred out of the way, and hath not well remembred his
owne lesson, <hi>That Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s our mouth, by which we speake to
the Father; our eye, by which we behold the Father; our right
hand, whereby wee offer to the Father, and that without this
Mediatour, there is no comming vnto God neither for vs, nor
any of the Saints.</hi>
               <note place="margin">As the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts did often bring in the Saints speaking, so spake they sometimes to them, as if they had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</note> You alleage also for the establishing of
your superstition, Saint <hi>Ieroms</hi> letter dedicated to <hi>Paula,</hi> to
whom yee appropriate that title which ordinarily your
companions doe attribute to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that is, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her holy Lady. But if we examine this epistle of S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms,</hi>
he speaketh to <hi>Paula</hi> who was absent and in heauen,
as if she had been present, and that by a figure, and certaine
manner of speech called in Shooles <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> whereby
he not only prayeth vnto <hi>Paula,</hi> to supplicate God for <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silla,</hi>
but for himselfe also in his extreame age. Likewise he
saluteth <hi>Paula,</hi> and saith <hi>vale</hi> to her, that is, farewell, or God
keep thee in good health. If then you will take these words
to the very letter, to conclude from thence that hee hath
called vpon <hi>Paula</hi> with a full assurance that she heard him,
and could perswade the diuine Maiestie to heare her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
you must likewise grant me, that he discoursed with
her mouth to mouth, and that in praying to God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
her in health, he beleeued that she, and all the Saints
in Paradise, desire that after their departure, we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
them to God in our prayers. But as ye will deny
me the last point, so I deny you the first, and that for these
three reasons: The first is, that in the Epitaph he made for
his friend <hi>Nepotian</hi> departed this world,<note place="margin">The aduersary is driuen into absurditie, by good &amp; strong reasons.</note> he calleth him
blessed, because hee neither heard nor saw the miseries of
this world, nor the barbarian rage against the Christians.
Whereunto hee addeth, that those words were as one
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:981:53"/>
would say dumbe and pronounced in vaine, because th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Nepotian</hi> heard him not: and that he with the other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in his time was assured that <hi>Nepotian</hi> was in heauen
with Iesus Christ, and ioyned to the companie of Saints.
Now this that <hi>Ierome</hi> hath plainly spoken of <hi>Nepotian,</hi> that
he heard him not, he also vndoubtedly hath beleeued, and
vnderstood of <hi>Paula</hi> and the other Saints departed, who
are established in their blessed estate, and receiued into pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
to enioy there the same rest with him. The second
reason is, that hee manifestly declareth to vs in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
vpon the prophecie of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that the Saints li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in this world cannot succour vs, nor consequently the
departed through their prayers and intercessions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For in
his exposition of this admonition of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
chap. 14. vers. 14. though these three men, <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi>
and <hi>Iob</hi> were in the midst of Ierusalem, &amp;c. they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deliuer them, nor their owne daughters. <hi>What shall we
say</hi> (saith <hi>Ierome) of those which thinke that by the merit and
vertues of their fathers, their peruerse children may be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hell fire?</hi>
               <note place="margin">The soule of him which shal haue sinned, shall be that which shal die.</note> 
               <hi>Euery one shall die through his owne sin, and
and shall be saued through his owne righteousnesse. In vaine
the Iewes say, Abraham is our father, hauing not his workes;
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t if there be confidence in any, let vs put our trust only in the
Lord.</hi> The third reason, for that he testifieth of these two
Christian women, who had bin instructed by him, to wit,
<hi>Paula</hi> and <hi>Blesilla,</hi> is, how they vpon the point of their
death, did not recommend themselues to the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
nor any of the saints in paradise, but to their only Lord
and Sauiour Iesus Christ. <hi>When</hi> (saith he) <hi>the feuer burned
Blesilla, and that her bed was bes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t with her dearest friends,
behold her last words were, Pray yee to the Lord Iesus Christ
that hee forgiue me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Likewise, who will giue me wings</hi> (saith
<hi>Paula) as a doue, that I may flie from hence and rest me? My
soule thirsteth after thee, my flesh oftentimes wisheth for thee.</hi>
Notwithstanding this, we cannot wholly excuse him.<note place="margin">Wise words of two women in great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</note> For
himselfe requiring <hi>Paula</hi> by his prayers to succour him in
his old age, followed not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rule which he himselfe had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to <hi>Paula</hi> and <hi>Blesilla,</hi> to call only vpon God, neither
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:981:53"/>
the example of their confidence in the only Sauiour Iesus
Christ, and sith that herein he hath failed, as by his owne
instructions we haue proued, his authoritie bindeth not vs
to follow his error. Now resteth that supplication which
according to your opinion S. <hi>Austin</hi> made to the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> and to all the saints. For proofe whereof you cite
the 40 chapter of his Meditations, where he saith, <hi>Holy and
immaculate Virgin, mother of God, mother of our Lord Iesus
Christ, vouchsafe to make intercession for me vnto him, of
whom through thy vertues and merits thou wast made the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Temple.</hi> You alleage with a bad conscience this booke
of Meditations: for you know that <hi>Erasmus</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Doctors durst not affirme it to be S. <hi>Austins.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Papistical Doctors make no conscience to discouer the shame of their fathers, seeing they attribute to them such shamefull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> Also
you are not ignorant that the Canon <hi>Garet</hi> attributeth
this supplication to <hi>Fulbert</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chartres.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
whosoeuer shall conferre this prayer printed vnder
S. <hi>Austins</hi> name, with his sentences, which I haue alreadie
alleaged against you, whereby he absolutely condemneth
the inuocation of Saints, will iudge with these learned
men, who had a better conscience then you, that none can
attribute vnto him this prayer, without doing him shame
and accusing him of manifest contradiction in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and of faining in that which he saith of Iesus Christ,
that hee only can present vnto God his Father the prayers
of his people, because there is no saluation but only in
him: and of himselfe that he speaketh more safely to Iesus
Christ then to all other saints in paradise. After this as in
a passage you propose against vs the authoritie of <hi>S. Leo,
and S. Gregory Popes, S. Gregory of Tours, S. Anselmus, and
S. Bernard.</hi> And you could name many other protectors
of your cause, if you were not of an opinion <hi>that the halfe
of them which you haue already named, were not more then too
sufficient to make the Caluinists and Lutherans to blush, if they
had any blood in their hearts.</hi> I confesse that the inuocation
of Saints, and namely of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was finally au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by the latter of these Popes, if that be true as is
reported, and brought vp by all force into the seruice of
the Church about the yeere of Christ 600: because that in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:981:54"/>
those daies there was no more <hi>Athanases,</hi>
               <note place="margin">We auouch that supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion got the vpper hand, but we denie that we ought to cleaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</note> nor <hi>Chrysostoms,</hi>
nor <hi>Cyprians,</hi> nor <hi>Austins,</hi> to stop the breach, and repulse
it from gaining the heart of the vulgar people. I confesse
also, that <hi>Anselmus</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> liuing in that miserable
age, wherein superstition was the Mistris of the field,
strooke their sailes and halted on both sides, to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
themselues to the custome of their time, through feare
and carnall wisedome: but I adde hereunto, that if you had
euer a veine in your heart of shame, you would then blush
in your soule, and would be ashamed to ranke <hi>Anselmus</hi>
and <hi>Bernard</hi> with these, who through their writings haue
confirmed your tradition, touching the adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Saints.
For it was impossible for them to confirme you and your
predecessors in your opinion, seeing themselues were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
firme therein, but very inconstant and variable. For at
sometimes they counselled the Christians to come vnto
God by the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> calling her the Mediatrix and
Sauiouresse of mankinde; at other times they admonished
them of the cleane contrarie, and to addresse themselues
to God only, through the intercession of his only Son, and
not to put their hope, but in the mercie of the Father, and
in the full satisfaction which his Sonne hath made to him
for our sinnes. Howsoeuer it be, we finde in <hi>Anselmus</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
the formall of prayer, which he made vnto God,
and published to the intent al Christians might vse it with
him for their instruction and consolation. <hi>Lord my God</hi>
(saith he) <hi>I pray vnto thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A formular of <hi>Anselmus</hi> his prayers.</note> 
               <hi>because thou art neere vnto all

                  </gap>all vpon thee; and those which call on thee in truth,
for thou art the Truth. I beseech thee. let thy truth then teach
me, that I may inuocate thy clemencie, for I cannot pray as I
ought; but most blessed truth I beseech thee to instruct me. To
be wise without thee, is to become foolish; but to know thee is
perfect knowledge. O diuine wisedome instruct me, and learne
me thy law: for I beleeue that he is blessed whom thou shalt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct,
and he to whom thou shalt teach thy law. I desire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate
thee, and intreate thee that it may be in truth. What is
it to call on the truth in truth, but to inuocate the Father by
the Sonne? for what is there more sweete then to pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:981:54"/>
by his only Sonne, and to moue the Father vnto compassion
by the remembrance of his owne Sonne? So haue wicked liuers

               <note place="margin">A similitude.</note> 
               <hi>so those which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to lose their heads, recouered not only their liues, but
an extraordinarie fauour, when they shew to the angrie fathers
the loue of their children: Euen so almightie Father, through
the loue thou bearest to thy almightie Sonne, I beseech thee
draw my soule out of prison, to the end it may confesse thy name,
deliuer me from the bands of sinne, through the intercession of
this thy precious Sonne which sitteth at thy right hand. For
surely I know not what other intercessor I could addresse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thee for me, but only he which is the propitiation for our
sinnes who sitteth at thy right hand, who through the glorie
which is common to him with thee, soliciteth thy goodnesse for
vs. Behold O God and Father my Aduocate with thee, behold
my High-priest which hath no need of being cleansed through
the blood of any one, because hee shineth being sprinkled with
his owne blood. I haue addressed thy welbeloued Sonne for my
Aduocate, I haue made him a Mediatour betweene thee and
me, an Intercessor through whom I am sure to obtaine pardon:
behold he is my hope, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

me for mine iniquitie, as I haue deserued, regard me yet
at the least in thy Sonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Our demerits are forgiuen through the merit of the Sonne of God.</note> 
               <hi>that propitiation which thou hast
prepared by one, that serued thee. Remember what thy Sonne
hath suffered, and forget that which a wicked wretch hath
done.</hi> In like manner we finde in his Epistles another forme
made for the instruction and consolation of the sick which
prepare themselues to die, in forme of a discourse, wherein
the Pastor demandeth, and the sick person answereth. <hi>Art
thou glad in thy selfe</hi> (saith the Pastor to the sick) <hi>that thou

therefore?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Another forme of <hi>Anselmus,</hi> to comfort the sick.</note> S. <hi>Yea.</hi> P. <hi>Beleeuest thou that thou canst not bee

in no other thing, trust and commit thy selfe wholly to

this death, couer thy selfe only therewith, and with it wrap thy
selfe round about. And if the Lord would iudge thee, say, Lord
I oppose the death of Iesus Christ our Lord, betweene me and
thy iudgement; otherwise I could not debate with thee. And if
hee say vnto thee, that thou art a sinner, say, Lord I put the
death of Iesus Christ our Lord betweene thee and my sinnes.
And if hee should say once more vnto thee, thou hast merited
damnation; say, Lord I put the death of our Lord Iesus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
thee and my damnation; I offer vnto thee his merit in
stead of that which ought to be in me, in whom there is none.
And if hee should say yet vnto thee, that he is angrie against
thee: say, Lord I put the death of our Lord Iesus betweene me
and thy anger. This being accomplished, let the sicke say three
times, Lord I recommend my spirit into thy hands.</hi> Thus Saint
<hi>Bernard</hi> hath oftentimes exhorted the people in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
not to stand vpon the Apostles, nor any other Saint
which is but a man, neither to any Angel, but to goe
straight forward vnto the Father of lights, who is the only
iudge and witnesse of our thoughts, and to his Sonne Iesus
Christ, the only Sauiour and Bridegrome of the Church.
For in his 23. Sermon expounding this sentence of our
Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Bernard</hi> sends vs to Christ.</note> 
               <hi>I am the way, the truth, &amp; the life. Who will</hi>
(saith he, making Christ himselfe speake) <hi>come, let come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
me, let him come by me, let him come to me. After me, saith
the Lord, for I am the truth; by me, for I am the way; to me,
for I am the life.</hi> And in his 15. Sermon on the 91. Psalme:
<hi>The Church</hi> (saith he) <hi>is excellent well described in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Canticles, that hauing found the watchmen, (or rather
being found by them, for she sought them not) she staieth not
with those watchmen, neither contenteth her selfe in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
but hauing enquired after her welbeloued, flies right to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him; for her heart had no trust in those watchmen but
in her Lord: and it may be she would haue said to those which
should haue counselled her otherwise, I haue my confidence in
the Lord; which the Corinthians did not well obserue, when
they met with those watchmen, but staied with them, and passed
no further: I am (said they) of Cephas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">As we are of Christ and not of another, so ought we to stay with Christ.</note> 
               <hi>and I of Paul, and I of
Apollo: but what haue these sober and well aduised watchmen
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:981:55"/>
done? For they would not take to them the Bride, they which
were ielous about her, euen with a godly ielousie, who had vowed
to render her as a chast virgin to her husband. And, if I deceiue
not my selfe, they pushed her forward, to the end she might passe
further to finde out her welbeloued. And it is to be considered
with what arrowes the Apostle S. Paul woundeth those which
some to stay with the watchmen: Paul, hath he been crucified
for you, or haue yee been baptized in the name of Paul?</hi> And
immediatly after: <hi>I will deliuer him</hi> (saith the Lord in the
91 Psalme) <hi>because hee hopeth in me: not</hi> (saith hee) <hi>in the
watchmen, not in man, not in Angel, but in me. Expect no good
from any but from me, and not by them: for euery good gift is
from aboue, comming downe from the Father of lights, for
through me the watchmen are profitable.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> seeketh not to disrobe her sonne, or to be clothed with his robes.</note> 
               <hi>But for the rest, the
watch of the secret intention, which is in the bottome of the
heart, must not only be of me, but also is made by me, because the
eye of man cannot penetrate so deepe, nor likewise the eye of an

of his time, that the Vrgin <hi>Mary</hi> would be honoured with

no want of mercie. I boldly take from the bowels of the Lord
what I want, because they are full of mercie.</hi> Besides, he died
in this beleefe, saying, <hi>I confesse that I am not worthie of the

            <p>It is not yet fiue hundred yeeres since S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who

was Abbat of the Cloister of Claitual,<note place="margin">The time and place when S. <hi>Bernard</hi> flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.</note> liued in Burgundie,
one of the principall Prouinces of France, and was there in
greater reputation then al the other Monkes of his Order.
His bookes doe plainly witnesse, that hee was more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the inuocation of our only God and celestiall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then to the adoration of Saints, and that he beleeued
that no man could haue sure accesse vnto his throne of
grace, but by the merit of the death of our only Sauiour
Iesus Christ. Your Fathers haue brought in and receiued
his bookes in their Church without any contradiction;
and euen vnto this present you haue them in your Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and handle them daily. And yet for all this you loue
rather to affirme against your owne consciences that S.
<hi>Bernard</hi> constantly maintained the inuocation of Saints,
then roundly to confesse that he spake thereof with some
scruple of conscience, and very doubtfully, as appeareth by
his writings. In the repetition of the prayers, which our
Fathers haue addressed to the departed Saints, you nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
that prayer of <hi>Origens,</hi> and aske me <hi>whether Origen
that Doctor praying to the Prophet Iob</hi> (about the yeere of

S. Iohn Damascenus,</hi> and many other Doctors of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church, according to <hi>S. Ieromes</hi> testimonie, who saith
that in the yeere of Christ 203, <hi>Origen</hi> was then of the age
of seuenteene yeeres; it is maruell why you haue not done
him that honour,<note place="margin">A double dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor done to <hi>Origen.</hi>
               </note> to place him in his ranke, and to cite his

you doe this wrong to <hi>Origen,</hi> to attribute this prayer to
him; <hi>O S. Iob pray for vs miserable wretches, that the mercie
of God may deliuer vs.</hi> True it is that <hi>Origen</hi> had many
strange and dangerous opinions, in such sort that <hi>S. Ierome</hi>
saith of him, that hee commended his spirit, but not his
faith, that he set greatly by his translations, but not by his
doctrines and expositions; which hee tearmeth venomous
and farre from the sense of holy Scriptures, and doing
them violence: but howbeit, as wee haue alreadie proued
by his disputations against <hi>Celsus</hi> the Philosopher, that he
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:981:56"/>
spake well of the inuocation of Gods name,<note place="margin">Albeit that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi> was an impure writer in some other points, yet he hath shewed himselfe pure in the article of inuocation.</note>
and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that religious adoration appertaineth onely to God,
and the presentation of out prayers to our only Mediatour
and Intercessor Iesus Christ. If <hi>Celsus</hi> reproched <hi>Origen,</hi>
that he and the other Christians worshipped our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and from thence sought to conclude that the
Christians worshipped after the fashion of the Gentiles
some other then God; would not he (<hi>Celsus</hi>) also haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
that hee and his followers called vpon the Prophet
<hi>Iob,</hi> and that they beleeued they offended not God in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
religiously his seruant? would hee not likewife in
good earnest haue flouted at this distinction of <hi>Origens,</hi>
that the Christians worshipped no other but God, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on the name of Iesus Christ: forasmuch as Christ was
not a simple man, as the Prophets &amp; other departed Saints
were; nor likewise a simple creature, as the Angels, but
forasmuch as hee was also one God with the Father, and
Lord of all things? And what likelihood is there that hee
besought <hi>Iob</hi> to pray for him, when he himselfe prescribed
this rule to all Christians to offer their prayers only to
God, through his only Sonne, and protesteth in his eighth
booke against <hi>Celsus,</hi> to haue followed it with the other
Christians? His rule is,<note place="margin">There is no likelihood that <hi>Origen,</hi> who sent vs vnto God only, should addresse himself to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
               <hi>That wee must adore the only soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
God, and present our prayers to the only Sonne of God,
who is his Word, and the first borne of all creatures, that as a
high priest he might offer them vp to his God and to our God, to
his Father, and according to his word the father of all liuing.</hi>
The practise agreeable to this rule is expressed in these
words: <hi>We worship as much as we can through supplications
and seruices one only God, and his only Sonne, his word and his
image, offering our prayers to God the Lord of all things by his
only Sonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The words of <hi>Origen</hi> are very expresse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of Saints.</note> 
               <hi>to whom first we doe addresse them, beseeching him
that being propitiatour far our sinnes, he would vouchsafe as
high priest to offer vnto God our prayers, sacrifices and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions:
and therefore our faith lieth in God through his Son
who hath confirmed it in vs.</hi> It is not credible then that <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
hath inuocated <hi>Iob,</hi> not the other departed Saints, not
the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> likewise, sith that hee himselfe in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:981:57"/>
comprehendeth them all together in the number of
sinners, which are not entred into heauen through their
owne merits, but by the only faith in Iesus Christ. <hi>Shall we
thinke</hi> (saith he in his 27. Sermon and 2. tome) <hi>that all the
Apostles were offended in our Lord, and that his mother was
exempted? If she hath suffered no scandall in the passion of the
Lord, then Iesus died not for her sinnes. But if all haue sinned,
and haue all need of the glorie of God, to be iustified and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

and of whatsoeuer hee alleageth in his bookes concerning

They haue also commanded to race out the annotations of

discouer it, by the soueraigne authority which they take

which God himselfe hath inspired into his Prophets and
Apostles. And if they had made no doubt of the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

that these falsaries haue not kept the treasure committed

with the pure gold which they receiued from their ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors:
what man is it among vs, which will dare to assure

And sith I haue quoted so many excellent sentences of the

of those sundrie rules of prayers, cited aswell in the

that there is nothing more sure, when any point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is to be disputed, or of the true sense of some texts in
the Bible,<note place="margin">Mariners in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obscuritie of a tempest, haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to their compasse and needle, and Christians to the law.</note> then to hold our selues to Gods law, which is a

the example of <hi>Esdras,</hi> and some other Doctors of the old

is of the true rule and manner of prayer, there is nothing
more expedient then to follow in all our prayers, that only
forme of prayer which our Lord Iesus Christ taught his
Apostles, as S. <hi>Tertullian</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> shew vs by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
discourses touching the excellencie and perfection
of this prayer. And S. <hi>Austin</hi> in his epistle which he wrote
to a Christian widow called <hi>Proba: Wee say no other thing</hi>
(saith he) <hi>then that which is contained in the Lords Prayer, if
we pray rightly and conueniently. And whosoeuer should say
any thing which is not agreeable with this Euangelicall prayer,
though he prayeth not vnlawfully, yet he prayeth carnally: and

<hi>Hippocrates</hi> reciteth in his book <hi>de Morbo Sacro,</hi> that some

would be reputed as holy personages. The like writeth
<hi>Bodin</hi> of <hi>Appolonius Thyaneus</hi> and of some other Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers

the gift of prophecying, and doe many strange things
through their officers, of which sort those shal be which shall say,
Lord, Lord, haue we not prophecied in thy name? and haue wee
not cast out diuels in thy name? and by thy name done many
great workes? To whom the Iudge will answere, I neuer knew
you. To this end also, S. Gregorie Bishop of Rome saith, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
oft times miracles are done through the inspiration of
the diuell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The pretended miracles of Popedome, are rather a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of a false then of a true seruice.</note> 
               <hi>my brethren loue not those signes as are common with
the reprobate. And S. Austin saith, The diuels doe miracles,
like vnto those which were done by the seruants of God,</hi> &amp;c.
Considering therefore that the wicked Spirit hath often
times done miracles among the Iewes and Gentiles, and
that it was foretold that Antichrist and his supporters shall
in great number doe them in the latter daies, to establish
their errors, and seduce the elect of God, if it were possible;
it is a follie in you to conclude that the miracles done,
through the inuocation of the departed Saints, is a seruice
pure and approued by God. But to reproue the course of
your fine discourse, adorned with this figure of preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">The subiect for which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists tearme vs heretike<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

speaking seriously, you at your pleasure flout at <hi>Caluin,</hi>
and our arguments. You say, <hi>that our strongest arguments,
and that which we most set by, is, that which wee hold from our
Captaine Caluin, who asketh you in the third booke of his Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
chap. 20. sect. 24. Who hath reuealed to you this secret,
that the departed Saints haue so long eares to stretch them
downe vnto your words? and so sharp eyes, that they can behold
your necessities?</hi> It is maruell that you, who so diligently
set foorth your tongue with the colours of Rhetorique,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caluin</hi> speaketh to the foolish, according to their folly.</note>
vnderstand not, that hee maketh this demaund of you by
an <hi>Ironia,</hi> or manner of mockage, and laugheth at your
foolish imagination, that the Saints, which are aboue in
heauen, heare and see what is done here beneath on earth.
For without searching any further, <hi>Caluin</hi> confesseth in
that very section, that the soules of the blessed, albeit they
are separated from their bodies, and vse no more the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of eyes and eares, yet vnderstand many things,
which concerne the aduancement of the glorie of God,
and his kingdome. Yea and that they seeke it with a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and vnmoued will; which may bee proued by some
texts out of the Bible: but hee condemneth the boldnesse
of your Sophists,<note place="margin">If the Saints see all things within the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it would follow that they should see the day of the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ, which is false.</note> who without any testimonie of holie
Scripture, dare affirme that the brightnesse of Gods face is
so great, that in the contemplation thereof the Saints
may behold as in a mirrour the things which in this world
do happen. But whilest you bark against this demand of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:981:61"/>
               <hi>Caluins,</hi> you dissemble our arguments, and accuse your
selues of falsehood and deliberate malice, seeing you
vaunt that you haue read the writings of our Ministers,
and haue therein obserued the reasons which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
against the second point of your doctrine. If it be
true that you haue perused the principall reasons of our
Pastors; why then do you let passe in silence that which
they haue drawne out of the fountaine of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and namely in the 9. chapter of Ecclesiastes, vers. 6.
<hi>That the loue and the hatred of the dead is now perished,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and

<hi>Lord thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of

our Teachers is grounded. The holy Scripture manifestly
instructeth vs in those aboue said texts, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Saints decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
this world haue no more portion in the things which
are done vnder the cope of heauen, nor any knowledge of
our affaires. Therfore it is a folly in them, which yet walk
in this vaile of miserie, to call vpon them.</p>
            <p>But to proceed on with the course of your inuectiue,
you say, <hi>that the disciples of Caluin and Luther, to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
wiser then their Masters, haue begun since that, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
of the Catholiques some expresse texts and examples
taken out of the holy Scripture, whereby it might appeare that
the Saints aboue in Paradise vnderstand &amp; heare our prayers.</hi>
Whereunto I replie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> haue not bound their aduersaries, to proue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of Saints by the Scripture.</note> that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> haue not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of you any expresse texts by the which it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
that the deceased Saints heare our Prayers; because
they knew exceeding well, that there could not be found
for it so much as one only word in the Word of God. For
what saith <hi>Caluin</hi> thereof in his 3. booke and 20. chapter,
sect. 21? <hi>What angell or diuell euer reueiled to any man any
one syllable of this intercessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Saints, which these men haue
forged? For in the Scripture there is nothing said thereof.</hi>
What reason had he then to seeke it there? And as for vs,
which are none of <hi>Luthers</hi> or <hi>Caluins</hi> disciples, but
Christs; wee require of you some proofes taken out of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:981:62"/>
marrow of the holy Scripture, not for that wee thinke it is
possible for you; but because wee might haue the greater
occasion to confute you of leasing euen by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.<note place="margin">The Papists are to make good that which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and not in vs which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie &amp; disproue the inuocation of Saints.</note> And when all is said, and when we come to that,
ye feare the blowes, &amp; to saue your selues from them, you
answere vs reciprocally by a demaund, whether wee can
proue our negatiue by some text, to wit, that the Scripture
teacheth vs not, that the Saints which are in heauen can
heare our prayers. In your inuectiue against <hi>Caluin,</hi> you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch
him in that hee wanteth Philosophie: but herein I
may rebuke you by an argument farre more forcible, that
you haue not learned the lawes Dialecticae, (that is, of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick)
which teacheth vs, <hi>Quod affirmanti incumbat proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> to wit, <hi>that he which affirmeth any thing, is bound to proue
his affirmation.</hi> So it is then, that you affirme, that the holy
Scripture teacheth vs that the departed Saints heare our
prayers,<note place="margin">We neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie nor affirme any thing of our own sense, but from the authoritie of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> and wee contrariwise denie it; then it is not in vs
to confirme our negation, but in you to ratifie your nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which is vnpossible for you: notwithstanding you
are so imprudent, or rather so impudent as to say, <hi>that wee
may reade ouer the Bible as oft as we list, yet we shall neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
thereout one only text contrary to your opinion.</hi> If your
conscience be not seared, it hath alreadie conuicted you
of falsehood by the reading of those two places, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
I haue quoted out of the 9. chapter and 16. verse of
Eccle.<note place="margin">Eccle. 9. 16.</note> and Esay 63. vers. 16. where the holy Ghost guiding
the pen of these two men of God,<note place="margin">Es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which are departed this life, haue no portion in our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
which are done vnder the Sunne, but that they are
ignorant thereof.</p>
            <p>Let vs now come to your demonstration, <hi>that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
faileth you not in this point: for to awaken our spirits, you
first command vs to note this expresse text of Scripture,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Two false prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and grounds of the Papisticall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.</note> 
               <hi>that
the Angels in heauen vnderstand our prayers, seeing they are
the reporters of then to the diuine Maiestie, as appeareth by
the same scripture.</hi> Secondly, <hi>it is an expresse text of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the Saints shall be in heauen as the Angels, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the saying of the Sonne of God in the Gospell.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:981:62"/>
you adde your conclusion, <hi>that the Saints heare our
prayers, sith the Angels (vnto whom they are likened) heare
them.</hi> If some one should propound this your argument
borrowed from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to Scholars which haue heard
the rules of Logick, they would quickly smell out your
deceit, and would replie, that you doe not aptlie appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
it to the Saints departed, because to conclude from
thence (according to the right forme and rule of Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians)
that the Saints departed vnderstand our prayers,
you must first haue proued, that Iesus Christ saith in the
20. chapter of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> that the departed Saints are Angels,
and not as you make them, like vnto Angels. They would
likewise reiect your reason, and confirmation which you
annex vnto this sentence,<note place="margin">The Papists ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer proue, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of the prayers of the Saints before God.</note> 
               <hi>that the Angels vnderstand our
prayers, because they are the reporters of them to the diuine
Maiestie, as appeareth by the holy Scripture.</hi> Mark you not
here a fine proofe, to say it appeareth by the Scripture that
the Angels report our prayers to God, without quoting
so much as one testimonie? From hence it comes, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
taken your principall peeces from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> you
durst not alleage that place of holy Scripture which is in
the 12. chapter and 15. verse of <hi>Toby,</hi> where the Angel <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi>
saith, <hi>That hee is one of those seuen holy Angels, which
presents before the Maiestie of God the prayers of the Saints.</hi>
If it be in regard that you make conscience to confirme
your proposition out of a booke which is Apocrypha, I
commend you, and in that I preferre you before your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
Or if it be because you haue not read, nor remembred
well, that text which he alleageth in his book of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse
of the Saints, I pardon you for it. Touching the
rest, it seemes at the first sight, that you make some stop at
falsifying the 36. verse of the 20 chapter of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and of
following therein the example of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> &amp; <hi>Richeome,</hi>
who in stead of saying as Christ did in answering the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,
<hi>that the Saints shall be</hi> (to wit, in the resurrection of
the flesh) <hi>like the Angels:</hi> they turne this text as if Christ
had said, <hi>that they are like to the Angels.</hi> But in the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your argument trussed to your conclusion, you
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:981:63"/>
shew your selfe to be of the same humour as your School-masters<note place="margin">Our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie with the Angels is not yet, but when we shal be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</note>
aboue said are; seeing you change the future tense
into the present; to maintaine with them that the Saints
are like to the Angels: and that against the intention of
our Soueraigne Lord and Master Iesus Christ, who dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
against the Sadduces, which denied the resurrection
of the bodie, and had propounded this question to him,
worthie to be laughed at, touching a woman which had
had seuen husbands, whose wife she should be in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
sheweth them vpon this occasion, that the
faithfull shall then be glorified, euen in regard of their
bodies which shall not bee mortall, nor corruptible no
more, but as the spirits of the Angels are, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shall not be enclined to mariage, for the maintaining of
their race and posteritie, but shall be like to the Angels
which doe not marrie. Now foreseeing through the agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of your spirit, what we might replie on that aboue said
place, you thinke that you heare vs alreadie answere, <hi>that
this similitude of the Angels and Saints, whereof our Lord
speaketh in the Gospell, consisteth only in their felicitie and
blessednesse, and not in their nature and office, that is to say</hi> (as
it hath pleased you to expound it) <hi>that the Angels and the
Saints shall be in heauen equall and like each other, because
both of them shall be blessed, enioying one selfesame glorie and
felicitie.</hi> Now as you can finde nothing therein to chaw
vpon, you grant vs this answere, and make it to serue your
turne, as a fowler with his net, to take and ensnare vs. For
behold the argument which you ground vpon our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
is, <hi>that seeing the felicitie and state of future life, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
not the Angels from hearing the prayers of the mortall,
why is it not possible that the Saints being in the same fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
with the Angels and like vnto them, may not heare like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
our prayers aswell as they? This text of scripture them
sheweth that the Saints heare our prayers.</hi> We denie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of this argument. If the felicitie of the Angels
hindreth them not from hearing our prayers, that it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
from thence, that the felicitie of the departed
Saints hindreth not them also from the vnderstanding of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:981:63"/>
our Supplications;<note place="margin">From things or persons which are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, we ought not to draw like conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</note> the reason is, because the Angels (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their present felicitie) haue receiued from
God <hi>this charge, to watch ouer vs, and our safetie,</hi> as it is
written in the 34. Psalme. For which cause the Apostle
S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth them administring spirits, sent for their
sakes that are to receiue the inheritance of saluation,
which the Scripture speaketh in no place of the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
You repeate afterward your affirmation, <hi>that the
Saints deceased heare vs, see vs, and are not ignorant of that
which is done vpon the earth.</hi> For confirmation whereof you
propound vs the example of <hi>Abraham, who being dead and
in Limbo, knew many things which happened among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the children of Israel, as one may perceiue by the</hi> 16.
<hi>chapter of S. Luke. For first of all he knew, that the people had
the bookes of Moses and the Prophets, the ancientest whereof
was Moses, which had been written more then foure hundred
yeares after the death of Abraham. Secondly, he knew the life
which the rich Glutton led vpon the earth, and what miserie
poore Lazarus had there endured. Thirdly, hee saw and knew
the estate and condition of that wicked wretch, and heard his
prayer, (although he was not heard) when he cried, Father A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
haue mercie on me, and send Lazarus, &amp;c. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
there was a great distance betweene the one and the
other, as Abraham answered him: finally, albeit that the rich
Glutton was damned, saw he not Abraham? heard he not his
answere? gaue he not his replies? albeit there was a great
gulfe set betweene them? Now there is no man that dares deny
all this; because it is the Gospell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a storie pronounced by the
mouth of him which cannot lie, but is the very truth himselfe,
euen Iesus Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">An argument from the least to the greatest, which hath more colour then strength.</note> 
               <hi>And if this thing and storie be true (as it
is) I now charge all the Caluinian and Lutherian Ministers,
and say vnto them, If Abrah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m (my Masters) being shut vp
in Limbo, and not enioying at that time the sight of God, nor
being blessed but through hope, knew notwithstanding the
things of this world, the estate and miserie of the rich Glutton,
and heard him make his prayer and demaund; will you thinke
that the Saints in Paradise, beholding God, and his most bright
sight, are better priuiledged then Abraham?</hi> I will reduce
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:981:64"/>
your paradox and superfluitie of words into this summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
If (say you) <hi>Abraham</hi> in Limbo, being not yet bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
but through hope, knew the things of this world, (as
appeareth by the historie thereof contained in the 16.
chapter of S. <hi>Luke</hi>) the Saints in paradise enioying the most
glorious countenance of God, are not lesse priuiledged in
that then <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now you presuppose that this is a
sure foundation, that <hi>Abraham</hi> after his death knew the
affaires of this world, and from thence you conclude, that
the consequence which you draw from it is good and true.
I say that in your discourse you interlarde many things
false and vncertaine. For first you presuppose that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was in Limbo, and in the place of such as are not bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
but through hope, when Christ spake of him and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
to his disciples.<note place="margin">It is impietie to say <hi>Abraham</hi> was in Limbo.</note> Whereof we can shew you the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
in the 8. chapter of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and eleuenth verse,
where Christ saith,<note place="margin">Matth. 8. 11.</note> 
               <hi>that many shall come from the East and
West, and shall sit downe with Abraham, and Isaac, and Iacob
in the kingdome of heauen.</hi> In which text you may see, that
Iesus Christ promiseth all those which shall beleeue in his
doctrine, that their soules shall be transported into the
kingdome of heauen, where were then at that time the
soules of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi> From whence one
may easily gather, that Iesus Christ vnderstood in S. <hi>Luke</hi>
by the bosome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that which in S. <hi>Matthew</hi> hee
calleth the kingdome of heauen. In consideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
sundrie of the ancient Fathers haue expressed those
words of <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, by the name of Paradise.
Likewise, there are some of them, which haue concluded

time accomplished, the combat atchieued, the lists made voide,
the Crowne giuen, and those which haue fought doe rest, and
those which haue not gained before, are departed from thence,
and those which haue not fought, cannot offer themselues any

all things liue to God, and all they which returne to the Lord,
be as in the number of his familie; we account that we haue lost
her, but she is lodged in heauen: For when Paula was in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
she was absent from the Lord, saying, I am a pilgrim, and
a stranger here, as all my Fathers were, I desire to be separated
from this body, and to bee with Christ. She now enioyeth the

that after the soule is issued foorth of the body, men cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
any further succour, by any care or prudence. After the
soule is dislodged from the body, there is presently a distinction
made betweene the righteous and the vnrighteous: For the
soules of the righteous are carried by the Angels into the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Paradise, whereof they are worthy, where they haue the
conuersation and view of Angels and Archangels, yea euen
the sight of our Lord Iesus Christ, according to that which is
said; Being absent from the body, we are present with the Lord:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:981:65"/>
But the soules of the vnrighteous goe into the places of hell, as

the alone seate of the blessed, according to that sentence
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:981:65"/>
of our Sauiour, contained in the fifth chapter of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
and 8. verse, <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
see God.</hi> On the other side, the same Doctor saith of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the old Testament, <hi>that they which beleeued in
Christ, before hee came in the flesh, haue been saued through
their faith in Christ Iesus.</hi> I could here alleage a sentence of
S. <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen,</hi> (whereby he comforted himselfe
at his brothers death, saying, that he was ascended vp into
heauen, and rested in the bosome of <hi>Abraham</hi>) and many
others to the same effect: but because I will not be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
I will now examine the second point of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which is, that that which Christ teacheth of the rich
Glutton and <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The historie of <hi>Lazarus</hi> is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolicall.</note> is a historie: which wee denie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there are sundry circumstances which shew also that
it is partly a parable. For in that storie we cannot take the
things literally which are recited in them, neither can it
be possible in all that which Christ heretofore did preach
of the rich Glutton and poore <hi>Lazarus;</hi> because Christ
therein attributeth, tongues, fingers, and eyes to the soules
of the departed, which hee doth by a manner of speech,
which is called historicall, but is parabolicall; by which
spirituall things are made cleere by the comparison and
similitude of corporall.<note place="margin">Though <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> should haue heard the complaints of the rich Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not from thence that the Saints heare our prayers.</note> Now although wee shall approue
that which wee haue denied, to wit, that <hi>Abraham</hi> heard
the complaints of the rich man, yet cannot you solidly
conclude from thence, that the departed Saints also doe
heare the prayers of such as liue vpon the face of the earth.
For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> your Doctor describeth the distance which
is between Limbus and Hell in such a sort, as if he had bin
there himselfe to haue measured the one and the other
place, where hee saith, there is betwixt them a great ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
neither more nor lesse then is betweene two places
separated only by the aire, so that from the one part of this
gulfe, one may see and heare what is done in the other. By
this reckoning then the distance is not so great betweene
those places, as it is betweene heauen and earth: seeing
that these two places are shut vp on all sides, and so farre
separated from each other, that it is not possible that the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:981:66"/>
Saints which are in heauen and we which are here beneath
on earth can heare or see each other. Neuerthelesse, to giue
some colour to your opinion, you bring in S. <hi>Austin</hi> vpon
this point, speaking in this manner: <hi>Quid non vident qui
videntem omnia vident? What</hi> (saith he) <hi>doe not the Saints
aboue in heauen see, in seeing him which seeth all things, to wit,
God?</hi> But wherefore haue you not marked that place? is
it not because you dare not openly gainsay those which
attribute these words to S. <hi>Gregory?</hi> But howsoeuer, if they
were his, he forgot himselfe in pronouncing these words:
for albeit that God seeth all things, yet it followeth not
from thence that the Saints which behold God should see
all things likewise. If you should propound such an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Schooles to <hi>Aristotles</hi> disciples, they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
confute you by the like argument, which an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
person might make you of the Sunne, and of vs which
daily doe behold it, to wit, sith that the Sunne, which is the
eye of the world (as Philosophers tearme it) seeth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth
all things which are vnder the cope of heauen,
that wee likewise in beholding the Sunne, should see all
things which are vnder the Sunne.<note place="margin">The Trinitie serueth not as a mirror in heauen, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template all things therein.</note> What man is it that
perceiueth not this consequence to be bad? And if it were
good, yet yours would remaine false &amp; naughtily groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
because wee denie that which you affirme, without
any testimonie of holy Scripture, that is, that God, or the
Trinitie serue as a mirror to the soules of the departed,
thereby to behold all things, as the Sunne and Moone
which are as spectacles to our bodily eyes, to perceiue by
them the things which are represented to our sight. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, it is an easie matter to stop your mouth, and to
shew by the testimonie of Christ and his Apostle in the
sixth chapter of the Reuelation, that the Angels and the
spirits of the departed, though they behold the face of
God, yet they see not, nor know the day and houre of the
last comming of Christ. Moreouer, wee can conuince you
thereof euen by your predecessors, and can proue by their
owne writings, how they taught that the soules of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
see not any thing which is done vpon the earth:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:981:66"/>
for you may see what <hi>Albertus</hi> Bishop of Ratisbone wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
thereof (who was Master to <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin</hi>) in his
booke of our Coniunction with God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Albert</hi> Master vnto <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin,</hi> denieth that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Doctors his successors doe affirme.</note> and 8. chapter: <hi>The
departed Saints</hi> (saith he) <hi>busie not themselues about the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of this world, neither care for the estate thereof, neither
of peace nor warre, neither of faire weather or raine, nor in
summe for any man here below: but are wholly deuoted to one
God, and all of them vnited and employed, to apply and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
themselues to him.</hi> Finally, from the blessed you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to the damned, and as though you had heard their
discourses, and sounded their spirits, you reason without
reason aswell of their knowledge, as of their charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and men suruiuing them: for thus you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
<hi>If the damned doe likewise heare those speake, which
are so farre distant from them, as the rich man heard Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
and shewed himselfe mindfull and carefull for his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
which yet remaine vpon the earth, being afraid left they
should come into the same place of torment where he was, as
you may see in the Gospell by that which he spake vnto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;
should we thinke, that the Saints, and those which are in
the kingdome of heauen see not, or know not what wee doe vpon
the earth?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Charitie is the marke of the children of God, and not of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</note> Poore Diuine that thou art, which vnderstands

in many places, that the zeale and charitie to the glorie
of God, and the desire of our neighbours saluation, are
vertues proper in the fourth degree (as in schooles they
teach it) only to the elect and children of God, and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
found in the damned after this life, which are sworne
enemies against God, and the children of his kingdome. If
then the reprobate are without charity, and are glad to see
many companions of their distresses, as some of your new
Doctors confesse: what a stupiditie is it then in you, not
to consider that Christ (as alreadie we haue touched) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth
to the rich Glutton the care of his brethren by a
parable or similitude, as also the speech of a liuing man,
vsing his tongue and other members of his bodie, which
neuerthelesse was separated by buriall from the soule

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll? I am much more astonied, because
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:981:67"/>
that Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> whom (as it seemeth by your writing)
you haue read, saith expressely of the rich Glutton, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he prayed <hi>Abraham</hi> to send <hi>Lazarus</hi> vnto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
yet <hi>hee knew not what his brethren did, nor what did
then happen to them.</hi> But to beate you with your owne rod,
you present vs a proofe, that the Saints which are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
see vs, because they behold God, who seeth all things.
From whence I argue by the contrarie,<note place="margin">The aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries argument retorted.</note> that forasmuch as
the damned, which are cast into vtter darknesse, see not the
brightnesse of the face of God, therefore they see not a
iot, nor haue any knowledge of our affaires? Afterward
you stirre the pot about, and fall againe into your begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
holding as an article worthie of beleefe, that which
you haue not proued, nor euer can prooue by holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to wit, that the Saints and all blessed soules departed
this life, know the things of this world, and thereupon
you build your argument, which is called in Schooles,
<hi>From the lesse to the greater: If the departed Saints know all
things in this world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bad foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mned; is it possible
that they should not vnderstand the prayers of such as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to be saued? Beside, if the damned themselues (as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by the storie of the rich Glutton) would procure that
there happen no euill to their brethren and friends; will those
which are saued be lesse charitable? will they not aduance as
much as they can, the saluation of their friends and Christian
brethren? and that so much the more, because they see and
heare that men doe seeke vnto them for it?</hi> To speake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
your first argument is no argument, but a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
repetition of the <hi>principij,</hi> that is to say, of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
question which needeth a proofe of better stuffe then
as yet you haue offered to satisfie vs withall. The others
depend on the former, and haue been refuted alreadie. I
will then goe on with the course of your Treatise, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise
you, that neither hee to whom you haue written
your Epistle, not they vnto whom he hath communicated
it to be read and examined, doe giue any beleefe to your
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:981:67"/>
false affirmations, that the Christians are commanded to
inuocate the Saints departed, or that they doe heare their
prayers. Hereupon you propound this question how the
Saints can heare vs and you acknowledge, that to say the
truth this is a hard question to be resolued, but neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
that your doctrine is true. To this point you produce
that which S. <hi>Austin</hi> writeth thereof in his Treatise, <hi>De
cura pro mortuis gerenda, cap. 16. In truth</hi> (saith S. <hi>Austin)
this question surpasseth the force of my vnderstanding, being
vnable to comprehend how and in what manner the Martyrs
helpe those which we certainly know to be helped by them.</hi> I will
here briefly repeate that which heretofore I haue shewne,
to wit, how this sentence of S. <hi>Austins</hi> is contrarie to those
which I haue gathered out of his writings, into which
some since his departure haue maliciously sowne many
tares and wicked seed,<note place="margin">Places suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins.</hi>
               </note> which is the cause that wee hold
this passage in suspition. And though it were S. <hi>Austins,</hi>
yet are we not bound to receiue it, seeing it is contrarie to
the holy Scripture. But to refute you by that very booke
which you attribute to S. <hi>Austin;</hi> answereth not he himself
to this question, whether the Saints departed intermeddle
with our affaires, that hee is of an opinion they doe not?
Doth he not reason in the same manner as we haue reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
afore, to shew that his opinion is grounded in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures? I will here recite his owne words, to the end
the moderate reader may iudge of them:<note place="margin">S. <hi>Austin</hi> doth absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the Saints meddle with our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</note> 
               <hi>Let euery man
take</hi> (saith <hi>Austin) as he will what I shall speake; If the soules
of the departed were present in the businesses of the liuing, and
so that we should see them, they would speake to vs in dreames:
to say nothing of others, my good mother then would not
leaue me one night alone, who for to liue with me, hath followed
me by sea and land. But that which is sung in the Psalme is
true, My father and my mother haue forsaken mee, but the
Lord hath receiued me. If then our fathers haue left vs, how
can they meddle with our affaires? and if our fathers and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
be not present in them, what others of the dead are there
which know the things that we doe, and that which we suffer?
The Prophet Esay saith, Thou art our father, for Abraham
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:981:68"/>
is ignorant of vs, and Israel hath not knowne vs. If these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
were ignorant of that which this people did,<note place="margin">A good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the greater to the lesser.</note> precrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from them; how can the dead busie themselues to succour
the liuing in their actions and affaires? and how could we say
it were well with those which are departed this world, before
the euils which followed their death had happened, if after their
death they should likewise feele the things which come to passe
in the calamities of humane life; or else wee should speake these
things erroneously? and should we hold those to be in rest which
are in paine, because of their suruiuers which haue no repose in
this life? What is that then which God promised to holy King
Iosiah as a great blessing, that he would take him to himselfe by
death, that hee might not see the euils which hee threatned the
people. Behold (saith the Lord) I will gather thee to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">Absurdities that followe, if we should grant that the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted haue to do with our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</note> and thou shalt be put in thy graue in peace, and thine eyes
shall not see all the euill which I will bring vpon this place, and
vpon the inhabitants of the same. The spirits then of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are in that place, where they see not the things which are
done, or which happen in the life of man.</hi> These are the words
of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> which purposely you haue omitted to deceiue
the ignorant, and to take an occasion from an imperfect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation
of his discourse, touching the obscuritie and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
of this matter of rising vp furiously against vs, and
falsely to impose vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, by a great medley of vaine words,
that which we cannot nor will not beleeue with S. <hi>Austin,</hi>
to wit, that this surpasseth the capacitie of our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
For as we beleeue the creation of the world, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
of the holy Trinity, and the resurrection of the flesh,
though we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not mete them by the measure of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
and that because they are plainly taught vs in
the holy Scripture: so when you shall prooue vnto vs, by
expresse tearmes out of the writings of the Prophets, that
the Saints heare vs, and ought to be adored, and called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by vs that are here beneath on earth, then wee will be
obedient to your counsell, and will subscribe in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and reuerence to that article. But what? you would
not that men should rebuke you, nor likewise should
thinke <hi>that you seeke an escape through the bogges:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:981:68"/>
in stead of bringing in some authenticall testimonie
of the Bible, you begin againe to alleage to vs three man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of waies, whereby S. <hi>Austin</hi> (which might erre, and
by his retractations roundly confesseth his errors) thought
that the departed Saints might heare our requests. The
first is, <hi>By the arriuall of those which depart this life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Three preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded meanes of the Papists, whereby the Saints might heare our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> 
               <hi>and goe
from hence to them, who may aduertise them of the things
which happen on earth, and especially of that which concernes
them most.</hi> The second: <hi>By the report of the Angels, which
sometimes mount vp into heauen, and sometimes againe euen
in an instant are about vs.</hi> The third: <hi>By the reuelation of
Gods spirit, which may comport</hi> (I retaine your fine speeches)
<hi>or beare it selfe with the soules of the blessed in heauen, neither
more nor lesse then heretofore it did comport it selfe with the
Prophets on earth, reuealing to them secret things, and that
which should be done a long while after them, as the Scripture
testifieth it.</hi> Whereunto you adde yet a fourth manner of
speech inuented by Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> which is this, <hi>That the
Saints seeing the face of God, see whatsoeuer appertaines to
them in any sort, and consequently heare also our prayers.</hi>
From whence you conclude, <hi>that by the doctrine of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
we may conceiue somewhat how the blessed ones heare vs
when we call vpon them.</hi> We now come to refute this fourth
meane forged out of mens braines, without any ground of
holy Scripture. First I will only aduertise the reader, that
it is not likely this sentence (to wit,<note place="margin">There is no likelihood that S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> took pleasure in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> 
               <hi>that the departed Saints
beholding the face of God doe see all things</hi>) was forged by S.
<hi>Gregorie,</hi> seeing in the same chapter that you haue allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in your Epistle, he saith the contrarie, to wit, <hi>that as
they which are liuing know not the estate of soules departed; so
likewise is vnknowne vnto the dead the manner of life, which
those leade that remaine after them in the flesh. For the life</hi>
(saith he) <hi>of the spirit is farre different from the life of the
flesh, and as things corporall and spirituall are differing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so are they likewise in knowledge.</hi> Now it resteth that
we should examine those three former waies of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
knowledge which you attribute to the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
I answere then to the first, that nothing is written
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:981:69"/>
thereof by the ancient Prophets, nor Apostles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee are not bound to beleeue it. Moreouer, it often
happeneth that the citizens which dwel in one citie know
not the affaires of one another; how can they then after
their departure declare them to the soules of the blessed
which they finde in heauen?<note place="margin">The examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those three meanes abouesaid, of the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our prayers.</note> Besides, there are many which
in praying cast their eyes vp towards heauen, whilest none
of their neighbours happen to decease; who is it then that
should doe their message to the Saints departed? And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
if so be there should be at that instant some
one ready to die when one prayeth, and to carry the newes
to heauen; what man among you can shew me by diuine
scripture, that God hath enioyned to him that speciall
charge? not one. Or if you would that one should approue
your first manner, you necessarily must grant me that there
is no Purgatory. For if that soules must passe through Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
and stay there for some time, according to the
number of Masses, which are caused to be said for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance;
how can it be possible for them to aduertise in
time the departed Saints of the prayers which were made
vnto them so long before?</p>
            <p>Your second and third meanes are of no more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
then the others, because it is neither written in the old
Testament nor in the new, that the departed Saints know
our necessities by the report of the Angels, neither that
God indueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saints after their departure with the spirit
of prophecie and reuelation, as at sometimes hee did to his
holy seruants, according as the necessitie did require, to
make them capable of their extraordinarie calling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he had called them.</p>
            <p>Now followeth your last argument, which you your
selfe calles least of all, and that for a good reason. For you
number vp many of the Fathers, which haue inuocated the
Saints departed, and afterward you close vp your Epistle
with flouts against the Ministers of the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
But whatsoeuer you heape vp against them is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
winde and smoake, yea dung in respect of the puritie and
excellencie of the word of Iesus Christ and his Apostles,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:981:69"/>
which we had rather follow then that of men, for we haue
no certaine testimonie that their doctrine was diuinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
as we haue of the Prophets and Apostles, and that
these men of God were not led by a humane wil, but were
moued thereunto by the spirit of our principall Pastor and
Bishop Iesus Christ: in whose name I admonish you no
more to protest so lightly, before God his Father, that
whatsoeuer you haue said, tendeth to his honour, and the
saluation of him, to whom you haue sent your Epistle
most preiudiciall and contrarie to the glorie of God, and
the repose of the true members of Iesus Christ; vnto
whom I pray to giue me his grace constantly to maintaine
his pure truth, and to accompanie this mine answere with
the vertue of his holie Spirit, to the end that thereby hee
may moue your heart to conceiue your errors, and to
renounce them, for the aduancement of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
the acquitting of your conscience,
and the augmentation of his
kingdome.</p>
