         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

NEW LETTER
FROM
WINDSOR,
FROM
A Perſon of Quality,
TO HIS
Friend and Correſpondent at LONDON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough it be a Matter of
vaſt Moment, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Conſequence to Rule
well, and know how to
diſpoſe the Reins of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ſo juſtly to the Subjects
Tempers, that neither the Mild be caſt
down, and trambled on, nor the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
and Turbulent, through too much
Remiſneſs, become Inſolent; the <hi>Loyal</hi>
not diſcouraged, nor the Factious have
Reaſon to rejoyce: A Task, which
none but ſuch to whom Nature hath
given Underſtandings equal to the high
Dignity, to which they are Born: ſuch
I mean, whom Providence thinks Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be its Vicegerents on Earth, are
able to undertake, much leſs perform;
Though I ſay, that <hi>Qui bene gubernat eſt
Deo ſimilimus,</hi> He that Rules well, is
the Trueſt Image of his Maker; And
Conſequently, it may be thought an
unpardonable Arrogance in me, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to meddle in a Matter as far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Capacity of a Subject, as is
the Almighty KING of Heaven above
his <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> amongſt Us; yet is not
any Man debar'd from declaring his
Sentiments in ſuch a caſe, ſo far as he
neither pretends to Inſtruct his Prince,
nor by prying into his <hi>Cabinet-Council,</hi>
betray the Failings, or Derogate from
the Authority of his Royal-Maſter,
which has of late been the Deplorable
Effect of too too many <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> whoſe
Authors purpoſe, if truly Search't in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
was only to ſpread <hi>Sedition,</hi> and
foment <hi>Rebellion;</hi> a thing ſo different
from my Principles, that I had much
rather deſiſt from an Enterprize Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
hazardous, than either in <hi>Thought,
Word,</hi> or <hi>Deed,</hi> injure my <hi>King,</hi> were
He the worſt of Tyrants, much leſs the
preſent KING in whom concenter all
thoſe Vertues that Compound a <hi>Good,
Pious, Just,</hi> and <hi>Merciful Prince;</hi> and
make Him almoſt an Object of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
to all His Subjects that do not
look upon him with Malicious, and
(though Unjuſtly ſo) a Diſaffected Eye.
However, in this Juncture of Affairs,
when the KING's Prerogative ſeems
on all ſides to be forgotten; and the
Liberty, and Property of the Subjects,
becomes the Chief Buſineſs of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
I think it the part of not only
every <hi>Loyal</hi> Subject, but of all that can
pretend either by Birth or Nature to be
<hi>Engliſh</hi>-Men, to Vindicate their Prince,
under whoſe Gracious Government,
they enjoy all that either Subjects can
Modeſtly require, or a <hi>King</hi> without
Derogating from His Authority can
Grant. Yet has it been the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of not a few Malignants to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
into the Minds of the Ignorant,
Unſteady People, a diſliking of the
preſent Government, perſwading them
that <hi>Arbitrary-Power</hi> is breaking in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and that unleſs they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtand up in Defence of their Juſt
Priviledges, they will be for ever Sold
to Slavery and Popery; two things as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101685:2"/>
generally Abominated by the Vulgar,
as the Thoughts of an Inquiſition; and
I dare Aver as far from the KING's
Intentions, as the introducing of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometaniſm.</hi>
But however, the KING
is extreamly Oblig'd to them for their
good Will, in taking ſuch great Care
of His Perſon; and for their unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Zeal to make Him a Glorious
Prince: But, How do they ſet about
it? Even by Alienating the Hearts of
His Subjects from Him; and by Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
their unthinking Heads, with
Groundleſs Jealouſies of mighty Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
from whence they know not;
but, Who can be Ignorant that this is
the ready way to make Him like His
Bleſſed Father, a Glorious <hi>Martyr</hi> in
this, and a <hi>King</hi> Triumphant in the
other World? For they need but Cry
out againſt <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> and
the Buſineſs is more than half Effected;
Cry but <hi>Liberty, Liberty,</hi> and their
needs no Drums or Trumpets to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm
them; for then they'l Swarm like
Bees to the Banner of the <hi>Good Old
Cauſe:</hi> nor ſhall they need Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Fight the Lord's Battel; for
there ſhall Ariſe in the Camp, Men
that from the Pulpit ſhall Juſtify their
Proceedings, and by Inſpiration (no
matter whether it be from Heaven or
Hell) tell 'em 'tis Meritorious to Fight
againſt, nay, to Depoſe Tyrants: a
Principle ſo near a Kin to that bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<hi>Popery,</hi> that nought but their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and Illiterateneſs can Teſtify,
that they were not brought up at St.
<hi>Omers,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Popiſh</hi> Seminary.
And when Matters are brought to this
Head, when the Vulgar are Run Mad
with Devotion; 'twill be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to reduce them to their Right
Sence of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance:</hi> And
when their Minds are Fermented in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Lump of Rebellion, nought but
the Mill of Oppreſſion under a Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> can reſtore
them to their firſt Purity. But Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
be Prais'd, things are not yet grown
ſo Deſperate, but that by Applying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Remedies, the KING may Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Prerogative, and the Subjects
not loſe their Priviledges; a Cure that
can be perform'd by none, but a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
Sober <hi>Parliament;</hi> and ſuch
it lyes in the Peoples Breaſt to Chooſe,
as neither prefer their own Priviledges
ſo high, as to over-power your Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to their <hi>King</hi>'s Prerogative.</p>
            <p>We have been now near <hi>Three</hi>
Years under the Sence of a <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi>
which has poſſeſt the People with ſo
panick a Fear of the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi>
that they have almoſt forgot the <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,</hi>
and to the greater Amazement
of the World: At laſt, when every
one ſeem'd ſo well Satisfied with the
Truth of it, that none durſt diſtruſt it;
that Party which ſeem'd moſt to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
the full Diſcovery of it, and did
with ſo great Zeal Perſecute the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in it even to Death, are found
<hi>Com-Plotters;</hi> and I doubt, are as deep
in the Mire, as the other in the Mudd;
for it has been the continual Practice
of ſome of no low Degrees, to Hunt
with the Hound, and Run with the
Hare, one of whom has often ſerv'd
as many purpoſes as he Looks ways at
once. But I ſhall leave the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of that, to Providence and Time,
when no doubt the People will be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
that ſtriving to avoid <hi>Scylla</hi> on
the one ſide, they run into <hi>Charybdis</hi> on
the other; that ſhunning <hi>Popery</hi> on that
hand, they betray themſelves to the
greedy Jaws of <hi>Phanaticiſm</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
whoſe <hi>Proſelites</hi> (not to abuſe the
Scripture Phraiſe) compaſs Heaven and
Earth to Create new Ones, whom when
they have Gain'd, they make <hi>Ten</hi> times
more the Children of Hell, than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and I hope, when the Curtain
is drawn from before their Eyes, they
will clearly See how they have Liv'd
almoſt in <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſs, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted
with Ignorance, have been
Led into the Paths of Eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>Having now purſu'd my purpoſe,
as far as I believe my Readers Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
will hold out; I ſhall ſet down
this, as an undeniable Maxim, That
<hi>Loyalty,</hi> and <hi>Honeſty</hi> is alwayes the beſt
Policy; and they that make theſe the
<hi>Pole-Star</hi> of their Courſe, ſhall never
Split on the Rocks of Damnable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
            <p>Thus having given you in Short my
Opinion, I remain in all Candour and
Sincerity,</p>
