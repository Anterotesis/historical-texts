         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Luke.</hi> 13. 24. And ſince many who have good
ground of claim to Chriſt, are not eſtabliſhed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of his favour, but remain in the dark, without
comfort, heſitating concerning the reality of godlineſs
in themſelves, and ſpeaking a little to the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Religion to others, eſpecially in the time of their
ſtraits, I ſhall ſpeak a little to two things of greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.
The one is, <hi>How a perſon ſhall know if he
hath a true and ſpecial intereſt in Chriſt, and whether he
doth lay juſt claim to Gods favour and ſalvation?</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, <hi>In caſe a perſon fall ſhort in the foreſaid tryal,
what courſe he ſhall take for making ſure Gods friendſhip
and ſalvation to himſelf?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. How ſhall a man know if he hath a true and
ſpecial intereſt in Chriſt, and whether he hath or may lay
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>laim juſtly to Gods favour and ſalvation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Before we ſpeak directly to the Queſtion,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhall premiſe ſome things to make way for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As Firſt,</hi> That a mans intereſt in Chriſt, or graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
ſtate, may be known, and that with more certainty than
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34737:6"/>
               <hi>people do conjecture; yea, and the knowledg of it may be
more eaſily attained unto than many do imagine:</hi> For not
only hath the Lord commanded men to know their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in him, as a thing attainable, 2. <hi>Cor. 13. 5. 2 Pet.</hi>
1. 10. But many of the Saints have attained unto the
clear perſwaſion of their intereſt in Chriſt, and in God,
as their own God; How often do they call him their God
and their portion; and how perſwaded is <hi>Paul,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can ſeperate him from the love of God? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
38, 39. Therefore the knowledg of a mans gracious
ſtate is attainable: and this knowledge of it, which may
be attained, is no fancy and bare conceit, but it is moſt
ſure: <hi>Doubtleſs thou art our Father,</hi> ſaith the Prophet
in name of the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23. 16. It is clear thus; 1.
That can be no fancy, but a very ſure knowledg, which
doth yeild to a rational man comfort in moſt real ſtraits:
But ſo doth this, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. when the people ſpake
of ſtoning <hi>David,</hi> he encouraged himſelf in the Lord his
God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. 6. he ſaith there, <hi>he will not be afraid of
ten thouſand that riſe againſt him.</hi> Compare theſe words
with ver. 3. of that Pſalm, <hi>Pſal. 27. 1, 3. Although
an hoſt encamp againſt him, he is confident in this.</hi> 2. That
is a ſure knowledg of a thing, which maketh a wiſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
ſell all he hath that he may keep it ſure, that mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a man forgo children, lands, life, and ſuffer the ſpoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all joyfully: But ſo doth this <hi>Mat. 13. 44. Mar.</hi>
1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 28, 29 <hi>Heb. 10. 34. Rom. 5. Act.</hi> 5. 41. (13)
That muſt be a ſure and certain knowledg, and no fancy,
whereupon a man voluntarily and freely doth adventure
his ſoul, when he is ſtepping into eternity with this word
in his mouth, <hi>This is all my deſire.</hi> But ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 5. And again, Not only may a
godly man come to the ſure knowledge of his gracious
ſtate, but it is more eaſily attainable than many do appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend:
for (ſuppoſing what ſhall be afterwards proved,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34737:6"/>
that a man may know the gracious work of Gods Spirit
in himſelf) if he will but argue rationally from thence he
ſhall be forced to conclude his intereſt in Chriſt unleſs he
deny clear Scripture truths. I ſhall only make uſe of one
here, becauſe we are to ſpeak more directly to this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
A godly man may argue thus: whoſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Chriſt, are juſtly reputed the Children of God,
<hi>John</hi> 1. 12. But I have received Chriſt all the wayes
which the Word there can import: for, I am well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the device, or way of ſalvation by Chriſt, I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to the terms; I welcom the offer of Chriſt in all his
offices, as a King to rule over me, as a Prieſt to offer and
intercede for me, as a Prophet to teach me; I lay out
my heart for Him and towards Him, reſting on Him, as I
am able; what elſe can be meant by the word <hi>receiving?</hi>
Therefore may I ſay and conclude plainly and warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
I am juſtly to reckon my ſelf Gods child according
to the aforeſaid Scripture, which cannot fail.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be premiſed is, <hi>That a man be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
in Covenant with God, is a matter of higheſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi>
it is his life, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 47. and yet very few
have or ſeek after a ſaving intereſt in the Covenant:
and many fooliſhly think they have ſuch a thing without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſolid ground, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 14. few find or walk in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
way. This ſhould alarm people to be ſerious about
the matter, ſince it is of ſo great conſequence to be in
Chriſt, and ſince there be but few that may lay juſt claim
to him, and yet many do fooliſhly fancy an intereſt in him,
who are deceived by a falſe confidence, as the fooliſh
Virgins do, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>The third thing to be premiſed, is, <hi>Men muſt reſolve to
be determined by Scripture, in this matter of their intereſt in
Chriſt.</hi> The Spirit ſpeaking in the Scripture, is judge of
all Controverſies (<hi>Iſa. 8. 20. To the law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and it ſpeak not according to theſe, there is no truth in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34737:7"/>
it</hi>) and of this alſo, whether a man be ſavingly in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God, or not. Therefore do not mock God
whilſt you ſeem to ſearch after ſuch a thing. If we prove
from Scripture (which is the uncontroverted rule) that
you are gracious, and have ſtricken Covenant ſavingly
with God, then reſolve to grant ſo much as to acquieſce
in it, and if the contrary appear, let there be a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the controverſie; elſe you do but mock the Lord,
and ſo <hi>your bonds ſhall be made ſtrong,</hi> Iſa. 28. 22. for,
<hi>a jot of his Word cannot fail,</hi> Mat. 5. 18. Therefore ſeek
eye ſalve from Chriſt to judge of things, according as the
word of God ſhall diſcover them to be.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing to be premiſed, <hi>is, although the matter
of a mans intereſt in Chriſt be of ſo great importance, and the
way to attain to the knowledge of it, ſo plainly held forth in
the Scriptures, yet there be but few who reach the diſtinct
knowledge of it;</hi> And that this may not diſcourage any
perſon from attempting it, I ſhall hint ſome few reaſons,
why ſo few come to the clear knowledge of it, which will
alſo prepare the way for what is to be ſpoken afterwards.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing which doth hinder many from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their intereſt in Chriſt, is, <hi>their ignorance of ſome
ſpecial principles of Religion:</hi> as, 1. That it was free love
in Gods boſome, and nothing in man, that moved him to
ſend a Saviour to perfect the work of Redemption. Joh.
3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he ſent, &amp;c.</hi> Men are
ſtill ſeeking ſome ground for that buſineſs in themſelves,
which leads away from ſuitable and high apprehenſions of
the firſt ſpring and riſe of Gods Covenant-favour to his
people, which hath no reaſon, cauſe, or motive in us, and
ſo they cannot come to the knowledg of their intereſt. 2.
They are ignorant how that love doth effectually diſcover
it ſelf to a mans heart, ſo as he hath ground to lay claim
to it, <hi>viz.</hi> That ordinarily it doth firſt diſcover his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſtate in himſelf becauſe of ſin and corruption defiling
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34737:7"/>
the whole man, and any thing in him that might be called
a righteouſneſs; <hi>all theſe things are loſs and dung,</hi> Phil.
3. 6, 7, Secondly, It diſcovereth Chriſt as the full and
ſatisfying treaſure above all things. The man finds a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
for which, with joy, he ſelleth all, <hi>&amp;c. Mat.</hi> 13.
44, 46. Thirdly, it determineth the heart, and cauſeth
it to approach unto a living God in the ordinances, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
65. 4. and cauſeth the heart to wait upon him, and him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
62. 5. <hi>My ſoul, wait thou only upon God.</hi> Thus, having
dropped in the ſeed of God in the heart, and formed Chriſt
there, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. The heart is changed and made new in
the aforeſaid work, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. and Gods Law is ſo ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the heart in that change, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. that the whole
yoak of Chriſt is commended to the man without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12. 16. The Law is acknowledged good, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
juſt and ſpiritual: upon all which, from that new
principle of life, there flow out acts of a new life, (Gal.
5. 6. <hi>Faith worketh by love,</hi> Rom. 6. 18, 22. and the man
becometh a ſervant of righteouſneſs and unto God) which
doth eſpecially appear in the ſpirituality of worſhip, (<hi>Joh.</hi>
4. 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. men then ſerve God in ſpirit, and truth,
and in the newneſs of the Spirit, and not in the oldneſs of
the letter) and tenderneſs in all manner of converſation;
The man then exerciſeth himſelf how to keep a conſcience
void of offence, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 24. 16. Now, this way doth the
love, God diſcover it ſelf unto man, and acteth on him, ſo as
he hath ground of laying ſome good claim to it; ſo as he
may juſtly think, that the love which ſent a Saviour, had
reſpect to ſuch a man as hath found theſe things made out
unto him. Surely, Ignorance of this doth hinder many
from the knowledge of their intereſt in Chriſt, for if a man
know not how God worketh with a perſon, ſo as he may
juſtly lay claim to his love, which was from eternity, he
will wander in the dark, and not come to the knowledge
of an intereſt in him. 3. Many are alſo ignorant of this,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34737:8"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:34737:8"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:34737:9"/>
That God alone is the hope of his people; he is called <hi>the
hope of Iſrael,</hi> Jer. 14. 8. Although inherent quallifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are evidences of it; yet the ſtaying of the heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him as a full bleſſing and ſatisfying portion, is faith
(1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. the faith and hope muſt be in God) and
the only proper condition which giveth right to the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bleſſings of the Covenant, Rom. 4. 5. <hi>To him that
worketh not, but believeth, faith is imputed for righteouſneſs.</hi>
Indeed if any perſon take liberty here, and turn grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
wantonneſs, there is, without doubt, in ſo far a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
ſince there is mercy with him, upon condition,
that it conciliate fear to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 14. Yea,
hardly can any man, who hath found the foreſaid expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Gods love made out upon him, make a cloak of
the Covenant for ſinful liberty without ſome meaſure of
a ſpiritual conflict: In this reſpect he that is born of God,
doth not ſin; and he who doth ſo ſin, hath not ſeen God,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 6, 9. I ſay, God is the hope of his people,
and not their own holineſs. If they intend honeſtly, and
long ſeriouſly to be like unto him, many failings ſhould
not weaken their hope and confidence: for, it is in him
who changeth not, <hi>Mal. 3. 6. And if any man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
he hath an Advocate,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1. Now, when
men place their hope in any other thing beſide the Lord,
it is no wonder they be kept in a ſtaggering condition, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the changes of the thing which they make the
ground of their hope, ſince they give not to God the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
due to his Name, and which he will not give unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
compare, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 10. (<hi>They who know thy Name,
will put their truſt in thee</hi>) with <hi>Iſa. 42. 9. My glory will
I not give to another: I am the Lord, that is my Name.</hi> 4.
Many are ignorant of the different wayes and degrees of
Gods working with his people, and it doth much darken
their knowledge and reflex acts of their intereſt in him.
This ignorance doth run mainly on three heads (1.) They
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34737:9"/>
are ignorant of the different degrees and ways of that
Law-work which ordinarily dealeth with men, and of the
different way how the Lord bringeth home people at firſt to
Chriſt. They conſider not that the Jaylor is not kept an
hour in bondage, <hi>Acts 16. Paul</hi> is kept in ſuſpence three
days, <hi>Acts 9. Zacheus</hi> not one moment, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. (2.)
They are ignorant of, or at leaſt do not conſider, how
different the degrees of Sanctification are in the Saints,
and the honourable appearings thereof before men in
ſome, and the ſad blemiſhing thereof in others: Some,
are very blameleſs, and more free of groſs outbreakings,
adorning their profeſſion much, as <hi>Job, Job 1. and
Zachariah, Luke</hi> 1. Thoſe are ſaid to be perfect, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all the Commandements of God. Others were
ſubject to very groſs and ſad evils, as <hi>Solomon, Aſa,
&amp;c.</hi> (3.) They are ignorant of the different commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
of Gods face, and expreſſion of his preſence.
Some do walk much in the Light of Gods countenance,
and are much in ſenſible fellowſhip with Him, as <hi>David</hi>
was; others are all their days kept in bondage through
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 25. Surely the ignorance of the
different ways of God's working and dealing with his
people, doth very much darken the knowledge of their
Intereſt in him, whilſt they uſually ſtint the Lord to one
way of working, which he doth not keep, as we have
ſhewed in the former examples.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing which doth darken men about their
intereſt in Chriſt, is, <hi>There is one thing or other, wherein
their heart in ſome reſpect, doth condemn them, as dealing
deceitfully and guilefully with God.</hi> It is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that theſe can come to clearneſs about their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
whoſe heart doth condemn them for keeping up
ſome known tranſgreſſion againſt the Lord; which they
will not let go, neither are uſing the means which they
know to be appointed by God for delivering them from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34737:10"/>
it; neither can theſe come to clearneſs, who know
ſome poſitive duty commanded them in their ſtations,
which they deceitfully ſhift and ſhun, not cloſing cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with it, or not willing to be led into it. Theſe
are alſo, in ſome reſpect, condemned of their own heart,
as the former ſort; and in that caſe it is difficult to come
to a diſtinct knowledge of their ſtate. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 21.
it is ſuppoſed there, that a ſelf-condemning heart maketh
void a mans confidence proportionally before God. I
do not deny but that men may, on good grounds, plead
an intereſt in Chriſt, in the caſe of prevailing iniquity,
<hi>Pſal. 65. 3. Rom.</hi> 7. 23, 25. but it is hard to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if at all attainable, when the heart is dealing
deceitfully, and entertaining known guile in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:
Therefore let people clear themſelves of the
particular which they know too well. It is the thing
which doth meet them, marring their confidence and
acceſs in all their approaches unto God. See <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.
10, 13. The Idolatries of the people are caſt up to
them by the Lord, and their ſuit rejected thereupon.
That which draweth away the heart firſt in the morning,
and laſt at night; like an Oven heated at night, and it
burneth as a flaming fire in the Morning, ſpoken of the
wicked, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 6. And taketh up their thoughts often
on their bed, as it is ſaid of ſome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 4. That
which doth lead away the heart in time of religious duty
ordinarily, and the remembrance of which hath power
to enliven and quicken the Spirits, more than the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of God, ſo as their heart is after the heart of
ſome deteſtable thing. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 21. That which
withſtandeth men when they would lay hold on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
as God caſteth up mens ſins to them who were
medling with his Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16, 17. That
is the thing which doth marr the knowledge of a
gracious ſtate, let it go, and it will be more eaſie
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34737:10"/>
to reach the knowledge of an intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The third thing which hindreth the knowledge of an
intereſt in Chriſt, <hi>is a ſpirit of ſloth and careleſs negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in many.</hi> They complain that they know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be in Chriſt or not; but, as few take pains to
be in him, ſo few take pains to try if they be in him.
It is a work and buſineſs which cannot be done ſleeping,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. The ſeveral words uſed there, <hi>viz. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine,
prove, know,</hi> ſay that there is a labour in it;
diligence muſt be uſed to make our calling and election
ſure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. it is a buſineſs above fleſh and blood;
The holy anointing, which teacheth all things, muſt make
us know the things Freely given us of God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.
12. Shall the Lord impart a buſineſs of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
and not ſo much as be enquired after to do it
for men? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. Be aſhamed you who ſpend
ſo much time in reading Romances, in adorning your
perſons, in hawking, and hunting, in conſulting the
Law, concerning your outward ſtate in the World, and
it may be, in worſe things than thoſe: Be aſhamed that
you ſpend ſo little time in the ſearch of this, whether
you be an heir of Glory or not; whether you be in the
way that leadeth to Heaven, or that which will land
you in darkneſs for ever. You who judge this below
you, and unworthy of your pains, any part or minute of
your time, it is like in Gods account, you have judged
your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, ſo as you have
no lot with Gods people in this matter.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing that doth darken the knowledge of
intereſt in Chriſt, is, <hi>men do not condeſcend upon what
would ſatisfie them;</hi> but complain that God will not
ſhew unto them what he is about to do with them; but
cannot yet ſay they know what would ſatisfie concerning
his purpoſe: this is a ſad thing. Shall we think thoſe
are ſerious, who have never as yet, pitched on what
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34737:11"/>
would ſatisfie them, nor are making earneſt enquiry
after what ſhould ſatisfie? If the Lord had left us in
the dark in that matter, we were leſs inexcuſable: but
ſince the grounds of ſatisfaction and the true marks of
intereſt in Chriſt, are ſo clear and frequent in Scripture,
and ſo many things written that our joy may be full, 1
<hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 4. and that thoſe who believe may know that
they have eternal life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 13. and ſince he that
believeth hath a Witneſs of it in himſelf, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10.
none can pretend excuſe here. We may not here inſiſt
to ſhew what may and ſhould ſatisfie concerning
our intereſt, ſince we are to ſpeak directly to it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>The fifth thing that helpeth much to keep men in the
dark, concerning their intereſt in Chriſt, is, <hi>they pitch upon
ſome mutable grounds,</hi> which are not ſo appoſite proofs
of the truths of an intereſt in Chriſt, as of the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtate of a triumphing ſoul ſailing before the wind,
and marks, which I grant are precious in themſelves,
and do make out an intereſt clearly where they are;
Yet they are ſuch, as without them, an intereſt in Chriſt
may be, and be known alſo in a good meaſure. We
ſhall touch a few of them. 1. Some think that all who
have a true intereſt in him are above the prevailing power
of every ſin. But this is contrary to that of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 3.
where we find that holy man laying juſt claim to pardon,
in the caſe of prevailing iniquity; and that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.
23, 24, 25. where <hi>Paul</hi> thanketh God through Chriſt, as
freed from the condemnation of the. Law, even whilſt a
law in his <hi>members</hi> leads him captive unto <hi>ſin.</hi> 2. Some
think that all true Saints have conſtantly acceſs unto
God in prayer, and ſenſible returns of Prayer at all
times. But this is contrary to the many ſad exerciſes of
God's people, complaining often, that they are not heard
nor regarded of God. <hi>Pſal. 13. 1. and</hi> 22. 1, 2. (3.)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34737:11"/>
Some think, that all who have any true intereſt in him
have God witneſſing the ſame unto them by a high opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that witneſſing ſpirit of his, ſpoken of <hi>Romans</hi>
8. 16. (whereof afterwards) and ſo they ſtill ſuſpect
their own intereſt in Chriſt, becauſe of the want of this.
But they do not remember that they muſt firſt believe, and
give credit to that record, which God hath given to his
Son, that there is life enough in him for men, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.
10, 11. and then look for the ſeal and witneſs of the
ſpirit, <hi>Eph. 1. 13. In whom after ye believed ye were
ſealed with the holy ſpirit of promiſe, &amp;c.</hi> As long as peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
hold faſt theſe principles and the like, they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come to the knowledge of their gracious ſtate, (which
God hath warranted people to prove and clear up to
themſelves) otherways than by the aforeſaid things.</p>
            <p>The fifth thing to be premiſed, is, The removal of
ſome miſtakes, whereunto people may readily run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
when we are about to prove their intereſt in
Chriſt. As, 1. It is a miſtake to think, that every
one who is in Chriſt, doth know that he is in Him. For
many are truly gracious, and have a good title to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life, who do not know ſo much, until it be made
out afterwards, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 13, Theſe things are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to believers, that they may know they have a true
title to eternal life; that is, that they may know they
are believers, and ſo it is ſuppoſed they knew it not
before. 2. It is a miſtake to think, that all who come
to the knowledge of their intereſt in Chriſt, do attain
an equal certainty about the ſame: One may ſay, he is
perſwaded, nothing preſent or to come, can ſeperate
him from the love of God, <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 8. 38. Another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
but this length, <hi>I believe, help mine unbelief,</hi> Mar.
9. 24. 3. It is a miſtake to think, that every one who
attaineth to a ſtrong perſwaſion of his intereſt, doth
always hold there; for he who to day may ſay of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34737:12"/>
Lord, <hi>He is his refuge,</hi> Pſal. 21. 2. and <hi>kis portion,</hi>
Pſal. 119. 57. will at another time ſay, <hi>he is cut off,</hi>
Pſal. 31. 22. and will ask, if the truth of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<hi>doth fail for evermore?</hi> Pſal. 77. 7, 8, 9. 4. It
is alſo a miſtake to think, that every one who doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a good knowledge of their gracious ſtate, can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
anſwer all objections made to the contrary;
But yet they may hold faſt the concluſion, and ſay, <hi>I
know whom I have believed,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 12. There be
few grounds of Chriſtian Religion, whereof many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are ſo perſwaded, as that they are able to maintain
them formally againſt all arguments brought to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and yet they may and will hold the concluſion
ſtedfaſtly and juſtly: So it is in this caſe in hand. It
is no leſs a miſtake to imagine, that the vain, groundleſs
confidence which many prophane, ignorant Atheiſts do
maintain, is this knowledge of an intereſt in Chriſt
which we plead for; Many do falſly avouch him to be
their Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 41. and many look for Heaven,
who will be beguiled with thoſe fooliſh <hi>Virgins, Mat.</hi>
25. 12. Yet we muſt not think, becauſe of this, that
all knowledge of intereſt is a deluſion and fancy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
theſe fools be deceived: for whilſt thouſands
are deluded, ſome can ſay on good and ſolid grounds;
<hi>We know that we are of God, and that the whole world
lyeth in wickedneſs,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 19.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed theſe things, it now followeth, that
we give ſome marks by which a man may know if he be
ſavingly in Covenant with God, and hath a ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in Chriſt, ſo as he may warrantably lay claim to
Gods favour and ſalvation. We ſhall only pitch upon
two great and principal marks, not willing to trouble
people with many. And before we fall upon theſe, we
will ſpeak of a preparatory work of the Law, whereof
the Lord doth ordinarily make uſe, to prepare his own
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34737:12"/>
way in mens ſouls. This may have its own weight, as
a mark, with ſome perſons. It is called the work of
the Law, or, the work of humiliation. It hath ſome
proportion to that ſpirit of bondage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. and
doth now under the New Teſtament anſwer unto it, and
uſually leadeth on to the Spirit of adoption. Only here
let it be remembred, 1. That we are not to ſpeak of
this preparatory work of the Law, as a negative mark
of true intereſt in Chriſt, as if none might lay claim to
Gods favour, who hath not had this preparatory work
in the ſeveral ſteps of it, as we are to ſpeak of it; for,
as we ſhall hear, the Lord doth not always keep that
path with men. 2. The great reaſon why we ſpeak of
it, is, becauſe the Lord dealeth with many (whom he
doth effectually call) by ſome ſuch preparatory work.
And to thoſe, who have been ſo dealt with, it may
prove ſtrengthning, and will confirm them in laying the
more weight on the marks which follow. 3. It may
help to encourage others, who are under ſuch bondage
of ſpirit, as a good prognoſtick of a gracious work to
follow: for as we ſhall circumſtantiate it, it will be
rarely found to miſcarry, and fail of a gracious iſſue.
4. Where God uſeth ſuch a preparatory work, he doth
not keep one way or meaſure in it, as we ſhall hear.</p>
            <p>For the more diſtinct handling of this preparatory
work, we ſhall ſhortly hint the moſt ordinary ways,
by which the Lord leadeth people into the Covenant
ſavingly, and draweth them unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>There are ſome called from the Womb, as John</hi>
the Baptiſt was, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 41, 44, or, in their very
young years, before they can be deeply engaged active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Satans ways, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. It cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that thoſe have ſuch a preparatory work as we
are to ſpeak of. And becauſe ſome perſons may pretend
to this way of e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ectual calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we offer theſe marks of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34737:13"/>
it, whereby thoſe who have been ſo called may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
(1.) Such uſe from their Childhood to be kept free
of ordinary pollutions, wherewith Children uſually are
defiled; as ſwearing, lying, mocking of Religion, and
religious perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe whom God calleth effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
he ſanctifieth them from the time of that effectual
calling: Sin cannot have dominion over them as over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
becauſe they are under grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. (2.)
Religion is, as it were, natural to them; I mean, they
need not be much preſſed to religious duties, even when
they are but children; They willingly run that way,
becauſe there is an inward principle, of love conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. ſo as they yield themſelves ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of righteouſneſs, without outward conſtraint, <hi>Rom.</hi>
6. 16. (3.) Although ſuch know not when they were
firſt acquainted with God, yet afterwards they have ſuch
exerciſes of ſpirit befalling, as the Saints in Scripture
(of whoſe firſt converſion we hear not) do ſpeak of. They
are ſhut out from God upon ſome occaſion now and then,
and are admitted to come nearer again, (to their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.)
Their heart is alſo further broken up by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
as is ſaid of <hi>Lydia,</hi> Act. 16. 14. and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
they do remember, when ſome ſpecial piece of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Duty, or when ſome ſin, of which they were
not taking notice before, was diſcovered to them. They
who can apply theſe things to themſelves, have much to
ſay for their effectual calling from their youth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Some are brought in to Chriſt in a ſoveraign
Goſpel way:</hi> when the Lord, by ſome few words of love
ſwallowing up any Law-work, quickly taketh a perſon
priſoner at the firſt, as he did <hi>Zacheus, Luke.</hi> 19. and
others, who upon a word ſpoken by Chriſt, did leave all
and follow him; and we hear no noiſe of a Law-work
dealing with them before they cloſe with Chriſt Jeſus.
And becauſe ſome pretend to this way of calling, we ſhall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34737:13"/>
touch ſome things moſt remarkable in that tranſaction
with <hi>Zacheus,</hi> for clearing and confirmation. 1. He had
ſome deſire to ſee Chriſt, and ſuch a deſire, as made him
wave that which ſome would have judged prudence and
diſcretion, whileſt he climbeth up upon a tree that he
might ſee him. 2. Chriſt ſpake to his heart, and that word
took ſuch hold upon him, that preſently with joy he did
accept of Chriſt's offer, and cloſed with Chriſt as Lord,
whileſt few of any note were following him. 3. Upon
this his heart did open to the poor, although it ſeems, he
was a covetous man before. 4. He had a due impreſſion
of his former wayes, evidencing his reſpect to <hi>Moſes</hi> his
Law; and this he did ſignifie before all the company then
preſent, not caring to ſhame himſelf in ſuch things as
(probably) were not known to the World. 5. Upon
all theſe things, Chriſt confirmeth and ratifieth the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
by his word, recommending to him that oneneſs of
intereſt, which behoved to be between him and the Saints,
and the thoughts of his own loſt condition, if Chriſt had
not come and ſought him, and found him: All which
are clear, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 3,—10. We grant, the
Lord calleth ſome ſo; and if any can lay claim to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
things we have now hinted, they have a good confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Gods dealing with them from that Scripture;
Neither are they to vex themſelves becauſe of the want of
a diſtinct preparatory Law-work if their heart have yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto Chriſt. For, a Law work is not deſirable except
for this end. Therefore Chriſt doth offer himſelf directly
in the Scripture, and people are invited to come to him:
and although many will not come to him, who is the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
until the ſpirit of bondage diſtreſs them for their debt;
yet if any upon the knowledge of their loſt eſtate,
would flee and yield to Chriſt, none might warrantably
preſs a Law-work upon them. As for others, whom
Chriſt perſwaded by a word to follow him, whatſoever he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34737:14"/>
did, or howſoever he ſpake to them at his firſt meeting
with them, we muſt rationally ſuppoſe, that then he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
ſo much of their own neceſſity, and his own ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and excellency to them, as made them quit all, and
run after him. And if he do ſo to any, we crave no more,
ſince there is room enough there for the Phyſitian. So
that from all this, as ſome may be confirmed and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with whom God hath ſo dealt; So there is no ground
nor occaſion for deluded ſouls to flatter themſelves in
their condition, who remain ignorant and ſenſeleſs of their
own miſeries and Chriſts all-ſufficiency, and hold faſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>There are ſome brought in to Chriſt in a way yet
more declarative of his free grace,</hi> and this is, when he ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
calleth men at the hour of death. We find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
recorded of this way in that pregnant example of the
Thief on the Croſs; <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 39, 41. Although this
ſeems not very pertinent for the purpoſe in hand; yet we
ſhall ſpeak a little of it, that on the one hand men may
be ſparing to judge and paſs Sentence upon either them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
or others, before the laſt breath. And we ſhall
ſo circumſtantiate it, that, on the other hand, none may
dare to delay ſo great a buſineſs to the laſt hour of their
life. We find theſe things remarkable in that buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Chriſt and the Thief; 1. The man falleth at odds
with his former Companion. 2. He dareth not ſpeak a
wrong word of God, whoſe hand is on him, but juſtifieth
him in all that is befallen him. 3. He now ſeeth Jeſus
Chriſt perſecuted by the World, without a cauſe, and
moſt injuriouſly. 4. He diſcovereth Chriſt to be a Lord
and a King, whilſt enemies ſeem to have him under. 5.
He believeth a being of glory after death ſo really, that
he preferreth a portion of it to the preſent ſafety of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
life, which he knew Chriſt was able to grant to him
at that time, and he might have choſen that with the other
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34737:14"/>
Thief. 6. Although he was much abaſed in himſelf, and
humbled, that he pleaded but that Chriſt would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
him, yet he was nobly daring to throw himſelf
upon the Covenant, on life and death; and he had ſo
much faith of Chriſts all-ſufficiency, that he judged
a ſimple remembrance from Chriſt would ſatisfyingly do
his buſineſs. 7. He acquieſced ſweetly in the word which
Chriſt ſpake to him, for the ground of his comfort. All
which are very clear in the caſe of that poor dying man,
and do prove a very real work of God upon his heart. As
this example may encourage ſome to wait for good from
God, who cannot as yet lay clear claim to any gracious
work of his Spirit: So we beſeech all, as they love their
ſouls, not to delay their ſoul-buſineſſes, hoping for ſuch
a caſt of Chriſts hand in the end, as too many do: This
being a rare miracle of mercy with the glory whereof
Chriſt did honourably triumph over the ignominy of his
croſs (a parallel of which we ſhall hardly find in all
the Scripture beſide:) yea, as there be but few at all
ſaved, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 16. and moſt few ſaved this way: So
the Lord hath peremptorily threatned to laugh at the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and not to hear the cry of ſuch as mocked former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at his reproof, and would not hear when he called to
them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24, 26. which Scripture, although it doth
not ſhut mercies door upon any, who at the hour of death,
do ſincerely judge themſelves and flee unto Chriſt as this
penitent Thief did: Yet it is certain, it implyeth that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few who fit the offer until then, are honoured with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
as he was, and ſo their cry, as not being ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and of the right ſtamp, ſhall not be heard.</p>
            <p>The fourth, and moſt ordinary way, by which many
are brought in to Chriſt, is, by a clear and diſcernable
work of the law and humiliation, which we ordinarily
call the <hi>ſpirit of bondage,</hi> as was hinted before. We do not
mean that every one whoſe conſcience is awakened with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34737:15"/>
ſin and fear of wrath, doth really cloſe with Chriſt; the
contrary doth appear in <hi>Gain, Saul, Judas &amp;c.</hi> But
that wherein there is a conviction of ſin, awakening of
conſcience, and work of humiliation, which, as we ſhall
circumſtantiate it, doth rarely miſcarry or fail of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
iſſue, but ordinarily doth reſolve into the ſpirit of
adoption, and a gracious work of Gods Spirit: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Lord dealeth with many ſinners this way, and
we find that many are much puzled about the giving judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Law-work.</p>
            <p>This work is either more violent and ſudden, or it is
more ſober and longer, protracted through a great length
of time, and ſo as the ſteps of it are very diſcernable.
It is more violent in ſome, as in the <hi>Jaylor, Paul,</hi> and
ſome other converts in the book of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
on whom Chriſt did break in at an inſtant, and fell
on them as with Fire and Sword, and led them captive ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly;
And becauſe ſome great legal ſhakings are deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and turn to nothing, if not worſe, we ſhall point at
ſome things remarkable in theſe converts, ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which did prove the work of the Law on them, to
have had a gracious iſſue and reſult. 1. Some word of
truth or diſpenſation, putteth the perſon to a dreadful
ſtand, with a great ſtir in the Soul: Some are pricked in
heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 27. Some fell on trembling, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.
29. and this is ſuch a ſtir, that the perſon is brought to
his wits end. <hi>What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> ſaith Paul,
Acts 9. <hi>What ſhall I do?</hi> ſaith the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> Acts 16. 30.
2. The perſon is content to have Salvation, and Gods
friendſhip on any terms, as the queſtions do import, <hi>What
ſhall I do?</hi> as if he had ſaid, What would I not do?
What would I not forego? What would I not undergo?
3. The perſon accepteth the condition offered by Chriſt
and his Servants, as is clear in the fore-cited Scriptures,
4. The perſon preſently becometh of one intereſt with the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34737:15"/>
Saints, joyning himſelf with that perſecuted ſociety, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
reſpect on thoſe whom he had formerly perſecuted,
joyning and continuing with them in the profeſſion of
Chriſt on all hazards. Thoſe with whom the Lord hath
ſo dealt have much to ſay for a gracious work of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in them; and it is like many of them can date their
work from ſuch a particular time and word, or diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and can give ſome account of what paſt between God
and them, and of a ſenſible change following in them from
that time forward, as <hi>Paul</hi> giveth a good account of the
work and way of God with him afterwards, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>Again, The Lord ſometimes carrieth on this work
more calmly, foftly, and gently, protracting it ſo as the
ſteps of mens exerciſe under it are very diſcernable. It
would draw a great length to enlarge every ſtep of it;
we ſhall touch the moſt obſervable things in it.</p>
            <p>1. The Lord Iayeth ſiege to men (who, it may be,
have often refuſed to yield to him, offering himſelf in the
Ordinances) and by ſome word Preached, Read, or
born in on the mind, or by ſome providence leading in
unto the Word, he doth alſo aſſault the houſe kept peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
by the ſtrong man, the Devil; and thus Chriſt,
who is the ſtronger man, cometh upon him, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.
22. and by the Spirit of truth, doth faſten the <hi>Word</hi> on
the man, in which Gods curſe is denounced againſt ſuch
and ſuch ſinners, whereof the man knoweth himſelf guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The ſpirit convinceth the man, and bindeth it upon
him, that he is the ſame perſon againſt whom the Word
of God doth ſpeak, becauſe he is guilty of ſuch ſins, and
from ſuch ſins the man is led on to ſee more until (ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily)
he comes to ſee the ſins of his youth, ſins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, he is led on until he ſees himſelf guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
almoſt of the breach of the whole Law; he ſeeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
evils compaſſing him, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh in a
fit of exerciſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 12. A man ſometimes will ſee
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34737:16"/>
ugly ſights of ſin in this caſe, and is ſharp-ſighted to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a filthineſs to every ſin almoſt. Thus the ſpirit convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of ſin, <hi>Jo.</hi> 16. 8. 2. The Lord ſhaketh a ſpecial
ſtrong hold in the garriſon, a refuge of lies, to which the
man betaketh himſelf when his ſins are thus diſcovered to
him. The poor man pretendeth to faith in Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he thinks his burden is taken off him, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi>
ſaid, <hi>John 8. 41. We have on Father, even God.</hi> They
pretend to a ſpecial relation of God as a common Lord.
The Spirit, of God beats the man from this, by the truth
of the Scriptures, proving that he hath no true faith, and
ſo no intereſt in Chriſt, nor any true ſaving grace; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clear differences between true grace and the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
fancies which the man hath in him, and between him,
and the truly Godly, as Chriſt laboureth to do thoſe, <hi>Joh.</hi>
8. 42, 44. <hi>If God were your father, ye would love me.
Ye are of the Devil, for ye do the luſts of ſuch a father.</hi> So,
<hi>fear ſurpriſeth the Hypocrite in heart,</hi> Iſa 33. 14. eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when the Lord diſcovereth to him conditions in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of theſe promiſes (wherein he truſted moſt) not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attainable, he now ſeeth grace and faith another thing
than once he judged them to be. We may in ſome reſpect,
apply that word here, <hi>The Spirit convinceth him of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath not believed on the Son:</hi> he is particularly
convinced of unbelief, <hi>John</hi> 16. 9. he ſeeth now a huge
diſtance between himſelf and the godly, whom he thought
before out-ſtripped him in only ſome unneceſſary, proud,
hateful preciſeneſs; he now ſeeth himſelf deluded, and
in the broad way with the periſhing multitude; and ſo in
the ſight of his miſery, coucheth down under his own bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
which, before this time, he thought Chriſt did
bear for him; he now beginneth to be afraid of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
becauſe of that and ſuch other words, <hi>What haſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
thou to do to take my Covenant in thy mouth? &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16</p>
            <p>3. The man becometh careful about his ſalvation, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34737:16"/>
beginneth to take it to heart, as the one thing neceſſary:
he is brought to this with the Jaylor, <hi>Act. 16. What
ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> His ſalvation becometh the leading
thing with him: It was leaſt in his thoughts before, but
now it prevaileth, and other things are much miſ-regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, ſince his ſoul is ready to periſh, <hi>What ſhall
it profit him to gain the whole world if he loſe his ſoul;</hi> Mat.
16. 26. Some here are much puzled with thoughts of an
irrecoverable decree to their prejudice, and with the fears
of uncertain death, which may attach them before they
get matters put to a point; and ſome are vexed with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
that they are guilty of the ſin againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt, which is unpardonable, and ſo are driven a
dangerous length, Satan ſtill caſting up to them many ſad
examples of people, who have dolefully put an end to
their own exerciſe: but they are in the hand of one, who
knoweth how to ſuccour them that are tempted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
            <p>4. When a man is thus in hazzard of miſcarrying, the
Lord uſeth a work of preventing mercy towards him;
quietly, and under-hand ſupporting him; and this is by
bearing upon his mind the poſſibility of his Salvation,
leading the man to the remembrance of pregnant proofs of
Gods free and rich grace, pardoning groſs tranſgreſſors,
ſuch as <hi>Manaſſeth;</hi> who was a bloody idolatrous man,
and had correſpondence with the Devil, and yet obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
mercy, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 12, 13. and other Scriptures
bearing offers of grace and favour indifferently to all who
will yield to Chriſt, whatſoever they have been formerly:
So as the man is brought again to this, <hi>What ſhall I do to
be ſaved?</hi> which doth ſuppoſe, that he apprehendeth a
poſſibility of being ſaved, elſe he would not propound the
queſtion. He applyeth that, or the like word, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>It may be ye ſhall be hid,</hi> Zeph. 2. 3. he findeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
excluding him from mercy now, if he have a heart
for the thing. Although here it may be, the man doth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34737:17"/>
doth not perceive that it is the Lord who upholdeth, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
he can tell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that when his foot was ſlipping, Gods
mercy held him up, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 17. 18. the Pſalmiſt
ſpeaketh in another caſe. And he will afterwards ſay,
<hi>When he was as a Beaſt, and as fool in many reſpects,
God held him by the hand,</hi> Pſal. 73. 22, 23.</p>
            <p>5. After this diſcovery of a poſſibility to be ſaved,
there is a work of <hi>deſire</hi> quickned in the Soul; which is
clear in that ſame expreſſion, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi>
But ſometimes this deſire is not regular, whilſt it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out thus, what ſhall I do that I may <hi>work</hi> the works of
God <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 28. In which caſe, the man formerly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
with fear and care about his Salvation would be at
ſome work of his own, to extricate himſelf; And here
he ſuddenly reſolveth to do all that is commanded, and
to forego every evil way (yet much ſlighting Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus)
and ſo beginneth to take ſome courage to himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
eſtabliſhing his own righteouſneſs, but not ſubmitting
to the Righteouſneſs of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. whereupon the
Lord maketh a new aſſault on him, intending the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his abſolutely broken ſtate in himſelf, that ſo room
might be made for the Surety; as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when he found them ſo bold in their undertakings,
<hi>Joſh. 24. 18. 19. You cannot ſerve the Lord,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>fer he is a Holy God &amp;c.</hi> In this new aſſault, the Lord,
1. Bends up againſt the man the ſpirituality of the Law,
the Commandment cometh with a new change in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
meaning of it, <hi>Rom. 7. 9. The Law came</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Paul) viz.</hi> in the ſpiritual meaning of it. <hi>Paul</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeen ſuch a ſight of the Law before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. God moſt
holily doth looſe the reſtraining bonds, which he had laid
upon the mans corruptions, and ſuffereth it not only to boyl
and ſwell within, but to threaten, to break out in all the
outward members. Thus ſin groweth bold, and kicketh
at the law, becoming exceeding ſinful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 8, 9, 13.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34737:17"/>
3. The Lord doth diſcover to man, more now than ever
before, the uncleanneſs of his righteouſneſs, and what ſpots
are in his beſt things. Theſe things kill the maſt, and
he dieth in his own conceit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. and diſpaireth
of releif in himſelf, if it come not from ſome other way.</p>
            <p>6. After many ups and downs here, ordinarily the man
reſolveth ſome retirement, he deſireth to be alone, he
cannot keep company as before; like thoſe who in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging
City, when they ſee they cannot hold out, and
would be glad of any good condition from the beſieging
enemy, they go to a council, that they may reſolve ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.
So the man here retireth, that he may ſpeak with
himſelf. This is like that communing with our own heart
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 4. Thus God leadeth to the wilderneſs, that he
may ſpeak to the heart, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 14. When the perſon
is retired, the thoughts of the heart which were ſcattered
in former ſteps of exerciſe, do more obſervable throng in
here. We ſhall reduce them into this method. (1.) The
man thinks of his unhappy folly, in bearing arms againſt
God, and here there be large thoughts of former wayes,
with a bluſhing countenance and ſelf-loathing, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.
31. like that of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 3. his ſin is before him. (2.)
Then he remembreth how fair opportunities of yeilding
to God he hath baſely loſt; his ſpirit is like to faint
when he remembreth that, as is ſaid in another caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
42. 4, 5. (3) He now thinks of many Chriſtians,
whom he mocked and deſpiſed in his heart, perſwading
himſelf now that they are happy, as having choſen the
better part; he thinks of the condition of thoſe who wait
on Chriſt, as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did of <hi>Solomons</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
<hi>Happy are thy ſervants</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>who ſtand
continually before thee, and that hear thy wiſdom,</hi> 1 Kings
10. 8. <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal.
8. 4. 4. He wiſheth to be one of the meaneſt who have
any near relation to God, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Son doth ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:34737:18"/>
he would be as one of the Fathers hired ſervants, <hi>Luke</hi>
15. 17. 19. (5.) Then he calleth to mind the good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
that is gone abroad of God, according to that teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 2. The Prophet knew that God was a
gracious God and merciful, ſlow to anger, and of great
kindneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The free and large promiſes and offers
of grace come in here; and the glorious practices which
have paſt upon ſinners of all ſorts, according to the ſame
of God in Scripture. (5.) He thinks with himſelf, why
hath God ſpared me ſo long, and why have I got ſuch a
ſight of my ſin? why hath he kept me from breaking pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
at my own hand, in chooſing ſome unhappy way of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape?
Why hath he made this ſtrange change on me? It
may be it is in his heart to do me good, O that it may be
ſo!—Although all theſe thoughts be not in the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
work of every one, yet they are with many, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
promiſing where they are.</p>
            <p>7. Upon all theſe Thoughts and Meditations, the man
more ſeriouſly than ever before, reſolveth to pray, and
to make ſome eſſay with God, upon Life and Death; he
concludeth, it can be no worſe with him: for, if he ſit
ſtill, he periſheth, as the Lepers ſpeak, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 3,
4. He conſidereth with the pinched Prodigal Son, that
there is bread enough in the Fathers Houſe, and to ſpare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
while he periſheth for want: ſo he goeth to God, for he
knoweth not what elſe to make of his condition, as the
Prodigal Son doth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 17, 18. and, it may be,
here he reſolveth that to ſpeak; but readily things do
vary when he is arraigned before God, as the Prodigal
Son forgot ſome of his premediated prayers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 18,
19, 21. And now when he cometh before God more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervably
than ever before, (1.) He beginneth with the
Publican, <hi>a far off, Luk.</hi> 18. 13. with many through
confeſſions and ſelf-condemnings, whereof he is very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal,
as <hi>Luk. 15. 21. I have ſinned againſt Heaven,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34737:18"/>
and before thee, and am no more worthy, &amp;c.</hi> (2.) Now
begin his thoughts about the hearing of his prayer, which
he was not wont to queſtion much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he now knows what
thoſe expreſſions of the Saints, about the hearing of their
prayers, do import. (3.) It is obſervable in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
that there are many broken Sentences, like that
of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. 3. (<hi>But thou, O Lord, how long?)</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with ſighs and groans, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. and greedy
looking upward, thereby ſpeaking more than can be
expreſt by words. (4.) There be ordinarily ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
and (as it were) diverſions, the man ſpeaking
ſometimes to the enemy, ſometimes to his own heart, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to the multitude in the world, as <hi>David</hi> did in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caſes, <hi>Pſal. 9. 6. Pſal. 42. 5. Pſal.</hi> 4. 2. (5.)
It is obſervable here, that ſometimes the man will halt
and be ſilent to hear ſome indiſtinct whiſpering of a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſound glancing on the mind, or ſome news in ſome
broken word of Scripture, which, it may be, the man
ſcarcely knoweth to be Scripture, or whether it is come
from God or Satan to delude him: yet this he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
only to hear what God the Lord will ſpeak, as
upon another occaſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 8. (6.) More diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
promiſes comes into the mans mind, whereupon he
aſſayeth to lay hold, but is beaten off with objections, as
in another caſe the Pſalmiſt is, <hi>Pſal. 20. 3. 6. But thou
art holy, But I am a Worm.</hi> Now it is about the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the day with the man, and Faith will ſtir as ſoon as
the Lord imparteth the joyful ſound, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 15. This
is the ſubſtance of the Covenant, which may be ſhortly
ſummed up in theſe words, <hi>Chriſt Jeſns is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleaſed; hear ye him.</hi> We can ſpeak no
further of the mans exerciſe as a preparatory work; for,
what followeth, is more than preparatory. Yet, that
the exerciſe may appear compleat and full, we ſhall add
here, That after all theſe things, the Lord (it may be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34737:19"/>
after many anſwers of divers ſorts) mightily conveyeth
the ſound of his Covenant to the heart and determineth the
heart to cloſe with it, and God now draweth him ſo to
Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. and ſo ſhapeth out the heart for him,
that the conception cannot miſcarry; for now the heart
is ſo in breadth and length for him, as that leſs cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie,
and more is not deſired, like that of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25.
<hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> or <hi>whom have I deſired
on earth beſides thee?</hi> The ſoul now reſolveth to die, (if
he command ſo) yet at his door, and facing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>We have drawn this preparatory work to ſome length,
not tying any man to ſuch a work ſo circumſtantiate; only,
we ſay, the Lord dealeth ſo with ſome; and where he ſo
convinceth of ſin, corruption, and ſelf emptineſs, and
maketh a man take ſalvation to heart, as the one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and ſets him on work in the uſe of the means,
which God hath appointed for relief; I ſay ſuch a work
rarely ſhall be found to fail of a good iſſue and gracious
reſult.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Hypocrites and reprobates have great ſtirrings of
Conſcience, and deep convictions about ſin, ſetting them on
work ſometimes, and I do ſuſpect any preparatory work of
the Law I ever had, to be but ſuch as they have.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It will be heard to give ſure eſſential diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
between the preparatory work in thoſe in whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
Chriſt is formed, and thoſe legal ſtirrings which
are ſometimes in Reprobates: If there were not ſome
gracious reſult of theſe convictions, and wakenings of
conſcience in the Lords people, and other marks, (of
which we ſhall ſpeak afterwards) it were hard to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon any difference that is clear in theſe legal ſtirrings.
Yet, for anſwer to the Objection, I ſhall offer ſome things,
which rarely will be found in the ſtirring of reprobates,
and which are ordinarily found in that Law-work which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34737:19"/>
hath a gracious iſſue. 1. The convictions of hypocrites
and reprobates, are uſually confined to ſome few very
groſs tranſgreſſions. <hi>Saul grants no more but the</hi> perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of <hi>David, 1 Sam. 26. 21. Judas grants only the</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
of innocent blood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 4. But uſually theſe
convictions by which the Lord prepareth his own way in
the ſoul, although they may begin at one or more groſs
particular tranſgreſſions; yet they reſt not there, but the
man is led on to ſee many breaches of the Law, and
innumerable evils compaſſing him, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh in
the ſight of his ſin. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 12. and withal, that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
conviction (if I may call it ſo) is not general, as
uſually we hear ſenſeleſs men ſaying, that in all things
they ſin: But it is particular and condeſcending, as <hi>Paul</hi>
afterwards ſpake of himſelf, he not only is the chief of
ſinners, but particularly, he was a blaſphemer, a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. 2. The convictions which Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
have, do ſeldom reach thier Corruption, and that
body of death which breeds an averſeneſs from what is
good, and ſtrongly inclineth to what is evil. Ordinarily
where we find Hypocrites ſpeaking of themſelves in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
they ſpeak loftily, and with ſome ſelf conceit, both
as to their freedom from corruption, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 34. The
<hi>Phariſees</hi> ſay to the poor man, <hi>Thou wast altogether born in
ſins, and doſt thou teach us?</hi> (as if they themſelves were
not as corrupt by nature as he) They ſpeak of great ſins
as <hi>Hazael</hi> did, 2 <hi>Kings 8. 13. Am I a Dog that I ſhould
do this great thing?</hi> And alſo in their undertakings of duty,
as that man ſpake, <hi>Mat. 8. 19. I will follow thee whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
thou goeſt.</hi> See how the people do ſpeak, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.
2. to 7. They undertake to do all that God will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them, ſo that they ſtill go about in any caſe to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
their own righteouſneſs, not ſubmitting unto the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
of God. But I may ſay, that convictions and
exerciſe about corruption, and that body of death, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34737:20"/>
to evil, and diſenabling for good, is not the leaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
part of the work, where the Lord is preparing his own
way. They uſe to judge themſelves very wretched, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of a body of ſin, and are at their wits end how to be
delivered, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh when he is under the exerciſe
of it afterwards, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19. 3. It will ordinarily be
found, that the convictions which are in hypocrites, either
are not ſo ſerious, as that ſome other buſineſs will not put<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
them out of head before any ſatisfaction be gotten, as in
<hi>Cain,</hi> who went and built a City, and we hear no more o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
his Convictions, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. Felix <hi>went away until a mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
convenient <hi>time, and we hear no more of his trembling,</hi> Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
24. 25. Or, if that work become very ſerious, then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
runneth to the other extremity and deſpair of relief, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no room for any eſcape. So we find <hi>Judas</hi> very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in his Convictions, yet he grew deſperate, and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 4, 5. But where the Lord prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his own way, the work is both ſo ſerious, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
cannot be put off it, (until he find ſome ſatisfaction)
and yet under that very ſeriouſneſs he lyeth open for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:
both which are clear in the Gaolers words, <hi>What
ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> Acts 16. 30. This ſerious enquiry
after Relief, is a very obſervable thing in the preparatory
work which leadeth on to Chriſt; yet we deſire none to
lay too much weight on theſe things, ſince God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
clearer differences between the precious and the
vile.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I ſtill fear, I have not had ſo through a ſight
of my ſin and miſery, as the Lord giveth to many whom he
effectually calleth, eſpecially to great Tranſgreſſors, ſuch as
I am.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord diſcovereth to ſome,
great ſight of their ſin and miſery, and they are thereby
put under great legal terrours. But as all are not
brought in by that ſenſible preparatory Law-work, (as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34737:20"/>
we ſhewed before) So even thoſe who are dealt with
after that way, are very differently and variouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
in regard of degrees of terrour, and of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that work: The Jaylor hath a violent work of
very ſhort continuance; <hi>Paul</hi> hath a work continuing
three days: Some perſons are in bondage through fear
of death all their days, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. ſo that we muſt not
limit the Lord to one way of working here. The main
thing we are to look unto in theſe legal wakenings and
convictions of ſin and miſery, is, If the Lord reach
theſe ends in us, for which uſually theſe ſtirrings and
convictions are ſent into the ſoul; and if theſe ends be
reached, it is well, we are not to vex our ſelves about
any preparatory work further. Now, theſe ends which
God driveth ordinarily with ſinners, by theſe legal ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and wakenings of conſcience, are four.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Lord diſcovers ſights of mens ſin and
miſery to them, to chaſe them out of themſelves, and
to put them out of conceit of their own righteouſneſs.
Men naturally have great thoughts of themſelves, and do
incline much to the covenant of works. The Lord
therefore doth diſcover to them ſo much of their ſin and
corruption, even in their beſt things, that they are made
to loath themſelves, and to deſpair of relief in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſo they are forced to flee out of themſelves,
and from the Covenant of works, to ſeek refuge elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<hi>Heb,</hi> 6. 18. They become dead to themſelves
and the Law, as to the point of juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.
4. <hi>Then have they no more conſidence in the fleſh,</hi> Phil.
3, 3. This is ſuppoſed in the offers of <hi>Chriſt, coming
to ſeek and ſave that which was lost,</hi> Luk. 19. 10.
and to be <hi>Phyſician to thoſe who are ſick,</hi> Mat. 9.
12.</p>
            <p>The ſecond great end, is, to commend Chriſt Jeſus
to mens hearts above all things, that ſo they might fall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34737:21"/>
in love with him, and betake themſelves to that treaſure
and jewel which only enricheth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 44. and by
ſo doing may ſerve the Lords deſign in the contrivement
of the Goſpel, which was the manifeſtation of his frec
grace through Chriſt Jeſus, in the ſalvation of men.
The ſight of a mans own miſery and damnable eſtate by
nature, is a ready way to make him prize Chriſt highly,
who alone can ſet ſuch a wretch at liberty. Yea, it not
only leadeth a man to an high eſteem of Chriſt, but alſo
of all things that relate to that way of Salvation, as
Grace, New-Covenant, Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and maketh him
carefully to gather and treaſure up his <hi>Michtams</hi> or gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Scriptures for the confirmation of his intereſt in theſe
things.</p>
            <p>The third great end, is, To deter and ſcar people
from ſin, and to make them fall out with it, aud conſent
to put their neck under all his yoke. God kindleth ſome
ſparkles of Hell in mens boſoms by the diſcovery of their
ſin, as a ready mean to make them henceforth ſtand in
awe, <hi>knowing how bitter a thing it is to depart from the
Lord,</hi> Jer. 2. 19. So we find reſt offered to the weary,
upon condition they will take on Chriſts yoke, <hi>Mat.</hi>
11. 29. And God offereth to own men as their God
and Father, upon condition they will allow no peaceable
abode to <hi>Belial, 2. Cor.</hi> 6. 14, 17. 18.</p>
            <p>The fourth great end, is, to work up men to a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and thankful ſubmiſſion to all the Maſters pleaſure.
This is a ſingular piece of work, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 63. Then
ſhalt thou not <hi>open thy mouth any more,</hi> The ſight of a
mans own vileneſs and deſervings, maketh him ſilent,
and to lay his hand on his mouth, whatſoever God doth
unto him, <hi>Pſal. 39. 9. I was dumb, and opened not
my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</hi> Ezra 9. 13. <hi>God
hath puniſhed us leſs than o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r iniquities.</hi> Micah. 7, 9.
<hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34737:21"/>
ſinned.</hi> The man careth not what God doth to him, or
how he deal with him, if he ſave him from the deſerved
wrath to come. Alſo, any mercy is a large mercy
to him who hath ſeen ſuch a ſight of himſelf, Gen.
32. 10. <hi>he is leſs than the leaſt of mercies,</hi> any <hi>crumb
falling from his Maſters Table is welcome,</hi> Mat. 15. 27.
he thinks it rich mercy that he is not conſumed, <hi>Lam.</hi>
3. 22. This is the thing that marvelouſly maketh his
poor afflicted people ſo ſilent under, and ſatisfied with
their lot; Nay, they think he deſerveth Hell, who
openeth his mouth at any thing God doth to him, ſince
he hath pardoned his tranſgreſſions. So then, for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
the Objection, I ſay, if the Lord hath driven
thee out of thy ſelf, and commended Chriſt to thy heart
above all things, and made thee reſolve on his ſtrength
to wage War with every known tranſgreſſion and thou
art, in ſome meaſure, as a weaned Child, acquieſcing
in what he doth unto thee, <hi>deſiring to lay thy hand on
thy mouth thankfully;</hi> Then thy convictions of ſin and
miſery, and whatſoever thou do'ſt, plead as a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
work, is ſufficient, and thou art to debate no
more about it; only be adviſed to ſtudy new diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the ſenſe of thy loſt condition every day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of thy old and new ſins, and alſo to ſee freſh help
in Chriſt, who is a Prieſt for ever to make interceſſion
and to have the work of ſanctification and patience with
thankfulneſs renewed and quickned often: for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of that work, which abaſeth thee, exalteth Chriſt,
and conformeth to his will, muſt conveigh thee through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all thy life-time in this World.</p>
            <p>We come now to ſpeak of ſome more clear and ſure
marks, by which men may take up their gratious ſtate and
intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing whereby men know it, is, their cloſing
with Chriſt in the Goſpel, wherein he is held forth.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34737:22"/>
This is believing, or <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the condition of
the Covenant. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. It is faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Act 16
31. <hi>Believe—and thou ſhalt be Saved.</hi> Now, although<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in propriety of ſpeech, it is hard to prove an intereſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
faith, it being our very intereſt in him; yet the heart
cloſing with Chriſt Jeſus, is ſo diſcernable in it ſelf,
that it may well be placed amongſt the marks, of a
gracious ſtate: And if a man can make out this, that
he believeth on, and in Chriſt Jeſus, he thereby doth
prove a very true intereſt in him. Many are prejudiced
at this as a mark, upon one of theſe three grounds ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily.
(1.) Some conceive faith to be a difficult myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
thing, hardly attainable. To theſe I ſay, do not
miſtake; Faith is not ſo difficult as many do apprehend
it to be. I grant true faith in the meaneſt degree is the
<hi>gift</hi> of God, and above the power of fleſh and blood:
for God muſt <hi>draw</hi> men to Chriſt, <hi>Phil. 1. 29. Joh.</hi> 6.
44. Yet, it were a reflection upon Chriſt, and all he
hath done, to ſay it were a matter of inſuperable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
as is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6,—11. it were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that Scripture, as much upon the matter, as to
ſay, Chriſt came not from Heaven, is not riſen from
the dead, or aſcended victorious to Heaven. I ſay, he
hath made the way to Heaven moſt eaſie; and faith,
which is the condition required on our part, more eaſie
than men do imagine. For the better underſtanding of
this, conſider, that juſtifying faith, is not to believe that
I am elected, or, to believe that God loveth me, or
that Chriſt died for me, or the like. Theſe things are
indeed very difficult and almoſt impoſſible at the firſt
hand to be obtained by thoſe who are ſerious, whilſt
natural Athieſts, and deluded Hypocrites find no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in aſſerting all thoſe things. I ſay, true juſtifying
faith is not any of the foreſaid things: neither is it ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the believing of any ſentence that is written or that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34737:22"/>
can be thought upon. I grant, he that believeth on Chriſt
Jeſus, believeth what God hath ſaid about mans ſinful
miſerable condition by nature, and he believeth that to be
true, That there is life in the Son, who was ſlain, <hi>and is
riſen again from the dead, &amp;c.</hi> But none of theſe, nor
the believing of many ſuch truths, do ſpeak out juſtifying
faith, or that believing on the Son of God ſpoken of in
Scripture; for then it were ſimply an act of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:
But true juſtifying Faith, which we now ſeek
after, as a good mark of Intereſt in Chriſt, is chiefly and
principally an act or work of the heart and will, having
preſuppoſed ſundry things about truth in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with the heart it is believed unto Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi>
10. 10. and although it ſeem (verſ. 9 of that Chapter)
that a man is ſaved upon condition that he believe this
truth, <hi>God raiſed Chriſt from the dead;</hi> yet we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
another thing there, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the truth of that propoſition: For, beſide that all
Devils have that Faith whereby they believe that God <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Chriſt from the dead.</hi> So the Scripture hath clearly
reſolved juſtifying Faith into a receiving of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi>
1. 12. The receiving of Chriſt is there explained to be
the believing on his Name, it is ſtill called a ſtaying on
the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 3. a truſting in God, often mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and the word is a leaning on him, it is
a believing on Chriſt, <hi>Joh</hi> 6. 29. and often ſo expreſt in
the New Teſtament. When God maketh men believe
ſavingly, <hi>He is ſaid to</hi> draw <hi>them unto Chriſt; and when
the Lord inviteth them to believe, he calleth them to come to
him,</hi> Joh. 6. 37, 44. <hi>The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

14, to 46. Now I ſay, this action of the heart on Chriſt
Jeſus, is not ſo difficult a thing as is conceived: Shall
that be judged a myſterious difficult thing, which doth
conſiſt much in deſire? If man have but an appetite, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have it; for, they are bleſſed that hunger after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
Mat. 5. 6. <hi>If you will, you are welcome,</hi> Rev.
22. 17. It is a matter of ſuch intricacy, and inſuperable
difficulty, greedily to look to that exalted Saviour, <hi>Iſa.</hi>
45. 22. and to receive a thing that is offered, held forth,
and declared to be mine, if I will but accept and take i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>;
and in a manner open my mouth and give way to it? Such
a thing is faith, <hi>Pſal</hi> 81 10. if not leſs. Oh if I could
perſwade people what is juſtifying Faith, which impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priateth
Chriſt to me! We often fright people from their
juſt reſt and quiet, by making them apprehend faith to be
ſome deep myſterious thing, and by moving unneceſſary
doubts about it, whereby it is needleſly darkened. (2.)
Some make no uſe of this mark, as judging it a high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
crime to pretend to ſo excellent a thing as is
the very condition of the New Covenant. To thoſe I
ſay, you need not ſtartle ſo much as it, as if it were high
pride to pretend to it; for whatſoever true Faith be, men
muſt reſolve to have it, or nothing at all; all other marks
are in vain without it; a thouſand things beſides will not
do the buſineſs: Unleſs a man believe, he abideth in
the ſtate of Condemnation. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18, 36. (3.) Others
do not meddle with this noble mark of faith, becauſe they
judge it a work of greateſt difficulty to find out Faith where
it is. To thoſe I ſay, It is not ſo difficult to find it out
ſince he that believeth, hath the witneſs in himſelf, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
5. 10. It is a thing which by ſome ſerious ſearch may be
known, not only may we do much to find it out by the
preparatory work going before it in many, as the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
and believing of a mans loſt eſtate, and that he
cannot do his own buſineſs, and that there is ſatisfying
fulneſs in Chriſt, very deſirable, if he could overtake it.
A ſerious minding of this, with a heart laid open for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
as alſo by the ordinary companions and concomitans
of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the liking of Chriſts Dominion, his Kingh
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34737:24"/>
and prophetical Office, a deſire to reſign my ſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
up to him to be at his diſpoſing: As alſo by the native
conſequences of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the managings of the World,
the managings of my own conſcience according to the
Word, a heart purifying work, a working love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
ſay, not only may we know faith by theſe things, but it
is diſcernable by it ſelf and of its own nature: although
I deny not but that there muſt be ſome help of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
by which we know what is freely given unto us of
God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12, As alſo that God hath allowed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
evidences and marks, as precious helps, whereby
men may clear up faith more fully to themſelves, 1 <hi>John</hi>
5. 13. Yet I ſtill ſay, that faith, or believing which is
ſome acting of the heart upon Chriſt in the Goſpel, and
the tranſacting with him there, is diſcernable of it ſelf,
and by it ſelf, to a judicious underſtanding perſon, with
an ordinary influence of the ſpirit; unleſs the Lord, for
reaſons known to himſelf, do overcloud a mans reflex
light, by which he ſhould take up and perceive what
is in him.</p>
            <p>This juſtifying faith which we aſſert to be ſo diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
is, in the Lords deep wiſdom and gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendence,
variouſly expreſt in Scripture, according to
the different actings of it upon God, and outgoings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, ſo as every one, who hath it, may find and
take it up in his own mould. It ſometimes acted by a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi>
of union with him in Chriſt. This is that <hi>looking
to him,</hi> Iſa. 45. 22. This ſeems to be a weak act of
faith, and far below other actings of it at other times
perhaps in that ſame perſon. Men will look to what
they dare not approach (to their apprehenſion) which
they dare not touch or embrace. They may look to one,
to whome they dare not ſpeak. Yet God hath made the
promiſe to faith in that acting, as the forecited Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth ſhew, and this he hath done mercifully and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34737:25"/>
wiſely; for this is the only diſcernable way of the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of faith of ſome perſons ſometimes: ſuch are the
actings our outgoings of faith expreſt in Scripture by
<hi>hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſs,</hi> Mat. 5. 6. and
that expreſt by <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lling,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. Again, this
faith goeth out ſometimes in the act of, <hi>recumbency,</hi> or
leaning on the Lord, the ſoul taking up Chriſt then as
a reſting ſtone; and God hath ſo held him out, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he be a ſtumbling ſtone to others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 33.
This acting of it, is hinted in the expreſſions of <hi>truſting
and ſtaying on God,</hi> ſo often mentioned in Scripture;
and precious promiſes are made to this acting of faith,
Iſa. 26. 34. <hi>God will keep them in prerfect peace whoſe
minds are ſtaid on him,</hi> becauſe ſuch do truſt in him.
<hi>Truſt in the Lord, for with him is everlaſting ſtrength,</hi>
So Pſal. 125. 1. <hi>They that truſt in the Lord, ſhall be as
Mount</hi> Zion <hi>which abideth for ever.</hi> I ſay the Lord hath
made promiſes to this way of Faiths acting, as knowing
it will go often out after him in this way with many
perſons, and this way of its acting will be moſt diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to them. It goeth out after God ſometimes by an
act of <hi>waiting,</hi> when the Soul hath ſomewhat depending
before God, and hath not got out his mind ſatisfyingly
about that thing; then Faith doth wait, and ſo it hath
the Promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 23. Sometimes it acteth in a <hi>wilful</hi>
way upon the Lord, when the Soul apprehendeth God
thruſting it away, and threatning its ruine; So Job 13.
15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet I will truſt in him.</hi> The
faith of that poor woman, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 22, 28. ſo highly
commended by Chriſt, did go out in this way of wilful
acting over the difficulties; and the Lord ſpeaketh much
good of it, and to it, becauſe ſome will be put to it,
to exerciſe faith that way ſometimes, and ſo they have
that for their encouragement. It were tedious to inſtance
all the ſeveral ways of the acting of faith upon, and its
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34737:25"/>
exerciſe about, and outgoing after Chriſt. I may ſay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the various conditions and preſſures of the
ſoul of man, the Lord hath variouſly held out himſelf
and his fulneſs in Chriſt under divers notions, as might
moſt fitly meet the diſtreſs or condition of man; and
accordinly, Faith, which God hath appointed to traffick
and travel between Chriſt and Man, as the inſtrument of
conveyance of his fulneſs unto man, and of maintaining
union and communion with him, acteth variouſly and
differently upon God in Chriſt; for, Faith is the very
ſhaping out of a mans heart, according to Gods contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Salvation by Chriſt Jeſus, in whom <hi>it pleaſed
the Father that fulneſs ſhould dwell;</hi> So that let Chriſt
turn what way he will, Faith turneth and pointeth that
way. Now, he turneth all ways, in which he can be
uſeful to poor man, and therefore faith acteth according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on him, for drawing out of that fulneſs, according to
a mans caſe and condition. As for example, The ſoul is
naked, deſtitute of a covering to keep it from the ſtorms
of Gods wrath; Chriſt is fine <hi>raiment,</hi> Rev. 3. 17, 18.
Then accordingly Faiths work here is to put on the Lord
Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. The Soul is hungry and thirſty after
ſomewhat that may everlaſtingly ſatisfy: Chriſt Jeſus is
<hi>Milk, Wine, Water, Bread of Life,</hi> and the true <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
Iſa. 55. 1, 2. Joh. 6. 4, 51. He is the feaſt of
Fat things, and of Wine refined, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 6. Then the
work and exerciſe of faith, is, to go buy, eat and drink
abundantly, <hi>Iſa. 55. 1. Joh.</hi> 6. 53. 57. The ſoul is
purſued for guilt more or leſs, and is not Law-biding;
Chriſt Jeſus is the City of refuge, and the High-Prieſt
there, during whoſe life-time (that is for ever) the
poor man who wins this, is ſafe. Then the work and
exerciſe of faith is to flee thither for refuge, to lay hold
on the hope ſet before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. In a word,
whatſoever way he may benefit poor man, ſo he ſpeaketh
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34737:26"/>
of himſelf; and as he holdeth out himſelf in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſo faith doth point toward him. If he be a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
faith will go out in a marriage relation; If he
be a Father, Faith pleads the man to be a child; If he
be a ſhepherd, faith pleads the man may be one of his
ſheep; if he be a Lord, faith calls him ſo, which none
can do but by the Spirit of Jeſus; If he be dead and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
again for our Juſtification, faith believeth God hath
raiſed him on that account. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. whereſoever he
be, there would faith be; and whatſoever he is, faith
would be ſomewhat proportionally. For, by faith the
heart is ſhapen out in breadth and length for him: yea,
when the fame and report of him goeth abroad in his
truth, although faith ſee not much, yet it believeth on
his Name, upon the very fame he hath ſent abroad of
himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
            <p>But here for avoiding of miſtakes, conſider, 1. That
although juſtifying Faith acteth ſo variouſly; yet every
Believer, who hath a good title to Chriſt Jeſus, hath
not all theſe various actings and exerciſes of Faith; for
his condition craveth them not: and alſo the Maſter is
pleaſed not to lead out the faith of ſome perſons at ſome
times in ſome of theſe ways (for reaſons known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf)
even when their neceſſity (to their apprehenſion)
calleth for ſuch acting of faith. Surely every one dare
not ſay, <hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
would not have gon up with that woman I ſpake of,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 15. but would have been diſcouraged and quit the
purſuit. It is on this account that Chriſt doth highly
commend the faith of ſome, beyond the faith of others,
<hi>Mat. 8. 10. and</hi> 15. 28. Many good people are much
diſquieted about their faith, becauſe it goeth not out in
all thoſe ways we find recorded in Scripture; But there
is hardly and man will be found, whoſe faith hath acted
all theſe ways. 2. Many of theſe actings of faith are
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34737:26"/>
much intended and remitted. They are ſometimes ſtrong
and vigorous, and diſcernable; and ſometimes they fail,
and misbelief doth prevail, ſo as it were an uncertain
thing to judge of a mans eſtate by theſe. We find the
Saints very different from themſelves in regard of the
actings of faith ſometimes, as we ſhewed before. 3. Each
one of theſe actings of faith, ſpeaketh good to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in whom it is, and hath promiſes annexed unto it, as
we have ſaid. Yet 4. Although theſe <hi>Actings</hi> of faith
have promiſes annexed unto them, they are not, for that,
the condition of the New Conenant; for then every one
behoved to have each one of them, which is not true, as
we have ſaid before. A promiſe is made to him who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh,
but perſeverance is not the condition of the
New Covenant, but doth ſuppoſe it. There are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
made to the exerciſes of all Graces in Scripture; but
only faith is the condition of the Covenant. I ſay then
theſe promiſes are made to theſe actings of Faith, not as
ſuch, but as they do ſuppoſe Juſtifying faith, which is
the condition of the Covenant: All theſe are actings of
faith, but not as it is juſtifying. Therefore 5. There is
ſomewhat common to all gracious perſons, which may be
ſuppoſed by all the foreſaid actings of faith, wherein the
nature and eſſence of juſtifying faith ſtandeth; and this
is the hearts satisfaction about Gods contrivance of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Chriſt; when man pleadeth Gods invention of
ſatisfaction to juſtice through Jeſus Chriſt, in whom all
fulneſs doth dwell now by the Fathers pleaſure; when
the ſoul and heart of man acquieſceth in that, then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
unto Salvation. As at firſt, the Lord made man
ſuitable to the Covenant of Works, by creating him
perfect, and ſo putting him in a capacity to perform his
Will in that Covenant: So under the New Covenant,
when God giveth the new heart to man, he ſets the <hi>Idea</hi>
and ſtamp of all his device in the New Covenant upon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34737:27"/>
the man, ſo as there is a conſonancy to Gods will there:

this is believing or faith, very oppoſite to works, and all
reſting thereupon: this cannot fail to be in all gracious
perſons, in whom many of the actions of faith are not to
be found. This doth clearly ſuppoſe known diſtreſs in a
man, without all relief in himſelf; this ſuppoſeth known
fulneſs in Chriſt as the alone ſufficient relief, this imports
a ſort of impropriation: for the heart pleaſing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivement,
it ſo far ſwayeth towards it. This is a thing
clearly ſuppoſed in all the actings of faith, ſpoken of
before. He that greedily <hi>hungereth,</hi> hath this; and he
that <hi>leaneth</hi> hath this, and he that <hi>putteth on Chriſt</hi> hath
this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is to eſteem Chriſt the <hi>wiſdom and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

this account Chriſt, who is the rejected ſtone to many,

and beautify the <hi>tottering building, and fabrick of

finding a treaſure, for which with joy he ſelleth all,</hi> Mat.
13. 44. Theſe words hold out the very way of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>viz.</hi> Salvation is diſcovered in the Goſpel to be by
Chriſt; the heart vallueth that invention as ſatisfying.
This is to believe on the Son of God <hi>lifted up,</hi> which is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34737:27"/>
compared to the <hi>looking up to the brazen Serpent, John</hi> 3.
14. It was mans <hi>approbation</hi> of that <hi>device,</hi> which made
it effectual for his <hi>healing.</hi> So is it here, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,
ſetteth to his ſeal that God is true. True!</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?
In that record he hath born, <hi>That God hath provided
life for men; and placed it all in Chriſt,</hi> 1. Joh. 5. 10.
11. <hi>He that believeth not, maketh God a lyer.</hi> Where?
In his ſaying that Chriſt is a ſafe and ſure way to Heaven.
This is well pleaſed with and acquieſcing in that deviſe,
and it is conſonant to all, I know, ſpoken of <hi>Juſtifying
Faith in Scripture.</hi> This is in the believing on Chriſt and
on his Name, the receiving of him, and reſting on him
for <hi>Salvation</hi> in our <hi>Catechiſm.</hi> The <hi>believing that Jeſus
is the Chriſt,</hi> that is, <hi>the Anointed one</hi> whom the father
hath ſealed, and ſet apart and qualified for the work of
reconciling man unto God; and <hi>he that believeth that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
is the Christ, is born of God, 1. Joh.</hi> 5. 1. This is
to believe <hi>with the heart that God hath raiſed Chriſt from
the dead.</hi> The man believeth Chriſt died, and is raiſed
on the account of <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for mans <hi>tranſgreſſion:</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
may believe that. Nay, but the man I ſpeak of,
<hi>believeth it with his heart,</hi> (which no natural man doth,
untill a new heart be given unto him) that is, he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially
pleadeth, is ſatisfied with, and acquieſceth in this
noble invention. And thus faith layeth out it ſelf now
and then in its actings, out-goings, and excrciſe. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all the Covenant relations, under which Chriſt is
held forth in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Now; I ſay, This faith is diſcernable, not only in
theſe actings many times; a man may know if his heart
doth hunger after Chriſt and flee for refuge to him, when
purſued, and if he doth commit himſelf unto God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but alſo in its very nature, as it is juſtifying, it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable,
and may be known. A man may clearly know,

fame of Chriſts fulneſs, his heart is well pleaſed with
Gods contrivement in the new Covenant, if it goeth out
after Chriſt in that invention, and pleadeth him a Lord of
the life of men, terminating and reſting there, and no
where elſe, acquieſcing in that contrivement with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

Therefore I beſeech men impartially to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and if they find that their heart hath cloſed ſo
with that invention of ſalvation, and is gone out after him
as precious, that thereupon they would conclude a ſure
and true intereſt in Chriſt Jeſus, and a good claim and
title to the crown, ſince <hi>he that helieveth ſhall never periſh,
but have everlaſting life.</hi> John 3. 16. 36.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Hypocrites and Reprobates have a ſort of faith,
and are ſaid to believe,</hi> Joh. 2. 23. Acts 3. 13. <hi>and
cannot chooſe but go out after Chriſt, and that invention of
Salvation, when they hear of it; and they profeſs they do
ſo, yet are deluded, and ſo may I be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To ſay nothing of that thought of your heart,
[whereby you wonder that any man ſhould not pleaſe
the contrivement of ſalvation by Chriſt, and lead out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him] as a very promiſing thing, and ſpeaking out
juſtifying faith to be in your boſom; and to ſay nothing
in contradiction to that which you think, That a natural
man whilſt ſuch, and before he get a new heart, can
pleaſe that contrivement, and believe with his heart and
affectionately, that which perfectly overthroweth the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works, and abaſeth man in the point of ſelf-righteouſneſs
already attained, or that can be won at by
him, which is inconſiſtent with many Scriptural truths;
I offer theſe differences between the faith of all Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
or reprobates, and that true ſaving juſtifying faith
whereof we have ſpoken. 1. They never cloſe with
Jeſus Chriſt (in that contrivement) and him <hi>alone</hi> as a
ſufficient covering of the eyes, as is ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:34737:29"/>
to <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 20. 16. They ſtill hold faſt ſomewhat
of their own, at leaſt to help to procure Gods favour
and ſalvation: Their heart doth ſtill ſpeak, as that young
mans ſpeech, <hi>Luke.</hi> 18 18, 21. doth inſinuate, <hi>What
want I that I may inherit life?</hi> Beſide that, they do ſtill
retain their former lovers, and will not break their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
with Hell and Death, imagining they may have
Chriſt with theſe things equally ſharing in their heart,
contrary to that, <hi>A man cannot ſerve two Masters,
Mat.</hi> 6. 24. Either Chriſt muſt be judged abſolute
Lord, and worthy to be ſo, or nothing at all. And ſo
it is clear, their heart is not ſhapen out for that way of
ſalvation by Chriſt, whom God hath alone made Lord
here, in whom all fulneſs ſhall dwell. But where juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
faith is, the ſoul of a man and his heart doth cloſe
with Chriſt, and him alone, having no confidence in the
fleſh, <hi>Phil. 3. 3. Pſal.</hi> 62. 5. he truſteth only in God.
As alſo the man here giveth up with other lovers, as
they ſtand in competition with Chriſt; they reſolve not
to be for another, <hi>Hoſ,</hi> 3. 3. They call him <hi>Lord,</hi>
which a man can only do by the Spirit of Chriſt, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 3. 2. As Hypocrites and Reprobates do never cloſe
with Chriſt alone; ſo they do never cloſe with <hi>full</hi> Chriſt
as he is annointed to be a King to rule over a man in all
things; a Prieſt, to procure pardon, and to make peace
for man upon all occaſions; a Prophet, to be wiſdom,
and a Teacher and Counſellor in all caſes to man. So
they do not receive Chriſt, eſpecially in the firſt and
third offices. But where true juſtifying faith is, a man
cloſeth with <hi>whole</hi> Chriſt in all his offices, judging all
his will good, holy, juſt and ſpiritual, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12.
and right concerning all things, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 128. mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mention of his righteouſneſs only, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71, 16.
The man alſo giveth up himſelf to be taught of him,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. So that Chriſt is made to the true believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34737:30"/>
with his own conſent, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and compleat redemption, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. And
although he hath not all theſe things formally in exerciſe
when his heart goeth out after Chriſt; yet, upon ſearch
and tryal, it will be found with him as I have ſaid. 3. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
and Reprobates do never cloſe with Chriſt, and
all the inconveniencies may follow him; they ſtick at
that, with that man <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 19. 20. But where true
juſtifying ſaith is, a man doth cloſe with him on all
hazards; he reſolveth to forego all, rather than to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 28. he reckoneth all to be loſs and
dung for the excellency of Chriſt Jeſus, as his Lord, and
to be found in him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. We might give other
differences alſo, as that true faith is operative, purifying
the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. working by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 44.
Whilſt Hypocrites do only cleanſe the outſide of the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Mat. 23. 25. and do all to be ſeen of men,</hi> Mat 6. 5.
not ſeeking the honour that is of God only, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe, <hi>John.</hi> 5. 6. We might alſo ſhew that true
faith is never alone in a man, but attended with other
ſaving graces: But becauſe theſe things will co-incide
with what followeth, and here we are ſhewing that a
man may take up his gracious ſtate by his faith, and the
actings thereof on Chriſt, we paſs theſe things.</p>
            <p>The ſecond great mark of a gracious ſtate and true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, is, the new creature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature.</hi>
That new creation or renovation of that man, is a very
ſenſible change, although not in thoſe who are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
called from the womb, or in their younger years;
becauſe thoſe have had this new creature from that time
in them, ſo as this charge in after period of time, is not
diſcernable: yet in thoſe who have been regenerated
and brought unto Chriſt, after they were come to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
age, and ſo have been more palpably unde the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34737:30"/>
of darkneſs, before they were tranſlated into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. But in all who do warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
pretend to Chriſt, this new creature muſt be, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſome do not know experimentally the contraries of
every part of it, ſo as others do, becauſe they have not
been equally, in regard of practice, under the power of
darkneſs. This new creature is called the <hi>new man,
Gal.</hi> 3. 10. which doth hold out the extent of it. It is
not ſimply a new tongue, or a new hand, but <hi>a new man.</hi>
There is a principle of new life and motion put in the
man, which is, the new heart: which new principle of
life ſendeth forth acts of life, or of conformity to the
image of him who created it, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. So as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is renewed in ſome meaſure every way. This reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the man who is in Chriſt, may be reduced to
theſe two great heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is a renovation, of the mans perſon, ſoul
and body, in ſome meaſure. 1. His underſtanding is
renewed, ſo as he judgeth Chriſt Preached in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
to be the wiſdom and power of God, a wiſe, ſtrong
contrivement beſeeming God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23, 24. He
knoweth the things of God really and ſolidly, not to be
yea and nay, and uncertain fancies, but all to be yea
and amen, ſolid, certain, ſubſtantial things, having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
accompliſhment in Chriſt, and reſolving much
in him, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 15. 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 18. Natural men, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
under Goſpel ordinances, although they have ſome
notional knowledge of God, Chriſt, Promiſes, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the holy Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo as they may Confer,
Preach, and diſpute of theſe things; yet they look on
them as common received Maxims of Chriſtianity, from
which to recede were a ſingularity and diſgrace; but
not as real, ſolid, ſubſtantial truths, ſo as to adventure
their Souls and Everlaſting being on them. The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is renewed alſo to take up ſomewhat of God in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34737:31"/>
the creatures, as bearing ſparks of his glorious attribute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Soul?</hi> Pſal. 42. 5. Pſal. 43. 5. <hi>Return unto thy

are renewed. The heart is made a new heart, a hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of fleſh, capable of impreſſions, having a copy of his
law ſtamped on it, and fear of God put into it, whereby
the mans duty becometh in a manner native and kindly to
the man, <hi>Jer. 32. 39, 40. Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a heart of ſtone, void of the fear of God, The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are renewed now. The love is renewed in ſome
good meaſure: it goeth out after God; <hi>I will love the
Lord,</hi> Pſal. 18. 1. after his Law, <hi>O how I love thy Law</hi>
Pſal. 119. 97. after thoſe who have Gods Image in
them, <hi>John 13. 35. 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 14. This love to Gods
people is upon a pure account, as they are the children
of God, and do keep his Statutes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. It is
with a pure heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 63. and therefore it goeth
towards all ſuch whom the man knoweth or apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be ſuch, <hi>Pſal. 119. 63. I am a Companion to al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them, &amp;c.</hi> In all caſes and conditions, even where there
is nothing to beautify or commend but the Image of God
And this love is ſo fervent many times, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
it putteth it ſelf out in all relations, ſo as a man ſeeketh
a Godly Wife, a Godly Maſter, a Godly Servant, a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Counſellor, if he have to chooſe upon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 6.

               <hi>imperfections</hi> and <hi>infirmities, difference in opinion, wrong

of good according to its meaſure, and as the
caſe of the poor godly requireth, <hi>Pſal. 16. 2. 1 John</hi> 3.
17, 18. 19. The mans hatred is alſo renewed, and is
now bent <hi>againſt ſin, Pſal. 119. 113. I hate vain thoughts:</hi>
againſt Gods enemies, as ſuch, <hi>Pſal. 139. 21, 22. Do
not I hate them that hate thee? &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>joy</hi> or <hi>delight</hi> is
renewed, for it runneth towards God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25.
<hi>Whom have I in Heaven? &amp;c.</hi> towards <hi>his Law</hi> and <hi>Will,
Pſal. 1. 2. His delight is in the Law of the Lord.</hi> And
towards the <hi>Godly</hi> and <hi>their followſhip, Pſal.</hi> 16. 3.—
<hi>In whom is all my delight.</hi> The ſorrow is turned againſt
ſin which hath wronged Chriſt, <hi>Zech. 12. 10. Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

11. The ſorrow is godly there, and againſt what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croacheth
upon Gods honour; they are ſorrowful for the
—aſſemblies, and the reproach of that is their burden,
<hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 18. There is ſome renovation in all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
as in every other part of the ſoul pointing now
towards God. 3. The <hi>very outward members of the man
are renewed,</hi> as the Scriptures ſpeak, the tongue, the eye,

which once were improved <hi>as weapons of unrighteouſneſs

            <p>Secondly, <hi>A man who is in Chriſt, is renewed in

to fear him for ever; he hath engaged to <hi>put his law in
mens heart, to put his fear in their heart, to make them
keep that Law; to put his Spirit within them to cauſe
them to keep it:</hi> He hath promiſed to <hi>ſatisfie the Prieſts
with fatneſs, that the ſouls of the people may be ſatiated
with goodneſs,</hi> and to <hi>keep, and water them continually
every moment, Ezek 26. 29. Jer.</hi> 32. 39, 49. and 31.
33. <hi>Ezek. 36. 27. Jer.</hi> 31. 14. and 31. 12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.
3. and if he muſt be enquired to do all theſe things unto
men, he engageth to <hi>pour out the Spirit of grace and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
on them,</hi> and ſo to learn them how to ſeek theſe
things, and how to put him to it, to do all for them,
<hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. Secondly, for the ſatisfaction of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
I grant this new creature, as we have circumſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and inlarged it, will not be found, in all the degrees
of it, in every gracious perſon. But it is well, if 1.
There be a new man, we cannot grant leſs; <hi>If any man
be in Chriſt, there muſt be a new creature;</hi> and that is
the new man, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 21, 22, 23, 24. which all
muſt put on who are ſavingly taught of Chriſt, There
muſt be ſome renewing after the image of God in a mans
ſoul and body; There muſt be ſomewhat of every part of
the man pointing towards God: although I grant every
one cannot prove this to others, neither diſcern it in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
becauſe many know not the diſtinct parts of the ſoul,
nor pieces of reformation competent to every part of ſoul
and body. Yet it will be found there is ſome ſuch thing
in them, yea, they have a witneſs of it within them, if you
make the thing plain and clear to them what it is. 2.
There muſt be ſuch a reſpect unto Gods known Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
that a man doth not allow peaceably any known
iniquity to dwell in him, for <hi>what concord is between
light and darkneſs? 2 Cor. 6. 14, 15, 16. Pſal.</hi> 119.
and 66. 18. <hi>he muſt not regard iniquity.</hi> I grant men
may be ignorant of many commands, and many ſins, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34737:34"/>
may imagine in ſome caſes, that ſome ſins are not
hateful unto God. But ſuppoſing that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in theſe things, there can be no agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
righteouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs. 3. Men muſt
point towards all the Law of God, in their honeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions;
for this is nothing elſe, than to give up the
heart unto God, to put his Law in it without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is a part of the Covenant we are to make
with God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. I grant many know not how
to point towards Gods Law in all their wayes; but
if it be made manifeſt unto them, how that ſhould be
done, they will point at it. And it is true, they will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times fail of their reſolutions in their practice; yet
when they have failed, they can ſay, They did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
other-wayes, and will yet honeſtly, and without
guile reſolve to do other wayes, and it will prove their
affliction to have failed of their reſolution, when the
Lord diſcovereth it to them, which he will in due time.
4. When we are to judge of our ſtate by the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
we muſt do it at a convenient time, when we are
in good caſe, at leaſt, not when we are in worſt caſe;
for the fleſh and ſpirit do Luſt and Fight againſt other,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. and ſometimes the one, and ſometimes the
other doth prevail. Now I ſay, we muſt chuſe a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
time, when the ſpiritual part is not by ſome ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
worſted and over-powred by the fleſh; for in that
caſe the new creature is recoyled back in its ſtreams,
and much returned to the fountain and the habits, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in ſome ſmall things not eaſily diſcernable, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it maketh oppoſition to the fleſh, according to the
foreſaid Scripture: for, now it is time of winter in the
ſoul, and we may not expect fruit, yea, not leaves, as
in ſome other ſeaſon; only here, leſt profane Atheiſts
ſhould make advantage of this, we will ſay, <hi>That the
Spirit doth often prevail over the fleſh in a godly man, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34737:34"/>
the ſcope, aim, tenour, and drift of his way is in the Law
of the Lord,</hi> that is his walk. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 1. whereas the path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and ordinary courſe of the wicked is ſin, as is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
hinted in the book of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon.</hi> And
if it happen that a godly man be over-maſtered by any
tranſgreſſion, ordinarily it is his ſad exerciſe; and we
ſuppoſe he keeps it ſtill in dependency before God, to
have it rectified, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal. 56. 13. Wilt
thou not deliver my feet from falling?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Athriſts and Hypocrites may have great chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and renovation wrought upon them, and in them, and
I fear mine be ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I grant that Atheiſts and hypocrites have
many things in them which do look like the new Creature.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In regard of the parts of the man. They may
(1.) Come to much knowledge, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They
are enlightned. (2.) There may be a zeal amongſt
their affections, as they receive the word with joy, <hi>Mat.</hi>
13. 20. (3.) They may reach a great deal of outward
reformation in the outward man, both about freedom
from ſin, and engagement to poſitive duty, as that Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee
did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 11, 12. Yea, (4.) In regard of
their practical underſtanding, they may judge ſome things
of God to be excellent. The people ſaid that never man
ſpake as Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 7. 46.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hypocrites, may have a great deal of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
(1) They may talk of the Law and Goſpel,
and Covenant, as the wicked do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16. (2.)
They may confeſs ſin openly to their own ſhame, as King
<hi>Saul</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 21. (3) They may humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in ſackcloth with <hi>Ahab, 1 Kings</hi> 21. 27. (4.)
They may enquire buſily after duty, and come chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to receive it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 2. (5) They may joyn with
Gods intereſt in a hard and difficult time, as <hi>Demas,</hi> and
other hypocrites in the book of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:34737:35"/>
who afterwards fell off. (6.) They may give much of
their goods to God and the Saints, as <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 1, 2. if
not all their goods, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. Yea, (7.) It is not
impoſſible for ſome ſuch, being ſtraitly engaged in their
credit, to give their bodies to be burnt, as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
place.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hypocrites may advance far in the common
and ordinary ſteps of a Chriſtian work, ſuch as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
have, when God leads them captive. As, (1)
They may be under great convictions of ſin, as <hi>Judas</hi>
was, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 3, 4, 5. So was King <hi>Saul</hi> often. (2.)
They may tremble at the word of God, and be under
much terror, as <hi>Felix</hi> was, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25. (3.) They
may rejoyce in receiving of the Truth, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20.
(4.) They may be in ſome peace and quiet in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſalvation by Chriſt, as the fooliſh Virgins were,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 24. (5.) All this may be backed and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with ſome good meaſure of reformation. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
ſpirit may go out of them, <hi>Mat. 22. 43. Luke</hi>
18. 11, 12. (6.) This work may ſeem to be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſome ſpecial experiences and taſtings of the good
word of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hypocrites may have ſome things very like
the ſaving graces of the Spirit: As, (1) They may have
a ſort of faith with <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8. 13. (2.)
A ſort of repentance, and walk mournfully, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14.
(3.) A great fear of God, ſuch as <hi>Balaam,</hi> who for
a houſe full of <hi>gold</hi> would not go with the meſſenger of
<hi>Balak,</hi> without leave asked of God, and given, <hi>Num.</hi> 22.
18. (4.) They have a ſort of hope, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 13. (5.)
They have ſome <hi>love:</hi> So had <hi>Herod</hi> to <hi>John, Mar.</hi> 6.
26. I need not to inſiſt, it is out of all queſtion they have
counterfeits of all ſaving gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ces.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They have ſomewhat like the ſpecial commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
of God, and the witneſſing of his Spirit, as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34737:35"/>
ſomewhat like the Powers of the World to come pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
on them, with ſome flaſhes of joy ariſing thence,
as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. Notwithſtanding all which they are
but almoſt perſwaded with <hi>Agrippa</hi> to be Chriſtians,
<hi>Acts</hi> 26. 28.</p>
            <p>It were tedious to ſpeak particularly to each of theſe
things, and to clear up, that they are all but rotten ware:
I ſhall condeſcend upon ſome few things, wherein a truly
renewed man, who is in Chriſt, doth differ from hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
and reprobates.</p>
            <p>1. Whatſoever change be in Hypocrites yet their heart
is not changed, and made new. The new heart is only
given to the Elect, when they are converted, and brought
under the bond of the Covenant, <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r. 32. 39 Ezek.</hi>
36. 26. Hypocrites did never apprehend Chriſt as the
only ſatisfying good in all the world, for which with joy,
they would quit all: for then the Kingdom of God were
entred in them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 44. The truly renewed man
dare and can upon good ground ſay, and hath a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of it from on high, that his heart hath been changed
in taking up of Chriſt, and hath been led out after him,
as the only enriching Treaſure, in whom to be found,
he accounteth all things elſe loſs and dung, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. 9.</p>
            <p>2. Whatſoever reformation and profeſſion Hypocrites
do attain unto, as it cometh not from a new heart, and
pure principle of zeal for God, ſo it is alwayes for ſome
wicked and by-end, as to be ſeen of men. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 5.
or to evite and ſhun ſome outward ſtrait, to be free of
Gods wrath, and the trouble of their own conſcience,
<hi>Iſa. 59. 3. Mal.</hi> 3. 14. In teſtimony of this, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have reſpect to all known commands, elſe they ſhould
never be aſhamed, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 6. nor do they without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
guile in their own heart, reſolve againſt a very
known iniquity; elſe they were freed of heart-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and ſo might juſtly have confidence before God.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34737:36"/>
1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 20. If in never ſo mean a caſe, they did from
a principle of love unto, and of zeal for Chriſt, and for
a right end, confeſs and profeſs him, Chriſt were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his own word to confeſs them before his Father,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 30.</p>
            <p>3. Whatſoever length Hypocrites advance in that work,
by which the people are led in unto Chriſt. yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeek, <hi>Firſt,</hi> the kingdom of God and the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
thereof, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. the one thing that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) Chriſts friendſhip and fellowſhip, is never their
<hi>one</hi> thing, and heart-ſatisfying choice; elſe that better
part would never be taken from them, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42.</p>
            <p>4. Whatſoever counterfeits of grace are in hypocrites,
yet they are all bred there, without any ſaving work of
the Spirit of Chriſt, and it is enough to exclude them
from the benefit of this mark, that they are never deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to thoſe things, nor emptied of them, but ſtill to reſt
on them as their Saviour, ſo that they ſubmit not unto
the righteouſneſs of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. and that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to keep them at a diſtance from Chriſt, who will
never clout that old garment of hypocrites with his fine
new Linnen, nor put his new Wine in theſe old bottels,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>5. We may ſay, let Hypocrites, Reprobates, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts
have what they can, they want the three great
eſſentials of Religion and true Chriſtianity. Firſt, They
are not broken in themſelves, and emptied even of their
righteouſneſs, the length of ſelf-loathing, yet lying open
for relief. Such loſt ones Chriſt came to ſeek and ſave,
<hi>Luke</hi> 19. 10. Secondly, They never took up Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
as the only treaſure and jewel that can only enrich,
and ſhould ſatisfie, and therefore have never cordially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
unto Gods contrivement in the Covenant, and ſo
are not worthy of him; neither hath the Kingdom of
God ſavingly entred into their heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 44. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34737:36"/>
They never in earneſt do cloſe with Chriſts whole
yoke without exception, judging all his will juſt and good,
holy and ſpiritual, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12. and therefore no
reſt allowed on them by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whoſoever thou art who canſt lay clear and juſt claim
to theſe three foreſaid things, thou art beyond the reach
of all atheiſts, hypocrites and reprobates in the world,
as having anſwered the great ends and intents of Law and
Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>I am clear ſometimes, I think to lay claim to
that mark of the new creature; yet at other times, ſin doth
ſo prevail over me, that I am made to queſtion all the work
within me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is much to be lamented, that people pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
his Name, ſhould be ſo ſlighted and enſlaved by
trangreſſion as many are. Yet in anſwer to the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if it be ſeriouſly propounded, we ſay, the Saints
are found in Scripture juſtly laying claim unto God and
his Covenant, when iniquity did prevail over them, as
we find, <hi>Pſal. 65. 3. Iniquities prevail againſt me, as
for our trangreſſions, thus wilt do them away,</hi> Rom. 7. 25.
<hi>Paul</hi> thanks God through Chriſt, when a law in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
leads him captive unto ſin: But for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and ſafe application of ſuch truths, we muſt
difference betwixt groſs outbreakings and ordinary infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
or ſins that come unawares upon a man, without
fore-thought or any deliberation. As for the former ſort
it is hard for a man, whileſt he is under the power of
them, to ſee his gracious change, although it be in him,
and very hard to draw any comfort from it, until the man
be in ſome meaſure recovered, and beginning ſeriouſly
to reſent ſuch ſins, and to reſolve againſt them. We find
<hi>David</hi> calling himſelf Gods ſervant, quickly after his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
of Gods people, but he was then under the ſerious
reſentment of ſin, <hi>Sam. 24. 18. Jonah</hi> layeth claim to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34737:37"/>
God as his Maſter under his rebellion, but he is then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
it, and in a ſpirit of revenge againſt himſelf for
his ſin, <hi>Jon</hi> 1. 9, 10, 12. Next, as for theſe ſins of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
and daily incurſion, and heart-ills, ſuch as theſe
whereof <hi>Paul</hi> doth complain (it is like) were. We
ſhall draw out ſome things from that ſeventh Chapter to
the <hi>Romans,</hi> whereupon <hi>Paul</hi> maintains his intereſt in
Chriſt; and if you can apply them it is well. (1.) When
<hi>Paul</hi> findeth that he doth much fail, and cannot reach
conformity to Gods Law, he doth not blame the Law, as
being too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rict, ſo as men cannot keep it, as Hypocrites
uſe to ſpeak, but he doth blame himſelf as being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
and he ſaith of the Law, that it is Good Holy
and Spiritual, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 12, 14. (2.) He can ſay, he
failed of a good which he intended and did out-ſhoot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and he had often honeſtly reſolved againſt the evil
which he fell into, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15, 18, 19. (3.) He ſaith
that the prevailing of ſin over him is his exerciſe, ſo as he
judgeth himſelf wretched, becauſe of ſuch a body of
death, from which he longeth to be delivered, <hi>Rom:</hi> 7.
24, (4.) He ſaith, that whilſt he is under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and law of ſin, There is ſomewhat in the bottom of

if ye can lay claim to theſe things (1.) If you do blame

good before the evil break in upon you. (3.) If

as to judge your ſelf wretched, becauſe of ſuch

of ſuch things. (4.) If you can ſay, that there is
a party within you oppoſing theſe evils, which would be
at the right way, and, as it were, is in its Element,
when it is in Gods way, it is well; only be adviſed not
to take reſt until in ſome meaſure, you be rid of the
ground of this objection, or at leaſt, until you can very

a good help againſt the prevailing power of ſin, is, to

            <p>Fifthly, There is a thing called <hi>Liberty</hi> before God
and this properly is freedom, or free ſpeaking unto God
many do much queſtion their ſtate, becauſe of the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:34737:39"/>
ſpaking before God. I grant where the Spirit of the
Lord doth ſavingly diſcover Gods will in the Scripture to
a man, There is liberty from any obligation to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law, and from the condemning power of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law, and from much of that groſs darkneſs and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
which is on natural hearts as a vail hiding Chriſt
in the Goſpel from them. I grant alſo, that ſometimes,
even this liberty which is a free communion with God,
<hi>and ordering of our caſe before him, and filling of our mouths
with Arguments,</hi> Job. 23. 4. is granted to the godly,
but not as liberty taken in the former ſences. Although
<hi>the Lord hath obliged himſelf to pour out the Spirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
upon all the houſe of</hi> David <hi>in ſome meaſure</hi> Zech. 12.
10. Yet this communication of the Spirit, which we call
<hi>liberty,</hi> or free ſpeaking unto God, dependeth much on
the Lords abſolute pleaſure, when, and what meaſure
to allow it. This liberty which we call freedom, or free
ſpeaking with God in prayer, is ſometimes much abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from any great confidence in the time of prayer, (at
leaſt, until it draw towards the cloſe of it) it ſtandeth
much in a vivacity of the underſtanding to take up the caſe
which a man is to ſpeak before God, ſo as he can or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his caſe; and next, there be words or verbal expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
elegant, ſuitable, and very emphatical, or powerful
and pithy; there is alſo joyned a fervency of ſpirit in
prayer, whereof the Scripture ſpeaketh; the ſoul is hot
and bended, and very intent: There is alſo ordinarily
in this liberty, a ſpecial melting of the heart (often joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a great meaſure of the Spirit of grace and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>Zech.</hi> 10. 11.) for ſo the ſoul in poured out before
God as for a firſt born: Such is the liberty, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Saints get before God, whilſt in much brekenneſs of
heart, and fervency of ſpirit, they are admitted to ſpeak
their mind fully to God, as a Living God, noticing (at
leaſt) their Prayer. Sometimes this liberty is joyned
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34737:40"/>
with <hi>confidence,</hi> and then it is not only a free, but alſo
a bold ſpeaking before God; <hi>it is that boldneſs with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
Epheſ.</hi> 3. 12. this is more rarely imparted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men than the former, yet it is ordinary. It hath in it
beſide what we ſpake before, ſome influence of the Spirit
upon faith, making it put out ſome vigorous acting in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
there is a ſweet mournful frame of Spirit, by which
a man poureth out his heart in Gods boſome, and with
ſome confidence of his Favour and good will, pleadeth
his cauſe before him, <hi>as a living God;</hi> and this is all
the ſenſible preſence that many Saints do attain unto:
there is no ground of doubt about a mans eſtate in point
of liberty before God in this laſt ſence, becauſe there is
nothing eſſential to the making up of a gracious ſtate
here: ſome have it, ſome want; ſome have it at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and not at other times, ſo that it is much up and
down; yet I may ſay, gracious men may do much (by
a very ordinary influence) in contributing towards the
attaining and retaining, or keeping of ſuch a frame of
ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, There is a thing called <hi>Influence,</hi> or <hi>breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Spirit.</hi> This gracious influence (for of ſuch
only do I now ſpeak) is either <hi>ordinary,</hi> and this is the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the holy Spirit on the ſoul; and the habits of
grace there, whereby they are ſtill kept alive, and in
ſome exerciſe and acting, although not very diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
This influence (I conceive) doth alwayes attend
Believers, <hi>and is that keeping and watering night and day,
and every moment,</hi> promiſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 3. Or, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
is more <hi>ſingular</hi> and ſpecial, and is the ſame to
a gracious (although a withered) ſoul, <hi>as the wind and
breath to the dry bones, putting them in good eaſe, Ezek.</hi>
37. 9, 10. <hi>And as the dew or rain to the graſs, or newly
mowen field and parched ground. Pſal.</hi> 72. 6. Such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
is meant, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16. by the blowing of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34737:40"/>
               <hi>South wind, making the Spices to flow out.</hi> When the
<hi>Spirit</hi> moveth thus, there is an edge put upon the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es
of God in the ſoul, and they are mad to act more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orouſly.
This <hi>is the inlarging of the heart, by which a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth run in the wayes of God, Pſal.</hi> 119. 32. This
influence is more diſcernable than the former, and not ſo
ordinarily communicated. Alſo here, ſometimes the
wind bloweth more upon one grace, and ſometimes more
diſcernably upon another, and often upon many of the
graces together; and according to the leſſer, or greater
meaſure of this influence, the ſoul acteth more or leſs
vigorouſly towards God: and ſince faith is a created
grace in the ſoul, this influence of the Spirit is upon it,
ſometimes leſs, ſometimes more, and accordingly is the
aſſurance of faith, ſmall or great.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, There is the <hi>hearing</hi> of prayer often ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in Scripture, and many vex themſelves about it,
alleadging that they know nothing of it experimentally.
I grant there is a favourable hearing of prayer: But we
muſt remember it is two fold.</p>
            <p>Either, 1. It is ſuch as a man is ſimply to believe by
way of argument on Scriptural grounds. As if I be fled
unto Chriſt, and do approach unto God in him, pray ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will, <hi>not regarding iniquity in my heart,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
faith about the thing I pray for, abſolutely or
conditionally, according to the nature of the thing and
promiſes about it. I am obliged to believe that God
heareth my prayer, <hi>and will give what is good, according
to the Scriptures, Joh. 14. 13, 14. Whatſoever ye ask
in my name, I will do it,</hi> 1 John 5. 14. <hi>This is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
that whatſoever we ask according to his will, he
heareth us,</hi> Mark 3. 24. Believe that you receive, and
you ſhall have what you deſire, <hi>Pſal. 66. 18. If I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
iniquity, he will not hear.</hi> Then if I regard not ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
I may believe that he doth hear me.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34737:41"/>
Or, 2. A man doth ſenſibly perceive that God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his prayer, It is made out to his heart without
any ſyllogiſtical deduction. Such a hearing of prayer
got <hi>Hannah, 1 Sam. 1. 8. Her countenance was no more
ſad.</hi> Surely the Lord did breath upon her faith, and
made her believe that ſhe was heard, and ſhe could not
make it out by any argument, for ſhe had not grounds
whereupon to build the premiſes of the argument ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Scripture in that particular. God did ſtamp
it in ſome way upon her heart ſenſibly, and ſo made her
believe it. This is but rarely granted, eſpecially in caſes
clearly deducible in Scripture. And therefore people
are much to be ſatisfied in exerciſing their faith about the
other, and let God give of this latter what he pleaſeth.
A mans gracious ſtate ſhould not be brought upon debate,
upon the account of ſuch hearing of prayer.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, There is <hi>Aſſureance</hi> of Gods favour by the
witneſſing of our own ſpirits; which aſſurance, is dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by way of argument ſyllogiſtically, Thus, <hi>Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
believeth on Chriſt ſhall never periſh; But I do believe
on Chriſt: Therefore I ſhall never periſh. Whoſo hath
reſpect unto all Gods Commandments, ſhall never be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
But I have reſpect unto all his Commands: Therefore,
I ſhall never be aſhamed.</hi> I ſay, by reaſoning thus, and
comparing Spiritual things with ſpiritual things, a man
may attain unto a good certainty of his Gracious State.
It is ſuppoſed, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 18, 19. That by loving the
Brethren in deed and in truth, we may aſſure our hearts
before God, and <hi>that a man may rejoyce upon the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of a Good Conſcience, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 12. A man may
have confidence, if his heart do not condemn him, 1
<hi>John</hi> 3. 21. We may then attain unto ſome aſſurance
(although not full aſſurance) by the witneſs of our own
ſpirit. I do not deny, that in this witneſſing of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
towards Aſſurance, there is ſome concurrence of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34737:41"/>
Spirit of God. But, I conceive there needeth but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ordinary influence, without which we can do nothing.
Now, this aſſurance, ſuch as it is, may be reached by
intelligent Believers, who keep a good conſcience in their
walk. So I hope, there needs be no debate about it, as
to a mans gracious ſtate; for if a man will clear himſelf
of heart condemnings, he will ſpeedily reach this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, There is a Witneſſing of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
<hi>Rom. 8. 16. A bearing witneſs with our Spirits
that we are the Children of God.</hi> This operation of the
Spirit is beſt underſtood, if we produce any ſyllogiſm by
which our ſpirit doth witneſs our Sonſhip: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Whoſoever loveth the Brethren, <hi>is paſt from Death</hi>
to <hi>Life,</hi> and conſequently is in Chriſt, But I love the
Brethern; Therefore I am paſſed from Death to Life,
Here there is a threefold operation of the Spirit, or Three
Operations rather.</p>
            <p>The firſt is a beam of <hi>Divine Light</hi> upon the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
perſwading the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of it as the
Word of God; the <hi>Spirit of the Lord</hi> muſt witneſs the
<hi>Divinity of the Scripture,</hi> and that is the infallible Word
of God, far beyond all other arguments can be uſed for it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Operation is, <hi>A Glorious beam of Light from
the Spirit, ſhining upon the ſecond propoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> and ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>his own graces in the Soul,</hi> diſcovering them to be true
graces; and ſuch as the Scripture calleth ſo. Thus are
we ſaid to know <hi>by his Spirit, the things freely given to us
of God, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
            <p>The third Operation is, <hi>in order to the third propoſition
of the Argument, or the Concluſion;</hi> and this I conceive,
to be nothing elſe, but <hi>an influence upon Faith, ſtrengthning it
to draw a concluſion of full aſſurance upon the foreſaid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi>
Now (with ſubmiſſion unto others, who have
greater light in the Scripture, and more experience of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34737:42"/>
theſe precious communications) I do conceive the Witneſs
of the Spirit, or witneſs of it, which is mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
16. is not that firſt operation upon the firſt propoſition;
for that operation is that teſtimony of the Spirit, by which
he beareth witneſs to the Divinity of the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and aſſerteth the Divine authority of it unto the
ſouls of gracious men; and ſuch an operation may be
upon a truth of Scripture, which doth not relate to a mans
ſonſhip or intereſt in Chriſt at all. The Spirit may ſo
ſhine upon any truth, relating to duty, or any other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
truth perſwading the Divinity of it, upon and
unto the ſoul, and ſpeaking nothing relating to a mans
intereſt in Chriſt. Neither is the third operation of the
Spirit, by which he makes faith boldly draw the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
this witneſſing of the Spirit; for that operation
is nothing elſe but influence upon faith, bringing it out
to full aſſurance: but that whereupon this full aſſurance
is drawn or put out, is ſomewhat deponed and witneſſed
already. Therefore I conceive the ſecond operation of
the Spirit upon the ſecond propoſition, and ſo upon the
graces in the man, is that witneſs of Gods Spirit, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of divine light, ſhining upon thoſe graces, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are made very conſpicuous to the underſtanding:
That is the witneſs, the ſhining ſo on them in his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing:
For only here in this propoſition and in this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
doth the Spirit of God prove a co-witneſs
with our ſpirit: For, the main thing wherein the witneſs
of our ſpirit lyeth, is the ſecond propoſition, and ſo the
Spirit of God, witneſſing with our ſpirits, is alſo in that
ſame propoſition. So theſe two witneſſes, having depon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and witneſſed one and the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> The truth
and reality of ſuch and ſuch graces in the man, which
our own ſpirit or conſcience doth depone, according to
its knowledge, and the Spirit of the Lord doth certainly
affirm and witneſs to be ſo. There is a ſentence drawn forth,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34737:42"/>
and a concluſion of the mans ſonſhip, by the mans faith,
breathed upon by the ſpirit for that effect, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
beareth the full aſſurance of a mans ſonſhip. It
may be preſumed, that ſome true Saints do not partake of
this all their dayes, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, (I ſpeak with the experience of many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
and, I hope, according to Scripture,) If, I ſay, there is
a <hi>communication</hi> of the Spirit of God which is let out to
ſome of his people ſometimes; it is ſomewhat beſide, if
not beyond that witneſſing of a ſonſhip, ſpoken of before.
It is a glorious divine manifeſtation of God unto the ſoul,
ſhedding abroad Gods love in the heart; It is a thing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
felt than ſpoken of; It is no audible voice, but it is
a glance of glory, filling the ſoul with God, as he is life,
light, love, and liberty, countervailing that audible voice,
<hi>O man greatly beloved, Dan.</hi> 9. 22, 33. putting a man in
a tranſport, with this on his heart, <hi>It is good to be here,</hi> as
<hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 4. It is that which went out from Chriſt to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
when He but mentioned her name, <hi>John</hi> 20. 16. he
had ſpoken ſome words to her before, and ſhe underſtood
not that it was he. But when he uttered this one word,
<hi>MARY,</hi> there was ſome admirable divine conveyance
and <hi>manifeſtation</hi> made out unto her heart, by which ſhe
was ſo ſatisfyingly filled, that there was no place for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
and diſputing, whether or not, that was Chriſt,
and if ſhe had any intereſt in him. That manifeſtation
made faith to it ſelf, and did purchaſe credit and truſt to it
ſelf, and was equivalent with, <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us ſaith the Lord.</hi> This
is ſuch a glance of glory, that it may in the higheſt ſence,
be called the <hi>earneſt,</hi> or firſt fruits of the inheritance:
For it is a felt armful of the Holy God, almoſt wholly
conforming the man unto his likeneſs, ſo ſwallowing him
up that he forgetteth all things, except the preſent mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation:
O how glorious is this manifeſtation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Faith here riſeth to ſo full an aſſurance, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34737:43"/>
wholly into <hi>ſenſible</hi> embracements of God. This
is the thing which doth beſt deſerve the title of <hi>ſenſible
preſence.</hi> And, it is like, is not given unto all Believers;
ſome whereof are all their dayes under bondage, and in
fear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. But here love, almoſt perfect, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out fear. This is ſo abſolutely let out upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
pleaſure, and ſo tranſient and paſſing, or quickly
gone when it is, that no man may bring his gracious ſtate
upon debate for want of it.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, There is a thing we call <hi>Peace,</hi> about which
many do vex themſelves. This <hi>Peace</hi> is either about a
mans <hi>ſtate,</hi> that he is reconciled unto God by Jeſus Chriſt,
or it is about his preſent <hi>caſe</hi> and condition, that he is
walking ſo, as approved of God, at leaſt, ſo far, as
there is no quarrel or controverſie between God and him
threatning a ſtroke: Both of theſe, are either ſuch in the
court of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and conſequently in Gods account,
or in the court of a mans own <hi>conſcience.</hi> Peace, about
a mans ſtate, as being in Chriſt, is ſure in the court of
Scripture, and of Heaven, when a man doth by Faith cloſe
with Chriſt and the New Covenant, <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Being
juſtified by faith, we have peace with God.</hi> It Being ſure
and ſolid in the court of Scripture, it ſhould hold ſure
in the court of mans conſcience, it being rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
for in that caſe, it ſtill ſpeaks according to
Scripture; but, becauſe often the conſcience is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed,
or in the dark, therefore there is often peace
about a mans ſtate according to Scripture, whilſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
doth threaten the contrary, and doth ſtill condemn,
and refuſeth to aſſoil the man, as being reconciled unto
God through Chriſt. In this caſe the conſcience muſt be
informed, and the mans gracious ſtate made out by the
marks of grace, as we ſhewed before; and here the
witneſs of my own ſpirit, will do much to allay the cry
of the conſcience; and if the Spirit of the Lord joyn his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34737:43"/>
witneſs and teſtimony, the conſcience is perfectly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and proclaimeth peace to the man. The other peace,
about a mans preſent <hi>caſe</hi> or condition, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is
approved of God in a Goſpel ſenſe, it may be wanting,
and juſtly wanting, although the other <hi>peace</hi> about a mans
<hi>ſtate</hi> be ſure. This peace about a mans caſe and condition,
it is either ſuch in the court of Scripture, and this is when a
a man is not regarding iniquity, and expecting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God without exception; then the Scripture
ſaith, he ſtands in an even place, and he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> fear no
ſtated quarrel between God and him, in order to a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
ſtroke; and when it is thus, his conſcience ſhould
alſo aſſoil him that ſame way; and would do ſo, if it
were rightly informed; but becauſe the conſcience is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the dark, therefore a man may be alarm'd with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
in the court of conſcience, as if he were juſtly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a ſtroke from God becauſe of his ſin, and ſome quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
God hath at him, although he intends ſalvation for
him; this is enough to keep a man in diſquiet, and to
inhibit him, the rejoycing allowed unto him, whilſt he
is walking in his integrity: Therefore a man muſt here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
inform his conſcience, and receive no accuſations,
nor condemnings from it, unleſs it make them clear by
Scripture. At that Bar let every man ſtand, both about
his ſtate, and his condition or caſe; and let him appeal
from all other courts to that, and not receive any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
but conform to the truth, of God, by which the
conſcience is to proceed in all things: and if this were well
lookt unto, there would not be ſo many groundleſs ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions,
amongſt the Lords people, either about their ſtate, or
condition, upon every thought which entereth their mind.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, There is the <hi>Joy</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, and
this is when the ſpirit doth breath upon our rejoycing in
God (which is a grace very little in exerciſe with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
and maketh it ſet out ſenſibly and vigorouſly; and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34737:44"/>
he exciteth and ſtirreth the paſſion of joy and delight in
the ſoul, ſo as there is an unſpeakable and glorious joy
in the ſoul, in the apprehenſion of Gods friendſhip and
nearneſs unto him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. This joy followeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
peace, and peace followeth righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.
17. This joy readily will not fail to be according to the
meaſure of the aſſurance of Faith, as 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 8. In
whom believing, ye rejoyee, &amp;c.</hi> So that the removal of
miſtakes about other things, will allay doubts about this.</p>
            <p>Now, becauſe ſome of theſe excellent communications
of the ſpirit, after they are gone, are brought in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as deluſions of Satan. For vindication of them we
ſay, that the ſpecial operations of Gods Spirit in any
high degree, uſually are communicated to people after
ſuch brokenneſs of Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 8. after ſo ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
pains in Religious duty, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 3, 21. or in time
of ſuch ſuffering for righteouſneſs, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14. or if
they break in as the rain that waiteth not for man, then
they do ſo humble and abaſe the perſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 5. and
there are found ſo many evidences of grace in the man,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. or theſe things do ſo provoke unto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and to have every thing anſwerable; and conform
unto theſe manifeſtations of God, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
under them doth ſo loath all things beſide Gods
friendſhip and fellowſhip, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 4. and theſe things
do carry on them and with them ſo much authority, and
divine ſuperſcription, whilſt they are in the Soul, that
afterwards they may appear ſufficiently to be ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
of God, and ſingular gracious operations of
his ſpirit, and no deluſions of Satan transforming himſelf
unto an Angel of Light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. nor ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
flaſhes of the ſpirit, as may admit afterwards irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
Apoſtacy from God, <hi>Heb,</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Now then, to conclude this part of the work that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth
unto tryal, I ſay, to all theſe who complain of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34737:44"/>
want of the precious out-lettings of the Spirit. 1. Bleſs
God if you want nothing eſſential for making out of a
ſaving intereſt in Chriſt. God hath given unto you Chriſt
Jeſus, the greateſt gift he had, and ſince your heart is ſhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
out for him, he will with him give you all things that are
good for you in their ſeaſons. 2. I do believe, upon
a right ſearch and tryal, after you have underſtood the
communications of the Spirit, you are not ſo great a
ſtranger to many things, as you did ſuſpect your ſelf to be.
But 3. Remember the promiſes of life, and of peace
with God, are now here in Scripture made unto theſe
ſpecial things whereof you alledge the want: The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
are made unto Faith, followed with holineſs: And
it may be preſumed, that many heirs of glory not in this
life partake of ſome of theſe things, but are in bondage
all their dayes through fear of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. ſo
that there ſhould be no miſtake about theſe things we
may ſeek after them, but God is free to give or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them. 4. Many do ſeek after ſuch manifeſtations
before they give credit by faith unto Gods word; He
hath born record that there is life enough for men in
Chriſt Jeſus, and if men would by believing ſet to their
ſeal, that God is <hi>true,</hi> they ſhould partake of more of
theſe <hi>excellent things.</hi> 5. I may ſay, many have not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
apprehenſions and thoughts of the ſpirit of God
whoſe proper work it is, to put out the foreſaid noble ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:
they do not adore him as God, but vex, grieve,
quench, and reſiſt him, and many people complaining of
the want of theſe things, are not at the pains to ſeek the
ſpirit in his out-goings, and few do ſet themſelves apart
for ſuch precious receits: Therefore be at more pains in
Religion, give more credit to his Word, and eſteem
more highly of the Spirit of God, and ſo you may find
more of theſe excellent things.</p>

by God, except only ſuch as are elected, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 7.
and whoſe hearts the Lord doth ſoveraignly determine to
that bleſſed choice, <hi>John</hi> 6. 44. yet the Lord hath left
it as a duty upon people who hear this Goſpel, to cloſe
with his offer of Salvation through Chriſt Jeſus, as if it
were in their power to do it. And the Lord, through theſe
Commands and Exhortations (wherein he obligeth men to
the thing) doth convey life and ſtrength to the elect, and
doth therein convey the new heart unto them, which point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
kindly toward this new Contrivance of ſaving ſinners,
and towards Chriſt in his Covenant relations; or, it is the
Lords mind in theſe commands and invitations, to put
people on ſome duty, with which he uſeth to concur, for
accompliſhing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that buſineſs between him and them; ſo
then, it is a <hi>coming</hi> on our part, and yet a <hi>drawing</hi> on his

Covenant of Works, and put himſelf in an utter incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to regain the Lords friendſhip, which he had loſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
by his ſin, and to reſcue himſelf from the curſe and
wrath now due to him for the ſame, or any way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his own ſalvation: But the Lord freely hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
another way of repairing mans loſt eſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> by
ſending his Son Chriſt Jeſus in the fleſh to ſatisfie his
juſtice for the ſins of the Elect, and to reſtore in them
his Image now defaced, and to bring them unto glory;
and he hath made open Proclamation in the Church,
<hi>That whoſoever will lay aſide all thoughts of ſaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by the Covenant of Works, or inherent righteouſneſs,
and will agree heartily to be ſaved by Chriſt Jeſus; they
ſhall be reſtored to a better condition, than formerly man
was in, and ſhall be ſaved.</hi> So then, to cloſe with Gods
device of ſaving ſinners by Chriſt Jeſus, is, to quit
and forego all thoughts of help or ſalvation by our own
Righteouſneſs, and to agree unto this way which God
hath found out; It is to value and highly eſteem of Chriſt
Jeſus, as the treaſure ſufficient to enrich poor man, and
with the heart to believe this record, <hi>That there is life
enough in him for men.</hi> It is to plead this invention, and
to acquieſce in it, as the only way to true happineſs: It
is to point towards this Mediator, as God holdeth him
out in the Goſpel, with deſire to lay the ſtreſs of our
whole eſtate on him. This is that which is called Faith
or Believing, the receiving of Chriſt, or believing on
his Name, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. This is that believing on the
Name of the Lord Jeſus, commanded unto the Jaylor
for his ſafety, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 31. This agreeth to all the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34737:48"/>
deſcriptions of juſtifying faith in the Scripture, this doth
anſwer the type of <hi>looking to the Brazen Serpent lifted
up in the Wilderneſs, John</hi> 3. 14, 15. and this is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in all theſe ordinary actings of Faith; to which,
promiſes are annexed in the Scripture, and will be found
in all who have got the new heart from God, and it
will be found in none elſe.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Second</hi> thing, <hi>viz. That this is the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
duty of all ſuch who would be in favour with God,
and ſecure their Souls.</hi> It appeareth thus.</p>
            <p>1. This cloſing with Gods contrivance, or believing
in Chriſt, is commanded every where in Scripture by
the Lord, as the condition of the new Covenant, giving
title and right unto all the ſpiritual bleſſings of the ſame;
for it is, upon the matter, the receiving of Chriſt: This
is commanded, whilſt God bids men <hi>come and buy;</hi> that
is impropiate all, by cloſing with that contrivement <hi>Iſa.</hi>
55. 1. the weary are commanded to come uuto him thus
for their reſt, <hi>Mat. 11. 28. This is his commandment,
that we believe on the name of his Son, 1. John</hi> 3. 23.
this is enough to prove it a duty incumbent. But further,
it is ſuch a duty, as only giveth title and right to a Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
for, only they who receive him, are priviledged
to be Sons, <hi>John 1. 12. To as many as received him, to
them he gave power to be the ſons of God, even to ſuch as
believed on his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It appeareth to be the neceſſary duty of all, thus:
No leſs than this doth give a meeting unto God, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf to be our God in Chriſt, and no leſs than
this doth anſwer our profeſſion, as we are in Covenant
with him, as Members of his viſible Church. The Lord
offereth to be our God in Chriſt; if we do not cloſe with
the offer, in laying aſide all thoughts of other ways, by
which we may attain to happineſs, we give no meeting to
him; he ſaith, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34737:49"/>
well pleaſed, hear ye him, Mat.</hi> 17. 5. If we cloſe
not with the offer, we give no anſwer unto God. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<hi>we are all baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, for the remiſſion of Sins, Acts</hi> 2. 38. Now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we cloſe with Chriſt, as is ſaid, we falſifie that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
therefore ſince this is the thing which doth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
Gods offer in the Goſpel, and make good our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
as members of his Church, it is a neceſſary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
lying upon us.</p>
            <p>3. Whatſoever a man hath elſe, if he do not thus
cloſe with Gods Invention about Chriſt Jeſus, and do
not receive him, it doth not avail, either as to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
of his perſon, or of his performances, or as to
the ſaving of his ſoul. Men are accepted only in Chriſt
the beloved, <hi>Eph. 1. 6. Abel</hi> and his offering are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by faith, <hi>Heb. 11. 4. Without faith it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to pleaſe God, Heb.</hi> 11. 6. and, <hi>He that believeth not,
is condemned already, and ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath
of God abideth on him, John</hi> 3. 18. 36. for want of
this, no external title doth avail; the Children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
are caſt out, if this be wanting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 10, 11,
12. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are like other Heathens, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of a graceleſs ſtate, lying open to the wrath of
God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 25, 26. If men do not believe, that he
who was ſlain at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who was called Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
and witneſſed unto by the Prophets, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be the Son of God by many mighty works: I ſay,
if men do not believe that he is the way, and cloſe not
with him as the only way, <hi>they ſhall dye in their ſins,
John</hi> 8. 24.</p>
            <p>We ſay then, it is a moſt neceſſary duty thus to cloſe
with <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the bleſſed relief appointed for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
every one who is come to years of underſtanding,
and heareth this Goſpel, is obliged to take to heart his
own loſt condition, and Gods gracious offer of peace and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34737:49"/>
ſalvation, throngh <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and ſpeedily to fly from
the wrath to come, by accepting and cloſing with this
offer, heartily acquieſcing therein, as a ſatisfying way
for ſaving of poor Sinners: And that all may be the
more encouraged to ſet about this duty, when
they hear him praying them to be reconciled unto them,
let them remember that peace and ſalvation is offered to
the people in univerſal terms, to all without exception:
<hi>If any man will, he ſhall be welcome,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. <hi>If
any thirſt,</hi> (although after that which will never profit)
yet <hi>they ſhall be welcome here,</hi> on the condition afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 2, 3. all are commanded to believe, 1
<hi>John</hi> 3. 23. The promiſes are to all who are externally
called by the Goſpel; God excludes none, if they do
not exclude themſelves, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. ſo that if any have
a mind for the thing, <hi>they may come forward, he will
in no wiſe caſt them out, John 6. 37. being able to ſave
to the utmoſt, them who come to God through him, Heb.</hi>
7. 25. And theſe who have long delayed to take this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to heart, had now the more need to look to it, leſt
what belongs to their peace, be hid from their Eyes:
but all theſe words will not take effect with people, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
God pour out his Spirit from on high,</hi> Iſa. 32. 15. to
cauſe <hi>men to approach unto God in Chriſt,</hi> yet we muſt
ſtill preſs mens duty upon them, and beſeech and charge
them, <hi>by the appearing of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and their
reckoning to him in that day, that they give the Lord no
reſt, until he ſend out that Spirit (which he will give to
them who ask it,</hi> Luke 11. 13.) <hi>and cauſe them to know
what belongs unto their peace, and bring them up to their
duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We come now to ſpeak of the <hi>Third</hi> thing, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
<hi>What is previouſly required of theſe who are to perform this
duty:</hi> Men muſt not raſhly, inconſiderately and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
ruſh in upon this matter, ſaying, <hi>They will plead
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34737:50"/>
that device of ſaving ſinners by Chriſt, and will acquieſce
and reſt on him for ſafety:</hi> Often men do deceive themſelves
here, and do imagine that they have done the thing;
We ſhall therefore hold out ſome things pre-required
in a perſon, who is to cloſe with <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> which
although we offer not as poſitive qualifications; fitting
a man for Chriſt that way, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. yet they are ſuch
things, as without them a man cannot knowingly and
cordially perform the duty of believing on Chriſt Jeſus.
Beſide the common principles which are to be ſnppoſed
in theſe who live under Goſpel-ordinances, as, <hi>The
knowledge that men have immortal ſouls; Soul and body
will be united again at the laſt day, There is a Heaven
and Hell, one of which will be the everlaſting Lot of all
men; The Old and New Teſtament is the true Word of
God, and the rule of faith and manners; Every man is
by nature void of the grace of God, and is an enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and an heir of condemnation: Reconciliation is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Mediator Chriſt Jeſus; Faith unites unto him,
and is the condition of the new Covenant; Holineſs is the
fruit of true faith, and is to be ſtudied, as that without
which no man ſhall ſee God:</hi> I ſay, beſide theſe things,
the knowledge of which is neceſſary, it is required of
him who would believe on Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That he take to heart his natural condition.</hi> And
here he muſt know ſome things, and alſo be very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
about them: I ſay, he muſt know ſome things; as
(1.) That as he was born a Rebel and out-law unto
God, ſo he hath by many actual tranſgreſſions diſoblig'd
God, and ratified the forfeiture of his favour; yea, a
man ſhould know many particular inſtances of his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
on all hands, as that he is a liar, ſabbath-breaker<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34737:50"/>
is ſtanding in force againſt theſe very ſins whereof
he is guilty, and ſo conſequently, he is the party undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
againſt whom God (who cannot lie) hath denounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
war. A man muſt know, that when the Scripture

Mal.</hi> 1. 14. it ſpeaketh againſt him for his ſuperficial
ſervice performed unto God with the outward man, when

know that it is ſpoken againſt himſelf, who hath gloried
in making his neighbour drunk, and that dreadful wrath
is determined by the Lord againſt him, according to that
Scripture: When the Word ſaith, <hi>God will judge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean

which he lieth, becauſe <hi>all his righteouſneſs in an unclean

He muſt know, that as he is void of all the ſaving graces
of the Spirit, as the true love of God, the true fear of
his Name, godly ſorrow for ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo particularly,
that he wants Faith in Chriſt, who taketh burden for all
them wbo believe on him: Until a man know this, he
will ſtill leave all his debt and burden without care or
regard, at the door of Chriſt, the common cautioner.</p>
            <p>Now not only muſt a man know theſe things, as I ſail
before, but muſt alſo very ſeriouſly take them to heart,
that is to ſay, he muſt be affected with theſe things, and
be in ſad earneſt about them, as he uſeth to be in other
caſes, wherein he uſeth to be moſt ſerious; yea, he ſhould

laſtingneſs of God, or his wrath aright (2.) This ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34737:51"/>
breaketh the mans heart, and fainteth the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it, and leadeth it out to ſorrow <hi>as one doth for her
firſt born: Zech.</hi> 12. 10. I grant their ſorrow will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuit that Scripture afterwards, when they apprehend
Chriſt pierced by their ſins. (3.) It leadeth the man
to ſelf-loathing. A man taking up himſelf ſo, cannot but
loath himſelf for his abomination, whereby he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
himſelf. There is ſomewhat of that ſpirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
which is mentioned as a fruit of true repentance,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. (4.) this ſeriouſneſs doth make the man
peremptory to find relief; ſince it is not in himſelf, he dare
not put off and delay his buſineſs, as before: and this
is indeed required that he finds himſelf, ſo purſued and
put to it, that he flees for refuge ſomewhere. I grant
ſome have a higher, and ſome a leſſer degree of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs,
as we ſhew in the former part of this Treatiſe.
But if we ſpeak of the Lords ordinary way of working with
thoſe who are come to age, we ſay, they muſt very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
take their ſouls eſtate to heart, deſpairing of help
in themſelves, Since the whole need no Phyſitian, <hi>but
thoſe who are ſick,</hi> Mat. 9. 12. As for the meaſure, we
plead on that which probably doth ſuppoſe, that a man
will be induced thereby to tranſact cordially with Chriſt,
on any terms he doth offer himſelf to be cloſed with.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing pre-required of him who would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on Chriſt Jeſus, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>He muſt know and take to
heart the way of eſcape from Gods wrath;</hi> The Spirit muſt
convince him of that righteouſneſs. Here a man muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
ſomewhat diſtinctly, that God hath deviſed a
way to ſave poor loſt man by Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
righteouſneſs hath ſatisfied offended juſtice, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
pardon and everlaſting favour to all thoſe whom
he perſwadeth by his Goſpel, to accept of Gods offer.
<hi>Acts 13. 38, 39. John.</hi> 1. 12. So that no perſon is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
of whatſoever rank or condition, whatſoever hath
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34737:52"/>
been his former way (unleſs he be guilty of the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Holy Ghoſt, which is, a malicious hatred and
rejection of the remedy appointed for ſinners, as we ſhall
hear) for, all manner of ſin is given unto thoſe who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the offer in Gods way, <hi>Matth. 12. 13. He is
able to ſave to the uttermoſt thoſe that come unto God through
him,</hi> Heb. 7. 25.</p>
            <p>The third thing pre-required is, <hi>A man muſt know
that as God hath not excluded him, from the relief appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
ſo he is willing to be reconciled unto men through Chriſt,
and hath obliged men to cloſe with him through Chriſt Ieſus,
and ſo to impropriate that ſalvation to themſelves.</hi> He not
only invites all to come, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1, 2. And welcometh
all that come, as we find in the Goſpel, and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
thoſe who come, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 10. and 15. 28. and
chideth for not coming and cloſing with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18.
But alſo he <hi>commandeth</hi> all to believe on Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi>
3. 23. So as a man is not to queſtion the Lords wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
to receive men, who go to Chriſt honeſtly, for
God hath abundantly cleared that in Scripture; unleſs
that a man know ſo much, he will ſcarcely dare to lay
his heart open for that noble device of ſaving ſinners, or
adventure his own weight and ſtreſs upon Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing pre-required, is, <hi>The man who would
cloſe with Chriſt Jeſus, muſt reſolve to break all Covenants
with Hell and death,</hi> Iſa. 28. 15. Whatſoever known
evil men are engaged into, they muſt reſolve to forego it;
for <hi>there is no concord between Chriſt and Belial,</hi> 2 Cor.
6. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. The Lord requireth that they
who would expect him to be for them, ſhould not be for
another, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. 3. This is far from Evangelick repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which (I grant) doth not precede a mans clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with Chriſt by faith; there is little here beyond a
miſ-regard of theſe things unto which a man was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
devoted, and a ſlighting what he was mad upon,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34737:52"/>
becauſe he ſeeth himſelf deſtroyed thereby, and relief
now offered, whereupon his heart beginneth to be more
intent than formerly it was. After this, when Chriſt is
lookt upon alone, his worth and beauty doth appear, ſo
as among all the gods there is none like unto him, and
he looketh out as a ſufficient covering of the eyes to all
who get him. Upon which the heart loveth Gods device
in the new Covenant, and loveth to lay its weight upon
Chriſt, rather than any other way, bending towards him,
and ſo the man becometh a believer. Now I will not ſay
that all theſe things whereof we have ſpoken, are formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
orderly and diſtinctly found in every perſon before
he cloſe with God in Chriſt; for the way of the heart
with Chriſt, may be added to the four wonderful things,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 19. It is hard to trace the heart in its tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
from darkneſs to light; yet we hold out the moſt
ordinary and likely way, to him who doth ask the way,
debarring thereby ignorant and ſenſeleſs perſons from
medling, and diſcharging them to pretend to any intereſt
in him whilſt they remain ſuch.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> thing we propoſe to ſpeak to, is, <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of this duty, when rightly gone about.</hi> I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hint a few.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Believing in Chriſt mùst be Perſonal;</hi> a man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and in his own proper perſon muſt cloſe with Chriſt
Jeſus. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith? Heb.</hi> 2. 4. This
faith, that it will not ſuffice; for a mans ſafety and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
that he is in Covenant with God, as a born mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the viſible Church by vertue of the parents ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to Chriſts Ordinances, neither will it ſuffice that
the perſon had the <hi>initiating ſeal of Baptiſm</hi> added, and
that he then vertually engag'd to ſeek ſalvation by Chriſts
blood, as all infants do. Neither doth it ſuffice <hi>that men
are come of believing parents;</hi> their faith will not inſtate
their children into a right to the ſpiritual bleſſings of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34737:53"/>
Covenant. Neither will it ſuffice <hi>that parents did in ſome
reſpect engage for their children, and give them away unto
God;</hi> all theſe things do not avail. The children of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and of godly predeceſſors are caſt out; unleſs a man
in his own perſon, put out faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and
with his own heart pleaſe and acquieſce in that device of
ſaving ſinners, he cannot be ſaved. I grant this faith is
given unto him by Chriſt: but certain it is, that it muſt
be perſonal.</p>
            <p>2. This duty muſt be <hi>cordial</hi> and hearty: <hi>with the
heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10. 10. A
man muſt be ſincere, and without guile in cloſing with
Chriſt, judging him the only covering of the eyes, not
hankering after another way. The matter muſt not ſwim
only in the head or underſtanding, but it muſt be in the
heart; the man not only muſt be perſwaded that Chriſt
is the way, but affectionately perſwaded of it, loving
and liking the thing, having complacency in it; ſo that
it is all a mans deſire, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. If a man be cordial and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
in any thing, ſurely he muſt be ſo here, in this one
thing neceſſary: It muſt not be ſimply a fancy in the
head, but it muſt be a heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> buſineſs, a ſoul-buſineſs;
yea, not a buſineſs in the outer court of affections, but
in the flower of affections, and in the innermoſt Cabinet
of the ſoul, where Chriſt is forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Shall a man be
cordial in any thing, and not in this, which doth comprize
all his chief intereſts, and his everlaſting ſtate within it?
Shall the Lord be ſaid to rejoyce over a man, as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
rejoyceth over his Bride, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. and to reſt in
his love with joy, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 17. and ſhall not the heart
of man go out and meet him here? the heart or nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
love, or nothing: Marriage love, which goeth from heart,
to heart; love of eſpouſals, or nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 26.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2. I will not ſay that there is in all as ſoon
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34737:53"/>
as they believe, a prevailing ſenſible love, which mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſick; but there muſt be in believing, a rational and
kindly love, ſo well grounded, and deeply engaging,
that many waters cannot quench it; It is ſtrong as death,
and jealouſie in it, burneth as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ire, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>The third property, or qualification of believing as it
goeth out after Chriſt, it muſt be <hi>rational.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby I mean, that the man ſhould move towards God
in Chriſt, in knowledge and underſtanding, taking up
Gods device of ſaving ſinners by Chriſt, as the Scripture
doth hold it out, no fancying a Chriſt to himſelf, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
than the Goſpel ſpeaketh of him, nor another way
of relief by him, than the word of God holdeth out. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we find knowledge joyned to the Covenant between
God and man as a requiſite, <hi>Jer. 24. 7. &amp;</hi> 31. 34. I
mean here alſo, that a man be in calmneſs of ſpirit, and
as it were, in his cold blood in cloſing with Chriſt Jeſus,
not in a ſimple fit of affection which ſoon vaniſheth:
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20. nor in a diſtemper through ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
diſtreſs, as the people were, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 34. and prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not ſtedfaſt in the Covenant; not under a tentation of
ſome outward temporary intereſt, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was
when be believed, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. A man muſt act here ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
as being Maſter of himſelf, in ſome meaſure able
to judge of the good or evil of the thing as it ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, Faith as it goeth out rationally, ſo it
goeth out <hi>reſolutely.</hi> The poor diſtreſt people in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
did moſt reſolutely caſt themſelves upon Chriſt. This
reſoluteneſs of ſpirit, is in order to all difficulties that
lye in the way: Violence is offered to theſe. The man
whoſe heart is a ſhaping out for Chriſt Jeſus, cannot ſay,
There is a Lion in the ſtreet, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 13. If he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have acceſs by the door he will break through the
roof of the houſe, with that man, <hi>Luk</hi> 5. 19. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34737:54"/>
doth not regard that which the World calleth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
or prudence, like <hi>Zacheus</hi> climbing upon a tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to ſee Chriſt, when faith was breeding in his boſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the man to move towards Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and from the good report gone abroad of God, that he

all, this reſoluteneſs doth proceed from the arm of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi>
ſecretly and ſtrongly drawing the ſinner towards
Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. I will not ſay that every one, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with Chriſt in the offers of the Goſpel, hath all the
foreſaid thoughts formally in his mind; yet, upon ſearch,
it will be found, if he be put to it, or put in mind of
theſe things, they are then aloft in the ſoul.</p>
            <p>By what is ſaid, it doth manifeſtly appear that many in
the viſible Church had need to do ſomewhat further for
ſecuring of their ſouls, when they come to years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
than is found to have been done by them before,
in the Covenant between God and the Church, ſealed to
them in Baptiſm. By what is ſaid alſo, there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
guard upon the free grace of God in the Goſpel,
held out through Chriſt Jeſus; ſo as ignorant, ſenſleſs,
profane men, cannot with any ſhadow of reaſon pretend
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34737:54"/>
to an intereſt in it. It is true, believing in Chriſt, and
cloſing with him as a perfect Saviour, ſeemeth eaſie; and
every godleſs man ſaith, that he believeth on him: But
they deceive themſelves, ſince their ſoul hath never cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially,
rationally, and reſolutely gone out after Chriſt
Jeſus, as we have ſaid. It may be ſome wicked men
have been enlightned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. and have found ſome
motion in their fear, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25. or in their joy; <hi>Mat.</hi>

meaſure eſcaped by the knowledge of the Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 22. or they utterly fall away
to the hatred and malicious deſpiſing and perſecuting of
Chriſt and his intereſts; from whence hardly can they
be recovered, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. and 10. 26, 29. which
thing ſhould provoke men to be ſerious, in this great
buſineſs.</p>
            <p>We come now to ſpeak to the fifth thing propoſed, and
that is, <hi>What be the native conſequents of true believing,</hi>
I ſhall reduce what I will ſpeak of them to theſe two, viz.
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with God, and Communion with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then, I ſay, when a ſinner cloſeth with Chriſt
Jeſus, as is ſaid, <hi>there is preſently an admirable union,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſtrange oneneſs, between God and the man.</hi> As the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and wife, head and body, root and branches, are
not to be reckoned two, but one; So Chriſt, or God
in Chriſt, and the ſinner cloſing with him by faith, are
one, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 30, 32. He that is ſo joyned unto the Lord
<hi>is one Spirit,</hi> 1. Cor. 6. 17. <hi>As the Father is in the
Son, and Chriſt in the Father; ſo believers are one in the
Father and the Son.</hi> They are one, as the Father and the
Son are one: the Father in Chriſt, and Chriſt in believers,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34737:55"/>
that they may be made perfect in one. O what a ſtrange
inter-weaving, and indiſſoluble knot is there! <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.
21, 22, 23, 26. Becauſe of this union between God
and the believer, 1. They can never hate one another,
henceforth the Lord will never hate the believer: <hi>As no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
man hateth his own fleſh at any time, but cheriſheth it and
nouriſheth it, ſo doth Chriſt his people,</hi> Eph. 5. 29. He
may be angry, ſo as to correct and chaſtiſe the man
that is a believer, but all he doth to him, is for his good
and advantage; <hi>all the Lords paths muſt be mercy and truſt
to him,</hi> Pſal. 35. 10. <hi>All things muſt work together for
good to him,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. On the other ſide, the believer
can never hate God maliciouſly; for, <hi>he that is born of
God ſinneth not,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 9. For the Lord hath reſolved
and ordained things ſo, that his hand ſhall undoubtedly
ſo be upon all believers for good, that they ſhall never get
leave to hate him, and be ſo pluckt out of his hands.
2. Becauſe of this union, there is as a ſtrange ſympathy
and fellow-feeling between God and the believer: The
Lord is afflicted with the mans afflictions; he doth ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
carefully, and ſeaſonably reſent it, as if he were
afflicted with it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. He who toucheth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
toucheth the apple of the Lords eye, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>He is touched with the feeling of their infirmities,</hi> Heb. 4.
15. <hi>And precious in his ſight is their blood,</hi> Pſal. 116. 15.
In a word, what is done to them, is done unto him; and
what is done unto them, is not done unto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.
40. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. 40, 45. On the other part, the zeal of his
houſe ſitteth in the heart of the believer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 9.
The Lords reproach lighteth on the believer, if it go well
with his affairs, that is the buſineſs of his people. So
there is a ſtrange ſympathy between God and believers,
all by vertue of the union between them; becauſe of which,
men ſhould hate every thing which would compete with
him in their love, or affections; and ſhould diſdain to be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34737:55"/>
ſlaves to the Creatures, ſince theſe are the ſervants of their
Lord and Husband, and their ſervants through him.
What a hateful thing is it for a Queen to whore with the
ſervants of her Prince and Husband? It is alſo a ſhame
for a Believer to be afraid of evil tidings, ſince the Lord,
with whom he is one, alone ruleth all things, and doth
whatſoever pleaſeth him in Heaven and in Earth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
3. 21, 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 6, 7. and 115. 3.</p>
            <p>The other great conſequent of believing, is an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unpararell'd <hi>communion:</hi> by vertue whereof, 1. The
parties themſelves do belong each to other: The Lord
is the God of his people, he himſelf, Father, Son, and
Holy Ghoſt, is their God, in all his glorious Attributes:
his juſtice, as well as his mercy; his wiſdom, power,
holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for <hi>He becometh the God of his people,</hi> as
he often ſpeaketh in the Covenant On the other part,
the Believers are his people: in their very perſons they
are his, as the Covenant doth ſpeak; <hi>They ſhall be his
people;</hi> their head, their heart, their hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they are, they are his. 2. By vertue of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
they have a mutual intereſt in one anothers whole
goods and geer, in as far as can be uſeful. All the Lords
Word doth belong to the Believer: Threatnings as well as
Promiſes, for their good; all his wayes, all his works
of all ſorts, ſpecial communications, death, devils, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
all things, in ſo far as can be uſeful 1. <hi>Cor,</hi> 3. 21, 22,
23. On the other ſide, all which belongeth to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
is the Lords; heritage, children, life, wife,
credit, all is at his diſpoſing; if any of theſe can be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to him, the Believer is to forego them, elſe he falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
that communion, and declareth himſelf in ſo far, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. 3. By vertue of this
communion, there ſhould be much familiarity between
God and the Believer. The Lord may meddle with any
thing which doth belong to the believer, and do to him
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34737:56"/>
what ſeemeth good to him, and the man is not to miſtake,
or ſay unto God, What doſt thou? (but in ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
his duty) yes, he is ſtill to ſay in every caſe,
Good is the Word and Will of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 8. 2.
<hi>Kings.</hi> 4. 23, 26. On the other part, the believer may
in an humble way, be free and familiar with God in Chriſt;
he may <hi>come with boldneſs to the throne of Grace,</hi> and not
uſe a number of complements in his addreſſes unto God,
<hi>Heb. 4. 16. For he is no more a ſtranger unto God,</hi> Eph.
2. 19. ſo as that he needs not ſpeak unto God, as one
that hath acquaintance to make every hour, as many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
do, and it maketh a huge inconſiſtency in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
The believer alſo may lay open all his heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 15. and impart all his ſecrets unto
him, and all his tentations without fear of a miſtake. The
believer alſo may enquire into what God doth, in ſo far
as may concern his own duty, or in ſo far as may ward
off miſtakes of the Lords way, and reconcile it with his
Word, <hi>John</hi> 13. 15. The believer is a friend in this
reſpect, as knowing what the Maſter doth, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.
23. <hi>&amp;c. Jer. 12. 1. Iſa.</hi> 63. 17. The believer alſo may
be free with God, to go in daily with his fallings, and
ſeek repentance, pardon and peace through Chriſts Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocateſhip,
<hi>Acts. 5. 31. 1 John</hi> 2. 1. O how often in
one day may the believer plead pardon, if he intend not
to mock God, or to turn grace into wantonneſs! The
Lord hath commanded men to forgive ſeventy times ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in one day, and hath hinted therein a parable, how
much more the Maſter will forgive, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 22, 28.
The believer alſo may be free to entruſt God with all his
ovtward concernments, for he doth care for theſe things,
<hi>Mat. 6. 30, 32. 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 7. Yea, the believer may
humbly put God to it, to make him forth-coming for
him, in all caſes, as beſeemeth, and to help him to ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
fruit in every ſeaſon, even grace in time of need.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34737:56"/>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. Yea, how great things may believers ſeek
from him in Chriſt Jeſus, both for themſelves and others,
1 <hi>John 5. 14, 15. John 14. 13. Iſa.</hi> 45. 11. It is the ſhame
and great prejudice of his people, that they do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
that communion with God more than they do; Chriſt
may juſtly upbraid them, that they ask nothing in his Name,
<hi>John,</hi> 16. 24.</p>
            <p>By what is ſaid, it doth appear of how great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
this duty of believing is, by which a man cloſeth
with Chriſt Jeſus, whom the Father hath ſealed, and given
for a Covenant to the people. It is ſo honourable for
God, anſwering his very deſign, and ſerving his intereſt
in the whole contrivment and manifeſtation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
And it is ſo advantagious to men, that Satan and an
evil heart of unbelief, do mightily oppoſe it, by mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
objections againſt it. I ſhall hint ſome moſt ordinary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I am ſo baſe, worthleſs and faithleſs of my ſelf,
that I think it were high preſumption for me to meddle with

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, all the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> are baſe

may ſay, let me be but a ſervant to waſh the feet of the

to be richly glorified in it, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 18. John</hi> 17. 10. and

2. The hating of good in others, whilſt I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced

               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:34737:59"/>
the truth, this unpardonable ſin (for then many of all
the Saints in Scripture were undone) but further, Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
from much of the truth is not that ſin; for that was
in <hi>Solomon,</hi> and in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia;</hi>
yea, denying, yea, forſwearing of the moſt fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
truth under a great tentation, is not this ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for then <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
had been undone. 5. As reſiſting, quenching, griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and vexing of the Spirit of God by many ſinful wayes,
are not this unpardonable ſin, for they are charged with
theſe who are called to repentance in Scripture, and not
ſhut out, as guilty of this ſin: So neither reiterating ſin
againſt light, is the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, although
it leadeth towards it, for ſuch was <hi>Peters</hi> ſin in denying
Chriſt; ſo was <hi>Jehoſaphats</hi> ſin in joyning with <hi>Ahab</hi>
and <hi>Jehoram.</hi> 6. Purpoſes and eſſays of ſelf-murther, and
even purpoſes of murthering godly men, (the party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under a ſad fit of tentation) yea, actual ſelf-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(although probably it often joyneth in the iſſue
with this unpardonable ſin, which ought to make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſoul look upon the very tentation to it with horrour
and abhorrency, yet) is not the ſin againſt the Holy
Ghoſt; The Jaylor intended to kill himſelf upon a worſe
account than many poor people do in the ſight and ſenſe
of Gods wrath, and of their own Sin and Corruption;
yet that Jaylor obtained pardon <hi>Acts.</hi> 16. 27. 34. And
<hi>Paul</hi> before his effectual calling, was acceſſory unto the
murther of many Saints, and intended to kill more, as
himſelf granteth, <hi>Acts 26. 9. to</hi> 13. Athough all theſe
are dreadful ſins, each of them deſerving wrath ever laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and not being repented of, bringeth endleſs ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
eſpecially the laſt cuts off hope of relief, for
ought can be expecting in an ordinary way, yet none of
theſe is the unpardonable ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; and
ſo under any of theſe, <hi>There is hope to him that hath an ear
to hear the joyful ſound of the Covenant;</hi> All manner of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34737:60"/>
ſuch ſin and blaſphemy may be forgiven, as is clear in
the Scripture, where theſe things are mentioned.</p>
            <p>As for the ſecond thing. Let us ſee what the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Holy Ghoſt is. It is not a ſimple act of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
but a complex, of many miſchievous things, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving
Soul and Body ordinarily in guilt. We thus
deſcribe it; <hi>It is a rejecting and oppoſing of the Chief
Goſpel Truth, and way of ſalvation, made out ſingularly
to a man by the Spirit of God in the truth and good thereof,
and that avowedly, freely, wilfully, maliciouſly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpightfully,
breeding hopeleſs fear.</hi> There be three places
of Scripture, which do ſpeak moſt of this ſin, and thence
we will prove every part of this deſcription, in ſo far as
may be uſeful to our preſent purpoſe, by which it will
appear that none who have a mind for Chriſt, need ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at what is ſpoken of this ſin in Scripture, See <hi>Mat.</hi>
12. 24.—32. <hi>Heb. 6. 4, 5. 6. and</hi> 10. 25,—29. Firſt then,
let us conſider the Object about which this ſin, or ſinful
acting of the man guilty thereof, is converſant, and that
is the chief Goſpel-truth, and way of Salvation: both
which run to one thing. It is the way which God hath
contrived for ſaving of ſinners by Jeſus Chriſt the promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>Meſſiah</hi> and Saviour; by whoſe death and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
men are to be ſaved, as he hath held forth in the
Ordinances; confirming the ſame by many mighty works
in Scripture tending thereto. This <hi>way</hi> of ſalvation is the
Object. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> oppoſe this, that Chriſt was the
Meſſiah, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 23, 24. The wrong is done againſt
the Son of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6, and the blood of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and the Spirit graciouſly offering to apply theſe
things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. Secondly, In the deſcription, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the qualification of this object. It is ſingularly
made out to the party by the Spirit of God, both in the
<hi>truth</hi> and <hi>good</hi> thereof. This ſaith, 1. That there muſt
be knowledge of the truth and way of Salvation. The
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34737:60"/>
Phariſees knew that Chriſt was the heir, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 38.
The party hath knowledge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. 2. That know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the thing, muſt not ſwim only in the head, but
there muſt be ſome half heart-perſwaſion of it. Chriſt
knew the Phariſees thoughts, and ſo did judge them, <hi>Mat.</hi>
12. 25. and that the contrary of what they ſpake was
made out upon their heart: There is a taſting, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.
4, 5. which is beyond ſimple enlightning; yea, there
is ſuch a perſwaſion ordinarily as leadeth to a deal of
outward ſanctification, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. 3. This perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
muſt not only be of the verity of the thing, but of
the good of it. The party taſteth the good Word of
God, and he apprehendeth the thing as eligible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.
5. 4. This perſwaſion is not made out only by ſtrength
of Argument, but alſo by an enlightning work of Gods
Spirit, ſhining on the truth, and making it conſpicuous.
Therefore is that ſin called <hi>the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
Mat. 12. <hi>Mark</hi> 3. The perſons are ſaid to have received
the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. and to do deſpight unto the
ſpirit of grace, who was in the neareſt ſtep of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
operation with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. Thirdly, In this
deſcription, conſider the acting of the party againſt the
object ſo qualified, It is a rejecting and oppoſing of it:
which importeth, 1. That men have once, ſome way at
leaſt been in hands with it, or had the offer of it, as is
true of the Phariſees. 2. That they do reject, even with
contempt, what they had of it, or in their offer. The
Phariſees deny it, and ſpeak diſdainfully of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi>
12. 24. They fall away, intending to ſhame Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 5, 6. 3. The men ſet themſelves againſt it by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of perſecution, as the Phariſees did ſtill. They rail
againſt it: Therefore it is called <hi>Blaſphemy againſt the
Holy Ghoſt, Mat.</hi> 12. 24. 31. They would Crucifie
Chriſt again, if they could, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. They are Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27. Fourthly, conſider the properties
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34737:61"/>
of this acting. 1. It is <hi>avouched,</hi> that is, not ſeeking to
ſhelter or hide it ſelf. The Phariſees ſpeak againſt Chriſt
publickly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 24. They would have Chriſt brought
to an <hi>open ſhame, Heb.</hi> 6. 6. They forſake the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
which ſavour that way, <hi>and</hi> 10. 25. and deſpiſe
the danger. For, looking for indignation, they tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that blood ſtill, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27, 29. 2. The party
acteth <hi>freely,</hi> it is not from unadviſedneſs, nor from force
or conſtraint, but an acting of free choice; nothing doth
force the Phariſees to ſpeak againſt and perſecute Chriſt.
They Crucifie to <hi>themſelves,</hi> they re-act the murder of
their own free accord, and in their own boſome, none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. They ſin of free choice, as
the word is, <hi>ſpontaneouſly, Heb.</hi> 10. 27. 3. It is acted
<hi>willfully.</hi> They are ſo reſolute, they will not be diſſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any offer, or the moſt precious means, as is clear
in the aforeſaid Scriptures. 4. It is done <hi>maliciouſly,</hi> ſo
as it proceeds not ſo much, if at all, from a tentation to
pleaſure, profit, or honour; It proceedeth not from
fear, or force, or from any good end propoſed; but out
of heart-malice, againſt God and Chriſt, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of his Glory and Kingdom. So that it is the
very nature of Satans ſin, who hath an irreconcileable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
againſt God, and the remedy of ſin, becauſe his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is thereby advanced. This is a ſpecial ingredient in
this ſin. The Phariſees are found guilty of heart-malice
againſt Chriſt, ſince they ſpake ſo againſt him, and not
againſt their own children caſting out Devils; and this
is the force of Chriſts Argument, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 27. They
do their utmoſt to Crucifie Chriſt again, and to bring
him to an open ſhame. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. They are adverſaries
like the Devil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27. 5. It is done <hi>deſpightfully.</hi>
The malice muſt bewray it ſelf. The Phariſees muſt
proclaim that Chriſt hath correſpondence with Devils,
<hi>Met.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>2. He muſt be put to an open ſhame, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34737:61"/>
again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. they muſt tread under foot that
blood, and do deſpite to the Spirit; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. ſo that
the party had rather periſh a thouſand times, than be in
Chriſts debt for ſalvation. The laſt thing in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is, the ordinary attendant or conſequence of this
ſin, it breedeth <hi>Deſperate and Hopeleſs fear.</hi> They fear
him, whom they hate, with a ſlaviſh, hopeleſs fear,
ſuch as Devils have, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27. They know that God
will put out his power againſt them; they tremble in
the remembrance of it; and if they could be above him,
and deſtroy him, they covet it; and ſince they cannot
reach that, they hate with the utmoſt of heart-malice,
and do perſecute him, and all that is his with deſpite.</p>
            <p>As for the third thing propoſed. (<hi>viz.</hi>) The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions</hi>
to be drawn from what is ſaid, whereby we will
ſpeak directly to the Objection, 1. As I hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſince the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and may be well known where it is, none ſhould
charge themſelves with it, unleſs they can prove and
make good the charge; for it is a great wrong done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, to labour to perſwade my ſoul that he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pardon me; It is the very way to make me deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and to lead me unto the unpardonable ſin; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unleſs thou canſt and dareſt ſay, that thou doſt hate
the way which God hath deviſed for ſaving of ſinners,
and doſt reſolve to oppoſe the thriving of his Kingdom,
both with thy ſelf and others, out of malice and deſpite
againſt God, thou oughteſt not to ſuſpect thy ſelf guilty
of this ſin. 2. Whatſoever thou haſt done againſt God,
if thou doſt repent it, and wiſh it were undone, thou
canſt not be guilty of this ſin; for in it, heart-malice and
deſpight againſt God do ſtill prevail. 3. If thou art
content to be his debtor for pardon, and wouldeſt be
infinitely obliged unto him for it, then thou canſt not in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34737:62"/>
that caſe be guilty of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; for,
as we ſhewed before, they who are guilty of it, do ſo
deſpite God, that they would not be his debtors for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
4. Whatſoever thou haſt done, if thou haſt a
deſire after Jeſus Chriſt, and doſt look with a deſiring
after him, and canſt not think of parting with his Bleſſed
Company for ever: Or if thou muſt part with him, yet
doſt wiſh well to him, and all his, thou needeſt not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
thy ſelf to be guilty of this unpardonable ſin; For
there can be no ſuch hatred of him in thy boſome, as is
neceſſarily required to make up that ſin. 5. If thou
wouldeſt be above the reach of that ſin, and ſecure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it for ever, then go work upon thy heart to plead
ſalvation by Chriſt Jeſus, and to cloſe with God in him,
acquieſcing in him as the ſufficient ranſome and reſt, as
we have been preſſing before, and yield to him to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his way: Do this in good earneſt, and thou ſhalt
be for ever put out of the reach of that ugly thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Satan doth affright ſo many poor ſeekers of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Although I be not excluded from the benefit of
the New Covenant, yet it is not in my power to believe on
Chriſt; For Faith is the gift of God, and above the ſtrength
of fleſh and blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, that ſaving Faith, by which alone
a man can heartily cloſe with God in Chriſt, is above our
power, and is the gift of God, as we ſaid before in the
premiſes: Yet remember, 1. The Lord hath left it as
a Duty upon all who hear this Goſpel, cordially by faith
to cloſe with his offer of ſalvation through Chriſt, as is
clear in the Scripture; And you muſt know, that although
it be not in our power to perform that duty of our ſelves,
yet the Lord may juſtly condemn for not performing of it,
and we are inexcuſable, becauſe at firſt he made men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
able to do whatſoever he ſhould command. 2. The
Lord commanding this thing, which is above our power,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34737:62"/>
willeth us to be ſenſible of our inability to do the thing,
and would have us putting on him to work it in us. He
hath promiſed to give the new heart, and he hath not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
any from the benefit of that promiſe. 3. The Lord
uſeth by theſe Commands and Invitations, and mens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
on the ſame, and their ſupplication about the
thing, to convey power unto the ſoul to perform the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Therefore, for anſwer to the objection, I do beſeech
thee in the Lords Name, to lay to heart theſe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
and Promiſes; and meditate on them, and
upon that bleſſed buſineſs of the New Covenant, and
pray unto God as you can, over them, (for he will be
enquired to do theſe things, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37.) and lay thy
cold heart to that device of God expreſt in the Scriptures,
and unto Chriſt Jeſus, who is given for a Covenant to the
People, and look to him for life and quickening; Go
and eſſay to plead that ſalvation in the way God doth
offer it, and to cloſe with, and reſt on Chriſt for it, as
if all were in thy power, yet looking to him for the thing,
as knowing that it muſt come from him; And if thou do
ſo, he who meets theſe who remember him in his wayes,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 5. will not be wanting on his part, and thou
ſhalt not have ground to ſay, that thou moved towards
the thing until thou could do no more for want of ſtrength,
and ſo left it at Gods door: It ſhall not fail on his part,
if thou have a mind for the buſineſs. Yea, I may ſay,
if by all thou haſt ever heard of that matter, thy heat
loveth it, and deſireth to be in hands with it, thou haſt
it already performed within thee, ſo that difficulty is paſt,
before thou waſt aware of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Many who have cloſed with Chriſt Jeſus, as
is ſaid, are ſtill complaining of their leanneſs and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs,
which maketh my heart lay the leſs weight on that
duty of believing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you be convinced that it is a duty to believe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34737:63"/>
on Chriſt, as is ſaid, yo may not ſhift it under any
pretence. As for theſe complaints of ſome who have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after him, not admitting every one to be judge of his
own fruit. I ſay, 1. Many by their jealouſies of Gods
love, and by their miſ-belief (after they have ſo cloſed
with God) do obſtruct many precious communications,
which otherwiſe would be let out to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.
58. 2. It cannot be, that any whoſe heart is gone out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Chriſt, have found him a wilderneſs 2. 31. ſurely
they find ſomewhat in their ſpirit, ſwaying them towards
God in theſe two great things, (<hi>viz.</hi>) how to be found
in him in that day, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. and how to be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
to his praiſe in the Land of the Living, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.
17. and 56. 13. they find theſe two things aloft in the
ſoul, and that is much; Moreover, they ſhall after ſearch,
if they judge aright, find ever ſince an emptineſs in the
Creatures, which abundance of the Creature cannot fill
up, all is vanity; Only God can fill the empty room in
their heart, and when he but breatheth a little, there is
no room for additional comfort from creatures; This ſaith,
that God hath captivated the man, and hath fixed that
ſaving principle in the underſtanding and heart, who is
God but the Lord? <hi>Worſhip him all ye Gods,</hi> Pſal. 97. 7.
Yea, further, theſe whoſe heart hath cloſed with God
in Chriſt, as is ſaid, will not deny that there have been
ſeaſonable preventings and quickenings now and then,
when the ſoul was like to fail, <hi>Pſal. 21. 3. &amp;</hi> 94. 18,
19. therefore, let none ſay, that there is no fruit follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and let none ſhift their duty upon the unjuſt and
groundleſs complaints of others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Although I judge it my duty to cloſe with Gods
device in the Covenant, I am in the dark how to manage
that duty, for ſometimes God doth offer to be our God without
any mention of Chriſt, and ſometimes ſaith, that he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth
us unto him; And in other places of Scripture, we
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34737:63"/>
are called to come to Chriſt, and he is the Bridegroom. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
God ſometimes ſpeaketh of himſelf as a Father to men,
ſometimes as a Husband; Chriſt is ſometimes called the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and ſometimes a Brother, which relations ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent,
and do much put me in the dark how to apprehend
God when my heart would agree with him, and cloſe with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may be very well ſaid, that men do come
to God, or cloſe with him, and yet they come to Chriſt
and cloſe with him. They may be ſaid to come under a
marriage relation unto God; and unto Chriſt alſo, who
is Husband, Father, Brother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to them, and there
is no ſuch myſtery here as ſome do conceive. For the
better underſtanding of it, conſider theſe few things, 1.
Although God made man perfect at the beginning, and
put him in ſome capacity of tranſacting with him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
<hi>Eccleſ. 7. 29. Gen.</hi> 2. 16, 17. Yet man, by his
fall, did put himſelf at a perfect diſtance from God, and in
an utter incapacity to bargain or deal any more with him
immediately. 2. The Lord did, after <hi>Adams</hi> fall, make
manifeſt the new covenant, in which he did ſignifie that
he was content to tranſact with man again, in and through
a Mediatour; and ſo did appoint men to come to him
through Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. and to look for acceptation
only in him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6. ordaining men to hear Chriſt,
He being the only party, in whom God was well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 5. 3. This matter is ſo clear, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be ſo notorious in Scripture, and ſo manifeſt to
all who are under the Ordinances, that the Lord doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſpeak of tranſacting with himſelf, not making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Mediator, becauſe it is ſuppoſed, that every
one in the Church knoweth that now there is no dealing
with God, except by and through Chriſt Jeſus the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.
4. Conſider, that Chriſt Jeſus, God-man, is not
only a fit meeting-place for God and men to meet into, and
a fit ſpokeſ-man to treat between the parties now at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34737:64"/>
2, <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. But we may ſay alſo he is, the
immediate Bridegroom, and ſo our cloſing or tranſacting
with God, may be juſtly called the marriage of the Kings
Son; and the elect may be called the <hi>Lambs Wife,</hi> Chriſt
Jeſus being, as it were the hand which God holdeth out
unto men, and on which they lay hold when they deal
with God. And ſo through and by Chriſt, we cloſe
with God, as our God, on whom our ſoul doth terminate
laſtly and ultimately through Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. 5.
Conſider that the diverſe relations mentioned in Scripture,
are ſet down, to ſignifie the ſure and indiſſoluble union
and communion between God and his people: whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
nearneſs is between head and members, root and
branches, King and Subject, ſhepherd and flock, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and children, brother and ſiſter, Husband and Wife,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> all is here, <hi>John</hi> 17. 21. to 27. So that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be ſpoken in the Scripture, people may be clear,
that God calleth them to be reconciled unto him through
Chriſt, and doth offer himſelf to be their God and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in him alone, and men are to accept God to be their
God in Chriſt, pleaſing that way of relief for poor man,
and to give up themſelves unto God in Chriſt, in whom
alone they can be accepted. And they who cloſe with
Chriſt, they do cloſe with God in him, who is in Chriſt
reconciling the world to himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19. Joh.</hi> 14.
9. <hi>to</hi> 12. And we are not to dip further into the diverſe
relations mentioned in Scripture, between God or Chriſt,
and men, then as they may point out union and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or nearneſs with God through Chriſt Jeſus, and our
advantage thereby.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being clear we will not multiply words:
But ſince to believe on Chriſt is the great duty, required
of all that hear this Goſpel, we beſeech every one, in the
Lords Name, to whom the report of this ſhall come, that
without delay they take to heart their loſt condition in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34737:64"/>
themſelves, and that they lay to heart relief which God
hath provided by Jeſus Chriſt, whereof he hath made a
free offer unto all who will be content of the ſame, and
to be ſaved that way. And that they lay to heart, that
there is no other way of eſcape from the wrath that is to
come (becauſe of which men would be glad at the laſt day;
to run into a lake of melted Lead to be-hid from the face
of the Lamb, whom they do here deſpiſe) we ſay, we
beſeech all in the conſideration of theſe things, to work
up their hearts to this buſineſs, and to lay themſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
for God, and to receive him through Chriſt in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of the Goſpel, acquieſcing in him, as the only deſirable
and ſatisfying good, that ſo they may ſecure themſelves;
go ſpeedily and ſearch for his offers of peace and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Scripture, and work up your heart and ſoul to
cloſe with them, and with Chriſt in them, and with God
in Chriſt: And do it ſo, as you may have this to ſay, that
you were ſerious, and in earneſt, and cordial here, as
ever you were in any thing to your apprehenſion, and for
ought you know, Chriſt is the choice of your heart, at
leaſt, you neither know nor allow any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
Whereupon your heart doth appeal unto God to
ſearch and try if there be ought amiſs, to rectifie it, and
lead unto the right way. Now this cleaving of the heart
unto him, and caſting it ſelf upon him, to be ſaved in
his way, is believing, which doth indeed ſecure a man
from the wrath that is to come, becauſe now he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Chriſt, and believeth on him, and ſo ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into condemnation, as ſaith the Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> When I hear what it is to believe on Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
I think ſometimes I have faith: For I dare ſay, to my
apprehenſion, the invention of ſaving ſinners by Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
pleaſeth me, my heart goeth out after him, and doth
determinate upon him as a ſatisfying treaſure; and I am
glad to accept God to be my God in him. But I often do
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34737:65"/>
queſtion if ever I have done ſo, and ſo am for moſt part kept
heſitating and doubting if I do believe, or be ſavingly in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ordinary for many whoſe
hearts are gone out after Chriſt in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,<note place="margin">Expreſs tranſacting with God.</note>
and have received him, to bring the
ſame in queſtion again. Therefore I ſhall
adviſe one thing as a notable help to fix the ſoul, in the
maintaining faith and an intereſt in God; and that is, that
men not only cloſe heartily with God in Chriſt, as is ſaid,
but alſo, they <hi>expreſly, explicitely, by word of mouth and
viva voce; And formally cloſe with Chriſt Jeſus, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Gods offer of ſalvation through him, and ſo make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God.</hi> And this, by Gods bleſſing may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
not a little for eſtabliſhing them about their ſaving
intereſt in God.</p>
            <p>Before I ſpeak directly to this expreſs Covenanting with
God, I premiſe theſe few things. 1. I do not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a covenanting with God, eſſentially differing from
the Covenant between God and the viſible Church, as
the Lord doth hold it out in his revealed Will. Neither
do I intend a Covenant, differing eſſentially from that
tranſacting of the heart with God in Chriſt, formerly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
unto: It is that ſame Covenant, only it differeth by a
ſingular circumſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>formal expreſſion</hi> of the
thing which the heart did before practiſe. 2. I grant this
expreſs covenanting and tranſacting with God, is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
neceſſary for a mans ſalvation: For, if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
cloſe heartily and ſincerely with God, offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in Chriſt in the Goſpel, his ſoul and ſtate is thereby
ſecured, according to the Scripture, although he utter
not words with his mouth: But this expreſs verbal cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
with God is very expedient, for the better being
of a mans ſtate, and his more comfortable maintaining
of an intereſt in Chriſt Jeſus. 3. This expreſs covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34737:65"/>
with God is very expedient, for the better being of a
mans ſtate, and his more comfortable maintaining of an
intereſt in Chriſt Jeſus. 3. This expreſs covenanting
with God by word of mouth, is of no worth, without
ſincere heart-cloſing with God in Chriſt joyned with it:
For, without that, it is but a prophaning of the Lords
Name, and a mocking of him to his face, ſo to draw
near unto him with the lips, whilſt the heart is far away
from him. 5. I grant, both cordial and verbal tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
with God will not make out a mans gracious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
unto him, ſo as to put and keep it above controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
without joynt witneſs of the Spirit, by which we
know what is freely given unto us of God; yet this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
way of tranſacting with God, joyned with that
heart-cloſing with him in Chriſt, contributes much for
clearing up unto a man, that there is a fixed bargain
between God and him, and will do much to ward off him
many groundleſs jealouſies and objections of an unſtable
mind and heart, which uſeth affrontedly to deny this hour,
what it did really act and perform the former hour. This
explicite covenanting, is an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> taken of what paſt
between God and the ſoul, and ſo hath its own vantage for
ſtrengthening of Faith.</p>
            <p>As for this expreſs covenant, we ſhall 1. Shew that
is a very warrantable practice. 2. We ſhall ſhew ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what is preparatorily required of thoſe who do ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
with God, 3. How men ſhall go about that duty.
4. What ſhould follow thereupon.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> I ſay, it is a <hi>warrantable</hi> practice, and
in incumbent duty, exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ly and by word to covenant with
God, which appeareth thus.</p>
            <p>1. In many places of Scripture (if we look to what
they may bear according to their ſcope and the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of Faith) <hi>God hath commanded it,</hi> and left it on peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as a duty, <hi>Iſa. 44. 5. One ſhall ſay, I am the Lords,</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:34737:66"/>
Iſa. 45. 24. <hi>Surely, ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I
righteouſneſs and ſtrength,</hi> Jer. 31. 4. <hi>Wilt thou cry unto
me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth,</hi> Zech. 13.
9. <hi>They ſhall ſay, The Lord is my God,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 16. <hi>Thou
ſhalt call me Iſhi,</hi> and in many places elſewhere. Now
ſince God hath ſo clearly left it on men in the matter of
the word, they may be perſwaded, that it is a practice
warranted and allowed by him, and well-pleaſing unto
him.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Arg. It is the approved practice of the Saints in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
thus expreſly to covenant with God, and they have
found much quiet in that duty afterwards. <hi>David</hi> did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
expreſly ſay unto God, that he was his God, his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that himſelf was his ſervant. <hi>Thomas</hi> will put
his intereſt out of queſtion with it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 28. Yea,
I ſay, the Saints are much quieted in remembrance of
what hath paſt that way between God and them, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
73. 25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 5. we find it often in the Book of
the <hi>Canticles.</hi> Now ſhall the chief Worthies of God be ſo
much in a duty, breeding ſo much quiet and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to them in many caſes, and ſhall we be under the New
Teſtament, unto whom acceſs is miniſtred abundantly and
who partake of the ſap of the Olive; ſhall we (I ſay)
lie behind in this approved piece of freedom with God?
Since we ſtudy to imitate that cloud of witneſſes in other
things (as faith, zeal, patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) let us all imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
them in this.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Arg.</hi> The thing about which we move here <hi>is a
matter of the greateſt concernmen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all the World:</hi> It is
the life of our Soul, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 47. Oh ſhall men ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be expreſs, explicite, plain and peremptory in all
their other great buſineſſes, becauſe they are ſuch, and
ſhall they not much more be peremptory and expreſs in
this, which doth moſt concern them? I wonder that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not only do not ſpeak it with their mouth, but that they
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34737:66"/>
do not ſwear, and ſubcribe it with their hand, and do not
every thing for ſecuring of God to themſelves in Chriſt;
and themſelves unto God, which the Scripture doth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 5.</p>
            <p>This alſo may have its own weight, as an argument
to preſs this way of covenanting with God. <hi>The buſineſs
of intereſt in Chriſt, and of real and honeſt tranſacting with
him, is a thing, which in experience of Saints, is moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
brought upon debate, and in queſtion.</hi> Therefore
men had need, all the ways they can, even by thought,
word, and deed, to put it to a point.</p>
            <p>This alſo may have place here for preſſing this as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>that God is ſo formal, expreſs, diſtinct and legal, (to
ſay ſo) in all the buſineſs of mans ſalvation, viz.</hi> Chriſt
muſt be a near kinſman, to whom the right of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth belong; he muſt be choſen, called, authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſent, Covenants formally draw between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and him, the Father accepting payment and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
giving formal diſcharges, all done clearly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly.
Shall the Lord be ſo expreſs, plain and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
in every part of the buſineſs, and ſhall our part of
it reſt in a <hi>confuſed thought,</hi> and we be as dumb beaſts
before him? If it were a marriage between man and
wife, it would not be judged enough, although there were
conſent in heart given by the woman, and known to the
man, if ſhe did never expreſs ſo much by word, being
in a capacity to do ſo. Now this Covenant between God
and man, is held out in Scripture as a marriage between
man and wife, <hi>Hos. 19. 20. 2 Cor.</hi> 2. The whole Song
of <hi>Soloman</hi> ſpeaketh it. The Lord uſeth ſimilitudes, to
ſignifie unto us what he intends, and ſurely this is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
requiſite in Marriage, that the wife give an expreſs
and explicite conſent unto the buſineſs: The man ſaith ſo,
<hi>I take thee to be my lawful wife, and do oblige my ſelf to
be a dutiful husband:</hi> The woman is obliged on the other
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34737:67"/>
Part, to expreſs her conſent, and to ſay, <hi>Even ſo I take
thee to be my lawful husband, and do promiſe duty and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:</hi>
It is ſo here; The Lord ſaith, <hi>I betroth thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me in faithfulneſs, and thou ſhalt call me</hi> Iſhi, <hi>my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi>
Hoſea 2. <hi>I will be for thee as a head and husband
if thou wilt not be for another,</hi> Hoſea 3. the man ought
to anſwer, and ſay, <hi>Amen, So be it, Thou ſhalt be my
God, my head, and Lord, and I ſhall and will be thine,
and not for another, Cant.</hi> 6. 3. And ſo this making of
this Covenant with God, is called, <hi>a giving of the hand
to him,</hi> as the word is, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 8. which doth hint
a very expreſs, formal, explicite and poſitive bargaining
with God. So then, we conclude it to be an incumbent
duty, and a very approved practice, neceſſary for the
quieting of a mans mind, and his more comfortable being
in Covenant with God, and more fully anſwering Gods
condeſcendence and offer in that great and primary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
<hi>I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not only <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>ſhould,</hi> people thus expreſly cloſe
with God in Chriſt for fixing their heart; but they may,
upon ſome occaſions, renew this verbal tranſacting with
God; eſpecially, when through tentations they are made
to queſtion if ever they have really and ſincerely cloſed
Covenant with God, as they are to put out new acts of
faith, embracing Chriſt as the deſirable portion and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and alſo upon other occaſions, ſo were it <hi>expedient,</hi>
eſpecially if there remain any doubt about the thing, that
by <hi>viva voce</hi> and expreſs word, they determine that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
and ſay of the Lord and to him, that he is their
refuge and portion, <hi>Pſalm 91. 2. Pſalm</hi> 142. We find
the Saints doing ſo; and we may imitate them, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
1. In the time of great back-ſliding, people were
wont to renew the Covenant with God, and we ſhould
do ſo alſo; Our heart ſhould go after Chriſt, in the
promiſes of reconciliation with God, for he is our peace
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34737:67"/>
upon all occaſions, and our Advocate, and we are bound
to apprehend him ſo when we tranſgreſs, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. and
to expreſs ſo much by word as Saints did in their formal
renewing of the Covenant. 2. When people are in haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
then it were good that they ſhould ſend out their
heart after him, and expreſs their adhering unto him,
for ſecuring their own heart; We find <hi>Joſhua</hi> doing ſo,
when he was to ſettle in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in the midſt of
ſnares, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24. ſo <hi>David</hi> doth in his ſtraits, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
57. 1. 3. When men apprehend God to be at a diſtance
from them, and their Soul be under withering and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
then it is ſafeſt heartily to cloſe with Chriſt, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
him by faith for ſecuring of the Soul, and it were
good to put it out of queſtion, by the expreſſing of the
thing; This is the ready way to draw ſap from Chriſt the
root, for recovering of the Soul, and for eſtabliſhing the
heart before him. The Spouſe in the Song of <hi>Soloman</hi>
doth ſo, thus aſſerting her intereſt in him, when in ſuch a
condition; Profeſſing and avouching him to be hér be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
<hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 4. At the celebration of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
men ſhould thus cordially cloſe with God in Chriſt,
and ſpeak and expreſs ſo much; For, that is a feaſt of
Love; And then, and there we come under a ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of cloſing with God in Chriſt, perſonally and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and do receive the ſeal of it: it is therefore beſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
at that time, to bring up both heart and tongue to
ſecond and anſwer our profeſſion, apprehending God to
be our God, and reſigning over our ſelves to be his, and
at his diſpoſing. We ſhall not confine the Lords people
to times and ſeaſon of this duty; The Lord may bind it
upon them at his pleaſure; Only there is hazzard, that
by too frequent expreſs covenanting with God, men turn
too formal in it; Therefore, it is not ſo fit that people
ſhould cordially at full length renew that explicite tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
with God, but rather to declare unto God, that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34737:68"/>
they <hi>adhere</hi> unto the Covenant made with him, and that
they do maintain and will never revoke nor recal the
ſame; and withal, they may hint the ſum of it, in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
claim unto God in Chriſt, as their own God; and
this they may do often, even in all their addreſſes to God,
and probably this is the thing deſigned by the Saints in
their ſo ordinary practice in the Scripture, whilſt they
aſſert their intereſt in God, as their God and portion;
And it is fit that men in all their walk, hold their heart
at the buſineſs, by heart-cleaving to God in Chriſt, <hi>The
life we live in the fleſh, ſhould be by faith in the Son of
God, Gal.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing, <hi>viz.</hi> what is preparatorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of him who is expreſly to tranſact with God: Here
beſides what we ſpake before as previous to a mans clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with Chriſt Jeſus, we only add, 1. That he that
would explicitly bargain with God, muſt know, that to
do ſo, is warranted and allowed by God, as we ſhewed
before: If this be wanting, a man cannot do it in faith,
and ſo it will be ſin unto him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. 2. The
man muſt labour to bring up his heart to the thing, that
it do not belye the tongue; It will be a great mocking of
God, ſo to draw near him with the lips, whilſt the heart
is far off from him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing to be conſidered in this expreſs verbal
covenanting with God, is the way how it is to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and managed; And beſide what was ſaid before in
heart-cloſing with Chriſt; I add here.</p>
            <p>1. The man ſhould do it <hi>confidently,</hi> not only believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he is about his duty when he doth it; But alſo,
that God in Chriſt Jeſus will accept his poor imperfect
way of doing this duty, he do accept a man according
to what he hath, if there be a willing mind, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12.
a mite is accepted, ſince it is all the poor womans ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 44. yea if it can be attained, the man
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34737:68"/>
ſhould believe that the iſſue and conſequence of this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
ſhall prove comfortable, and all ſhall be well, and
that God, who engageth for all in the Covenant (ſince
he hath determined the man to this happy choice) will
in ſome meaſure make him forth-coming, and will perfect
what concerns him; <hi>Faithful is he who hath promiſed, who
will alſo do it, 1. Theſſ.</hi> 5. 24. If this confidence be
wanting, the matter will be done with much fear and
jealouſie, if not worſe, and will ſtill prove a diſquieting
buſineſs to the man.</p>
            <p>2. It ſhould be done <hi>holily:</hi> It is called the <hi>Holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
Luke 1. 72. <hi>The holy things of David,</hi> Acts 13.
34. Here it were fitting, that what is done in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
tranſacting with God, ſhould not be done paſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and on the by, but in ſome ſpecial addreſſes unto God:
the thing ſhould be ſpoken <hi>unto the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 142, 5.
It is beſeeming in ſo great a buſineſs that a piece of time
were ſet apart for confeſſing and ſupplication before God:
yea, alſo the perſon ſo tranſacting with God, ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to have high apprehenſions of Gods greatneſs and
ſoveraignty, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 22. although he thus humble
himſelf to behold things in Heaven and Earth, and theſe
high and holy thoughts of him, will and ſhould be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with debaſing and humbling thoughts of <hi>ſelf,</hi> although
admitted to this high dignity, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18. It is no
ſmall thing to be allyed unto, and with the great God of
Heaven, and his Son Chriſt, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh when
King <hi>Saul</hi> did offer his Daughter unto him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.
22. Yea, further, there ſhould be ſpecial guarding and
watching, that the heart keep ſpiritual tranſacting with
God; there is great reaſon for this holy way of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the duty; For, men are ready to forget themſelves,
and to ſhape the Lord according to their own fancy, and
to turn carnal in the buſineſs, ſince it is a marriage tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
held out in all the ordinary expreſſions of love,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34737:69"/>
as in the Song of <hi>Soloman, Iſa. 62. 5. Zeph.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> thing we ſhall ſpeak a word unto, is, what
ſhould follow upon this expreſs verbal Covenanting with
God; I ſay, beſide that union and communion with God
in Chriſt, following upon believing, if a man explicitly
by word tranſact with God, 1. He ſhould thenceforth be
ſingularly careful to abide cloſe by God in all manner
of converſations; For if a man thenceforth do any thing
unſuitable, he doth falſifie his word before God, which
will ſtick much in his Conſcience, and prove a ſnare; If
a man henceforth forget God, and take on him to diſpoſe
of himſelf, ſince he is not his own, and hath opened his
mouth unto the Lord, he makes enquiry after vows, and
devoureth that which is holy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 25. 2. He
who tranſacteth with God, ſhould hold ſtedfaſt that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
and concluſion; it is a ſhame for a man,
whoſe heart hath cloſed with God; and whoſe mouth
hath ratified and confirmed it ſolemnly before him,
to contradict himſelf again, and to admit any thing to the
contrary, he ought boldly to maintain the thing againſt all
deadly.</p>
            <p>Then let me beſeech you who deſire to be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the matter of your intereſt in God, that with all
conveniency you ſet apart a piece of time for Prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and labouring to work up your heart to ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
affection, and the faith of the duty, to make a
Covenant, and to tranſact with God by expreſs words after
this manner:</p>
            <p>O Lord, I am a loſt and broken Creature by Nature, and
by innumerable actual tranſgreſſions which I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
particularly before thee this day; And although, being
born within the viſible Chriſt, I was from the womb in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with thee, and had the ſame ſealed unto me in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sïſin;
Yet for a long time I have lived without God in the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34737:69"/>
world, ſenſeleſs and ignorant of my Obligation, by vertue
of that Covenant. Thou haſt (at length) diſcovered unto
me, and bound upon my heart, my miſerable ſtate in my
ſelf, and haſt made manifeſt unto my heart the ſatisfying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
thou haſt provided by Chriſt Jeſus, offering the ſame free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto me, upon condition that I would accept of the ſame,
and would cloſe with thee as my God in Chriſt, warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and commanding me upon my utmoſt peril, to accept
of this offer, and to flee unto Chriſt Jeſus: Yea, to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
now thou haſt Soveraignly determined my heart,
and ſhaped it for Chriſt Jeſus, leading it out after him in
the offer of the Goſpel, cauſing me to approach unto the
living God, to cloſe ſo with him, and to acquieſce in his
offer, without any known guile; And that I may come up
to that eſtabliſhment of Spirit in this matter, which ſhould
be to my comfort, and the praiſe of thy glorious Grace;
Therefore, I am here this day to put this matter out of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by expreſs words before thee, according to thy will:
And now I, unworthy as I am, do declare, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that Chriſt Jeſus, who was ſlain at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was
the Son of God, and the Saviour of the World; I do believe
that record, that there is life eternal for men in him, and
in him only; I do this day in my heart, plead and acquieſce
in that device of ſaving ſinners by him, and do intereſt my
ſoul unto him; I do accept of reconciliation with God through
him, and do cloſe with thee as my God in him; I chuſe
him in all that he is, and all that may follow him, and do
reſign up my ſelf, and what I am, or have, unto thee, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
to be divorced from every thing hateful unto thee, and
that without exception, or reſervation of any thing (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with my knowledge) or intended reverſion; Here
I give the hand to thee, and do take all things about me
witneſſes, that I, whatever I be, or have hitherto been, do
accept ſo Gods offer of peace through Chriſt, and do make
a ſure Covenant with thee this day never to be reverſed,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34737:70"/>
hoping that thou wilt make all things forth-coming, both on
thy part and mine, ſeriouſly begging (as I deſire to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
that my corruptions may be ſubdued, and my Neck
brought unto thy ſweet yoke in all things, and my heart
made chearfully to acquieſce in whatſoever thou doſt unto me,
or with me, in order to theſe ends. Now, glory be unto thee,
O Father, who deviſed ſuch a Salvation, and gave the Son
to accompliſh it; Glory be to Chriſt Jeſus, who at ſo dear
a rate, did purchaſe the out-letting of that love from the
Fathers boſome, and through whom alone this acceſs is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and in whom I am reconciled unto God, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
united unto him, and am no more an Enemy or Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
Glory be to the Holy Ghost, who did alarm me when
I was deſtroying my ſelf: and who did not only convince
me of my hazzard, but did alſo open my eyes to behold the
relief provided in Chriſt; yea, and did perſwade and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
my wild heart to fall in love with Chriſt, as the
enriching treaſure; and this day doth teach me how to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God, and how to impropriate to my ſelf all
the ſure Mercies of <hi>David,</hi> and bleſſings of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
to ſecure to my ſelf the favour and friendſhip of God for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Now with my ſoul, heart, head, and whole man;
as I can, I do acquieſce in my choice this day, henceforth
reſolving not to be my own, but thine; And that the care
of whatſoever concerns me ſhall be on thee, as my Head
and Lord, proteſting humbly that failings on my part, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
which I reſolve thou knoweſt) ſhall not make void
this Covenant; for ſo haſt thou ſaid, which I intend not to
abuſe, but ſo much the more to cleave cloſe unto thee, and
I muſt have liberty to renew, ratifie, and draw extracts
of this tranſaction, as often as ſhall be found needful. Now
I know thy conſent to this bargain, ſtands recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſo as I need no new ſignification of it; and I, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accepted of thy offer upon thy own terms, will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
wait for what is good, and for thy ſalvation in the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34737:70"/>
end; As thou art faithful, pardon what is amiſs in my
way of doing the thing, and aceept me in my ſweet Lord
Jeſus, in whom I only deſire pardon: And in teſtimony
hereof, I ſet to my Seal, that God is True, and in declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him a competent Saviour.</p>
            <p>Let People Covenant with God in fewer or more words,
as the Lord ſhall diſpoſe them; for we intend no Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of words for any perſon; Only it were fitting that
men ſhould, before the Lord acknowledge their loſt ſtate
in themſelves, and the relief that is by Chriſt, and that
they do declare that they accept of the ſame, as it is
offered in the Goſpel, and do thankfully reſt ſatisfied
with it, intruſting themſelves henceforth wholly unto God
to be ſaved in his way, for which they according to his
faithfulneſs. If men would heartily and ſincerely do this,
it might heartily through the Lords bleſſing, help to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
them againſt many fears and jealouſies; And
they might date ſome good thing from this day and hour,
which might prove comfortable unto them when they
fall in the dark afterwards, and even when many fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
do ſtare them in the face perhaps at the hour of
death, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. It is much if a man can appeal
unto God, and ſay, Thou knoweſt there was a day and
an hour, when in ſuch a place, I did accept of peace
through Chriſt, and did deliver up my heart to thee, to
write on it thy whole Law without exception; heaven
and earth are witneſſes of it: Remember thy word unto
thy Servant, on which thou cauſedſt me to hope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I dare not adventure to ſpeak ſuch words unto
God, becauſe I find not my heart coming up full length in
Affection and Seriouſneſs: So, I ſhould but lye unto God,
in tranſacting ſo with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is to be regreted that mens heart doth not
with much bended ſail of Deſire and Affection embrace
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34737:71"/>
and welcome that bleſſed offer and portion: Yet for
anſwer to the objection, remember, 1. That thoſe to
whom the Lord giveth the new heart, forming Chriſt in
them, the whole heart is not renewed; There is Fleſh
and Spirit luſting againſt each other, the one contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the other, ſo as a man can neither do the good or evil
he would do with full bended ſail, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. It is well
if there be a good part of the heart going out after Chriſt,
deſiring to cloſe with him on his own terms, 2. That there
is often a rational love in the heart unto Chriſt Jeſus, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
it ſelf by a reſpect to his Commandments. 1.
<hi>John</hi> 5. 3. when there is not a ſenſible prevailing love
which maketh the ſoul ſick, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 5. Men muſt not
alwayes expect to find this. I ſay then, although ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what in your heart draw back, yet if you can ſay, you
are convinced of your broken ſtate without him, you want
a righteouſneſs to cover your guilt, and you want ſtrength
to ſtand out againſt ſin, or to do what is pleaſing before
God: You alſo ſee fulneſs in him in both theſe reſpects:
You dare ſay ſomewhat, within your heart, would be
fain at him upon his own terms, and would have both
Righteouſneſs for Juſtification, and ſtrength in order to
Sanctification; and what is within you contradicting this;
is your burden in ſome meaſure, and your bondage. If
it be ſo, your heart is brought up to a tolerable length;
Go on to the buſineſs, and determine the matter by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting
with God, and ſay with your mouth, <hi>that you
have both Righteouſneſs and Strength in God, as he hath
ſworn you ſhall do, Iſa.</hi> 45. 24. It is approved Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſay unto God, <hi>I believe,</hi> when much miſ-belief is
in me, and the heart divided in the caſe, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24.
Withal, ſhew unto God, how matters are in your heart,
that ſo you may be without guile before him; conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing from him, and put your heart, that is, in his
hand to write his Law on it according to the Covenant;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34737:71"/>
For that is the thing he ſeeketh of men, that they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
up their heart to him, that he may ſtamp it with his
whole Will, without exception; And if you can hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
conſent unto that, judging Chriſts blood a ſufficient
ranſome and ſatisfaction for Mans Trangreſſion; You
may go and expreſly ſtrike Covenant with God; for your
Heart and Affection is ready engaged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I dare not ſo Covenant with God, leſt I break
to him; Yea, I perſwade my ſelf, if ſuch a tentation did
offer ſo and ſo circumſtantiate, I ſhould fall before it, and
ſuccumb. Therefore to tranſact ſo with God, whilſe I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
ſuch a thing were but to aggvedge my condemnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You have already entred Covenant with
God, as you are a member of his viſible Church; And
what is now preſt upon you, is, but that you more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
ſincerely, particularly, and more expreſly covenant
and tranſact with him; You are already obliged hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to cloſe with God in Chriſt; And, if you do it in
heart, I hope the hazzard is no greater by ſaying that
you do ſo, or have done ſo. 2. What will you do if you
ſhift hearty tranſacting with God in Chriſt, and do not
accept his peace, as it is offered? You have not a ſecond
of it in the World; Either you muſt do this, or periſh
for ever: And if you do it with your heart, you may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſay it with your tongue. 3. If people may ſcare at
Covenanting with God, becauſe they will afterwards
Tranſgreſs, then not one man ſhould Covenant with God;
for ſurely every one will tranſgreſs afterwards, if they
live any length of time after the tranſaction; And we
know no way like this, to ſecure men from falling: For
if you Covenant honeſtly with him, engageth, beſide <hi>the
new heart,</hi> to put his <hi>fear and Law therein; To give his
Spirit to cauſe you to walk in his way:</hi> And when you Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God, you deliver up your ſelf unto him,
to be ſanctified and made conform to his will; It is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34737:72"/>
a giving up of your ſelf to be led in his way in all
things, and kept from every evil way, than any formal
engagement on your part, to keep his way, and to hold
off from evil. So that you need not ſcare at the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the Language whereof is, <hi>Wilt thou not be made
clean? Jer.</hi> 13. 27. And all that ſhun to ſtrike Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God, do thereby declare, that they deſire not
to be made clean. 4. As it is hard for any to ſay confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
they will tranſgreſs, if ſuch a tentation did offer
ſo and ſo circumſtantiate; becauſe men may think, that
either God will keep a tentation out of their way, or not
<hi>ſuffer them to be tempted above what they are able to bear,</hi>
or give to them a way of eſcape, <hi>Pſal. 46. 1. 1 Cor.</hi>
10. 13. So the queſtion is not, What I may do after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
but, what I now reſolve to do. If my heart
charge me preſently with any deceit or reſolution to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
I muſt lay aſide that deceit before I tranſact with
God: But if my heart charge me with no ſuch purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yea, I dare ſay, I reſolve againſt every tranſgreſſion;
And although I think I ſhall fall before ſuch and ſuch a
tentation, yet that thought floweth not from any allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and approved reſolution to do ſo; But from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of my own corruption, and of what I have done to
provoke God to deſert me. But the Lord knows, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
not to Tranſgreſs, nor do I approve any ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of my heart to ſuch a ſin, but would reckon it
my ſingular mercy to be kept from ſin in ſuch a caſe; And
I judge my ſelf a wretched man, becauſe of ſuch a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
of death within me, which doth threaten to make me
tranſgreſs. In that caſe, I ſay, my heart doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
me, <hi>therefore I may, and ought to have confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 21. If this be the caſe, I ſay to thee,
although thou ſhouldeſt afterwards fail many wayes, and
ſo perhaps draw upon thy ſelf ſad temporal ſtrokes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
<hi>And loſe for a ſeaſon many expreſſions of his Love,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34737:72"/>
yet there is an Advocate with the Father to plead thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
1 <hi>John 2. 1. Who hath ſatisfied for our breaches, Iſa.</hi>
53. 5, 6. and for his ſake, God reſolveth to hold faſt
the Covenant with men after their tranſgreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
89. 30. 37. elſe how could he be ſaid to <hi>betroth us to
himſelf for ever, Hoſ.</hi> 2. 19, 20. and how could the
Covenant be called <hi>Everlaſting, ordered in all things and
ſure,</hi> if there were not ground of comfort in it, even when
our houſe is not ſo and ſo with God; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 25.
Yea, it were no better than the Covenant of Works, if
thoſe who enter it with God, could ſo depart from him
again, as to make it void unto themſelves, and to put
themſelves into a worſe condition than they were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they made it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.
6. The Lord hateth putting away, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 16. No
honeſt heart will ſtumble on this, but will rather be
ſtrengthned thereby in duty, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 9. For other ties
and bonds, beſide divorce, and puniſhment by death, do
oblige the ingenuous wife unto duty. So here men will
<hi>fear the Lord and his Goodneſs,</hi> Hoſ. 3. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I have at the celebration of the Lords Supper,
and at ſome other occaſions, covenanted expreſly and verbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with God, but my barrenneſs in his ways, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
jealouſies of my gracious ſtate, maketh me queſtion if
ever I tranſacted with God in ſincerity, and I think I can
do it no other wayes than I have done it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Men are not to expect fruitfulneſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their deſire, nor full aſſurance of Gods Favour,
immediately after they have fled unto Chriſt, and expreſly
tranſacted with God in him. Theſe things will keep a
man on work all his dayes. The Saints had their failings
and ſhort-comings, yea, and back-ſlidings, with many
fits of dangerous miſ-belief, after they had very ſeriouſly,
and ſincerely, and expreſly cloſed with God, as their
God in Chriſt. 2. Many do look for faithfulneſs in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34737:73"/>
their walk and eſtabliſhment of faith, from their own
ſincerity in tranſacting with God, rather than from the
Spirit of the Lord Jeſus. They fix their heart in their
own honeſty and reſolutions, and not in the Bleſſed Root
Chriſt Jeſus, without whom we can do nothing, and are
vanity altogether in our beſt eſtate. Men ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that one piece of grace cannot produce any degree
of grace; Further, nothing can work grace but the arm
of Jehovah: And if men would lean unto Chriſt, and
covenant with him as their duty abſolutely, whatſoever
may be the conſequence, at leaſt, looking only to him
for the ſuitable fruit, it ſhould be far better with them:
God pleaſeth not that men ſhould betake themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt, and covenant with him for a ſeaſon until they
ſee if ſuch and ſuch fruit and eſtabliſhment ſhall follow,
purpoſing to diſclaim their intereſt in him, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
if ſuch and ſuch fruit doth not appear within ſuch
a length of time. This is to put the wayes of God to
tryal, and is very diſpleaſing unto him. Men muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
cloſe with Chriſt, and covenant with him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
to maintain theſe things as their duty, and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
way to reach fruit, whatſoever ſhall follow thereupon,
they having a teſtimony within them, that they ſeriouſly
deſign conformity to his revealed will in all things; And
they that have cloſed Covenant with him for the ſame
end, as well as to be ſaved thereby. 3. Men ſhould
be ſparing to bring in queſtion their ſincerity in tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with God, unleſs they can prove the ſame, or have
great preſumptions for it. if you can prove any deceit
or guile in your tranſacting with him, you are obliged
to diſclaim and rectifie it, and to tranſact with God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,
and without guile: But if you know nothing of
your deceit or guile, in the day you did tranſact with him;
Yea, you can ſay, that you did appeal unto God in that
day, that you dealt honeſtly with him, and intended not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34737:73"/>
to deceive: and, did obteſt him according to his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
to ſearch and try if there was any crookedneſs in
your way, and to diſcover it unto you, and heal it, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
139. 23, 24. and afterwards you came to the Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that your deeds might be manifeſt, <hi>John</hi> 3. 20, 21. and
you can ſay, that Gods anſwers from his Word to you,
in ſo far as you could underſtand, were anſwers of peace,
and confirmations of your sincerity; Yea, further, you
dare ſay, that if upon life and death, you were again to
tranſact with him, you can do it no other way, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
more ſincerity and ſeriouſneſs than before: Then
I dare ſay unto thee in the Lords name, thou oughteſt not
to queſtion thy ſincerity in tranſacting with God, but to
have confidence before God, ſince thy heart doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
thee, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 21. and thou art bound to believe
that God dealeth uprightly with the upright man, <hi>and
with the pure doth ſhew himſelf pure, Pſal.</hi> 18. 25, 26.
If a man intend honeſtly, God will not ſuffer him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
himſelf, yea, the Lord ſuffereth no man to deceive
himſelf, unleſs the man intend to deceive both God and
Men. 4. Therefore, impute your unfruitfulneſs to your
unwatchfulneſs, and your miſ-belief; And impute your
want of full aſſurance, unto an evil heart of unbelief,
helped by Satan to act againſt the glorious free grace of
God; And charge not theſe things upon want of ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in your cloſing with Chriſt; And reſolve henceforth to
abide cloſe by the root, and you ſhall bring forth more
Fruit; And by much Fruit you lay your ſelf open to the
witneſs of Gods Spirit, which will teſtifie with your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that you have ſincerely and honeſtly cloſed with God,
and that the reſt of your works are wrought in God, and
approved of him; and ſo the witneſs of the Spirit and
the Water, joyning with the blood, whereupon you are
to lay the weight of your Soul and Conſcience; And

ſhall be to have waſhed their garments in the blood of

flouriſh in following him whitherſoever he goeth;
And in being in the immediate company of the Ancient

I could perſwade men to believe, that theſe things are
not yea and nay, and to make haſte towards him, who
haſteth to judge the World, and to call men to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
