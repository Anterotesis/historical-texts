            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Had not given thee the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a Preface, were it not
for apologizing for a Phrase
which I observe something fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to occur in my <hi>Remarks,</hi>
which may seem to thee hugely
Paradoxical, if not very absurd.
It is <hi>Gravitation upwards:</hi> I made
use of it in imitation of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Authour, upon whose Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
I make my <hi>Remarks.</hi>
Wherefore that thou maist the
better discern how allowable or
disallowable this form of speech
is, and that I may withall offer to
thee that which may perhaps
tend to the better opening thine
understanding in <hi>Hydrostatical</hi>
Theories, I will lay down a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:53653:3"/>
               <hi>Hypothesis</hi> for the illustrating
that natural poize, libration or
Gravitation that Philosophers
suppose they discover in the <hi>Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id
matter</hi> of this our Terrestrial
world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> therefore, Let us ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
our Earth environed only
with the <hi>Materia subtilis,</hi> that
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> has so curiously descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
or more plainly and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly,
with the pure subtil <hi>Aether</hi>
which is a liquid body of that
subtilty, that it will with ease pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
all bodies in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but abundantly the pores of
Glass.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us consider, that
a Hail-shot, Gravel, Quick-sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and the like may be poized
in Water, and Corn, Chaff, Currans,
Powders, and such like in the
Air, and that they will subside
or weigh one against another in
the said Elements; so the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of these Elements themselves,
<pb facs="tcp:53653:3"/>
Water and Air, and the vapours
therein, are as it were weighed
or poized in this more universal
<hi>Liquidum</hi> of the <hi>Aether.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the particles of
Quick-silver, Water, Vapours,
Air, and, in brief, what ever is
conteined in that which they call
the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> if there be no lett
nor new emergent mutation, are in
this poizing placed according to
their <hi>solidity,</hi> chiefly of the very
particles they do consist, suppose
Air, Water, Quick-silver, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as I have declared in my first
<hi>Hydrostatical</hi> Axiom, <hi>Enchirid.
Metaphys. cap. 13. sect.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That in some sense
all the parts and particles of the
<hi>Atmosphere,</hi> even the thinnest
Air at the <hi>Convexity</hi> thereof, are
heavy, namely thus; That if they
were upon some occasion raised
higher than the <hi>convexity,</hi> those
thin parts of Air would descend
again to the said <hi>convexity</hi> as
<pb facs="tcp:53653:4"/>
sure as the vapours do in Dew on
the Grass, or raised Dust does
upon any pavement or floor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That this we call <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viness</hi>
is nothing else but a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
in the parts or particles
of the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> to be placed
according to their solidity, by
that, what ever it is, that moves
them, or disposes them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That when these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of <hi>Fluids</hi> in the <hi>Atmosphere</hi>
are so disposed, with regard to
their different solidity, as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the
Laws of this <hi>mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Principle,</hi> they press not then
on one another, but, as to any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
<hi>Gravitation</hi> on one another,
they are at rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> This diversity of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
in the particles is the cause
why we see Elements and liquids
in such different <hi>places,</hi> and of
such different <hi>Consistencies.</hi> As
Quick-silver below water, water
below, air, the thicker air below
<pb facs="tcp:53653:4"/>
the thinner, and their <hi>Consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> That the more <hi>solid</hi>
the particles are in <hi>fluids,</hi> the
more strong their <hi>consistency</hi> is,
as well as they are thereby more
<hi>heavy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> That as the <hi>moving</hi>
or <hi>disposing Principle</hi> brought the
several <hi>Liquids</hi> to such various
differences of <hi>consistency</hi> by a <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi>
action, so it keeps them in
the same <hi>consistency</hi> by a like <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi>
action or force, though
upon occasion mutable or vinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> That there may be a
very strong <hi>consistency</hi> in Liquids
without any <hi>elasticity</hi> or <hi>springi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
at all, as in Quick-silver and
Water which are not <hi>compressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elevently,</hi> That there may be
a <hi>compressible consistency</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
strong where there is little
or no <hi>elasticity</hi> of parts. A thing
<pb facs="tcp:53653:5"/>
easily discernible in the wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or pressing in a mans hand
a wet Handkerchief; and of such
a <hi>compressible consistency</hi> may
be our lower Air, stuffed with
thick vapours, as also consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the grosser <hi>Aëreal</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> That all poizings,
suspensions or librations of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
liquid bodies, are not by a
mere counterpoize of perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
pressure of another body,
but may be by the firmness or
force of its <hi>consistency.</hi> I speak
this in reference to the <hi>Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
experiment, and the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the water in Pumps and
Syringes, which is thus solved
with the greatest ease and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibleness
that may be, by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
so strong a <hi>consistency</hi> in
this lower Air, that the firmness
thereof will resist the weight of
suppose 29 inches of Mercury in
a Tube, or of 34 foot of water
<pb facs="tcp:53653:5"/>
in a Pump, but will be broke by
the weight of 30 or 31 inches
of Mercury, and 35 or 36 foot
of water, and suffer <hi>compression,</hi>
to the letting in the subtil <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidum</hi>
or <hi>Aether</hi> (in which the
whole Atmosphere is poized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Glass or Pump, whereby
the Mercury or Water is made
capable to descend. And 29
inches of Mercury being of one
weight with 34 foot of water in
a Tube of the same diameter, it
is plain, that this is the poize
that equals either the <hi>firmness</hi> of
<hi>consistency,</hi> or else the <hi>weight</hi> of
the Air.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirteenthly,</hi> But here now I
say lies the curiosity of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory,
whether this suspension, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of the Mercury in the Tube,
be to be conceived to be by <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
pressure</hi> or <hi>actual Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation</hi>
of the Air upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stagnant
Mercury; or else, as I
intimated before, by the <hi>firmness</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53653:6"/>
of its <hi>consistency,</hi> it being not
compressible, by no greater
weight than that of 29 inches of
Mercury, and so there being no
<hi>vacuum,</hi> nor penetration of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions,
the circle of motion is
necessarily stopt, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
stands at that pitch. To
which I conceive is most safely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That when the Mercury
is fallen to 29 inches, that there
is a kind of libration betwixt the
air jointly with the restagnant
Mercury, and the Mercury in the
Tube. For upon the infusing of
water upon the restagnant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
that in the Tube will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
ascend. And this
the Learned Authour upon
whom I make the <hi>Remarks,</hi> will
call <hi>Gravitation upwards,</hi> because
its tendency is towards that more
subtil matter in the derelicted
space in the Glass. And this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
is not much unlike that
in a <hi>Siphon</hi> with one leg much
<pb facs="tcp:53653:6"/>
higher than another, into which
putting some quick-silver (which
will presently poize it self into
an equality in each shank) if you
pour water into the longer shank,
the quick-silver in the other will
ascend accordingly: which is again
a kind of <hi>Gravitation upwards</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the thin <hi>Air,</hi> and answers
to the ascending or gravitating
of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Mercury in
the Tube against the subtil <hi>Aether</hi>
there. But that the parts thus
librated in this <hi>liquidum subtilis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simum,</hi>
(in which the whole at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere
is poized by the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or disposing Principle) when
they are settled in their poize,
press or gravitate one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I do utterly deny. But
then secondly, I say, the <hi>firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
of the <hi>consistence</hi> of the Air
is as it were the <hi>string</hi> of this <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,</hi>
which if it break, or so far
forth as it breaks or relaxates,
the Mercury in the Tube will fall
<pb facs="tcp:53653:7"/>
down. And thirdly, that the
Mercury is kept up by this <hi>string</hi>
of <hi>firmness</hi> of the <hi>consistency</hi> of
the Air, and not by the actual
<hi>gravitation</hi> of an <hi>Atmospherical</hi>
Cylinder of an equal diameter
on the restagnant Mercury, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from that experiment of
the Mercury in the Tube not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
though the Vessel of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
be close covered in a Glass,
and so the supposed pressure of
the <hi>Atmospherical</hi> Cylinder inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
and a commodious Valve
made, that upon the falling of
the Mercury would let the Air
out, though there be none let in
by it; which Valve the weight,
suppose, of ten pounds of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
would be sure to fling open,
if it were the weight of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mospherical
Cylinder that held
up that ten pound of Mercury in
the Tube before. Nor fourthly,
can it be the spring of that Air
included in the Glass that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
<pb facs="tcp:53653:7"/>
the Mercury in the Tube,
since it must be so great, that it
must hold up no less than the
weight of ten pound of Mercury;
and if the <hi>elasticity</hi> of the Air be so
great or strong, considering the
subtilty of the parts of the Air
that make this spring, which are
hugely more subtil and thin, and
consequently more cutting than
the edge of a Razor, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
but that they should cut
with all imaginable ease into the
Quick-silver, and so piercing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it prove unserviceable for the
pretty feat they are intended.
To say nothing here of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
arguments of this Learned
Authour upon whom I remark,
by which he seems to me quite
to have defeated that modern Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox
of the monstrous <hi>elasticity</hi>
of the Air, which yet some exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious
Wits have so favourably
entertained.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53653:8"/>Wherefore lastly, to detain my
Reader no longer in a less need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Preface, From what has been
said he may easily discern, that
this Phrase of <hi>Gravitation upward</hi>
is not destitute of all good
ground, since such libration up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
terminates on a thinner Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as true and proper Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
always does; and he may
in the mean time observe there is
no proper Gravitation but in
such cases, when a heavier fluid
sways upon a lighter, but that
the parts of the heavy fluid do
not press or gravitate one upon
another at all, nor a lighter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an heavier, but are moved
jointly by that <hi>Principle</hi> which
disposes them according as we
have above described; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider with himself, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not more likely there
should be such a <hi>subtil Element</hi>
penetrating all Bodies, in which
they, or (to speak more compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously)
<pb facs="tcp:53653:8"/>
the whole <hi>Atmosphere</hi> is
librated, and that there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that vincible <hi>consistency</hi> of
the lower Air, than that there
should be that <hi>Tension</hi> this Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Authour stands up for (which
cannot be without penetration of
dimensions, nor is it conceivable
how such an extended <hi>Funiculus</hi>
should hold together) or (which
this Authour is as much against as
for the other) that there should
be such a monstrous <hi>elastick</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Air, and <hi>actual gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation</hi>
of the parts of the <hi>same
elements</hi> one upon another, when
the Particles are of the against more
solid and searching Reason, that
enquires after the <hi>final cause</hi> of
things, and duely relishes that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Aphorism of <hi>Aristotle,
Natura nihil agit frustra:</hi> So is
it manifestly against common
<hi>sense</hi> and <hi>experience.</hi> Methinks
the Hypothesis I have here briefly
<pb facs="tcp:53653:9"/>
described, is far less obnoxious
than any of the other. But if
any one be otherwise minded, I
know right well, that liberty of
philosophizing is the common
right of all that in good earnest
profess themselves free Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</p>

                  <head>The first REMARK.</head>
                  <p>IN this Chapter there are
things said that are repugnant
one to another. For in the
very entrance of the Chapter the
learned Author asserts that <hi>Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53653:25"/>
is an <hi>intrinsecal quality of bodies
whereby they tend Downwards to
or towards the Center of the Earth;</hi>
and yet afterwards toward the
end of the Chapter, he affirms
that fire may rightly be said to
gravitate Upwards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now
if that Definition be true, That
<hi>Gravity</hi> is an intrinsecal quality
of bodies whereby they tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the center of the Earth;
whether by <hi>Gravity</hi> be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
a faculty or capacity of so
tending, or the actual exercise
thereof, we cannot avoid a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy.
For if an actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise thereof be understood, that
is <hi>Gravitation:</hi> Which here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
affirmed to be the tending
downwards of bodies towards
the center of the Earth, it is a
contradiction that the tendency
of them upwards should be <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,</hi>
but rather <hi>Levitation.</hi>
But if by <hi>Gravity</hi> be understood
only their <hi>Capacity</hi> of tending
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53653:25"/>
downwards to the center, yet
the <hi>actuality</hi> thereof will be <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,</hi>
as that of <hi>Levity, Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi>
and therefore according
to this Notion of <hi>Gravity,</hi> can
be only downwards, when as
the learned Author after asserts
that <hi>Gravitation</hi> is also upwards,
which, I say, seems a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But I rather interpret it an
emendation of his former asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and by after affirming that
<hi>Gravitation</hi> is upwards as well
as downwards, that he would
insinuate, that it is really and in
truth, (against that sense that
<hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Gravitation</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in the Schools) as well
upwards, transverse, oblique as
downwards, there being no way
such <hi>Gravity</hi> or <hi>Gravitation</hi> as
the Schools dream of, that is, from
any inherent quality of the body
it self, that may be called <hi>Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
but that it is a mere <hi>Idolum
Fori,</hi> as My Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53653:26"/>
call it, a false Notion sticking to
the vulgar use and sense of that
word, which me thinks this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Author does apertly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and consequently explode
that usual Notion, in these words
where he says; That <hi>Gravitation</hi>
is nothing else but <hi>Motus,</hi> or <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
ad motum secundùm lineam
directionis ejusdem;</hi> and a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
That <hi>Gravitation</hi> is nothing
else but <hi>motion,</hi> or at least <hi>Cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
or <hi>Nisus ad motum:</hi> Which
in my judgment plainly takes
away that false notion of <hi>Gravity</hi>
and <hi>Gravitation,</hi> entertained by
the Vulgar and the Schools. For
it as plainly follows, by denying
all <hi>intrinsecal</hi> nature to <hi>Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
saving <hi>motus</hi> or <hi>nisus ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
that that Scholastick <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,</hi>
or the specifick nature
thereof is taken away, as by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
that <hi>Homo</hi> is any thing but
<hi>Animal vitâ sensú<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> praeditum,</hi>
would take away the specifick
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53653:26"/>
nature of man out of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
                  <p>The first part therefore of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
my first Remark shall be, That,
even according to the judgment
of this learned Author, there
is nothing in bodies but <hi>mobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and <hi>actual motus</hi> or <hi>Nisus
ad motum,</hi> however they may be
disguized under the vulgar Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>levity,</hi> of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation</hi>
or <hi>levitation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Author,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
though in processe of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
he use these vulgar Phrases
of <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Gravitation,</hi> he
is to remember that the true and
Philosophical sense of them is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but <hi>Mobility,</hi> and <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
motion,</hi> or actual <hi>Nisus ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi>
which if it be considered
in its direction towards the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Earth, is more special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
noted with the name of <hi>Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
or <hi>Gravitation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That if we will cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53653:27"/>
and severely Philosophise,
we are not to imagine this <hi>actual
motion</hi> or actual <hi>Nisus ad motum</hi>
to be in any body, unless it be
discovered there to be, by clear
sense or reason; but rather not
to be when we have diligently
used these two faculties for to
discover them, and yet they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, It is deprehensible
neither by sense nor reason, that
because water, for example, will
nimbly run up a Tube let down
into water, stopt with ones fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
at the neather orifice, and
then opened, that there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any actual motion upwards
in the water, or any actual <hi>Nisus
ad istiusmodi motum,</hi> but that
as to any such motion, it was at
rest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, That if the quick run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
up of the water into such a
Tube be a solid argument of an
actual <hi>Nisus</hi> of the water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53653:27"/>
even then when it has no
such occasion to discover it self,
the quickness of the ascent of the
water is so great, and so equal
to the descent of water in a
crooked Tube of water opened
at one end in the Air, after it
is immersed into the water, I
mean the other orifice stopt also
with ones finger and them open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again when it is let down at
a sufficient depth, that the actual
<hi>Nisus</hi> of the water, (suspended,
suppose in a Bucket) downwards
and upwards will be in a manner
equal. So that the water will
have no weight at all; in so much
that another Bucket of the same
weight and size, without any

                  <p>From whence Sixthly and Lastly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
it would follow, That we finding

                  <p>IN the beginning of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Author seems to affirm
that it belongs to <hi>solid</hi> bodies
as such to have an actual pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or <hi>Conatus ad Motum</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Center of the Earth,
but to <hi>fluids</hi> onely as they are
reducible to <hi>solids</hi> by being put
into some Vessel; when as yet it
is evident that some <hi>fluid</hi> bodies
have a stronger pressure towards
the Center of the Earth than
many <hi>solid</hi> bodies. Thus bulk
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53653:28"/>
for bulk water presses more
strongly towards the Center than
most kinds of Wood, and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver
than most kind of metals.
Whence it is plain that <hi>Gravity</hi>
is not to be esteemed from the
<hi>fixedness</hi> of <hi>parts,</hi> but from the
<hi>solidity</hi> of the <hi>particles,</hi> which
that Principle that orders matter
ranges accordingly.</p>

                  <p>That also I conceive is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
in that he says, <hi>p. 15. l.</hi> 3.
That though solid bodies do actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
gravitate, yet the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
do not gravitate one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because mutually and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically</hi>
sustained one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in a state of <hi>continuity.</hi>
For first, the <hi>continuity</hi> and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
of solid dodies in Nature
is not <hi>Mechanical</hi> but <hi>per</hi>

                     </gap>.
And then that the parts do not
gravitate one upon another is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53653:29"/>
not from their <hi>continuity,</hi> but
<hi>Homogeneity</hi> or equal solidity of
particles rather. Whence it is,
that in <hi>fluids</hi> of an <hi>homogeneal</hi>
Nature, the parts do not gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
one on another; but in <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid</hi>

it might seem hopeful, That my

that the Egg-shell scapes so well
is to be referred to some other
cause. As for that lateral pressure

But what is this to the nature of

might make a pair of Pinsers that

would pull up more sand than

this will not destroy the firmness of
my demonstration from the round
board at the bottom of the Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
since the Diameter of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Bucket may bear such
a proportion to the altitude of
the Bucket, and so little distance
left betwixt the round board and
the sides of the Bucket, that
there will be a great Horizontal
section of the Cone in the Air
above the Bucket or surface of
Water in it, whence the residue
of this supposed hollow <hi>Arch</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
on the residue of the
Cone must needs fall to it, and
consequently the whole Cylinder
of water over the board gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate

30 times more than that hollow
Cylinder which is contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the convex of this Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of water and the concave of
the Bucket. And yet shall the

round board ascend. This is
plain enough already, but if there
could be any scruple, I could so
encrease the proportion of the
diameter of the bottom of the
diameter of the bottom of the
Bucket to its height, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

suppose, 30 times bigger than the

That the Water will undermine

this experiment: Supposing the

as before, and that heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-wood-rundle
almost equal to
the bottom of the Bucket pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
on it, and then a lighter-wood-rundle
of equal diameter
with the heavier placed on it,
Whether the whole Cylinder of
Water does not press on these
Rundles, and not a Cap only,
and whether notwithstanding the

which is a sign that its ascending
at other times is not to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Architecture of the

by this Learned Authour.</p>
                  <p>But I will appeal to one Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
more which will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
both these two mechanical
Accounts at once, that of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity,</hi>
and this of <hi>Architecture;</hi>
and the Experiment is this: Let
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53653:39"/>
there be a Bucket, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity
is perfectly Cylindraceous,
and the diameter of the bottom
63 parts: Let there be another
Cylindraceous Vessel, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
diameter shall be 61 parts,
external 62: Let there be at the
bottom of this Vessel 4 little
equidistant holes in the sides
slooping inwards so as to come
just to the bottom, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may no otherwise go out
than just from the bottom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
nor ascend at all but by
pressing to the bottom first. Put
this Vessel into a Bucket to the
bottom thereof, and hold it there
so as that the top of the Vessel
shall be equal to the top of the
Bucket. Then pour in water till
they be full to their brims, then
take away your hand that held
the Vessel to the bottom of the
Bucket. The Vessel in the Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
will rise up higher and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
till there be no more thereof
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53653:40"/>
immersed in water than is equal
to such a <hi>moles</hi> of water as is
equal to the whole Vessel in
weight.</p>
                  <p>The weight of the water on the
bottom of this Vessel is near up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thirty times more than the
water betwixt this Vessel and the
sides of the Bucket, which should
undermine it, and yet the Vessel
rises, of which no account can
be given, neither from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity</hi>
of the water; for the
water in the Vessel is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

nor from that <hi>Masonry</hi> of an

                  <p>Indeed the Learned Authour
seems aware of this difficulty and
propounds it as such (<hi>p. 76. l.</hi> 3.)
but I must confess I understand
not the force of his answer,
though he says it is plain. For
he says the <hi>water in the Bucket</hi>
is as fluid a body as so much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Ocean, but the <hi>Bucket
of water</hi> is as one solid body.
The <hi>Bucket of water</hi> is the <hi>water
in the Bucket,</hi> which cannot be
<hi>fluid</hi> and <hi>solid</hi> at once. It is a
perfect repugnancy in Nature.
It is therefore most certainly a
<hi>fluid body</hi> even in the Bucket,
and will have all that belongs to
a <hi>fluid body</hi> as such, all those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Gravitations, Oblique, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal,
and upward, if there
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53653:47"/>
were any such, and that upward
especially, there being nothing to
bound it or check it, which yet
is of the greatest force to lessen
the perpendicular Gravitation.
But that there are none such, is
manifest from the entireness of
the <hi>Gravitation downwards</hi> in
the water of the Bucket: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
12 pound weight still, and
were the bottom of the Bucket
taken out at once as it hangs,
the water would not as it comes
out immediately spread <hi>Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,</hi>
but descend directly down.
So that the <hi>Horizontal</hi> sallies are
only <hi>pro re nata</hi> made, when the
water cannot get down perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly,
nor attempted ever
but <hi>ex data occasione,</hi> when the
moving Principle is invited to
act, which is true also of its <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
downwards,</hi> which is
never <hi>actual,</hi> but upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being misplaced. But to
phansie there is such a perpetual
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53653:47"/>
                     <hi>Conatus</hi> every way and strong
pressure to no purpose, is too
much a-kin to those <hi>elastick</hi>
thrusts and croudings imagined
by others in the air, or that furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

The Laws of Nature assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
are more orderly and still.</p>
                  <p>To all which we will add, That
if this were the main reason why
the parts of water do not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate
one upon another in the
Bucket, because the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Gravitation is so refracted, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated,
and as it were brought
to an aequilibrium, by the other
Gravitations; it would necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow, that the water in the
Bucket being wholly turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Ice, and so really becoming
a solid body, whereby all those
other Gravitations saving the
perpendicular would be extinct,
that the perpendicular Gravitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which was 12 pound weight

when as on the contrary it is
rather lighter, proportionable to
that moderate rarefaction it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

                  <p>THE Learned Authour here
takes up Principles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
<hi>p.</hi> 21. and such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

or Reason in Nature, nay
such as are repugnant to Reason,
and absurd if we more closely
canvase them, and more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
search into them.</p>
                  <p>That he has not proved them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
but merely applied them, is plain
to any one that will give himself
the divertisement of perusing his
Treatise.</p>
                  <p>And that they cannot be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
is manifest from the very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi>
and of <hi>Tension</hi> and <hi>Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
p. 21. l.</hi> 12. For <hi>Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
and <hi>Tension</hi> is when one and
the same corporeal substance
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53653:50"/>
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupies a greater space than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but <hi>Condensation</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
when it occupies less.
These are the general natures
(which is enough for my present
purpose) in which they agree, I
mean <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Tension,</hi>
and <hi>Condensation</hi> and <hi>Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which were rashly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by some ancient Philosophers
as well as by modern, because
they conceited there were no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in the Universe, at least near
our Earth, whose parts were
more subtil than those of the
Air, or else phancied the Air an
absolute homogeneous body, nor
looked upon it as consisting of
any particles. So confused were
their notions of this natural <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But that it consists of actual
particles seems to me manifest, in
that it is so easily divisible. The
tender thred of a Spinner that
hangs on a mans Hat, being able
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53653:50"/>
to divide it in any assigned part,
which were a thing incredible,
did not the Air consist of parts
merely contiguous, and that small
ones too, and yet not of an infinite
smalness; for as much as Air will
not pass the pores of some bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
though of other some it
will.</p>
                  <p>And therefore seeing there is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
no <hi>vacuum,</hi> as is agreed on all
sides, and that the parts of the
Air are exceeding yielding to
the least touch, which could not
be if the main parts of the Air
were of such Figures as would
adequately fill all the space it is
conceived to occupy; For then
it would be so crammed that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could move easily or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
forcible penetration of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions:
Wherefore there must
be particles to fill the little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
betwixt the parts of the Air,
and those exceeding small, that
motion may be easie, and that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53653:51"/>
the fluitant parts of the Air in
this more subtile <hi>Fluid</hi> may
nimbly yield to motion every
way, as we see it does. This is
one way of proving there are
exceeding small particles in the
Air, distinct from the main and
more proper particles thereof.</p>
                  <p>But there is yet a more visible
detection thereof in the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi>
of light, in that it passes
the pores of Glass, which the Air
cannot pass. And that light is a
subtil body, besides the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Ancients, the Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion
and Refraction of it makes
it abundantly manifest. How
can the figure of a body, as in
a Burning-Glass, direct the rays
so to one point, if they were a
mere quality and not thinner
particles of matter in the Air?
And as for the conceit of <hi>Species
Intentionales,</hi> which they make
<hi>Lumen Solis</hi> to be in respect of
his <hi>Lux:</hi> that it is an impossible
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53653:51"/>
Notion, I have demonstrated in
my <hi>Enchiridium Metaphysicum.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cap. 19. Sect. 2.</note>
These hints are sufficient in an
Argument so easily allowed by
all unprejudiced Philosophers to
demonstrate, that there are<note n="*" place="margin">See Remark 4.</note> smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
parts of matter than those
that are properly Aëreal, and such
as can penetrate the pores of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
when the Aëreal parts shall
be forced to stand without.</p>
                  <p>From whence therefore it will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
plainly follow, That these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densation,</hi>
of <hi>Tension</hi> and <hi>Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
of the Air cannot be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be in Nature, in such cases
as this Learned Authour and
others phansie they are. Because
the coming in and re-ceding of
the subtiler particles we have
proved to be in Nature, will salve
these Phaenomena, and show that
it needs not be the same substance
entire when it is rarefied, but
subtiler parts may come in as
wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <pb n="56" facs="tcp:53653:52"/>
into a Spunge; nor when it
is condensated, but the subtil
parts may go out as water out of
a Spunge. And there is the same
reason of the <hi>Tension</hi> of the Air
and its <hi>Restitution;</hi> it may be
salved by egress and regress of
subtiler particles, and the <hi>Tension</hi>
and <hi>Restitution</hi> like a Lute-string
may be a mere conceit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Nor are we content with this,
but we also further affirm that it
is <hi>de facto</hi> a mere conceit, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from that we have already
proved, That the Air is so well
replenished with matter far sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiler
than it self, even such as
will penetrate Glass, and from
what is acknowledged on all
sides, that the Air is also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible.
For from hence it will
necessarily follow, that upon the
compression thereof, that there
may be <hi>no vacuum,</hi> or by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
circle of motion, those
smaller particles will pierce any
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53653:52"/>
Glass, as suppose the Glass-Tube
in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, of
which we shall speak more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in its due place.</p>
                  <p>Besides, the very notion of such
a <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condensation,
Tension</hi> and <hi>Restitution,</hi> as this
Authour would have, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the nature of a body, which
the ancient Philosophers defined
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of trinal Dimension and
impenetrable.</hi> And <hi>impenetrabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of body or matter is so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
acknowledged as a real
and inseparable property there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that even those Philosophers
that are for such a <hi>Rarefaction</hi>
and <hi>Condensation,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> has
broached, and this Authour main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
have laboured tooth and
nail, though in vain, to defend
it from that absurdity of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
of Dimensions. To say
nothing how it is a mere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
of the properties of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53653:53"/>
                     <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> For such a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction</hi>
and <hi>Condensation</hi> as is
here supposed, is too like the
<hi>Dilatation</hi> and <hi>Contraction</hi> that
belongs to particular Spirits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And lastly, if we consider
more punctually and precisely,
That if there be this <hi>Rarefaction,</hi>
it must be either by encreasing
the bulk of every Particle, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of Air, thus rarefied, or by
encreasing the number of the
Particles (every Particle (a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
imagination!) sending
Particles out of it self to occupy
a greater room) both the emissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and original particles in the
mean time being without pores,
at least so far forth as they are
thus encreased (this new acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
extension being not by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and filling of pores (as
in the <hi>Cartesian</hi> way) but by
new <hi>continued</hi> quantity, or at
least newly emitted) It is, I say,
here manifest, That if the
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease <pb n="59" facs="tcp:53653:53"/>
of the Particles be in bulk
(since there is no other imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or at least rational notion of
<hi>Solidity,</hi> but <hi>Imporosity</hi> of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and close <hi>continuity</hi> of parts
undivided into particles (For na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
experience teacheth us that
looseness of Particles is the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of <hi>Fluidity</hi> and softness)
those Particles becoming bigger,
in some cases it may be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
or a thousand times, and
being likewise solid; the effect
of the <hi>Rarefaction</hi> would be, that
the body rarefied would feel more
gross than before, which is against
experience. But however in the
other case where the number is
only encreased, those emissiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Particles by reason of their
imporosity and close continuity
of parts, are as really solid as
those bigger. And therefore it
is as hard to conceive that they
can ever enter again into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
out of which they were
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53653:54"/>
emitted. To say nothing (since
there is no <hi>vacuum</hi>) how hard a
thing it is to conceit upon every
such <hi>Rarefaction</hi> there is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
this crouding of hard or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
bodies into the like hard or
solid bodies, so that they really
penetrate, not pores but the very
dimensions of one another, though
thus hard and solid. And this
in bodies unraresied, and that
upon slight occasions and small
force, which I must confess to me
seems hugely harsh &amp; absurd, and
plainly against experience, even in
soft bodies as in water; those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
experiments that disprove
its Elasticity, proving therewithal
the Impenetrability of its parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> To all which I shall add, That
this supposed Principle of <hi>Tension</hi>
takes away all starting holes that
might be sought in bringing in
any interspersed vacuities or
empty pores in bodies, which
would be a Discontinuity or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53653:54"/>
Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contiguity of matter in the world,
which this Tension is pretended a
Fence against. And besides, if
there were any such interspersed
vacuities, so that matter might
be driven up closer into them,
that would still make my Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
from the Air-Pump more
firm, and the ascending of the
weight would be still the more
marvellous, and require the more
necessarily a <hi>Principium Hylar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicum,</hi>
the Defence of which
is the great scope of my present
<hi>Remarks.</hi> But to admit so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
and unconceivable affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in Nature as the <hi>mutual
Penetration of Dimensions,</hi> even
in hard or solid bodies, (for the
littleness of them hinders not but
that they are really hard or solid)
is an Hypothesis so like the rude
crouding and intolerable pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
in that prodigious <hi>Elasticity</hi>
of the Air, that I hope this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Authour will be as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53653:55"/>
cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious how he over-firmly adheres

actually gravitate upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour

the latter Gravitation <hi>ad

conceive if there were any such

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53653:55"/>
that it should not have

the whole body of the water
from A. to the superficies is
raised up at once, and there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
no hillock of water above
the Oyl at A. on the superficies
or on a Vessel of Oyl above
the water at A. supposing water
let into a Vessel of Oyl after the
same manner by a Glass Tube.
Now besides that it is incredible
that so little portion of water or
Oyl effused at A. should at all
be able to-raise the whole bulk
of water or Oyl in the Vessels,
from the whole superficies where
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53653:57"/>
A. is (though never so little)
towards the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p of the Vessels;
it is also further demonstrable
that the increase of Renitence or
Pressure of the water against its
being raised higher in B. more
than in A. and in C. more than
in B. is not the reason that the
Oyl in the Tube put in Water,
or Water in a Tube put into
Oyl, does not go out at B. and
ascends at C. For it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that a Tube of Oyl put into
a Vessel of Water of a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
diameter than before, suppose
twice as great, and the Tube
again immersed to A. that is, to
an equal depth as before, the
Oyl would not go out, since the
bulk of the water from A. to
the superficies is four times as big
as it was before, and therefore
the Renitence against being rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
higher, should nigh hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in proportion. And yet
the Oyl goes out at A. as before,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53653:57"/>
notwithstanding this imagined
Renitency. Whence it is plain
it is not the force of effused Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Oyl, or Oyl in the
Water, that can raise the Water
or Oyl one Atoms breadth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but the preventing activity of
that <hi>immaterial Principle</hi> that
disposes all the parts of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
in the Vessel, orderly and
at once, there being no crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nor pressing any way, one

<hi>l.</hi> 23. is found from the bottom
to the top in a manner of equal

the superficies of the water no
higher in one position than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but because the water is
no heavier at one depth than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that is, is not heavy at all.</p>

                  <p>After an experiment made with
a Glass-Siphon with Quick-Silver
and Water, the longer leg of the
Siphon being 32 inches, the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
8. and the shorter leg having
something a larger Diameter than
the longer (which experiment is
thus: 1. He filled the shorter leg
with <hi>Mercury</hi> till it ran up as high
in the longer, that is 8 inches ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the law of Fluids, and
stopping the shorter with his fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
filled the residue of the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
with water, whereupon the
<hi>Mercury</hi> in the longer leg subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to two inches and a quarter,
24 inches of water driving it so
far down, though 28 inches of
water is the usual counterpoise to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53653:60"/>
two inches of <hi>Mercury.</hi> 2: Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
filled again the Siphon with
Quick-silver as at first, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersing
it into a Tube of water
32 inches high, so that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
of water over the shorter
leg was full 24 inches, yet those
24 inches drive the <hi>Mercury</hi> in
the shorter leg but one inch down,
and raised it one inch in the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
3. Having poured water
into the longer leg of the Siphon,
so that the <hi>Mercury</hi> subsided two
inches, and as much flowed out
at the shorter, and then immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
again the Siphon into the
Glass-vessel 32 inches deep filled
with water, the <hi>Mercury</hi> subsid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
near an inch in the shorter leg,
and accordingly impelled the
<hi>Mercury</hi> into the longer.) Upon
this experiment, I say, he makes
this observation, <hi>p. 67. l.</hi> 1. That
notwithstanding the advantage
of the larger Diameter of the
shorter leg, the Gravitation of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53653:60"/>
the external water or any imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
column thereof, was not
half so much as the Gravitation
of the Cylinder of water includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Tube, he means, the
longer leg of the Siphon, which
I conceive to be a plain mistake;
For neither is that larger Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the shorter leg any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
but a disadvantage; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Fluids being swifter out
of a narrow passage into wide
than <hi>vice versâ:</hi> nor is there any
indication in all these experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that the Gravitation of
the 24 inches of water in the
longer leg does gravitate as much
more as the column of water of
24 inches impendent over the
orifice of the shorter leg. For in
the first instance, where 24 inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of water drives the Quick-silv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
2 inches and ¼ downward in
the longer leg, it is because of the
largeness of the Diameter of the
shorter leg, or by reason of its
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53653:61"/>
wideness. So when the 24 inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of water and the Quick-silver
was to balance against it, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
more Quick-silver to be
at a counterpoise with it, than if
it had had the same Diameter with
the longer shank; and hence it
is, that the Quicksilver subsides
so far in the longer shank, and
not the discontinuity of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in it from other water. And
now we come to the second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
it is to be noted that the
impendent column of water driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Mercury</hi> one inch down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the short leg, and so
consequently raising it one in the
longer, that there will be 9 inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
in the longer leg, and but 7 in
the shorter; so that upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the column of 24 inches in
the water poizes as much against
the Quick-silver in this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as that water in the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
shank did in the former. For
here it ponderates against 2 inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53653:61"/>
of Quick-silver, there but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
2 and ¼, nay I may safely
say against above two in this;
For if it was driven down one
inch in the shorter but wider
shank, it must needs rise above
one inch in the other; and I
doubt not but a quarter of an
inch or thereabout, if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
had taken so punctual no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it. And as in these two
instances in several, the column
of the water in the water is found
to be aequiponderant to a column
of so many inches in the longer
shank of the Siphon, so we shall
find them in this last and joint
experiment. For upon the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
water into the long leg of
the Siphon there remained but
6 inches of <hi>Mercury</hi> in that leg,
and 8 in the other, wherefore
upon the immitting of the Siphon
into the Glass-Tube, and there
being found about an inch sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding
in the shorter leg, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53653:62"/>
a rising as much in the longer; it is
manifest that in each leg there was
about 7 inches height of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver
a piece, and that the column
of water in the water gravitates as
much as the column of water in
the longer shank of the Siphon,
and not only half as much, as our
Authour would have it; which
is an excellent experiment against
his supposed <hi>Masonry</hi> in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of water, and that each
part of water by each part doth
most glibly slip: And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this imaginary <hi>Architecture</hi>
can contribute nothing to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

                  <p>That the Rundle ariseth not in
the Vessel the Learned Authour
offers this reason, because the
water gravitates now upon the
Rundle, as having mediately a
lighter element, namely the Air
upon which it gravitates, <hi>l.</hi> 23.
But being as firmly sustained as
before from passing to the Air,
why should it gravitate any more
than before? And besides if the
bottom of the Bucket be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
higher than the Basis of the
Ribs of the Bucket on which it
may stand, and there be a second
bottom made to keep the Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
this second bottom and
the former perforated bottom
from communicating with the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53653:63"/>
rest of the Air; it is worth the
enquiring whether the Rundle
then will not rise, because the
<hi>Abituriency</hi> of the Air which was
in the other case, is thus sufflami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated?
Whence it would be
plain, it was not simply because
there was Air beneath, that the
water gravitated on the Rundle,
but because that Air was in the
state of <hi>Abituriency,</hi> or at least in
sufficient quantity to colluctate
with the water, the <hi>Principium
Hylarchicum</hi> upon such hints, by
reason of the quick motion of
those Laws of Life in it, putting
this under-Air into that <hi>Abituri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>

the water <hi>raptu consensûs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an actual tendency downward,
and so thrusting the Rundle clos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to the Hole, intangles it self
in its own attempt, as not acting
by free reason and counsel, but
by some general Laws of instinct
of life, which in some such by-cases
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53653:64"/>
do not further but hinder
the effect generally produced by
Nature. Whence it is evident
that this <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> is not

of an empty Glass-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
carefully stopt, and sunk a
great depth into the Sea, that
the pressure of the water will
break it a-pieces, p. 95. l. 9. And
he resolves it into this reason,
because the water presses against
a lighter Element, the Air, though
mediately through the Glass.
But I say, that is not the adequate
cause thereof, that it has a ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Element near to it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the Element is mispla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
for the upper part of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53653:64"/>
water in a Vessel does not press
against the Air in the Vessel
that is incumbent on it; but if a
Bottle of Air were let down into
the Sea with its mouth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and well stopt to keep out
water, yet the water will thrust
the Cork upward and drive it in.
But that is because the Air is mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed,
and put in the Element
of water, which methinks are
very apert insinuations, that there
is no such thing as <hi>intrinsick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi>
but that matter moved is
moved by a principle distinct from
it self. For the parts of the water
of the Sea do not press one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
another, neither before nor
after the Bottle is let down, and
yet there is such a pressure on the
Bottle once let down, that either
the Cork is driven in or the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
broke in pieces. The other
two instances also the Authour
mentions in this page tend to the
same purpose, I mean those of

Oyl driving Water upwards, and
Water Quick-silver, of which

in these instances though the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate

l. 6. why a small Glass-Tube
of so many Inches long, and filled
up with water, and stopt with
ones finger at the lower end, and
let into a Vessel of Water of a
competent diameter and depth,
upon the unstopping of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
end, all the water in the Tube
above the superficies of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Vessel will run down
till' it be no higher than the said
superficies, namely, because if it
obtain never so little more height
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53653:66"/>
in the Pipe than in the Vessel, it
has a greater force to press down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
than the water in the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
has strength to resist it; this
reason I conceive does not quite
exhaust the difficulty: For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this Pipe of but a quarter
of an inch diameter, and a Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
of a foot and a half, and deep
a foot, and the Pipe 9 inches
and half a quarter long, and 9
inches thereof in the water, so
that there is but half a quarter
of an inch of the water to press
up by its force to some, though
very little, height, a <hi>moles</hi> of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of 9 inches deep, and a foot
and an half diameter, how is it
possible that the force of <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi>
Gravity of a Cylinder of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
but a quarter of an inch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter,
and half a quarter of an
inch altitude, should raise at all
a Cylinder of 18 inches diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and 9 inches in altitude, if
some principle distinct from both,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53653:66"/>
did not assist? For the one Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
exceeds the other above
some hundred thousand times, and
yet the pressure of this little Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
must raise the great one by
its own force, if there be no
other <hi>principle</hi> to help, nor pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration
of dimensions, which
is even as absurd as the other.
Or if you take the 9 inches of
water more in the Tube into
your compute, yet this added
to the abovesaid Cylinder of
but half a quarter of an inch
high, will be above 5000 times
less than the exteriour Cylinder.
So big is the absurdity still.</p>

that should carry down the
<hi>Obturaculum,</hi> (or rather that
Principle that moves the matter
being rapt into one consent of
circular motion from the bottom
of the Air in the Tube to the
top, and then down into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
till it reach the <hi>Obturaculum</hi>

as if it would ascend up,
(which it would do but for the
<hi>Obturaculum)</hi> in pursuit of the
Air so drawn upwards, till it
was even with the superficies of

<hi>Obturaculum</hi> upon that <hi>abituri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi>
is driven upwards, and that
the motion in order of Nature is
first there in the air of the Tube;
for as much as if the <hi>abituriency</hi>
of the Air in the Tube be stopt
with a mans finger at a due near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or by a moveable <hi>Embolus,</hi>
the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> that at such a
depth clave close before to the
Valve, will presently fall down,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53653:68"/>
which is a plain demonstration
that the rise of the motion of
pressure against the <hi>Obturaculum</hi>
is from the air in the Tube first
moved, according to that Law of

                  <p>And from what we have said
in the foregoing <hi>Remark,</hi> it is
evident I conceive that this
Learned Authour is out in the
account of this <hi>Phenomenon.</hi>
For p. 110, <hi>and</hi> III. he resolves
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53653:68"/>
the sticking of the <hi>Obturaculum</hi>
to the Valve, into the Tubes
pressing up a portion of water of
a greater weight than it. <hi>If the</hi>
Sucker, says he, (which answers
to that which I call the <hi>Obtura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum)
be drawn up</hi> (p. 110. l.
12.) <hi>and then immersed so low
that the portion of water impelled
up by the Tube does exceed the
weight of the Sucker, the Sucker
will be sustained by the pressure of
the water upon it: But if the
weight of a</hi> moles <hi>of water,</hi> saith
he, <hi>commensurate to so much of the
Tube as is immersed in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
be less than the weight of the
Sucker, the Sucker by its own
weight will subside.</hi> That this
reason is maim, is apparent from
hence; That if the Tube be let in
so low that it raised a <hi>moles</hi> of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whose weight is much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the weight of the <hi>Obtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculum,</hi>
or Sucker, and that for
the present the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> will
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53653:69"/>
stick to the Valve, yet if the
Tube be stopt with ones finger,
or rather by a moveable <hi>Embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
at a due nearness to the Valve,
the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> will suddenly
fall; whence it is manifest, that
the Solution is not finally to be
made into the raising of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to several heights, upon which
its pressure should encrease a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Obturaculum,</hi> but into
the <hi>abituriency</hi> of the Air in the
Tube or just quantity thereof,
and of the several forces of that
<hi>abituriency</hi> into the laws of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
innate or essential to the
<hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> or universal
<hi>Transposer</hi> of the parts of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the world. For where there
is no raising of the water high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
at a deeper descent to make
its pressure greater in the immit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Air into Water, as in a Glass
filled with Air and well stopt let
down into the bottom of the Sea,
upon a deep descent it will break,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53653:69"/>
though upon a moderate it will
not (though it raises the water
alike in both cases.) Which is
resolvible into nothing but the
greater excitement of the force
of the <hi>Principium Hylarchicum,</hi>
upon the greater transgression of
those <hi>Hylostatick</hi> laws vitally and
essentially included in it. For
the parts of water in water do
not gravitate one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and they have as much room
to play in when a Bottle of Air is
sent down into the Water, as
when a Bottle of Water of the

the Air in the former is mispla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
contrary to the <hi>Hylostatick</hi>

                  <p>IT is a very notable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Experiment the Learned
Authour mentions, <hi>p. 118. l. 19.
It is most evident to any mans
sense,</hi> quoth he, <hi>that will but
try, that if a Tube be open at both
ends and filled up with Mercury,
and then one end stopped with
the finger, and the other end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and immersed in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stagnant
Mercury, whereby it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
from the top of the Tube, a
strong and sensible attraction is
wrought upon the pulp of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
finger that closeth it, which
continues and grows more and
more forcible, sensible, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
the further the Mercury is
removed from the upper end, and
approaches to its usual station of
29 inches.</hi> This is his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53653:70"/>
which to me is a seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
confirmation of what in the
foregoing <hi>Remark</hi> I observed.
That the force of activity in the
<hi>Principium Hylarchicum</hi> or <hi>Hylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staticum</hi>
is excited proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to the measure of misplace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the parts of the matter
of the Universe. But as for the
Learned Authours solution of
this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> I mean of this
attraction of the pulp of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
at the top of the Tube, I must
confess I am not at all satisfied
with, and look upon it as a kind
of Philosophical incivility, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
so eminent a fellow Creature
as this <hi>Hylostatick spirit,</hi> took
the opportunity of pulling him
by the finger, when he could not
shake him by the hand, that he
would not embrace this offer of
acquaintance, nor take notice of
the existence of such a Being in the
world, which I must confess, I
think, this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53653:71"/>
evidence of, so circumstantiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as this Authour hath described;
for it is not Impulsion <hi>ab extrà</hi> as
he describes it. <hi>For,</hi> says he, <hi>most
evidently the force the finger feels
is from within and not from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:</hi>
and when he says, it is
upon the pulp of the finger and
not the quitching of the skin, it is
apparent that that force is in his
very finger, not on the outside,
whether in the Tube or without.
And therefore it cannot be the
contiguity of any body in the
Tube, as our Learned Authour
would have it, by which this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
is made, but it is the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostatick
spirit of Nature,</hi> that
upon unexpected occasions, after
an unexpected manner moves the
matter, and it was a kind of an
attempt of this <hi>Hylarchick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
to expand and rarifie the
pulp of the finger to supply the
absence of the Mercury. Its tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
therefore of the pulp of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53653:71"/>
finger toward the Cavity of the
Tube, made the sense of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
into it. But that this
Attraction could be by no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity
of any body in the Tube,
appears from hence, that then it
would have been felt more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
and distinctly in the very
exteriour skin.</p>

                  <p>OUR Authour reasons pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing-well
against a free per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meation
of the <hi>Aether</hi> into the
Glass-Tube derelicted of the
Quick-silver, because the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver
then would subside to the
bottom, as when there is but a
hole at the top of the Tube no
bigger than a Pins point, because
then the Air he thinks may come
in freely, so if the <hi>Aether</hi> could
come in freely through the pores
of the Glass, the Mercury would
subside in that case too. But
that the subtiler parts of the Air
or <hi>Aether</hi> cannot upon occasion
(though not so freely) penetrate
the pores of the Glass, His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for this Assertion seem
to me altogether unsatisfactory.
For if I understand him aright,
the first thing he offers to prove
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53653:73"/>
it by, is, That if they could pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
at all they would pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
freely, and then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Inconvenience would return.
The second is a denial, or suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
that there are no such pores in
Glass as any such smaller Particles
can go thorough. But to the
first I answer. That though the
pores of the Glass be pervious
enough to the <hi>Aether</hi> or subtiler
parts of the Air, yet the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi>
of the natural consistence
of the Air will not for-go them
but by some force, and a less pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
or force than of a column
of Quick-silver of about 30 inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
high will not prevail, any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
it will. To the second,
That in my first <hi>Remark</hi> I have
hinted that <hi>(part 4.)</hi> which will
sufficiently prove that there are
pores in the Glass as well as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
subtiler than the Air to
pass through them, as is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in the direction of the rays

to one point through a Burning-glass,
against what our Authour
here declares that there is only a
<hi>vis,</hi> virtue or vigour corporeal,
no substance that penetrates the
Glass. For as bodies are only
<hi>tangible,</hi> so they are only <hi>reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible</hi>
and <hi>refractable;</hi> To which
you may add, that the lightness
and frangibleness of Glass are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Indications of its porosity.
These things are so plain to the
unprejudiced that it is needless to
insist on them.</p>

To which I answer, that these
two ways are in a manner one
and the same, or at least the
stress lies upon that one first,
which if it fail the other will sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
nothing. And methinks it
is apparent at least in such a case
as this, that it will signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
namely, if the Tube filled
with Mercury be immitted into
the restagnant Mercury, very
much inclining, and be raised to
a perpendicular by degrees and
leasurely, for then there being no
such jolting of one part against
another, but a gently bringing

against this opinion of Mercurial
<hi>effluvia</hi> supplying the derelicted
place of the Mercury in the

should contain 4 pounds of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
this Mercury subsiding to

<hi>effluvia</hi> to fill so great a space?
His answer is, the more Mercury
descends to 29 inches, the more
<hi>effluvia</hi> there will be to fill the
space; but I say if the Tube of
Mercury be let down obliquely,
as before, and be gently and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely

according to the law of Fluids
the compression will be even just
nothing. From whence then can

sealed at one end, filled with
Mercury and immersed to the
bottom of a Vessel of restagnant
Mercury 7 inches deep, so that
29 inches and 1/2 will be above the
restagnant Mercury, the Tube re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
full to the top. But
the Glass being lighter than the
Mercury, it will be driven up
thereby near to the superficies
thereof. So that about 6 inches
of the upper end of the Tube
will be empty, but the Tube con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53653:77"/>
till 39 inches of Mercury
and 1/2, the bottom of it immersed

is, that the 29 inches of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
and an half, weighs one
pound, and the Tube just as
much. This Tube of Mercury
now in these circumstances fixed
by a String to a Beam of a pair of
Scales, two pound in the adverse
Scale will counterpoise, and any
little advantage of weight ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
will make it preponderate.
Whence he clearly deduces from
the Mercury's contributing the
weight of a pound to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoizing
the Scale, that it is not
sustained by a Cylinder of Air of

it self, for then there would be

the two pound in the Scale;

                  <p>And as weak a subterfuge is
that whereby they would elude
this Answer, namely by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Glass-Tube being
a body specifically lighter than
Mercury, is it self sustained by the
restagnant Mercury, as if that
broke the force of the column of
Air that presses 9 times as strong
on the head of the Tube as the
other column of Air on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stagnant
Quick-silver; when-as
it is a thing plainly prodigious
that a single force should keep
Mercury 29 inches and 1/2 above
the surface of the restagnant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
up in the Air, though it be
I know not how many thousand
times lighter than Mercury, and
yet that the Glass should not be
kept down 6 inches under the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the restagnant Mercury,
though not fourteen times hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier

                  <p>But the Authour does very
handsomely meet with all such
elusions by two neat experiments.
The one is of a Glass-Tube, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter
of whose Cavity was <hi rend="sup">48</hi>,
the Diameter of the whole <hi rend="sup">58</hi> of
an inch, the length 18 inches, the
weight thereof in the Air 2 oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi rend="sup">34</hi>, the water it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
near 1 ounce <hi rend="sup">34</hi>. This Tube
tyed at the closed end to the
Scale of a Balance, and being
filled with water and stopt with
ones finger, and so let down into
water, and so settled there as that
the lower end was near about a
quarter of an inch from the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
there was required in the
opposite Scale four ounces and <hi rend="sup">12</hi>,
which is equal to the weight of
the Water and Tube together to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53653:79"/>
hold the Tube in an <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi>
and here the Glass-Tube is not
held up by the restagnant water,
the Glass being so heavy that it
would sink to the bottom, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a body specifically heavier
than water. Wherefore this
<hi>Aequilibrium</hi> being from hence,
according to the Principles of
those that hold the pressure of
the Atmosphere, either because
the Tube and the water jointly
do weigh against the Weights in
the other scale, or because the
column of Air on the head of
the Tube with the Tube weigh
against them, this second being
impossible, for as much as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter
of that column is five such
parts as the diameter of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
of water in the Tube, and
that of Air on the restagnant wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is four, and therefore would
press at least half as much again
as the water in the Tube, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the proportion of 25 to 16,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53653:79"/>
which the Scale discovers to be
false, for there is only one ounce <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>/4
added to the two ounces 3/<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
3/2 of an ounce more; it remains
that it is the Water with the Tube
jointly that weighs against the
Weights in the other Scale, for
as much as the restagnant Water
does not hinder the Tube: from
whence it follows, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Tube is not sustained
by any column of Air on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stagnant
Water, which will be
more apparent in the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
which is this: He
took, suppose, the same Tube,
heated it very hot, and hung the
closed end upon one Scale of a
Balance, and let the open end
sink a little into a Vessel of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and counterpoized it in the
other Scale with 2 ounces 3/<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, the
weight the empty Tube weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Air, which, because
the end of it did little more than
touch the water, it still retained,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53653:80"/>
but within the space of half a
quarter of an hour the Tube was
filled 12 inches of its 18 with
water, which 12 inches of water
was found to weigh one ounce
and ¼, and one ounce and ¼ more
put in the opposite Scale, and
the Scales held so that the Tube
might only touch the surface of
the water, the Tube with the 12
inches of water in it was found
to weigh just 4 ounces. Now
therefore since the Tube could
weigh no more, if so much, on
the top of the water, than it did
when it was hung only in the
Air, for the pillar of Air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on the top of the Tube
is the same in both cases, it is
manifest, against the principles of
those that hold the pressure of
the Atmosphere, that the water
in the Tube weighs its part,
namely one ounce and ¼ to make
the weight 4 ounces, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that the water in the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53653:80"/>
Tube is not sustained by any
pressure of a Pillar of Air incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on the restagnant Water.</p>

plainly disproved by the Authour,
not only by these last Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

particularly by the two Brass Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linders
weighed in water of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameters
of a double proportion

is, and that equal weights pressed

is notably levelled against the
<hi>elasticity</hi> of the Air, <hi>p. 196. l.</hi> 22.
That a Bolts-head soundly heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and placed upon a Glass-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
with some fix ounces of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in it, which may fill it about
half full, but not so closely luted
but that some Air, though but at a
pins hole, may come in, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Bottle will be wholly
drawn up into the Bolts-head.
But if the Bolts-head were hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so closed that no Air could
enter into it, some water would
indeed rise as far as into the shank
of the Bolts-head, but the whole
water would not ascend into the
Bolts-head as before it did, which,
says this Learned Authour, is a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53653:82"/>
plain argument against that huge
<hi>elasticity</hi> of the Air that some
imagine. For no fresh Air being
let in by this strict closure, the
force of the rarefied Air in the
Bolts-head is more entire, and as
he conceives the attraction more
powerful to raise the water as
before, if there were any thing
near that <hi>elasticity</hi> in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Air that is imagined there,
that it can expand it self into 40
times a larger space if need be;
nor would the weight, says he,
of the interposed water be too
great for the <hi>Elatery</hi> of the Air
in this case to drive it up so
high as before, since in a close
Receiver it is able, according to
their opinion, to thrust and keep
up a column of Mercury to 29
inches high, possibly of a pound
weight or more. Why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if there were any such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
<hi>Elatery</hi> of the Air, cannot
it thrust up 5 or 6 ounces of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53653:83"/>
wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about 5 or 6 inches high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Bolts-head, which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
argued against that huge

the Authours own solution of

materially acts against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward-sides

as near as it could to a consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
more sutable to the rest of
the Air at this pitch from the

                  <p>In this Chapter the Learned
Authour lays down the
true cause, as he conceives, of
the suspension of the Mercury in
the Glass-Tube in the <hi>Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
experiment, and he takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to speak of three kinds
thereof, but I shall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
only of one, and that the
chief of them, in which if I
plainly discover his mistake, I
suppose there will be no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
touching the other two.
This experiment then is, when a
Tube, suppose of four foot long,
is filled full of Quick-silver, and
so inverted and immitted into a
vessel of restagnant Quick-silver,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53653:88"/>
upon which the Mercury in the
Glass-Tube will descend to 29
inches and an half, and leave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
18 inches in the Tube de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of Mercury. The reason
of this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> the Authour
gives to be this; The expression
and ascension of some mercurial
vapours or particles at large, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
up by the <hi>agitation</hi> and <hi>pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of the parts of the Mercury,
and withal their <hi>Tension,</hi> that
they may be able to fill so great
a space as the 18 inches of the
Tube devoid of the body of
Mercury. This is his solution
of this Problem. But the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
upon which this solution is
built, are not sufficiently firm.
For <hi>first,</hi> He supposes no Aëreal
particles passing through the
Mercury to get into the dereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
space of the Tube, that it
must necessarily be the <hi>effluvia</hi> of
the Mercury it self that ascends;
when-as by the 3. and 4. part of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53653:88"/>
my first <hi>Remark</hi> there are such
subtil parts in the Air that they
penetrate the pores of the Glass.
And then <hi>secondly,</hi> For the <hi>pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
and <hi>agitation</hi> of the parts of
the Mercury, the pression of Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids
on Fluids of the same kind,
is nothing in a manner, and the
agitation observed might be
much diminished, if not wholly
prevented by a leasurely oblique
immission of the Tube, and so
by degrees bringing it to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular;
whence there would
be either no mercurial <hi>effluvia</hi>
raised, or else the copiousness of
them so varied accordingly as
they shall take heed to prevent
the tumultuary agitation, that
the suspension of the Mercury
will not be the same at all times,
but sometimes lower, sometimes
higher. Nor is that <hi>lucta</hi> in the
Mercury from the endeavouring
of Nature to give <hi>Tension</hi> to the
<hi>effluvia,</hi> but betwixt the weight
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53653:89"/>
of the column of Mercury, and
the <hi>resistency</hi> of the consistence of
the compressible Air. Nor <hi>last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
will that experiment of the
Quick-silver, so forcibly rising
against the top of the Tube, if it
be suddenly lifted up, prove any
such Lute-string-like <hi>Tension</hi> in
the supposed <hi>effluvia.</hi> For in
this case there is that, which this
Learned Authour admits of, both
phrase and thing, that is, <hi>Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio
sursum,</hi> and upon the more
sudden plucking up the Tube,
the consistence of the Air not
letting in the subtil Element, and
there being no <hi>vacuum</hi> any where,
nor penetration of dimensions,
the Air is driven upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stagnant
Quick-silver, and the
restagnant Quick-silver into the
mouth of the Tube, and so is as
it were a flux of water into a far
straiter Channel, and therefore
it must there proportionably run
the swifter. And this swift
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="131" facs="tcp:53653:89"/>
in so heavy a body as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
must needs be the stronger
and more peremptory, coming
against so thin a body as that
subtil matter in the Tube, even
to the danger of breaking it. So
that the whole is as it were a
quick Gravitation <hi>sursum,</hi> by a
circle of motion against that thin
Element at the upper end of the
Tube. Which plainly shows, that
there is no ground for <hi>Tension,</hi>
there being such reason for <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumpulsion.</hi>
And thus I have
shown the <hi>groundlesness</hi> of his
<hi>Reasons,</hi> but in the next Chapter
I shall discover the <hi>repugnancy</hi> of
his <hi>assertion.</hi>

the two suppositions he holds
necessary for the maintaining of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53653:90"/>
his former solution of the <hi>Torri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellian</hi>
Phaenomenon. The <hi>first</hi>
is, that there is no <hi>vacuum</hi> in
Nature. The <hi>second,</hi> that thin or
subtil bodies are capable of <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
and of <hi>attraction</hi> and <hi>strong
adhaesion</hi> to other bodies, and <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haesion</hi>
of one part to another, as
in a Lute-string, as is his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
illustration, saving that in a
Lute-string the <hi>Tension</hi> one way
straitens it another way, and
makes the Lute-string narrower,
but here the <hi>Tension</hi> and <hi>Cohaesion</hi>
is every way at once. As for the
first, that there is no <hi>vacuum,</hi> it is
granted, which makes his denial
of the passing of any aërial parts
or particles in the Air, through
the Glass or Mercury, repugnant
to his own supposed principle.
For it being plain that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersion
of the Tube may be
made so obliquely and leasurely
as neither to press out nor fridge
out any mercurial <hi>effluvia;</hi> it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53653:90"/>
follows there would be a <hi>vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi>
or if some few should arise,
what would they do when the
top of the Tube is like a Bolts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
containing the capacity of
many pounds of Mercury, there
must be a <hi>vacuum,</hi> or such a <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of those few <hi>effluvia,</hi> that
I should think it would exceed
all belief in the very Authour
himself. But let this go; There
is enough in what remains utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to destroy this Hypothesis of
the Authour, I mean these two
things comprized in the second
member; mere <hi>Tension</hi> it self, such
as is ordinarily supposed in an
usual Tube, in the descent of the
Mercury to 29 inches, and that
<hi>tough adhaesion</hi> and <hi>cohaesion</hi> of
the particles thus extended. For
first as for the <hi>Tension,</hi> in a Tube
so obliquely immitted and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely
raised to a perpendicular,
no man can rationally imagine
one inch of <hi>effluvia</hi> either pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53653:91"/>
or fridged out of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
by its descent; and if there
were, and these taken or let out by
some artifice at every trial, some
18 trials would lessen the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
18 such inches of the Tube,
which would prove very sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
But though this were not,
there would in the mean time by
this <hi>Tension</hi> of one inch of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into 18, be seventeen inches
penetration of solid matter and
hard, or else it would not be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration,
and this by so small a
force as the weight of a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Mercury of no greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter
than would make it
weigh one pound, when-as the
Authour himself acknowledges
that an 100 pound weight will
not press water so as to make it
yield at all, and yet here upon
the least gentle motion of the
Tube from a perpendicular to an
inclined posture, and from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
posture to a perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53653:91"/>
there shall be more or less
penetration of dimension, as if
that which wise and considerate
Philosophers have held impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
were as easie as the running
an hot Bodkin into a pound of
Butter, which methinks to any
one that indifferently perpends
the matter, must seem a clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
against this solution
of the Problem, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
noted in the sixth and seventh
part of my first <hi>Remark;</hi> and
what I have there already writ,
will save me the labour of any
further enlarging my self in this
point.</p>
                  <p>But now for that tough and
peremptory <hi>adhaesion</hi> of this thin
body in the Tube, to the top
and sides thereof, and <hi>cohaesion</hi>
of one part thereof to another,
and the lowest part to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of the Quick-silver in the
Tube, as if the top of the Tube
were instead of so many <hi>Peggs,</hi>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:53653:92"/>
and the upper part of the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver
the <hi>Bridge</hi> of the Lute,
and the subtil matter betwixt,
under this actual <hi>Tension,</hi> so many
<hi>Lute-strings,</hi> in virtue whereof
the column of Mercury hangs
suspended as a weight. This to
me I must confess is unimagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For first I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that if I could come to
this thin matter, which is thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
than Air it self, I could cut
through it with a Spinners thred,
or by any other line subtiler and
weaker than it; nor can I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that that which can be so
easily cut asunder, holds so fast
together, as that it will sustain
in this experiment one pound
weight, in some others it may
be some hundreds. Besides, if
every part held together so
toughly, no Flie could move in
it, nor Flie nor Feather fall down
from the top of the Tube to the
upper Bafis of the mercurial
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53653:92"/>
Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder, which is against experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but they would hang like
dust or flies on the webs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
or indeed the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
of that subtil matter
would be viscous or glutinous
and so impassable to them. To
all which you may add, If it
had this strong retraction as a
<hi>Lute-string,</hi> it taking hold only
on the upper part or surface as
it were of the mercurial Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it would pluck up the <hi>Bridg.</hi>
Wherefore the mercurial Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is not held up by <hi>Suspension</hi>
but by <hi>Circumpulsion</hi> and <hi>Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
upwards, if I may use the
language of this Authour, the
Air and Quicksilver both gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
against the thin subtil mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the upper end of the
Tube, through the Mercury in
the lower end, as the water
does against the stopple of the
Valve in the<note n="*" place="margin">Remark 12.</note> above-mentioned
experiment, that is, there is a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53653:93"/>
                     <hi>sistency</hi> of them in this order and
<hi>Libration</hi> by the <hi>Hylostatick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>

confess men have tired
themselves in vain to find out
any <hi>mechanical</hi> cause, and I have
in my <hi>Enchiridium Metaphysicum</hi>
proved that it is contrary to the
laws of <hi>Mechanicks.</hi> And he
seems to resolve these things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Nature,</hi> which is the <hi>Principium
matûs &amp; quietis,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines,
and also declares of her,
That <hi>Natura nihil agit srustra.</hi>
Whereby, but that his words have
stuck in his teeth and he hath
not spoke out, <hi>Aristotle</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
what I contend for, a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Nature</hi> or <hi>Hylostatick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi>
which he must of necessity
acknowledge, unless he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
himself, for as much as he
makes matter <hi>merely passive,</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:53653:93"/>
which it cannot be, if what moves
it and orders it be but a <hi>modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of matter, and not a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
distinct there-from: for that
<hi>modification</hi> would be from its
own essence, and consequently
it would be <hi>self-moved,</hi> and move
it self so, (unless we play tricks
with it) that it does <hi>nihil agere
srustra,</hi> which is far from being
a mere passive Principle. But
this is more than I intended to
say upon this occasion. VVe
have plainly enervated the main
of this Chapter; what little
maters remain, we will dispose
into the following Remarks.</p>

                  <p>The Learned Authour endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to prove the <hi>attraction</hi> of
<hi>tensed</hi> bodies, <hi>p. 239. l.</hi> 12. from
Natures affectation of a strict
<hi>contiguity,</hi> it being a kind of
<hi>continuity</hi> of the Universe and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53653:94"/>
all its parts. But I observe, if
there were any such <hi>attraction,</hi>
the <hi>final</hi> cause only is there indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated,
but we seek after a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<hi>efficient</hi> cause. And I deny
moreover that there is any scope
in the suspension of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
to save the Universe from
<hi>discontinuity,</hi> but only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Air in its due <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency.</hi>
Nor is the Air the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

Spirit</hi> that holds the parts
of the whole Universe together,
no <hi>Atomi hamatae,</hi> or any such
corporeal contrivances. And
where the matter is never so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til,
the contiguity of the world
is as much as where it is more
crass. And therefore where we
see strange things done upon any
place, being filled with only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme

and suspension of the

the water, he attributing the
suspension of the water in both
to the <hi>attraction</hi> of the rarefied

so fully confuted by me, I am
more sollicitous in these instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to give an handsom account
of the jointly weighing of the

and Water, and of the Glass and
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, each of them as one joint
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, than of confuting what
is already confuted. And the
case I conceive stands thus: By
the <hi>Hylostatick</hi> laws of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi>
it is, that heavy bodies will
even press upwards, as light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
heavy, and jointly both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a far lighter, though there
be an heavy body betwixt,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53653:95"/>
which I a little<note place="margin">Remark 32.</note> above noted in
the resiliency of the Quick-silver
against the top of the Tube.
Now as there the Air and restag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Quick-silver gravitated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the subtil matter in the
top of the Tube through the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
of Quick-silver in the Tube,
so the Air and Water gravitate
both in the Tube and Drinking-glass,
against the rarefied Air
therein, it being thinner than the
common Air, and ascended in
each so far according to <hi>Hylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statick</hi>
laws; As I doubt not
but that if a whole Tube of such
subtil matter as is at the top in the
<hi>Torricellian</hi> experiment could be
had and were inverted into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stagnant
Mercury, the Mercury
would be seen to ascend to 29
inches in the Tube as the water
is seen to ascend in the Beer-glass
and Tube. In all which cases
both the Mercury and Water
ascend by a <hi>Libration</hi> which this
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53653:96"/>
Authour calls a <hi>Gravitation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi>
and are held there by the
same Law at such a gage, and
not by <hi>attraction</hi> or <hi>suspension.</hi>
But how then, will you say, does
the Tube and Mercury, the Tube
and Water, the Beer-glass and
Water, weigh each of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as one joint body? 'Tis
a considerable Problem, but I
answer, The same <hi>Hylostatick
Principle</hi> that thus librates them,
which is the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> does
also, but with a vincible and
mutable union, unite them. For
both motion and union is from
Spirit, as I have showed in my
<hi>Enchiridium Metaphysicum.</hi> And
from hence it will be easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
how when with the
hand, <hi>p. 247. l. 12.</hi> you lift up
the Beer-glass towards the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
of the restagnant water,
the water included will arise with
it much above the superficies of
the external water. Which though
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53653:96"/>
it be not by that monstrous <hi>Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi>
pressure of the Air that
some are for, yet it is by a <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation</hi>
of the Air upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and of the water upwards, and
both of them jointly against the
rarefyed Air in the Concave of
the Glasse. So little need is there
of any <hi>Tension,</hi> but merely of this

Reason, why the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Earth more than to the Moon, but
only Nature that is the</hi> principi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
motûs &amp; quietis, <hi>or rather
the God of Nature, whose stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and statuminated Law Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is, has so odered it, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it so in the best way for the
use, beauty and accommodation
of the Vniverse:</hi> Wherein he
does plainly declare that the laws
of Nature are not <hi>mechanical,</hi>
which if they be not, they must
be <hi>vital,</hi> and if they be <hi>vital</hi>
Laws, what is the immediate
Fountain next to God, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in which this life is, or this
<hi>principium motûs &amp; quietis?</hi> Is
it a <hi>substance</hi> distinct from <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
or is it an <hi>essential power</hi> or
<hi>modification</hi> of matter it self?
For every thing is either <hi>substance</hi>
or <hi>modification</hi> of substance. If
these Laws of Nature be an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
power, or modification of
matter, matter is self-moving,
and is also herself-orderer, even
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53653:97"/>
to the expression of all those cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
footsteps of the Divine
Wisdom in the Creation, which
is most apertly against <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
whom our Learned Authour has
no mean respect for, and who
expresly gives only <hi>passivity</hi> to
matter, but derives <hi>activity</hi> from
another Principle. This is his
frequent doctrine. And then
which is still worse, it confounds
the nature of Body and Spirit,
the <hi>motive</hi> and <hi>unitive</hi> power
being immediately and original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Spirit,</hi> but the <hi>moveable</hi>
and <hi>unitable</hi> in matter. But if
these <hi>vital</hi> Laws in Nature that
conduce to the good of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
be not essential to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and act from it, it remains
there is a <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> to
which they are essential, which
is the mover and moderatour of
the matter, which wants no Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licles,
Hooks, or Grappers, to
hold those parts of matter
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53653:98"/>
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that are to be held, or while
they are to be held together, nor
Chissels to loose them, as the
Laws of Nature shall require.
This this Learned Authour seems
to be assured a Spirit is capable
of, by the union of his Soul and
Body; and it is a wonder to me,
being we consist of those two
Principles, that the Genius of the
Age is so generally such, that
they take all their measures of
Philosophizing from their corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
part, none from their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
as if they had forgot they
had any such, or were utterly
unacquainted with its faculties,
or as if their entire personal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages
were nothing else but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
modified mass of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizing
matter: But that mere
matter should so peremptorily
hold together without those <hi>Ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi

would be to me a greater won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
than that <hi>they</hi> should with

10. how that a Rundle of wood,
lighter than water, laid upon the
hole of the bottom of a Vessel
to be filled with water, that the
pillar of water on that wood will
keep down the Rundle, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
will gravitate to the full
weight of such a dimension of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53653:100"/>
water, when-as, if that hole be
not under the Rundle, it of it
self will come up. I say, this were
a great Paradox in Nature, if the
parts of water gravitated on wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that there were such a
monstrous <hi>elasticity</hi> of the Air.
For the recoiling column of Air
bearing against the Rundle
through the hole, of such a diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as that such a column would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
in some other cases some
hundred pounds weight, this
should make the Rundle arise
with far greater ease, than when
the bottom of the Vessel is whole
and is not perforated; therefore
it is a plain indication that there
is no such constant pressure of
the parts of water on water, nor
any such prodigious <hi>elasticity</hi> of
the Air, but that the motion and
rest of matter is <hi>pro re nata,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the <hi>Hylostatick</hi> spirit
of the world guides it. For
certainly that upper <hi>Elater</hi> of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53653:100"/>
the Air that presses the water on
the Rundle, is less resisted by
far, by the bottom unperforat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which does not heave at the
Rundle to lift it up, than it is
by the column of Air below, that
heaves so strongly as might
match some hundred pound
weights. Which consideration
will be most unexceptionable if
for a Rundle we place a lesser
Vessel with thin sides, with four
small holes made sloopingly
through the sides at the bottom,
as I have above described upon
another Occasion. It will be hard
then to find any evasion if the
inward Vessel ascend not as it
does when the bottom is unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated.</p>

                  <p>THat the divulsion of the
<hi>Magdeburg</hi> Hemispheres,
<hi>p.</hi> 267. is so far much easier side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
than from their Center, I
easily accord to; for in such a
divulsion there is as it were the
power added of a double wedge,
but in pulling directly from their
Centers, it comes nearer to the
case of one attempting to pull a
Billet into two, by taking hold
of this side and that side of the
middle of it, and so to part it
into two, in a parallel separation
of each part. But that they are
held together by any such <hi>Tension</hi>
of Filaments, or the <hi>contraction</hi>
of them, while they adhere to
the concave of the Hemispheres,
seems not to me at all credible.
For though the Learned Authour
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53653:101"/>
argues indeed shroudly against
the <hi>elasticity</hi> of the Air being the
cause of their adhesion, because,
if the Hemispheres after they
have grown cold adhere so close
together, that the weight of 30
pound will not sever them, (by
reason of the <hi>elasticity</hi> of the
Air or weight of the Atmosphere
pressing them together,) yet
though they were put again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a considerable heat, they
would adhere as strongly still,
the <hi>elatery</hi> of the Air being not
at all diminished, but rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by warmth, it exciting
the spring thereof to a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
expansion, which therefore
must press the harder against the
Hemispheres; but that it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
that if they be but made
blood-warm they will easily fall
asunder, which I confess is no
contemptible argument against
the <hi>elasticity</hi> of the Air's being
the cause of this so strong cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:53653:102"/>
Yet it is in my opinion one
argument amongst others, that
it is not the <hi>contraction</hi> or <hi>resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
of the <hi>tensed</hi> matter in the
Hemispheres, that is the cause
thereof. For if it were upon so
strong a <hi>stretch</hi> and <hi>contraction,</hi>
as he ordinarily expresses by the
stretch of a Lute-string, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
that so small a moment
of heat should so suddenly and
hugely relaxate it, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mispheres
should as it were fall
asunder of themselves, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
stuck so strongly together
that they bore 30 pound weight,
which Relaxation neither can be
without penetration of Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which immensly heightens
the incredibility of it, that so
small a force should cause penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Dimensions, as I have also
observed<note place="margin">Remark 1. part 7, and 8. Remark 33.</note> before in the <hi>Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
experiment, besides all other
repugnancies that recurr here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
And therefore as the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53653:102"/>
Learned Authour would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from the remotion of the
<hi>elasticity</hi> of the Air, there none
other appearing, that his <hi>Tension</hi>
and <hi>Restitution</hi> must take place;
so I by like reason, by the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>elasticity</hi> of the Air
and his <hi>Tension &amp; Restitution,</hi> may
infer that my <hi>Hylostatick Spirit</hi>
of the world ought to take place,
which acts <hi>pro re nata</hi> upon the
matter, constringes and relaxes
as occasion is. And here I say,
upon cooling of the Hemispheres,
here is a <hi>gravitation</hi> of the Air
<hi>inwards,</hi> toward the common
Center of the Hemispheres, by
reason of the subtilty of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there contained in an undue
place, and the sides of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mispheres
are kned together, as
a man may sometimes feel his
Ribs to be in some subtil cold Air,
and we feel this contraction not
from within, but rather from
without or in our very Ribs. I
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53653:103"/>
say therefore there is an <hi>occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
Gravitation of the ambient Air
and Hemispheres themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>rarefied</hi> Air or subtil
matter within them, to squeeze
it out, as there is of water against
a Bottle of Air let into the Sea,
which sometime this very pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
breaks: Which cannot be
expected in these brass Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheres;
but this compression be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not <hi>mechanical</hi> but <hi>vital,</hi> a
little hint changes the operation,
as in the board that ascends in a
Bucket, if there be a hole in the
bottom of the Bucket it will not
ascend, but if there be a false
bottom below that, at a due
nearness, it will, and the <hi>obtura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi>
of the Valve in the Tube
that will adhere to the Valve, if
the Tube be open into the Air,
yet do but stop it with your <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus</hi>

But after this, be the <hi>Embolus</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

the reason of no more water

apparent there is no need of any

being subtil matter to supply its

that the water is not suspended

to ascend to such an height by

either upon an actual

goes up till such an height or

the bottom of the Pump

so much crowded by reason of

whereof is according to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
of the Elements that thus

emerge a reason why in this case
not one drop of water comes,
upon the elevation of the <hi>Embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
namely because the <hi>Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the rarefied Air in the
Cavity of the Glass, added to
the restagnant water above the
Orifice of the Pipe, by reason of
the tenuity of the one, and small

weak to raise or sustain a pillar
of water in the Pipe, that would
reach up into the Pump, and so no

<hi>Hylostatick Spirit</hi> of the world)
of the getting the water out of
the Pump, it being part of that
material circle in motion, caused
by that Principle that guides the

                  <head>REMARK the Forty seventh.</head>
                  <p>The two arguments against
the <hi>elasticity</hi> of the Air, which
the Learned Authour concludes
with, are, if they be well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
very considerable. The first
is, that if the <hi>elasticity</hi> of the
Air in a low roof'd Room, or a
Glass Receiver, is able to sustain
the Mercury in the Tube at the
same height in the <hi>Torricellian</hi>
experiment, that it is sustained
in the free Air where there is the
weight of the <hi>Atmospherical Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder</hi>
superadded to the said
<hi>elasticity</hi> of the Air, it is a sign
that they are both but a mere
conceit, and that the Mercury is
suspended by the pressure of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I must confess I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
how those <hi>elastick</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
can evade the evidence of
this argument, unless they hope
to escape by saying, That the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53653:110"/>
                     <hi>elasticity</hi> of the Air being
brought to its highest vigour or
force the Atmospherical pressure
can give it, so it be but kept at the
same springiness and tightness by
the Glass or the roof of the
Room, the <hi>elasticity</hi> being the
same still, the effect will be the
same. This a man might phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
at first sight, but if he more
distinctly consider the matter, it
will not satisfie: For let the force
<hi>elastick</hi> of the Air in the Glass or
Room caused by the pressure
first of the Atmosphere be as 10,
and this conserved entire in the
Glass or Room which does not
press against this <hi>elastick</hi> Air, but
stands immoved, nor would the
Atmosphere, if it were incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on this Air, add any thing
more to the <hi>elasticity</hi> thereof,
but it will still remain as 10, yet
though it add nothing to the <hi>ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticity</hi>
of the Air, seeing it has a
pressure and protrusive force in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53653:110"/>
it, which the Roof and Glass
have not, it will notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
have its distinct force super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added
to that 10 of the interja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>elastick</hi> Air, through which
it will effectually act for the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
raising or suspending of the
Quick-silver, and consequently
will suspend at an higher pitch
than the Air in a Room or Glass
can do, there being a small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Valve that would let
out the Air, but hinder any from
coming in. There is a nicety in
this business, but I doubt not
but the truth will be found on
our Learned Authour's side, and
the urgency forward or progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
<hi>conatus</hi> of the <hi>elastick</hi> Air,
will add something to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>And besides, as an Appendage
to this Argument, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
portions of this <hi>elastick</hi>
Air without regard to the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere,
the least proportion of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53653:111"/>
it will have equal effect with
the greatest, and a Cylinder of
<hi>elastick</hi> Air reaching from the
roof of the Room to the restag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
quick-silver, shall have no
more force for the sustaining of
the Mercury in the Tube, than
one of but the tenth part of
an inch high, which is again a
sign there is no such <hi>elasticity</hi> at
all. For no man will say that the
smallest charge of Gunpowder
will, when it is fired, explode
the Bullet with equal force, that
a due quantity of Powder will;
for all its <hi>elasticity</hi> or expansive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is more quick and smart than
this of the Air. Or that, if but a
quarter of an inch of Air, or less,
were condensated to that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that a due measure of air in
a Wind-Gun uses to be, that it
will discharge with that force
that the other does, and yet both
their motions here are by <hi>elasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi>
properly so called. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53653:111"/>
there being these differences
where <hi>elasticity</hi> is really, but
none in the pretended <hi>elasticity</hi>
of the Air, it is a sign it is a mere
pretense and no true <hi>Phaenomenon</hi>
in Nature.</p>
                  <p>And now for the Authour's
other Argument which he raised
out of his Pump, which is this;
If there were any such <hi>elasticity</hi>
of the Air, suppose in a close
Room or Glass that could keep
up a Cylinder of Mercury, (I add,
and raise it too, if a Tube of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria
subtilis</hi> only, could be let
down into it) to 29 inches high,
which yet according to the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude
of its Diameter may
weigh two, four, or ten pound,
it were impossible but that the
<hi>elatery</hi> of the air in his Pump (it
being open at K and B, so that
the Air may come in at B, and
either Air or Water go out at K)
should drive a portion of water
into the Pipe of but half an inch
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53653:112"/>
diameter, so that it may rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the surface of the restag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
water in the Glass-bottle,
suppose an inch or half an inch
high, which is nothing in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to the raising of 10 pound
weight. Which we shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
still more clearly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly,
if we will suppose the
Pipe of this Pump of such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter
that 29 or 30 inches of
Mercury in it would weigh 10
pound, and a Glass-bottle of a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
18 times larger than that of
the Pipe, which is the proportion
that this Glass-bottle does really
bear to this Pipe in the Pump:
Then imagine this Glass-bottle so
well replenish'd with Quick-silver,
that the restagnant Quick-silver
will reach somewhat above the
middle of the Glass, the Pipe in
the mean time filled 29 or 30
inches full of it, it will stand at
thereabout, though it be 10 pound
weight; nay I dare appeal to any
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53653:112"/>
considered Philosopher if there
were a Glass-Tube of 4 foot, or
longer, of mere <hi>materia subtilis</hi>
immitted into this Glass-bottle of
Mercury, sufficiently replenisht
therewith, if he can otherwise
think but that the Mercury will
rise up to about 29 or 30 inches
high. But for the sustaining of
it, it is acknowledged of every
side, that 10 pound weight of
Mercury 29 inches high, is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sustained,
whatever it be that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
it. The <hi>elastick</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
say, it is the <hi>elatery</hi> of the
Air in the Glass-bottle, which
bears so strongly against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stagnant
Mercury, that the 29
inches of Mercury, that weigh
10 pound weight, cannot descend
into the restagnant Mercury. But
our Learned Authour here most
rationally denies it, averring, that
if there were so strong an <hi>elatery</hi>
of the Air as to drive up or bear
up 10 pound weight of Mercury,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53653:113"/>
which is here 29 inches in the
Pipe or Tube; certainly the same
<hi>elasticity</hi> would drive or bear up
one inch of water into the Pipe
or Tube, it being many hundred
times lighter than those 29 inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of Mercury. But here the <hi>ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi>
Philosophers seek a witty
refuge, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistence
of the <hi>materia subtilis</hi>
that is destitute of all <hi>elasticity,</hi>
which is the reason of the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the <hi>elatery</hi> of the Air to
mount up or sustain so great
weight of Quick-silver, but there
being Air in the Pipe of like <hi>ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticity</hi>
with that in the Glass-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in this other case, that it is
that that stops all such motion of
the water upward. But this is
to indulge to pretty phancies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
palpable sense and all true
reason. It is already acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by these <hi>elastick</hi> Philosophers,
that there is an <hi>elatery</hi> of the Air
in the Glass, that will at least su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53653:113"/>
if not raise up a ten pound
weight. Now if there be not an
<hi>elatery</hi> in the air of the Pipe so
strong as might resist such a force,
but exceedingly far weaker, if
any at all, the water must rise
or stand an inch high at least, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is done. But now
you may feel with your fingers
end how exceeding weak the <hi>ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
of just such a Cylinder of Air
is, as is in the Pipe, if you make
a Tube of the same diameter with
that Pipe, and make an <hi>Embolus</hi>
of some wood equiponderant, or
at least not lighter than water,
and so fit it to the Pipe that it
may slip up and down with all
ease imaginable, which it may do
and be close enough if it be oiled.
And this easie slipping up and
down of it, might be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
how weak the <hi>elatery</hi> of
the Air is in it, but that they will
straight answer that you move the
<hi>Emboblus</hi> so easily upward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53653:114"/>
the recoiling <hi>elatery</hi> helps
you; but does not the direct as
much hinder me? But put your
<hi>Embolus</hi> in the water, whose
surface I suppose the upper end
of the <hi>Embolus</hi> will lie even with,
then put the Tube on the <hi>Embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
and putting your hand into
the water, with your finger move
up the <hi>Embolus,</hi> which you shall
find to move against the <hi>elatery</hi>
of the air in the Tube, if there be
any, with extreme ease; you will
discern that the force of 1/4 of a
pound weight at most, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the air with its <hi>elatery.</hi>
How then can it resist the force
that will draw up or sustain forty
times as much? Wherefore it is
plain upon supposition that the
<hi>elasticity</hi> of the Air is so strong
that it will raise or sustain ten
pound weight, that it will so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
press the water in the Glass-bottle
into the Pipe, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the straitness thereof in
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53653:114"/>
comparison of that part of the
Glass, that contains the water, it
will send it packing through that
Pipe as Air sent out through the
nozel of a pair of Bellows, by
him that presseth the Bellows
with his hands. All the air of the
Bellows is pressed at once, and the
motion of that in the Bellows
being much slower, that in the
nozel comes out quick and smart,
and so would the water through
the Pipe be driven with a swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
force by reason of its straitness,
and new air coming in at the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
B, it would never leave run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
out at K, till the water were
exhausted as low as E, which we
seeing not done, we see hereby,
that there is no such <hi>elasticity</hi> in
the Air at all, as our <hi>Elastick</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
suppose.</p>
                  <p>We will obviate the vanity of
but one evasion more and then
conclude. The pretense of the
recoiling <hi>elatery</hi> of the Air we
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53653:115"/>
took away by placing the little
Tube and <hi>Embolus</hi> of wood in
the water. Here perhaps they
will say, that the Elatery of the
Air on the surface of the water,
causes the <hi>Embolus</hi> so easily to be
pressed against the elatery of the
Air that is incumbent on it. But
how can that be, whenas the
water has no elatery to lift up
my hand, or bear against the
bottom of the <hi>Embolus,</hi> and the
water only succeeds the pressure
of my finger against the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus,</hi>
does not press with it, if
we can believe our senses? so
that there is merely a circule of
such strength as the pressure of
my finger makes and no more.
And besides this, if this be any
such advantage, the same is found
in this Learned Authours Pump,
the air coming in at B to make a
circle of pressure by its elasticity
to E and so to A and out at K, till
it come to B again, and yet there
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53653:115"/>
is not one inch of water raised by
this elasticity above the surface I,
though this elasticity is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to sustain 29 inches of Quick-silver
of 10 pound weight. And
that this mistake may still be laid
more open, and no creep-holes
lest for further evasion, from the
Valves or littleness of the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
at K and B, let us turn this
round Glass into a large open
Vessel, that the pressure of the
air may come as free as heart can
wish, and let into it a Tube, 29
inches whereof would contain 10
pound of Mercury, and which
being immersed in Mercury, so
many inches of Mercury would
be suspended in: put upon such
an <hi>Embolus</hi> as was above descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
(whose upper Basis lies equal
with the water) this empty Tube,
and then put in your hand into
the water, and believe your sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
with what ease that <hi>Embolus</hi>
is to be pressed up against the ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53653:116"/>
of the air in the Tube, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
as I said before, scarce the
force of a ¼ of a pound weight.
Can therefore the <hi>elatery</hi> of the
air sustain 40 times that weight,
and keep the Mercury about 30
inches high in the same Tube, and
not raise water into the Tube one
inch high, which is above 400
times lighter than the 30 inches
of Mercury it is pretended to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain,
whenas the <hi>elatery</hi> of air in
the Tube is deprehended not to
make the fortieth part of resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
against the <hi>elatery</hi> of air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on the restagnant water,
which is pretended to press forty
times stronger? Wherefore the <hi>ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
of the air being so certainly
deprehended not to do that which
is forty times easier for it to do, it
is impossible that it should do that
which is forty times harder, and
is a manifest demonstration there
is no such <hi>elatery</hi> at all.</p>

               <head>Conclusion.</head>
               <p>But now to bring all home at
length to the intended scope,
and to recount the chief fruits of
our labour in making these <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi>
on the Learned Authours
two Treatises. If I be not out in
my account, I conceive in my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi>
on the first Treatise (to say
nothing of several in the second)
I have clearly demonstrated the
invalidity of all this Authour's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
though otherwise inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
whether <hi>mechanical</hi> or <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi>
(and yet such as would
exclude the <hi>Spirit of Nature)</hi>
whereby he might seem to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the strength of my Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
from the <hi>rising of the
wooden Rundle in a Bucket of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Enchirid. Metaphys. c. 13. sect.</hi>
4. Which demonstration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remains unshaken in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the <hi>Principium Hylarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>
or <hi>Hylostatick Spirit of the Universe.</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:53653:117"/>
And as for that other
like notable demonstration, from
the <hi>ascending of so great a weight
hung at the Embolus of the Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pump,</hi>
the chief undermining of
the force thereof being by either
the <hi>Elatery</hi> of the <hi>Elastick</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
or this Authour's <hi>Tension,</hi>
the former this Learned Authour
himself has so abundantly confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with such plain and solid ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
that any discerning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
may easily discover the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness
of that cause. And now
for that other, I think I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
abundant reasons for the
incredibility', or rather impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
thereof<note n="*" place="margin">See Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark 1. 29. 32, 33.</note> Wherefore
the conceit of the <hi>elasticity</hi> of
the Air, and of <hi>Funiculus Lini,</hi>
or <hi>Tension</hi> in general being thus
utterly defeated, it is manifest,
the force of my Demonstration,
<hi>Enchirid. Metaphys. cap. 12. sect.</hi>
2, 3, 4, &amp;c. from the <hi>weight at
the Embolus of the Air-pump,</hi> for the
<hi>Hylarchick Spirit</hi> of the world
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53653:117"/>
holds strong and entire still. And
therefore I account, in a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
compute, that the fruits of
my labour in making these <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi>
are these. First, This Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Authour I hope is freed from
that anxiety &amp; solicitude touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, and is by this time satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that I have not incurred the
guilt of that rashness and heedles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as to make choice of <hi>small</hi>
and <hi>feeble</hi> Arguments to sustain
<hi>great</hi> and <hi>concerning</hi> Truths. For
it is very judiciously said of him,
and I am wholly of his mind, <hi>That
the most important and surest
Truths in the world never receive
so much detriment by Arguments
and Sophistry of Opponents, as they
do by those Arguments in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
which have improper medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums
to support their conclusions, or
such as are capable of other solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
which I am very confident
mine will never be found capable
of. And I think from these <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi>
this Learned Authour by
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53653:118"/>
this time may be sensible, is no
rashly grounded confidence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is the redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of no small commendation to
this Authour for his industry and
dexterity, and special sagacity in
making and improving <hi>Hydrosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Experiments,</hi> that are so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
succours to such useful
Truth. For he has very stoutly and
pertinently assisted me in a more
full defeating of that which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
appeared to me an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Paradox, I mean that prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>elastick</hi> pressure of the Air,
and therefore I impute it to the
modesty of this writer, that he has
entitled his second Book <hi>Diffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
Nugae.</hi> For though there may
be some <hi>difficulty</hi> and <hi>curiosity</hi> in
making and examining such like
<hi>Hydrostatical</hi> experiments, yet
believe me there is no <hi>Nugality</hi> at
all, unless to those that make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
for experiments sake,
or to pass away the time, or to be
thought great <hi>natural</hi> or rather
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53653:118"/>
                  <hi>mechanical</hi> Philosophers, and that
in hope to shew, that all the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
of Nature may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
without the present assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or guidance of any <hi>imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Principle.</hi> But to try and
consider these Experiments and
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> with that carefulness
and distinctness, and penetrancy of
discernment, as to discover there
must of necessity be some <hi>imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
mover</hi> underneath, there is
no <hi>nugacity</hi> at all in this, but
sound and serious <hi>Philosophy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly therefore, This is no
small fruit of this Authour's two
<hi>Treatises,</hi> and of my labour in
making my <hi>Remarks</hi> on them, that
it does more plainly and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear, that there is nothing of
real strength can be said against
my <hi>Demonstrations</hi> for the <hi>Spirit
of Nature,</hi> but that of necessity
there is such a Being in the world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And that therefore it
being so plain that there is this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
immaterial Being endued
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53653:119"/>
only with <hi>life,</hi> or some more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
<hi>sensation,</hi> and that has the
<hi>general</hi> strokes of the <hi>Laws of the
Universe,</hi> but cannot act by <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and <hi>counsel pro re nata,</hi> it is
manifest that there is a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and <hi>divine Being</hi> in the world
that gave this inferiour <hi>immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Being</hi> its existence, and allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to it in measure, or limited
out to it those <hi>general</hi> Laws of
<hi>vital Activity,</hi> which we discover
in it in the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature.
Beside, that this certainty of the
existence of the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi>
demolisheth the strongest Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
that ordinarily the Atheist
has, namely his confidence that
there is no such thing as a <hi>Spirit</hi>
or Immaterial Being in the world.
Whence he securely hugs himself
in that fond and foul Conclusion,
<hi>That there is no God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Whenas many men are
driven quite out of all conceit of
ever understanding the nature of
their own <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Soul,</hi> by that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53653:119"/>
sophistry put upon them, that if it is
a <hi>Spirit</hi> or Immaterial Being, it would
pass through the body, but could not
take hold of it or unite with it to
move it; the discovery of the <hi>Spirit
of Nature,</hi> moving as well as penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all the matter of the world, will
as solidly and palpably confute the
<hi>Sophism,</hi> as he did that against moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by walking before the face of the
Sophister that would prove there was
none in the world.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Whenas this <hi>Spirit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
moves all the tenuious matter,
and fluid as well as solid in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
we easilier discern how rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
it is, that <hi>particular Spirits, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
suppose, or <hi>Daemons,</hi> may have a
faculty of moving their tenuious <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles,</hi>
and the <hi>souls</hi> of men the <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
spirits</hi> in the body.</p>
               <p>Seventhly &amp; lastly, Whenas others
according to the thickness of their
conceptions cannot believe they have
any soul at all, but take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they have none, what a rousing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
ought this to be to them, to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53653:120"/>
awake them out of this <hi>dull dream,</hi>
to consider that a stone does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to the earth, but by the virtue
of a <hi>Spirit</hi> that moves it downwards,
nor a wooden Rundle ascend up in a
Bucket of water, but by the same
means? How then can it be possible,
but that we being conscious to our
selves of more <hi>free</hi> and <hi>spontaneous</hi>
motions, of motions contrary to the
tuggings of the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> of
motions <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>divine,</hi> that
these can be performed by mere mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and body, and not by a particular
Spirit really distinct therefrom?
Wherefore there being that unexce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptionable
<hi>evidence</hi> for the <hi>existence</hi>
of the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious
<hi>usefulness</hi> of the knowledge
thereof, I shall conclude for this anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Platonick</hi> or rather <hi>Pythagorick.</hi>
Opinion in this <hi>Lucretian</hi> strain of
confidence.
