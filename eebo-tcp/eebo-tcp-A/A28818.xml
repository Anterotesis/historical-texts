         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Renatus Deſcartes.</head>
            <p>THat there are certain Wits,
whom Nature (like her
moſt conſpicuous Luminaries)
only expoſeth to view, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
withdraws them from

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51512:6"/>
envy, for which I want a name,
ſuddenly ſnatcheth away with
one hand, what ſhe liberally
contributed with the other, is
a thing notorious to all men.
Yet ſuch Wits are rarely produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by her in the compaſs of an
Age. Wherefore the Great <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
being one of that number,
it ſeems to me a piece of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and ingratitude, that the
Life of ſo famous a Perſon
ſhould never as yet be printed
or publiſhed in any place
whatſoever. And although, my
ſtilebe too unpoliſht for ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime

to make an Eſſay in this
weighty matter, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51512:6"/>
to give you a Compendium,
the proportion of the foot of
that Lion, as a fore-runner of a
more full deſcription of his Life,
hoping it may be acceptable;
to the end, that ſo great a Light
might not be in a manner hid

            <p>This renowned Perſon began
to draw his firſt Breath in the
year 1596, between the <hi>Britains</hi>
and <hi>Poictevins,</hi> in the City cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Caſtrum Eraldum,</hi> born of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51512:7"/>
a moſt Noble Father, Senator of
his Countrey, whoſe Family was
illuſtrious for their antient No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and was the only Son of
his ſecond Wife; he was a man
of no mean eſtate, ſince he had
between ſix and ſeven thouſand
pounds a year.</p>
            <p>He himſelf hath given you a
Relation of his firſt courſe of
Life, in the third Page of his
Treatiſe <hi>de Methodo,</hi> as <hi>Clauber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
Profeſſor at <hi>Teutoburg</hi> upon
the <hi>Rhine</hi> hath obſerv'd; who
affirms that <hi>Deſcartes</hi> made eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that was knowable, the
Subject of his ſtudy, being in one
of the beſt Colledges, imagining
that he ſhould find out the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51512:8"/>
Truth among thoſe that were
Learned; but being fruſtrated
of his expectation, nine years
were elapſed, before he could
diſcover what Courſe he was to
ſteer.</p>
            <p>He was thin fac'd, of
a pleaſant countenance, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeldome, but excellently;
healthful, ſober, concealing his
own parts, a hater of Diſputes,
but by proving the truth, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
error, a moſt bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to oſtentation; preferring
Reaſon before authority, though
he made uſe of it: he delighted
to diſcourſe with Women; he
often deſired the renown of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſons, as he himſelf te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51512:8"/>
for he was no Boaſter;
nay, he was ſo modeſt, that he
had not the confidence to aſſert
what he underſtood.</p>
            <p>He was educated and taught
in the Schools of <hi>Flexia,</hi> and
had run through the whole
courſe or race of his Study at
ſeventeen years of Age.</p>
            <p>His Portraicture is carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
in all places, and in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Paris</hi> to be had in
Copper: and becauſe he was
good both at the Pen and the
Pike, he loved the valiant as well
as the prudent and Learned, and
ſo by a happy conjunction of
Arms and Arts, in his younger
years he made it his buſineſs to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51512:9"/>
underſtand Military Diſcipline
among the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the beſt
Nurſery for Souldiers; and as
a Voluntary underwent all the
dangers of War without any
Pay, for the ſpace of three years,
he only received one <hi>Duplio,</hi> a
piece of Money ſo called which
he always kept as the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Warfare; he alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
publick command, becauſe
he had a deſire to perform the
duty of a private Souldier, that
he might be the better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with that Art, and the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs
thereof; and was twice
preſent at the Siege of <hi>Breda,</hi>
and in the Battel of <hi>Prague,</hi>
from whence he viſited <hi>Italy,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51512:9"/>
firſt taken a view of the
large Engines of <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi>
and diſcours'd with his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Italy</hi> he met with <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileus</hi>
and other eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and thence he came to the
Siege of <hi>Capha</hi> or <hi>Gava</hi> near <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi>
and at length return'd to
<hi>France,</hi> and was preſent at the
Siege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and in other
Military Expeditions; nay, he
went voluntarily to that Siege.
He performed a memorable
thing before Cardinal <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi>
the Popes Nuncio,
then Cardinal <hi>Berullius</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
renowned and ingenious
men, who aſſembled together to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51512:10"/>
hear Monſieur <hi>Chandou</hi> Diſpute
of the new Principles of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy:
and when he had gain'd
the applauſe of them all for his
Speech, <hi>Deſcartes</hi> only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they ask'd his opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Arguments, who
commended the Authors
Speech, but not the Company,
becauſe they were only ſatisfied
with a bare probabilty, and did
ingage to prove any probable
Truth, falſe, by twelve ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and ſo on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
which when he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
they were ſtruck with
admiration and aſtoniſhment;
therefore they inquired of him,
whether there was any way to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51512:10"/>
avoid Sophiſms; and he aſſur'd
them that the Truth might be
Mathematically demonſtrated
in all things according to his
Principles: then they intreated
him that he would publiſh
them; which requeſt he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
to condeſcend unto, and
betook himſelf to <hi>Holland,</hi> that
he might the better prepare his
conceptions for the Preſs.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he would needs
take a journey into <hi>Denmark,</hi>
where <hi>Stephen Breſſiaeus</hi> our
Countrey-man, a moſt skilful
Phyſician and Chymiſt, &amp; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

of Learning) accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51512:11"/>
him; but he was detain'd
by the Emperors Forces in the
County of <hi>Embden;</hi> then he
endeavor'd to ſee <hi>Tyrol</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
and deſigned from thence
to go to the Siege of <hi>Caſal,</hi> which
laſted above two years after all,
which are ſufficient teſtimonies,
that he underſtood the Intrigues
of Government.</p>
            <p>But he return'd again to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi>
being accompanied
with our friend <hi>Breſſiaeus,</hi> that
he might be preſent at the Kings
return. He was in <hi>Holland</hi> in
the year 1648, and thence cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the King to <hi>Paris,</hi> upon
very honorable terms.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he continued at <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:51512:11"/>
he ſo diſpoſed of his annual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,
that he might receive
them by the hands of a friend
where he pleas'd. Therefore he
went to <hi>Holland,</hi> where, in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart,
he compos'd his ſo much
applauded Works, of which we
will give you a Catalogue.</p>
            <p>He had alſo before viſited
<hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Huugary,</hi> whilſt
he was in purſuit of the Truth;
where he was preſent at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
Coronation.</p>
            <p>When he could not fine out
that Democritical Truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, which lies hid, as it
were in a bottom; he fell upon
the Contemplation of the Book
of the World, and of himſelf,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51512:12"/>
and ſtudied Anatomy, Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> from whence he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
admirable things; he
was ſlenderly ſtor'd with Books,
becauſe he underſtood they
were not true, the Mathematical
only excepted; wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asked by a friend, whether
he had a Library, and deſired
to ſhew it; lifting up the cloath,
he diſcovered to him a Calf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected;
Behold, ſaith he, my
Library! O noble expreſſion!
ſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> found <hi>Democritus</hi>
heretofore ſtudying among A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
diſſected: he was not
tempted with the deſire of gain,
honor, or worldly Dignities, but
he did Philoſophize, out of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51512:12"/>
love he had to vertue, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to make inquiſition after the
Truth. In this he did imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Antients, which was the
reaſon that he, according to
their Cuſtom, ſpent ſome years
in Travel, and viſit in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
Cities and Courts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
His chiefeſt deſign was to
diſcover the equability of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a virtuous mind, and
the neceſſity of a Method; whilſt
he followed the War, in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he employed his vacant hours
in Philoſophical Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and being deſirous to
unlock the <hi>Arcana</hi> of the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
and Philoſophy with
the ſame Key, he did ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51512:13"/>
conjoyn Nature and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
that he obtained his end.</p>
            <p>Yet he run through all
the Arts and Languages, and in
a ſhort time turn'd over all
ſorts of Books, being in queſt
of the Truth, he perus'd
thoſe that were ſuperſtitious
and falſe, that he might leave
nothing unſaluted.</p>
            <p>He was ſo excellent in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
that according to that
conſtant deſire which he ever had
of reſtoring Philoſophy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
his own knowledge, he
did invent an abſolute new Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
and invented the true
Principles, and moſt emnent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
thereof, inſomuch that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51512:13"/>
his works were printed in all
parts, &amp; publikely profeſs'd by
many famous men, and taught
as now at <hi>Paris,</hi> where there are
ſeveral private Academies, in
which his Philoſophy is only
read.</p>
            <p>When he found that there
was nothing worth his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
among men, he made
choice of a deſert (as <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and other true Philoſophers
did) at <hi>Egmond</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and
there led a ſolitary life for the
ſpace of five and twenty years,
and diſcovered many admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things by his contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>He was ſo eminent in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51512:14"/>
Mathematicks, that he did
things beyond apprehenſion,
eſpecially about Proſpectives;
and to the end that he might
prove his experiments, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Proſpectives of a large
ſize, either of ice or artificial
black poliſht marble made hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
according to his deſire,
and the various forms he
phancyed by the aſsiſtance of
<hi>Breſsiaeus,</hi> a moſt ingenious
man; and when he had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht
his deſign, he brake them
in pieces, and made new ones
of the ſame matter.</p>
            <p>And before the ſame <hi>Breſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aeus,</hi>
by a hidden ſecret in the
Opticks he would ſhew him a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51512:14"/>
company of souldiers march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his chamber, which he
did much admire; but this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the ſmal figures of
Souldiers which he conceal'd,
and brought forth multiplied
without doors. He believ'd
the Heaven was fluid, as in truth
it is, for the air alone is the
Heaven, nor differs it from
ours, therefore it is confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Hiſtory of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He did acknowledge <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi>
his Atoms to be the
Principles of all things, as he
moſt excellently proved.</p>
            <p>He had many, nay an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable,
number of friends;
among whom were Cardinal
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51512:15"/>
               <hi>Barbarini,</hi> and <hi>Berullius; Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>

<hi>Deſargnes,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Holleng,</hi>
Monſieur <hi>de Faber</hi> Governor
of <hi>Sedam, Gaſſendus Balſaack,</hi>
for whom <hi>Breſsiolus</hi> did no ill
office againſt Father <hi>Goulu</hi> his
Enemy at Cardinal <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>'s;
yet he had ſome that did
hate and envy him; for envy
alwayes aimes at high things;
but he confuted their writings
excellently. His chiefeſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were the Fathers of the
Chriſtian Chruch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrianus Lentulus,</hi> Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
of <hi>Hereborn,</hi> injuriouſly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51512:15"/>
objected to him, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
himſelf to God, ſaying
at the end of his notes, humane
things are not to come in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with thoſe that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;
he farther ſaith, that he
doubted all things; which is
a miſtake, but heretofore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
like the reſt of vulgar
Philoſophers, he was ſceptical,
before he had reform'd Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.
he calls him alſo a
Perſon of ſmall eſteem; but
the Learned <hi>Clanbery</hi> replies
excellently, you call him a man
of mean repute, whom prudent
men ſtile Natures Darling, and
one that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> would tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call Philoſopher. <hi>Revius</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51512:16"/>
of <hi>Weſtfrizeland</hi> in
<hi>Holland</hi> was ſo bold as to call
him Magician and Atheiſt; and
ſo formerly all men of great
Learning were accus'd of being
Magicians, becauſe they did
things beyond the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on of Scioliſts; as <hi>Gabriel Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſus,</hi>
in his Apologie for thoſe
men that were accus'd for dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with Magick, ſtrongly
proves.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo many were the plots
contriv'd by his Antagoniſts
<hi>Peripatetick</hi> Profeſſors, (whoſe
weak ſight could not endure
the rays of ſo great a Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
becauſe like the Sun he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcur'd
their ſmaller lights,) that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51512:16"/>
they ſtirring up their Pupils
and the whole City to a muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
durſt baniſh him from the
City of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>treck</hi> by the ſound of
a Bell, whom Kings &amp; Queens
that were remote did in vit,
and cheriſhed in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
            <p>The integrity of his life
purg'd him from all calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
yet he on the contrary
was no Detractor, nor injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to any perſon. For he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
committed injuries to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
but to oblivion, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at the wonderful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God by contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on the Creatures. It were as
hard a taske to reckon his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51512:17"/>
&amp; admirers, as to count
the ſtars, or number the ſand.</p>
            <p>The Learned <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> alſo,
and <hi>Koberval</hi> his worthy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,
writ ſome things againſt
him; but this was done rather
out of an earneſt deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after the truth, then out
of any hatred; <hi>Marinus Merſenus</hi>
being an affector of curioſity,
promoting and ſtirring them
upto it, that he might oblige
men of ſuch great parts to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of many rare things, to
ſatisfie his own curioſity.</p>
            <p>In fine, this Learned and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
man was call'd from his
retirement by <hi>Chriſtina</hi> the
<hi>quondam</hi> Queen of <hi>Swedeland,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:51512:17"/>
and infinitely belov'd by her,
inſomuch that ſhe would hear
him almoſt conſtantly arguing,
which much prejudiced his
health; for he being alwayes
bare, and diſcourſing with her,
the major part of the night, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
thoſe ſubjects ſhe moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
by that means he had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
reſt, and fell into a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
which he neglected, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it an uſual diſeaſe, and that
he might ſoon be freed from it;
but when ſhortly after he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
it was another kind of
malady, and underſtood it was
an inflammation of the Lungs;
he ordered a vein tobe opened,
which prov'd ineffectual, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51512:18"/>
on the ſeventh day of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
he deceaſed: which proves
theſe known Verſes to be

of what we know not, and that
moſt people are ignorant of
thoſe things they boaſt and
preſume to underſtand, and
that by this means ſuch things
are taught and delivered which
muſt be unlearned; though it
ſeem'd good to him to doubt
of thoſe hitherto received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of Philoſophers; that
doubting he might find out a
plain way to wiſdom both for
himſelf and others; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
the Philoſophy that was
aequaevous to Nature; and ſo
conſequently that which was
as true as ancient; and
brought the ſame out of that
filthy ſervitude wherewith it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51512:35"/>
had been enſlav'd for many
Ages, and as it were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numitted
it; who by his

the Univerſal Nature of

was not ſatisfied with thoſe
things that were ancient, for
their antiquity; nor did
thoſe that were modern diſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
by reaſon of their novelty
for he was ſenſible that what is
now old was once new, and
what is now new will in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of time become old, but
as he found them either true
or falſe; therefore a new and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51512:35"/>

ſet up, which will continue,

Epiſtle of Deſcartes, to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Marinus Merſenus.</head>
            <p>THe reaſon why I am of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that ſome certain
portions of the moſt ſubtile
parts of the blood are convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the ſtomach and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines
through the Arteries to
help digeſtion, is, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I have obſerv'd that the
<hi>ſaliva</hi> or ſpittle, which when we
eat, or have a deſire thereunto,
and have only an imaginative
faculty, comes to the mouth in
ſuch abundance, proceeds not
only from the kernels or Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51512:44"/>
ariſing from the root of
the tongue (or probably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
only to the throat (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be tranſferr'd to the
mouth of the veſſels by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of the tongue) but
from the Arteries ariſing from
the gums: for I have made ſo
clear an experiment hereof,
that beyond all diſpute the
ſame work is performed by
theſe Arteries which are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Inteſtines and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle;
ſince we ſee that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
medicines do draw the
largeſt quantity of humours
from the whole body to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines,
and we know no other
paſſage (in my apprehenſion)
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51512:44"/>
to thoſe humours; for the
veins are obſtructed by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
valves, as may be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented
if both in the meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium
of a live Dog be tied,
the Arteries between the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines
and the Ligature will
ſwell, and no farther; and the
venae lacteae as well as the other
veins do the contrary. But
thoſe Sanguinal parts which
enter into the ſtomach cannot
retain it's reddiſh colour, no
more then the ſaliva (which
helps the digeſtion of food
whileſt maſticated in the
mouth) nor of tears or ſweat
which are by the ſame means
ſeparated from the blood, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51512:45"/>
through the extremities of
the Arteries; for this redneſs
proceeds from its more viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
parts, which I judge are
of irregular forms, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
twigs which mutually
embrace and interſect one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
and this is the reaſon
they cannot poſſibly make their
way through ſuch narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
but only thoſe that are
moſt ſubtile, which I phancy
to reſemble needles that pierce
the narroweſt holes; and the
faculty of their ſegregation is
ſufficiently and experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifeſted in extravaſated
blood; for we ſee that after
Phlebotomy the ſerous matter
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51512:45"/>
of the blood in the Porringer
ſeparates it ſelf, and is clear;
whereas the remainder which
is red or black is congeal'd.
As to the cauſe of Chylificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the veins, I know no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but that which cauſeth the
Inteſtines to lye out of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when wounded with a
ſword, <hi>viz.</hi> the compreſſion of
the cuticles or other particles
which contain them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the more fluid parts of
that Chyle are capable of this
penetration by their own
weight without compreſſion:
like water which paſſeth from
coagulated milk or curds,
through the holes of the veſſel
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51512:46"/>
into which it is put by their
own natural agitation; for I
conceive that every part of any
liquor is in perpetual motion;
and farther, the action of the
muſcles doth very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
hereunto, in regard that
it cauſeth the parts of the
Chyle from that part of the
holes where it finds a paſſage,
to enter into the <hi>venae lacteae</hi> as
well as the other veins; for I
make no difference between
them, but only this, that their
juice is white, becauſe they
are accompanied with none of
the Arteries; but the others
red, becauſe intermixed with
the blood flowing from the Ar-
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51512:46"/>
Nor do I only reckon the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral
muſcles, thoſe of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen</hi>
and <hi>Diaphragm</hi> in the
number of muſcles, but almoſt
all the whole ſubſtance of the
Inteſtines and Ventricle; and
I have made this obſervation in
the diſſection of live Dogs, that
their Inteſtines have a regular
motion, nearly reſembling that
of reſpiration. But this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the muſcles is not ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
neceſſary, as the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſieve is to expel the
duſt, becauſe then the parts of
the Chyle have a voluntary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their own, which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath not. And this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of the ſearſe or ſieve doth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51512:47"/>
pleaſe me extraordinarily, and
ſeems very proper for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of the various ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the blood which are
made in the <hi>Cyſtis fellea,</hi> the
Reins, and other parts of the
body, the Spleen only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for I do not judge that the
melancholique humour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is conveyed thither by the
means of this ſeparation; but
I rather think that the blood
gains this quality in the ſpleen
it ſelf. For ſome Serſes are
made to ſeparate the duſt from
the grain that is round in
ſhape; others, in which Oats
and not Rye are ſifted; others

that thoſe ſmall <hi>ductus</hi> by

And as to that clammy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

is ſometimes found in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine;
that generally flows
from the Reins, or ſuch parts
as are ſubject thereunto; and
if it happen that it proceeds
from the ſuperiour parts, the
reaſon of that may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from hence, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51512:48"/>
from more penetrative
parts then thoſe by which the

a place, which paſſages the

by what means can we imagine
that the blood ſhould be impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

occaſion is, that the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
for the moſt part do not
receive a ſufficient quantity of
air from without, to ſupply the
place of the ſmoak that goes
out of the room; for 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
that the fire, by its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
expells a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of air with thoſe ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of wood, which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing
with the air, cauſeth
the ſmoak, as the groſſer parts
of the wood make aſhes; and
ſince there can be no <hi>vacuum</hi> in
Nature, it neceſſarily follows,
that there muſt be a conſtant
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51512:54"/>
acceſs of freſh air into the
Chamber, and that in as large
a quantity as the ſmoak that
goes out; as may be ſeen in
Chymical furnaces, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
whereof there is a hole
which receives a great part of
the wind wherewith the fire is
kindled, which wind is nothing
elſe but air expell'd from the
place which the ſmoak, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the fire, tends
to: ſo that when a Chamber is
cloſe ſhut, the ſmoak muſt
needs flye about it, that is, that
the ſmoak which is cauſed by
the fire muſt fill the chamber,
becauſe the air of the chamber
tends only towards the fire;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51512:55"/>
and the uſual remedy in ſuch
caſes is, to open the door, or
windoors; but becauſe this is
ſomewhat incommodious, it
may be avoided by making
holes behind the chimney,
which are oppoſite to the fire,
or behind the bed-ſtead.</p>

are ſenſible that I do not at all

               <p>Likewiſe, The reaſon why a

the air, when you move them
