            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, <hi>ROBERT,</hi> Earle of WARWICK: And to the Right Honourable, the Lady <hi>SVS ANNA,</hi> Countesse of WARWICKE; His pious CONSORT.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are two things common to man, whose nature is capable of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: one is an appetite of Honour; the other a mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himselfe about the matter or way of Honour: Ambition stirres up the one, and Ignorance causeth the other; that swels, this poysons the heart of man.
<pb facs="tcp:17924:3"/>
The first Humour did so farre transport some Ancients, that they placed very Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie in Honour, and made strange and unnaturall Adventures for the same. The second, as an Evill, made them to make that to be Honour, which is not; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that to be Honour, which is Honour indeed. It is no Honour, to be wicked; nor yet a way to Honour, with God, or good men: and yet some men doe <hi>glory in their shame,</hi> accounting Besenesse it selfe to be their Honour.</p>
            <p>It is the highest Honour (and indeed, nothing so truly ennobleth) to be truly gracious, and godly; and yet, with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of men, Religion and Godlinesse are thought staines and blemishes of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ignobling Greatnesse it selfe, which they shun, as the greatest shame. The Scriptures make Godlinesse the formall and intrinsecall Cause, and Root of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Nay, it is and was the opinion of the most moderate Philosophers, That Vertue is the proper <hi>Basis</hi> of Honour; and that it doth belong to Vertue, as a Debt; and so much as vertuous, so much
<pb facs="tcp:17924:3"/>
honourable: and though it did not make, yet it did dresse a Morall happinesse. The Honour of being vertuous, is great to all; most, unto Personages whose bloud runnes Noble, and Places are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: the World eyeth such most, and are willing to see, if they will shine; and readie to commend, if they will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. When great ones are but in the common way of honouring God, which is meerely formall, and verball; this is pleasing, and many times winning name and fame unto themselves: But, when they are found upon the speciall way of honouring God, which is radicall, and vitall, the heart being inwardly affected with the love and purpose, and the life full of the courses and discourses of Godlinesse; this makes Nobilitie it selfe glorious, and eminently to shine: And certaine it is, that such shall have from God the Honour of secret Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, speciall Protection, externall Publication, and of eternall Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they being all Heires under Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17924:4"/>This honour, in all eminency, I wish unto your Honours, by how much the more God hath already advanced and enlarged your Names and Families, not onely in many outward, but also in many choise and spirituall respects For your further helpe herein, I make my selfe bold to present you with certaine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, heretofore preached by D. <hi>Sibbs</hi>; a man whose pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:17924:5"/>
know any thing among you, save Iesus Christ, and him crucified, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>2.2.</hi> Yea and after all his studie and teaching, was not ashamed to confesse of himselfe, that he was not <hi>yet perfect</hi> in the knowledge of Christ, nor <hi>had attained</hi> so much as might be attained, but was still therefore looking upward, and <hi>pressing forward to that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> Phil. <hi>3.12, 13.</hi> And indeed, what <hi>David</hi> acknowledged, concerning his searching the Scriptures in generall; that though he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further in the discoverie of Divine Truths, then those that went before him, <hi>Psal. 119.99.

            <p>They that were his constant Hearers, know this well; they that were not, may see it by these his Sermons now published, (reduced, as was
<pb facs="tcp:17924:6"/>
deemed most fit, into four severall Treatises) wherein, as the season required, he still tooke the opportunitie of instructing his Hearers in this great Mysterie of our Religion, <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>carnation of the Sonne of God</hi>; one of the chiefe Fundamentals of our Faith, one of the chiefe of <hi>those Wonders in the Mercy-Seat,</hi> which <hi>the Cherubins gaze at, which the Angels desire to prie into, 1</hi> Pet. <hi>1.12.</hi> And indeed, by reason he spake at severall times, and by occasion of so many severall Texts of Scripture concerning this subject, there is scarce any one of those incomparable benefits which accrew to us thereby, nor any of those holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions which the meditation hereof ought to worke in our hearts, which is not in some place or other sweetly unfolded. In the first Treatise, the Mysterie it selfe is indeed chiefely opened, and is therefore called, <hi>The Fountaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sealed:</hi> the rest, as in so many strea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The noted Humilitie of the Author I now the lesse wonder at, finding how often his thoughts dwelt
<pb facs="tcp:17924:7"/>
on the Humiliation of Christ. If we that now reade them, be not <hi>changed into the same image from glory to glory,</hi> it will be our owne fault. This take from me, the Treatises following are published by Copies of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which himselfe approoved and appointed, and that by subscribing his owne hand, purposely to prevent imperfect Copies. Embrace them therefore as truly his; and the Lord so raise up thy heart in the carefull perusall hereof, that <hi>thy profiting may be seene of all.</hi>

                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And then the seale of it; it is a <hi>great Mysterie without</hi> all <hi>controversie:</hi> by the confession of all, as the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <div type="part">

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Godlinesse, what.</note>
                        <hi>Godlinesse,</hi> is either the Principles of Christian Religion, or the inward disposition of the soule towards them, the inward holy affection of the soule; the word implyeth both: for <hi>Godlinesse</hi> is not onely the naked Principles of Religion, but likewise the Christian affection, the inward bent of the soule, sutable to Divine Principles, there must be a godly disposition, carrying us to godly Truths. That <hi>Godlinesse</hi> includes the Truths themselves, I need goe no further then the connexion: In the last words of the former Verse, <hi>The Church is the Pillar and ground of Truth</hi>; and then it followes, <hi>Without controversie, great is the Mysterie</hi> (he doth not say of <hi>Truth,</hi> but <hi>of Godlinesse</hi>; in stead of <hi>Truth,</hi> he sayth <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The same word implyes the Truths themselves, and the affection and disposition of the soule to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them Truths, to shew that both must alway goe together. Wheresoever Christian Truth is knowne as it should be, there is a supernaturall Light; it is not onely a godly Truth in it selfe, but it is embraced with godly affections. These blessed Truths of the Gospel, they require and breed a godly disposition; the end of them, is <hi>godlinesse,</hi> they frame the soule to <hi>godlinesse.</hi> Thus we see the Truths themselves are <hi>godlinesse,</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to God, and holinesse; that I need not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17924:12"/>
much stand on. But that there must be an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on answerable, and that this Truth breeds this, is a little to be considered, Why is Religion it selfe called Faith, and the grace in the soule also called Faith? To shew that <hi>Faith,</hi> that is, the Truth revealed (as we say, the <hi>Apostles Faith</hi>) it breeds Faith, and must be apprehended by <hi>Faith:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one word includes both the object, the thing beleeved, and likewise the disposition of the soule to that object: So, here <hi>godlinesse</hi> is the thing it selfe, the Principles of Religion, and likewise the disposition of the soule, that those Truths worke, where they are entertained as they should be. Hence followes these other Truths briefely.</p>
                     <p>First of all, that no Truth breeds <hi>godlinesse,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Divine Truth onely breed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Againe,<note place="margin">From what reasons we must be godly.</note> hence, in that Divine Truth is called <hi>Godlinesse,</hi> it shewes us, if we would be <hi>godly,</hi> we must be so from reasons of Christianitie: not (as I said) by framing devices of our owne, as gracelesse foolish men doe; as we see in Poperie, it is full of Ceremonies, of their owne devising: but if we will be <hi>godly,</hi> it must be by reasons and motives from Divine Truth; that breeds <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> It is but a bastard <hi>godlinesse,</hi> a bastard Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that is from a good intention, without a good ground: therefore the word implyes both
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17924:13"/>
the Tenent, the Doctrine, and the frame of Soule answerable to that Doctrine. Good Principles without an impression of it on the soule, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> but helpe us to be damned; and <hi>godlinesse,</hi> without a frame of doctrine, is nothing but superstition: <hi>godlinesse</hi> in doctrine, frames the soule to <hi>godlinesse</hi> in conversation. There are many, that out of a naturall superstition (which is alway accompanied with a poysonfull malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous disposition against the Truth of God) they will have devices of their owne; and those they will force, with all their power: but if we will be <hi>godly,</hi> it must be from reasons fetched from Divine Truth.</p>

When he nakedly beleeves the grounds of Divine Truth, the Articles of the Faith, when he can patter them over, doth that make a true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? No; but when these Truths breed, and worke <hi>godlinesse:</hi> for, Religion is a <hi>Truth according to godlinesse,</hi> not according to speculation onely, and notion: Wheresoever these fundamentall Truths are embraced, there is <hi>godlinesse</hi> with them; a man cannot embrace Religion in <hi>truth,</hi> but he must be <hi>godly.</hi> A man knowes no more of Christ, and divine things, then he values, and esteemes, and affects, and brings the whole inward man into a frame, to be like the things; if these things worke not <hi>godlinesse,</hi> a man hath but a humane knowledge of divine things; if they carry not the Soule to trust in God, to hope in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17924:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God, to feare God, to embrace him, to obey him; that man is not yet a true Christian: for Christianitie is not a naked knowledge of the <hi>Truth,</hi> but <hi>Godlinesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Religious Evangelicall Truth,<note place="margin">Divine Truth, Wisedome.</note> is <hi>Wisedome</hi>; and Wisedome is a knowledge of things directing to practise: A man is a wise man, when he knowes so as to practise, what he knowes: the Gospel is a Divine Wisedome, teaching practise as well as knowledge; it workes <hi>godlinesse,</hi> or else a man hath but a humane knowledge of divine things. Therefore, he that is <hi>godly,</hi> he beleeves aright, and practiseth aright: he that beleeves ill, can never live well; for he hath no foundation, he makes an Idoll of some conceit he hath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Word: and he that lives ill, though he beleeve well, shall be damned too. Therefore a Christian hath godly Principles out of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and a godly carriage sutable to those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And indeed, there is a force in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Godlinesse</hi> (from Gods love in Christ) to stirre up to <hi>godlinesse:</hi> the Soule that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends Gods Truth aright, cannot but be <hi>godly.</hi> Can a man know Gods love in Christ incarnate, and Christs suffering for us, and his sitting at the right hand of God for us, the infinite love of God in Christ, and not be carryed in affection backe to God againe, in love, and joy, and true affiance, and whatsoever makes up the respect of <hi>godlinesse?</hi> It cannot be.

A strange Mysterie, that rayseth a man above other men, as much as another man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other creatures. For a man to be content with his condition, in all changes, and varieties; when he is cast and tossed up and downe in the world, to have a mind unmoveable, it is a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: Therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Philip</hi> 4. <hi>I have entred into</hi> Religion (as it were) <hi>I have consecrated my selfe,</hi> the word is wondrous significant; <hi>I have learned this Mysterie, to be content.</hi> It is a Mysterie, for a man to be tossed up and downe, and yet to have a contented mind; <hi>I can want, and I can abound, I can doe all through Christ, that strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth me:</hi> Why?

so contrarie to our reason; they are Mysteries altogether above Nature: There are some seeds of the Law in Nature, but there are no seeds in Nature of the Gospel; therfore we should come to it with a great deale of reverence.

Church, as if we went to a Play, or some common place, without prayer, without preparation; when wee come with common affections, this is to come prophanely.

So the Spirit doth not onely bring a blessed Light to the Scriptures, and shew us the meaning in generall; but it is a Spirit of appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to bring home those gracious promises to every one in particular, to tell us the things that are given us of God; not onely the things that are given to the Church, but to us in particular: For the Spirit of God will tell us what is in the brest of God, his secret good will to the Church; he loves the Church, and he loves thee, sayth the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore he is called an <hi>earnest,</hi> and a <hi>seale</hi> in our hearts; because he discovers not onely the Truth at large, but he discovers the truth of Gods affection, in all the priviledges of the Gospel, that they belong to us.

Hence comes the necessity of the Ministery: for, if the Gospel be a Mysterie, that is, a hidden kind of knowledge, then there must be some to reveale it. God hath therfore stablished an Office in the

Prophane people, they thinke they know enough, they need not be taught; as if this were a shallow Mysterie, or none at all. It argues a prophane and naughty heart, not to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all sanctified meanes; all is little enough: And sometimes God will not grant his Spirit in one meanes, because hee will make us goe to another, and from that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He denyes his Spirit of purpose in hearing, because he will have us to read; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes it in that, because he will have us conferre, and practise the Communion of Saints; and all little enough, to apprehend this glorious excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Mysterie. A man may know a prophane heart therefore, by despising the improovement of any meanes of knowledge. It is a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; therefore Gods people desire to have it taught.</p>

None ever miscarry in the Church, but those that have false hearts; they have not humble and sincere hearts, willing to be taught: For if they have that, then God, that hath given this sinceritie, and will; this resolution, that they will use the meanes, and they will be taught, hee will suit it with Teachers: God usually suites men with Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, fit for their dispositions. Let a man have a naughtie heart, and he shall find flatterers to build him up in all violent and naughtie cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; God, in judgement, will give him Teachers, that shall suit his disposition.

So it is with men, when their mindes be cleare; before they be over-cast with passion, and strong affections to the world, they judge clearely of divine things: but when those passions prevaile with them, they are opposite to that Truth that before they saw, (in Gods just judgement,) such is the antipathy &amp; emulation of the heart against this sacred Mysterie: The heart of it selfe is an unfit Vessell for these holy Mysteries; let us desire God, to purge and to cleanse them.

As I said before, there is a prevailing power in Faith; because Faith sets before the soule, that which is incomparably better, and incomparably worse: What is all that man can doe, in comparison of Hell, and Damnation; conscience saith, if you doe this, ye shall die: And on the other side, what is all the world can give, in comparison of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;

Though somewhat there will be in us, to humble us; or else, why are Precepts of Mortification given to them that were Saints alreadie, but that there is somewhat will draw us downe, to abase us? But this is no comfort to him that is not the child of God, that lives in filthie courses, that he might easily command him selfe in; let him abandon the name of a Christian, he hath no interest to the comfort of this, that <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up to glory.</hi>

                     <p>For the first, of glorifying God in generall, I will not speake much, it would be large: and the point of glorifying God, is most sweetly considered, as invested in such a benefit as this, when we thinke of it, not as an Idea onely, but thinke of it in <hi>Christ,</hi> for whom we have cause to glorifie God,<note place="margin">How to know whether we glorifie God.</note> and for all the good wee have by him.</p>

                        <note n="1" place="margin">When we exalt him above all.</note>First then, we hold tune with the blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in giving glory to God, when we exalt God in our soules, above all creatures and things in the world, when we lift him up in his own place, and let him be in our soules, as he is in himselfe, in the most holy; God is glorious, especially in his mercy and goodnesse; let him be so in our hearts, in these sweet Attributes, above all our unworthinesse and sinne: for God hath not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from us, till we give him the highest place in our love, and joy and delight, and all those affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that are set upon good, when they are set upon him as the chiefe good, then we give him his due place in our soules, wee ascribe to him that Divinity, and excellency, and eminency, that is due to him. And this especially appeares in competition and opposition of other things;<note place="margin">Especially in opposition.</note> when we will not offend God for any creature; when we can say as the <hi>Psalmist, Whom have I in heaven but thee,</hi>

Let us examine what is highest in our soules: <hi>The loving kindnesse of the Lord, is better then life it selfe,</hi> saith the Psalmist. Then we give <hi>God</hi> glory, when we set light by life it selfe, as holy Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could say, What, doe you tell me of suffering at <hi>Ierusalem?

What we are by nature, and the misery we are exposed to by sinne, that whatsoever we have more then hell, is more then we deserve: and then withall, thinke what we are advanced to in <hi>Christ,</hi> what we are freed from, that cursed condition, and what we shall be freed from, the sting of death, and all that wee feare for the time to come, thinke of what we are freed from, and what we are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to, and by whom, by God becomming man; a mysterie that might, nay, that doth ravish the very Angels themselves; God-man now in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, making good what he did on earth, by his Intercession, and then the ground of all, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love, and mercy, and bounty of God, to poore distressed man. The thought of these things, will inflame the heart: now, they never worke upon the heart thorowly, till they end in admiration, and indeed the Scripture sets it downe in termes of admiration, <hi>So God loved the world, So, how?</hi> So as I cannot tell how, I cannot expresse it, and, <hi>What love hath God shewed us, that we should be called the sonnes of God?</hi> And then the fruits that we have by this Incarnation of <hi>Christ</hi> and by his death, they are admirable: <hi>Peace that passeth understanding, joy unspeakable, and glorious,</hi> so that the mysterie is wonderfull, and the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wonderfull, and the fruits, the comfort, and peace, and joy wonderfull, every thing is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

preserve us to life everlasting. We are kept by the power of God, to that glory that Christ hath purchased by his death.

the true riches, by their desire, and hungring and thirsting after grace, by their care to please God in all things; to approve themselves to God, to doe nothing against conscience, by their care in using the meanes of salvation, and their walking circumspectly; a man may see and discover their riches in their carriage: and if there be he least degree of grace, it is great riches: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of inferiour things, though it be little in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that wee shall have in Heaven. Let us search what wee have, that we may walke thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and comfortably.

We account them base minded men, that being very rich, yet they live as if they had nothing: so Christians are too blame, that having great riches in Christ, they live as uncomfortably as if they had none. What is the reason (Christ being so rich) that Christians have no more grace? Sometimes it is because they search not their owne estates for good, as well as bad. And then they doe not empty themselves enough, that Christ may fill them. They are not thankfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for that they have; for thankfulnesse is the way to get more.</p>

                     <p>And then, what was there in us that should move him to abase himselfe so low; was there any worth in us? No, we were dead: was there any strength in us?

No, we were opposite to all goodnesse in our selves, there was no desire in us to be better then we were: if God should have let us alone to our owne desires, we were posting to Hell. It is the greatest misery in the world, next to Hell it selfe, to be given up to our owne desires: A man were better to be given up to the Divill then to his owne desires, he may torment him, and perhaps bring him to repentance; but to be given up to his owne desires, leads to Hell. It is meerely of grace, grace; it was the grace of God the Father that gave his Son,<note place="margin">Grace what it is.</note> and it was grace that the Son gave himselfe. What is grace?

                     <p>Wee must not thinke of Christ as an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the worke of salvation; hee is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple (in the worke) from his Father.

                     <p>First, grace as it is in God and Christ in their owne breasts, the favour of God resting in his own bosome.</p>
                     <p>And then this grace, and favour shewed in grace, that is, in habituall grace, in bestowing grace upon our natures, to sweeten and sanctifie it, to fit it for communion with God.</p>
                     <p>And then actuall grace, the movings of the Spirit to every good worke, to every action of grace.</p>
                     <p>And then every gift of God, every blessing as a grace, because it riseth from grace; as we say of the gifts of a great person, this is his grace or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: so every good thing we have is a grace. It is the favour of God in Christ that sweetneth all: let us labour to see grace in all, especially the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental grace, the favour of God, and of Christ, the cause of all. And let us see any grace in us as from that grace, and every good act wee doe, a grace from meere favour; and every blessing wee have, is a grace, if our hearts be good: as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle cals the <hi>Macedonians</hi> benevolence, a grace; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is good is a grace. <hi>Therefore not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name be the glory,</hi> both of thy favour, and of al that comes from it: all that we have is sweet, because it issues from grace. The favour in the thing is better then the thing it selfe: as we say of gifts, we care not for the gift, but for the love of him that gave it: so the good things that we have, are not so sweet as the favour of him
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17924:196"/>
that gives it: when we deserve not so much as daily bread, but that also is of grace. The sourse and spring of all that is in us, is free grace in the breast of God and Christ.<note place="margin">We are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by grace, how meant.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the controversie between us and the Papists, when we say we are justified by grace, we must not understand it of inherent grace, whereby our natures are sanctified, and that but in part; but it is meant of the free grace and mercy of God in Christ, and the free grace of Christ in his owne breast. Let us take heed that we build not our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification and salvation upon a false title; the title is the grace of Christ, and of God the Father.</p>
                     <p>Now the grace we have in Christ in the breast of God is,<note place="margin">Grace twofold</note> either the good will of God, whereby he is disposed to give Christ, and to doe all good to us, there is no cause of that at all. Christ as God joynes with the Father in that grace which is <hi>Amor benevolentiae, the grace of good will:</hi> Christ as Mediator is the effect of that grace. But then there is the grace of complacency, whereby God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in us: this is bestowed upon the creature in effectuall calling: then God shewes the grace of delighting in us, ingrafting us into Christ by faith: for though before all worlds God had a purpose to doe good to us, yet that is concealed till we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.

                           <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.</note> because we are in Christ, as it is in <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. <hi>I in them, and they in me.</hi> God loves the head and members with the same love: Christ as God was freely disposed to choose men; but Christ as Mediator continues this favour and mercy of God, when we are grafted into him, to shine on us continually. It is this second that we must labour for as a fruit of the first. Let us labour not only to know that there was an eternall love of God to some that are his: but labour by faith in Christ, to know that he shines upon us in Christ, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces within us, and all other gifts are from this first grace, therefore they have the name. Why doe we call Faith, Hope, and Love, graces, but because they issue from the mercy, and favour, and love of God in Christ? and (as I said before) why doe we call any benefit we have a grace? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it comes from grace: all good things have the terme of grace on them, to shew the Spring from whence they come.</p>

more from the spring from whence they come, then for themselves. The necessaries of this life, food, and raiment, they are but meane things in themselves: but if we consider what spring they come from, from the blood of Christ that hath purchased them, and from the grace and love of Christ: grace will adde value to them: grace will make all sweet that we have, when we can say, I have this from the grace of God: as <hi>Iacob</hi> said, <hi>These are the children that God hath given me of his bounty and grace.</hi> This is the provision, the helpe, and comfort, that I have from the grace of Christ: for the same grace that gives Heaven, gives neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries and daily bread. Let us look on every thing, and put the respect of grace upon every thing. It is grace that we meet with afflictions wherby we are corrected; God might have let us goe on in the hardnesse of our hearts; looke upon every thing as a fruit of Gods grace and favour. What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that we are no more thankful for common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits? Because we looke not on them as issuing from grace. Take away grace the free favour of God, extract this quintessence; take the love of God out of things, what are they? Let a man be rich, if he have it not from the love and mercy of God, what will all be in time, but snares? Let a man be great in the world, if it be not from the grace of God, what is it? As God saith, <hi>I will curse you in your blessings</hi>: without grace we are cursed in those things that else are blessings: take grace from <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> is afraid in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and hides his head. Take the favour

he know that he hath interest in Christ? It may be knowne out of the Scriptures, as a history, that Christ is gracious for matter of fact: the Devils know it as well as we, and <hi>Iudas</hi> knew it: but hee speakes here of a knowledge with interest; you know it by experience,<note place="margin">What know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this is.</note> the Spirit witnesseth to your spirits so much, that Christ gave himselfe for you.

This knowledge is a super-added grace. It is one thing to be a sound Christian, and another thing to know it.

It may be sure in it selfe, but it cannot be sure to him without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: therefore those that know their estate in

grace, they are fruitfull, growing, carefull, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Christians.</p>
                     <p>It is no wonder that in these secure times,<note place="margin">Cause of doubting.</note> if we aske many whether they know themselves to be in the state of grace upon sound grounds: they wish well, and they have many doubtings. There are many that have the seeds, and the worke of grace in them; but the times are so secure, that they know it not. Vsually it is made knowne to us in the worst times, either in the time of affliction, and temptation, and triall, or after: when wee have <hi>fought the good fight,</hi> and overcome our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>To him that overcommeth will I give of the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Mannah</hi>; that is, he shall have a sweet sense of Christ to be Mannah, to be bread of life to him, to him that conflicts and gets the victory over his corruptions. The reason why many feele not that sweet comfort from the <hi>Grace of our Lord Iesus Christ</hi>; it is because either they doe not conflict with their base corruptions; or if they doe strive, they get but a little ground of them.</p>
                     <p>And let us take heed of that cold and injurious conceit, as if it were a thing not to be known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we belong to Christ or no. What, doe we think that Christ would come in the flesh, and become poore, nay become a curse for us, and that he is now in Heaven for us, and all that we should doubt whether we be in his love or no? and that we should not labour to finde our portion in that love? What a wrong is this to the grace of Christ? Is not all his dealing towards us that we might be joyfull in our selves, and thankfull, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17924:201"/>
fruitfull to him: and how can this be without some knowledge that our state is good? How can wee live well, and dye comfortably without it? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us make it the maine scope and aime of our indeavour. Oh the happinesse of that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that is good, and knowes himselfe to be so! What in this world can fall very uncomfortably to such a man? Nothing in the world can take downe his courage much: whereas another man that doubts of this can never be comfortable in any condition, he cannot be joyfull and thankfull in prosperity, he cannot be comfortable in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity: for hee knowes not from what ground this comes, whether it be in love to him or no.</p>

                        <hi>She loved much, because much was forgiven her:</hi> what made that blessed woman so inlarged in her affection and love to Christ? She had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the pardon of many sins, and having felt the love of Christ, she loved him againe, And what is the reason that those that are converted from dangerous courses of life, do often prove the most fruitfull Christians? Because they have felt most love and mercy. Who was more zealous then the blessed Apostle. S. <hi>Paul</hi>? Oh he found rich and abundant love! How large is he in fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the mercy of God: <hi>Oh the height, and breadth, and depth</hi>! Nothing contents him, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, when he speakes of Gods mercy: because he had beene a wretched man, and found mercy. Let no man be discouraged if he have beene never so sinfull, if he come in. The more need he hath of mercy, the more aboundant God is, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith here, <hi>You know the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And those that have felt most grace, will bee most wrought on, to shew the fruits of that grace in all good workes, in duties towards God and men.</p>

such, that take occasion from the free grace, and infinite, and boundlesse mercy of God, to be loose and carelesse in their lives and conversations; that think it is a time of liberty, and we may doe what we list, (though the tongues of men say not so, nor they dare not for shame, yet their lives speak it) would men else live in swearing, and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht carriage, that is offensive to God and men? Do they know that there is a God, a Christ, and mercy? Doth mercy and grace teach them that lesson? No, it teacheh us to deny such base lives and lusts, and to live holily, and soberly, and justly in this world. Therefore such men are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists; either they must not beleeve the Scriptures, or else exclude themselves from interest in mercy: for as yet they are not in the state of grace, in whom the consideration of mercy and grace doth not worke better effects then these.<note place="margin">The Gospell forceth strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life.</note>

                     <p>The Gospell hath as strong encouragements, and stronger to be good and gracious then the Law. Grace inforceth strictnesse of life more sweetly and strongly then the Law. The Law saith, <hi>We must not take the name of God in vaine</hi>: and we must be subject to our superiours, and to live chastly, &amp;c. under a curse. Doth not the grace of God teach this as well as the Law, and from a higher ground? It teacheth the same thing by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments taken from love and grace. A man peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth by the Law in such sins, but then there is a pardon offered, if men will come under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Christ, and lead new lives: but if men refuse, there is a superadded guilt; not only

justice condemnes such wretches, but mercy it selfe: because they refuse mercy upon these termes rather then they will leave their sinfull courses; mercy and justice both meet to condemne such persons.

because we are like the Son of his delight; whom doth God delight most in? In his owne blessed Sonne; and who come neerest in his delight to his Sonne? Those that expresse him in their lives and conversations.</p>
                     <p>The more like we are to Christ, the more like we shall be one to another. As if there be one Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or Picture, or Effigies, that is set for the first sample, the neerer the rest come to that, the more like they are one to another: so I say, the neerer Christians come to the first paterne of goodnesse, Christ himselfe (who is Gods master-piece (as it were) that which he glories in) the more we come to be like one another, and love and joy one in another. What is the sweet communion that we shall have one with another for ever in Heaven? Is it not that the Spirit shall be all in all in every one, and each shall looke upon another, as perfect in grace and love, and so shall solace and delight themselves first in God, and Christ, and then in one another, admiring and reverencing the graces and sweetnesse one of another. This is the very joy of Heaven it selfe, and it is the Heaven upon Earth, when we can joy and solace our selves one in another, as we are good. Now the neerer wee come to Christ who is the Image of God, the more we shall attaine this. Therefore let us labour that Christ may be all in all in us; that as the soule doth act the body, so the Spirit of Christ may act us, that Christ may speake in us, and think in us, and love in us by his Spirit; that he may dwell in us, and joy, and hate in us by his Spirit; that we

                     <p>How is that?</p>

Therefore let us labour to doe that we doe with our whole man, especially from our heart, and affection, and bowels. It is said of Christ in the Gospell, when he saw the people in misery, his bowels yearned within him, the workes of grace and mercy in Christ, they came from his bowels first. Let us worke our hearts to pitie, and love, and mercy first, that it may come from the soule as well as from the outward man.</p>

man is not the poorer for discreet mercy. It is seed (as I said before) a poore man labours to have his seed sowne, because it returnes plentifully. Let us be sober and abate of our superfluous expences: pride is an expender, and superfluous lusts; let us cut off from them, that we may have somewhat for seed; let us labour in an honest calling, that we may have somewhat to give. Oh, it is a blessed thing to give!

All are not alike (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe is) as white lines upon a white stone, that we cannot see a difference. It is not alike with all men: for we see a difference in this world: but not much here, because Gods government is vailed, it will appeare at the last day; and whatsoever appeares at the last day, it had a ground before. There is a difference in regard of grace and inward qualification, and in regard of the care of God. Even as there is a difference in the creatures: there be precious stones, and common stones; and in plants, there be fruitfull trees, and barren trees: and as there is a difference likewise in the living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>For it is an Article of our faith, <hi>Wee beleeve the holy Catholike Church:</hi> there must not be an Article of faith, and no object to beleeve. If there bee saith to beleeve a thing, there must be somewhat to be beleeved: if I beleeve that at all times there shall be an <hi>holy Catholike Church,</hi> there must be such a Church in the world, that is the object of my beleefe, or else there were no foundation for that Article of faith: therefore there must alway be a Church to the end of the world; sometimes more, sometimes fewer, even as the discovery of Christ is From whence comes the abundance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? the Spirit followes the manifestation of the knowledge of Christ, who is the Head of the Church: then is the Church most glorious, when the riches of Christ are more gloriously discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Those times wherein there is most discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ, and the mercy and love of God in him, there are more elect of God in those times then in other. There will be alway a Church in the world, that is the object of our beleefe: what is the meaning of it? I beleeve that in all times to the end of the world, there will be a company of people spread over the world, gathered out of the rest of mankinde, whom Christ hath knit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by faith, and themselves together in a holy spirit of love; of which copany <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such is the ill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and poysonfull nature of men (if they have not the Spirit of God) that God would not indure the world to stand a moment, unlesse there were some to with-hold his wrath, to be objects of his love, and to stay his hand; and when they are all gathered, there shall be an end of this wretched and sinfull world: some there must be while the world endures, and for their sakes God continues the world.

Why? There is good reason: for they are his in a peculiar manner. A governour of an house, he cares for all his cattell: but he cares for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren more. A man hath some care for all the lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and trash in his house, he sees them usefull at sometime or other; but he cares more for his Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17924:217"/>
if fire come, he will be sine to carry away his Iewels, whatsoever become of the lumber. Gods children are his after a peculiar manner; therefore he hath an answerable peculiar care of them in all times. And indeed when they are once his, as he makes them have a peculiar care of him; so hee lookes upon them, as such as he hath wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be good, and to witnesse for him, that have a care to stand for him and his honour, to own him and the cause of religion, he will have a care of them. Not that they have this of themselves to winne his love: but he workes in them a care to witnesse for him; he workes in them a care to stand for him &amp; his glory in all times; and therfore he wil be sure to stand for them in the worst times. He will not be beholding to any man; what wee have, we have it from him, and then he crownes his owne graces after; he will have a speciall care of those that are his.</p>

                  <p>And indeed there must be such a poverty of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, (before we can beleeve in Christ) whereby we may be convinced of our debts,<note place="margin">Necessity of this poverty of spirit.</note> and of our unabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

we never come into that cursed condition againe.</p>
                  <p>And indeed it is an errour in the foundation which is not mended in the Fabrick (as we say) when there is an errour in poverty of spirit at the first,<note n="5" place="margin">It is the cause of all miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> when the work of humiliation is not kindly wrought; hence is the defect in all the whole car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of a Christian.

For Christianity it is an excellent frame, it is a frame for eternity, a building for ever; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must have a sure foundation which must be laid in humiliation and poverty of spirit. An er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the first digestion is not amended in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; if that be not good, the rest are naught; if there be not sound humiliation, nothing will bee sound afterward. Therefore we should desire, that God by his spirit would helpe us more and more to know what we are in our selves, that we may get to be what we are in Christ.</p>
                  <p>But there is a continuall frame and disposition of soule,<note n="2" place="margin">Spirituall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty after conversion.</note> which is a poverty in spirit, that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Gods children all the dayes of their life, till they be in heaven, till they enjoy that riches that is laid up there for them;<note place="margin">In all passages of our life.</note> and that is especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here meant.

                  <p>For in justification there must be a poverty of spirit,<note n="1" place="margin">In justification</note> to make us see that there is no righteousnesse

The poore man is much in prayer, he that is poore in spirit, is much in supplication: for prayers they are the Ambassadours of the poore soule to God, to supply it with the riches of his grace. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where there is no prayer, there is no sense of poverty, but there is a <hi>Laodicean</hi> temper, as if they were rich enough. You have a company of men, they say they cannot pray privately, their spirits are barren. They intimate much pride of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17924:234"/>
spirit: for if a man be sensible of his wants, you need not supply him with words. If a poore te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant come to a Land-lord, and find he hath a hard bargaine, let him alone for telling his tale; I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you he will lay open the state of his wife and children, and the ill yeare he hath had, he will be eloquent enough.

                  <p>Againe,<note n="2" place="margin">Vse of meanes.</note> there is a care of using all meanes. Where poverty is, there will bee a making out of our selves unto places where GOD bestowes any riches. They that are poore, and have no victuals at home, they will goe to market, rather than they will starve: and those that find in themselves want of grace and comfort; surely they will goe out of themselves, they will goe to Gods market, they will attend upon the meanes. He that is like to be arrested for debt, and hath nothing at home, it is time for him to seeke abroad for supply: so when a man is poore spiritually, ready to bee snared and catched in every thing, for want of spirituall grace, he will labour for strength in the use of all means. Therefore those that are of a <hi>Laodicean</hi> stamp, that thinke there is too much preaching, and too much hearing, and too much reading; and what need all this adoe? Alas, they were never hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, they were never sensible of their state by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor are not yet in the state of grace: for the

A poore man that is sensible of his poverty, will be more thankfull for a penny, then another man for a pound that hath money of his owne. A soule that sees the want of grace, and withall sees the excellency of grace is thankfull to God that hee will worke any thing in such a poore defiled soule as hee is; that hee will worke any good motions, any good affections, any degree of faith, that he will give him any assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of salvation.

A thankfull soule is a poore soule, and a poore soule is alway a thankfull soule.

thing: a humble man is alway thankfull, and that is the reason that GOD may have his glory from him, hee is forced sometimes to humble and abase him, hee should have no sacrifice from him else. A proud man, a conceited man, so dotes upon his owne worth, hee forgets the giver, he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe an idoll to him: therefore such, they are usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of what they have, they enter upon GODS blessings, not considering from whom they have them, nor for what end they have them. They deny <hi>God</hi> his tribute of thankfulnesse, because they are proud: but a man that is poore in spirit, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon all by title of gift, and receives all from God in the forme of a poore man: therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever hee hath, hee returnes thankes for it againe.

Those therefore that give not themselves up to Christs governement, but are governed by rules of policy, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others, and have base dependance upon others; they know not what spirituall poverty is: they see there is a sufficiency in themselves to rule and governe themselves, as if Christs wisedome were not sufficient; they are not so disposed as the Apostle requires, they worke not <hi>out their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with feare and trembling, because God gives the will and the deed.</hi>

                     </note> that wee must not be so poore in spirit, as to deny the worke of grace in our hearts.<note place="margin">Not to deny the worke of grace.</note> It is one thing to bee poore in spirit, and to see our wants, and it is another thing to bee unthankfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, to deny the worke of grace, and so to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Satan: wee must not give false witnesse against our selves, and so deny the worke of Gods Spirit in us, it is not poverty, but darknesse of spirit; we are not acquainted with that grace that God hath enriched us with. Therefore where the soule is in a right temper, there is a double eye, one to see the defects and the staines of those graces we have, to see what we are wanting in of what we should be, and to see how our graces are stained, and that there is a mingling of our corruptions with them. The viewing with the one eye, that wee have any grace, that should make us cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and thankefull, and comfortably goe on, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that there are some beginnings that God will perfect: for hee never repents of his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. And then a sight of the want, and of the staines of those graces, that we mingle our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with them, that workes againe this poverty of spirit to go still out of our selves, to desire grace, to purge and cleanse our selves more and more.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17924:238"/>
Therefore I beseech you let us remember that, that we doe not unthankfully deny the worke of grace, and thinke that to be poverty of spirit; as some do out of covetousnesse, because they have not that they would have, they think they have nothing at all; that is a spirituall covetousnesse. But let us be wise to discerne what God hath wrought in our hearts what he hath done for, and in our soules. A holy man, you shall have him much in mourning and complaining, but it is of himselfe, not of God, as if God were wanting to him, you shall have a holy man in a perpetuall kinde of despaire, but it is in himselfe, he hopes in God still. Remember this caution, that as wee complaine, so let us be sure it be of our selves, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way justifie God in his mercy; and if we despaire, let us despaire of our selves, that we can do nothing of our selves; but be sure to maintaine (all we can) the hope of Gods rich mercy in Christ.</p>

                     <note place="margin">How to come to spirituall poverty.</note>Now having premised this caution. The way to come to spirituall poverty among many others, is:<note place="margin">To come into Gods presence.</note> First, to bring our selves into the presence of God, to the presence of greater lights then our own; men that think themselves some body when they are alone; yet when they consider, God sees them, whose eyes are a thousand times brighter then the sun; then they learne to abhor themselves in <hi>dust and ashes,</hi> as we see <hi>Iob</hi> did when God talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, when he saw God: and <hi>Abraham</hi> when he talked with God, he accounts himselfe dust and ashes.

And withall let us bring our selves to greater lights then our owne; that is, oft come into the company of those that have greater grace then our selves.

It is a good course therefore not to love alway to be best in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (as it is some mens vanity, because they will be conceited of their owne worth) but to present our selves before God in his ordinances, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our selves in communion and fellowship with others that are greater and richer in grace then our selves, and so we may see our owne wants.

                  <p>Especially let us consider what our profession requires of us;<note place="margin">What our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</note> not by the law, let that goe: but what in the covenant of grace we should be, &amp; are not, it will shame the best of us. Alas, how much good might we have done, that we have not! How have we failed in bringing honour and credit to our profession? How barren have wee beene in good works? How unwatchfull over our thoughts and speeches, whereby we have stained our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17924:240"/>
and our consciences, and grieved the Spirit of God. Let us consider how short we are of that we might have beene, and this will bring inward shame and confusion of spirit, from whence this temper of poverty of spirit comes. Consider of these things and enlarge them in your owne medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. There is not a more fruitfull spending of our thoughts (next to the consideration of Christ, and the riches we have in him) then to consider what we are in our selves: that we may be in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall disposition of soule, fit to receive the good that is to be had in Christ.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Two graces al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes requisite</note>Two graces are the maine graces that must go along with us all the dayes of our lives: this grace to go out of our selves, and another grace to go to another, that is better then our selves, in whom lyes our happinesse. That we may go out of our selves, and the creature, and all that is in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, poverty of spirit is necessary, to see that there is not that in our selves, that will yeeld a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of comfort; and poverty of spirit sees that there is not that that we possesse in the creature that will stand out. The creature, that is a particular good, for a particular case, to supply a particular want, and but for a time, it is fading and outward: but the comfort we must have, it must be spirituall and universall, to give contentment to the soule. The consideration of these things will force us to go out of our selves, this poverty of spirit, that wee have not enough to make us happy. The Heathen men by the use of discretion and knowledge, had so much to see, that there is nothing in the world
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17924:240"/>
to make man happy; the negative part they knew well enough: but there must be another grace to carry us to a possitive happinesse, where that lyes, and that is the grace of trust that followes. <hi>I will leave in the middest of thee an afflicted and poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> that shal be disposed and prepared by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward poverty, to inward spirituall poverty, to go out of themselves to Christ, to trust in him.</p>
                  <q>And they shall trust in the name of the Lord.</q>
                  <p>This is the carriage of these poore and afflicted people. <hi>They shall trust in the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath no delight in afflicting his children, he joyes and delights in the prosperity of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; it is our sinfull nature that forceth him to afflict us, that he may weane us from the world, because we are prone to surfeit upon things here below, All that God doth is that we may trust in him, which we would never doe, unlesse he did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us and make us poore in spirit; but when we are afflicted and poore in spirit and have nothing at home, we will make out abroad, as people in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity will doe: supply must be had, either at home, or from without; and when the soule is beaten and driven out of it selfe (which requires much ado) then we are fit for this blessed act, here spoken of, to <hi>trust in the name of the Lord.</hi> And the one is an evidence of the other. How shall wee know that we are sufficiently humbled, and made poore in spirit? when we trust in the name of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>In the unfolding of these words, take these for grounds which I will but name.</p>

                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:17924:241"/>First, that naturally every man will have a trust in himselfe, or our of himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that God is the trust of the poore man; what he wants in himselfe, he hath in God: God is the Rock or the Castle to which he retires, he hath supply in him.</p>
                  <p>The third is, that
<hi>God is trusted as he is knowne.</hi>

It is presumptuous bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to challenge any thing of God that we have not a promise for; or to attribute that to him that he is not: God is therefore trusted as he hath made himselfe by some name knowne to us. He hath made himselfe knowne by his attributes, by his nature and essence, <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and by his word, and the promises in his word: for his word is one of the best &amp; sweetest names whereby he hath made himselfe knowne. The name of God is glorious in all the world, in the creation, and every creature hath a tongue, to shew forth the power, and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and goodnesse of God: but what is this to us if we know not the will of God toward us? There is the name of God discovered, what he is in himselfe, somthing of his power and wisdome, &amp;c. But what he is to us, gracious and mercifull, and sweet, that we must gather out of the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his owne breast. He must come out of that <hi>light that none can attaine unto,</hi> and discover himselfe as he hath done in his word: and by this name of God, his word, we come to make use of his other

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17924:242"/>
but yet notwithstanding in the covenant of grace, wherein grace and mercy must have the glory; God hath stablished such a grace to rule there as ascribes all out of it selfe, and is an empty grace of it selfe; to make use of the riches that is ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of it selfe: therefore God hath made choice of this tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting instead of all other graces, as indeed leading to all other graces whatsoever. God brings us home by a contrary way to that we fell from him. How did we fall from God at the first, that was our Rock, our defence and trust? We fell from him by distrust, by having him in a jealousie, as if he aimed more at himselfe, then at our good; so the Devill perswaded our first parents: the next way therefore to come back againe to God, it must be to have a good conceit of God, not to have him in jealousie; but to be convinced in our soules that he loves us, better then we can love our selves (in spight of the Devill and all his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:) so to trust God is to relye upon him in life and death: therefore God hath appointed this grace, as he saith here. <hi>They shall trust in the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now because we all pretend that we trust in the name of the Lord. We will first examine our trust: let us try our trust a little, that wee may see whether it be true trust or no. And then upon that we will give some directions, how to come to this blessed condition, to trust <hi>in the name of the Lord.</hi>

                     </gap>solutely; for there is no comfort in an absolute God, distinct from his relations: but when we apprehend him in relation, as a sweet Father in Christ, in that name, then the nature of God is lovely to us, betweene whom and us there was an infinite distance before. Now Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with us, hath brought God and us together intermes of league. Now our nature is lovely to God in Christ, because it is taken to the unity of his person, and Gods nature is lovely to us, having made himselfe a father in Christ his beloved Sonne. Therefore when we speak of God, our thoughts must runne upon God as thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as clothing himselfe with the sweet terme of Father, our God in covenant, we must so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him.</p>
                  <p>Now one evidence of this trust in this our God,<note place="margin">Evidence of trust in God.</note> is a care to please him in all things. When we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon any men,<note n="1" place="margin">A care to please him.</note> wee have a care to please them. A tenant that feares to be thrust our, will strive to please his Landlord. We that hold all upon this tenure, upon faith and trust in God, we should feare to displease him.</p>
                  <p>And there will be likewise an use of all meanes to serve Gods providence and care of us,<note n="2" place="margin">Vse of means.</note> if wee trust in him; or else it is a tempting and not a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting. There are no men more carefull of the use

of meanes then those that are surest of a good issue and conclusion: for the one stirs up diligence in the other; assurance of the end, stirs up diligence in the meanes. For the soule of a beleeving Christian knowes that God hath decreed both, both fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same decree; when God pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

He that trusts a Physicians skill, will be very carefull to observe what was prescribed, and will omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It is but presumption, it is not trust where there is not a care in the use of meanes: as wee see many pretend to trust in God, and sever the means from the end, they are regardlesse of the meanes of salvation.</p>
                  <p>Againe, those that trust in God, they are quiet when they have used the meanes.<note n="3" place="margin">It quiets the soule.</note> Faith hath a quieting power, it hath a power to still the soule, and to take up the quarrels, and murmuring, and grudgings that are there, and to set the soule down quiet: because it proposeth to the soule greater grounds of comfort, then the soule can see any cause of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So the Spirit of God will difference a Christian from a naturall man, that will goe so farre as his braine can reach; if he can see how things can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed he will trust God, as if God had not a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, comprehension then hee.

Therefore though God shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his dealing as offended: yet he argues, God may be offended with me, but he cannot hate me, there is hope. Faith where it is in any strength, it will beleeve in contraries.

For all things: for faith never chooseth and singleth out its object to beleeve this, and not that: for all comes from the same God: therefore he that trusts God for one thing, will trust him for all things. If I will trust a man for many pounds, surely I will trust him for a shilling. He that pretends he will trust God, God will save me, God is mercifull; and yet notwithstanding will not trust him for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things: it is an abusive delusion, and flate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his owne soule in vaine: there is no such trust in him, because he that trusts God for the maine, will trust him for the lesse. Therefore true trust is for all things: he that trusts God for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse of sinnes, which is the maine, and hath wrestled with God for the forgivenesse of sinnes and found peace with God there, he will easily
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17924:245"/>
wrestle in other baser and lesse temptations. As God saith to <hi>Iacob, Thou art Israel, thou hast prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God, and shalt prevaile over men:</hi> so a true Christian, that in the grand point of forgivenesse of sinnes (when his conscience is surprized with the feare of Gods wrath) hath gotten assurance of the pardon of his sinnes, when hee is to set upon other lesser temptations, he overcomes them easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Therefore a Christian will trust God (as for forgivenesse of sins,<note n="1" place="margin">With good name.</note> and life everlasting, so) with his good name. Oh, will some say, you will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of thus &amp; thus; he cares not, he knowes the cause is just, he will trust his good name with <hi>God, Who will bring a mans righteousnesse forth cleare as the noone day,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> speakes. He that will not trust God with his good name, is of a base spirit; and feare of disgrace keepes many men from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny just actions. He that truly trusts God, will trust him with the righting of his cause;<note n="2" place="margin">To right his cause.</note> hee will not pull Gods office out of his hands, he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himselfe, but he will trust God, God cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will right me first or last, he will only use the legall meanes, and that quietly. But a man that is not acquainted with the Spirit of God, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently moved with revenge, and hath not learned to overcome himselfe in this conflict. A man hath gone indeed very far in religion, that can conquer himselfe in this conflict, that can trust his cause with God when he is wronged and overcome by might, &amp;c. So our Saviour Christ committed his cause to him <hi>that was able to judge righteously.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Christian hath the Spirit of Christ; hee
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17924:246"/>
when hee was reviled, retorted not againe: but committed the cause to him that was able to judge righteously. Shall I be able to commit my soule to God in the houre of death; and shall I not in case of revenge be able to commit my case to <hi>God,</hi> when I have done that that peaceably I may doe? I may suspect that I am but yet an hypocrite, I have not true trust in God.</p>

What is it to acknowledge him? To go to him for direction and protection in doing our duty, that we seeke to him for strength and for successe, this is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God in our wayes. What makes men so unfortunate and successelesse in their consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Because they are so faithlesse, they doe not acknowledge God in their wayes, but trust too much to seeming things, and appearance of things, they are carried too much with that. Though things seeme to go never so well, yet let nothing make us give over to acknowledge God: nay, when things are never so ill, let us acknowledge <hi>God,</hi> for <hi>God</hi> can set all streight and at rights again. Alas, what a small matter is it for him, that rules Heaven and Earth, and turnes this great wheele of all things, to turne the lesser wheeles, to order lesser businesses, and bring them to a happy issue and conclusion? It is but a little matter with his command, seeing he rules all things; it is but tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in him, and praying to him, and then using the meanes with dependance upon him. Let us therefore acknowledge God this way by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our wayes and affaires to him. Wee need knowledge, and strength, and a comfortable issue,

                  <p>Thus you see in all the passages of our lives we must learne to trust God, and to make use of God; for God is so abundant, that hee is never drawne dry; he joyes when he is made use of, it is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him.
