         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>So much of the wisdom of God.
The will of God is that,<note place="margin">Gods will.</note> by which

all things with one Act, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18.
<hi>Epb. 1. 5. Jam.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
               <p>In God there are two wills.</p>
               <p>1. A will whereby God determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
what shall be done concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us, or in us.<note place="margin">Quid vult. fieri de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, or in nobis.</note>

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:104646:9"/>
what shall be done off
us.</p>
               <p>The first of these wills is called
Predestination: And therefore it is,<note place="margin">M. P. pag. 295.</note>
that Predestination is commonly
defined to be the preparation of
the blessing of God, whereby they
are delivered which are delivered.</p>
               <p>The second of these wills is the
Gospel.</p>
               <p>Predestination determines, who
who, and how many are to be
saved, and hereupon Christ saith, I
know whom I have choosed, <hi>John</hi>
13. 18.</p>
               <p>The Gospel which is the second
will of God, determines what kinde
of ones they are that shall be saved,
and how they must be qualified.
Predestination which is the first
will of God, is Gods Decree it self.</p>
               <p>The Gospel which is the second
will of God, is an outward means
of the execution of this Decree of
Predestination.</p>
               <p>In the will of God there are three

wholely,<note place="margin">Nolendo nolle, <hi>or</hi> penitus nolle.</note> and absolutely nill a

               <p>3. A remiss Action,<note place="margin">Decretun Dei non tell it liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis sed ordinat. So <hi>M. P.</hi>
                  </note> which is as

               <p>God willeth good by approving

               <p>God willeth evil, because it is
good that there should be evil.</p>
               <p>For this cause God doth volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily

evil he wills it not; But doth
dissalowe and forsake it, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 16.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 12.</p>
               <p>The will of God in respect of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
objects, is called diversly by

The love of God is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

then all his Creatures as they are
good without their desert, and doth
take delight in them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 16.
<hi>Joh. 3. 16. Rom.</hi> 5. 8.</p>

               <p>Gods goodness is that, by which
he being also absolutely good, doth
freely exercise his liberality upon

               <p>Gods mercie is that, whereby he
freely assisteth all his Creatures in
their miseries, <hi>Esai 30. 18. Lament.</hi>
3. 22. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 19.</p>
               <p>Gods justice is that, by which he
in all things willeth that which is
just, as <hi>Psal. 11. 7. and</hi> 5. 4.</p>
               <p>Gods justice is either in word, or

               <p>

35.)</p>
               <p>This is the justice of God in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Gods justice indeed is that, by
which he disposeth, or rewardeth</p>
               <p>Gods disposing justice is that, by
which he as a free Lord, ordereth
all things rightly in his Actions,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 17.</p>
               <p>His rewarding justice is that, by
which he rendereth to his Creature

1 <hi>Pet. 1. 17. Jer.</hi> 51. 56.</p>
               <p>Again, the justice of God is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his, Gentlenes, or his Anger.</p>
               <p>Gods Gentlenes is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

<hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 41. 42.</p>
               <p>Gods Anger is that, by which he

               <head>Of Gods works and his Decree.</head>
               <p>THe works of God, are all the
World, and all the things
contained therein.</p>
               <p>The end for which all things are
created, is the manifestation of the
glorie of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:104646:13"/>
The Decree of God is that, by
which God hath freely from all
eternity determined all things, <hi>Eph.</hi>
1. 11. 4. <hi>Matth. 10. 29. Rom.</hi> 9. 21.</p>
               <p>The execution of Gods Decree
is that, by which all things in their
time are accomplisht, according as
he foreknew them, and Decreed
them.</p>
               <p>The Decree of God is the first,
and principal working cause of all
things, and it is also in order and
time before all other causes.</p>
               <p>This first, and principal cause
doth not take away freedom of will
in Election; Nor the Nature and
property of second causes; but it
bringeth them into a certain order;
and it directeth them to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
ends, and hereupon the
effects, or events of things are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
contingent, or Necessary.—</p>
               <p>—Even as the Nature of the
second cause is; And thus Christ
according to his Fathers Decree,
died necessarily, (as <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 3.)
But yet willingly. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:104646:14"/>
And if we respect the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Christs body, he might have
prolonged his life, and therefore in
this regard he may be said to have
died contingently.</p>
               <p>Gods foreknowledge is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
with his Decree; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of us it is before his Decree,
but not in regard of God.</p>
               <p>The branches of the execution of
Gods Decree are his, Operation,
and his operative permission.</p>
               <p>His operation is his effectual
producing of all good things, which
either have being, or moving, or
which are done.</p>
               <p>Gods operative permission is
that, whereby he onely permitteth
one, and the same work to be done
of others, as it is evil; but as it is
good he doth effectually work it,
<hi>Gen. 56. 20. &amp; 45. 7. Isai</hi> 10. 5. 6. 7.</p>
               <p>God permitteth evil by a certain
voluntary permission, in that he
forsaketh the second cause in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evil.</p>
               <p>And he doth also forsake his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104646:14"/>
creature, either by detracting the
grace it had,</p>
               <p>Or by not bestowing that which it
wanteth, <hi>Rom. 1. 26. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 25. 26.</p>
               <p>And in this we must not think
God unjust, for he is indebted to
none, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 15.</p>
               <p>It is in Gods pleasure to bestow
how much grace, and upon whom
he will, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 15.</p>
               <p>That evil which God permitteth
in respect of God is good, whither
it be as a punishment, or as a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement,
because he can, and doth
produce good out of it.</p>
               <p>Gods Decree as it concerneth
man, is called predestination.</p>
               <p>Predestination is a Decree of
God, by which all men are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to an everlasting estate; either
of Salvation, or Condemnation,
1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
               <p>The means of accomplishing
Gods predestination, was the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

The parts of the World, are the
Heaven and the Earth.</p>
               <p>The Heavens are three fold,
1. The Air, 2. Sky, 3. The invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Heaven.</p>
               <p>Heaven in a large acceptation,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 2.</note> is
all that is above the Earth. All
which, is distinguisht into three
Heavens. The first Heaven is the
space betwixt the Earth, and Starry
Firmament. The second Heaven
containeth the Sun, Moon, &amp; Stars.
The third Heaven is the invisible
Heaven, this is the place in which
the blessed do behold the Majesty,
and glorie of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of the World are
Angels, Men, and all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>In Angels there are these things
to be considered.</p>
               <p>1. Their Nature; they are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and incorporeal essences, <hi>Heb.</hi>
2. 16. <hi>and</hi> 1. 7.</p>
               <p>2. Their qualities,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Sam. 14. 17.</note> First they
are wise, Secondly, they are of great
might, 2 <hi>Thes. 1. 7. 2 Sam.</hi> 24. 17.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104646:15"/>
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 35. Another quality
of them is, Thirdly, that they are
swift, and of great agility, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 6.
<hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21.</p>
               <p>3. Their Number they are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable,
<hi>Dan. 7. 10. Hebr</hi> 12. 22</p>
               <p>4. The place in which these good
Angels are, and that is in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Heaven, for there they do ever
attend upon God, and have socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with him, <hi>Matth. 18. 10. Mark.</hi>
12. 25. <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 17.</p>
               <p>5. Their orders, or degrees,
which what they be, no man can
certainly say; but there are Arch-Angels
spoken of in Scripture,
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
               <p>And Angels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 10. And
Cherubims, &amp; Seraphims, <hi>Esai</hi> 6. 6.</p>
               <p>But it concerneth us not to
search this; neither may we curious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enquire after it.</p>
               <p>6. There office which is to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
God, and perform his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 20. 21.</p>
               <p>The Angels were created within
the six days, as appeareth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:104646:16"/>
The knowledge that the Angels
have,<note place="margin">Their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> is either: 1. Natural, 2 Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
3. Experimental.</p>
               <p>The Ministry of the Angels is
three fold,<note place="margin">Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> either to adore, or to
praise, or to glorifie God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
To this purpose do they stand
in the presence of God, ever more
ready to do his Commandments;
as <hi>Isai 6. 2. Luke 2. 14. Rev.</hi> 5. 11.
12. <hi>Ps. 103. 20. Dan.</hi> 7. 9. 10.</p>
               <p>Part of the Ministry of Angels
respecteth the Church, for they are
Ministring Spirits sent forth of
God, to Minister for the good of
those that shall be heirs of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <p>For the good of all these, they
Minister first in this life, 2. In the
end of this life, and 3. In the last
judgement.</p>
               <p>In this life they watch for the
good of their bodies, and for the
good of their Souls, and that from
the beginning of their days to the
end of them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 7.</p>
               <p>In the end of this life, they carry
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104646:16"/>
the Souls to Heaven, as they did the
Soul of Lazarus, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 22.</p>
               <p>In the last judgement they do
gather all the Elect together, that
they may come before Christ, and
so enter into Eternal fruition of
glorie, both in body and Soul,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 31.</p>
               <p>Another part of their Ministery
concerneth Gods Enemies, and it is
to execute judgements upon his
Enemies at his command.</p>

Justice, which was a conformity
in his will, affections and powers of

               <p>3. Man's dignity, which consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in these things. 1. In Man's

and winck at offences, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.

by Counsel, presence, or inticement,
as <hi>Rom. 1. 13. Mark 6. 25. 26. Act.</hi>
22. 20.</p>
               <p>2. The second difference of sin
of Commission is.</p>
               <p>Sinning ignorantly,<note place="margin">Sin of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> that is,
when a man doth not expresly and

35. 24. 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 4. Ps.</hi> 10. 13.</p>

               <p>Is,<note place="margin">Sin of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> when any Man sinneth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

though we do evil, and run on in
it, <hi>Eccles. 8. 11. Rom.</hi> 2. 4.</p>

               <p>Every Commandment is both
affirmative and negative. That is,
it doth both command and forbid.</p>
               <p>As it is Affirmative it bindeth at
all times, but not to all times.</p>
               <p>As it is Negative it bindeth at all
times, and to all times.</p>
               <p>Under one Vice expresly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
are comprehended all of that
kinde; yea, the least cause, occasion,
or inticement thereto are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<hi>Joh. 3. 15. Matth.</hi> 5. 21.</p>

no other God but him.</p>
               <p>The marks of the true love of
God are these.</p>
               <p>1. To hear his word willingly.</p>
               <p>2. To speak often off him.</p>

               <p>We must not account that God

these things.</p>
               <p>1. Ignorance of the true God
and of his will.</p>
               <p>2. Atheism, which is a denying
of God, or of his Attributes; as off
his justice, wisdom, providence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<hi>Ps.</hi> 14. 1.</p>
               <p>3. Errours concerning God, or
concerning the Persons of the Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or concerning Gods Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</p>
               <p>Here Helenism, or the adoring
of a multiplicity of Gods is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>4. The setting of our hearts and
affections upon any thing else but
one God.</p>
               <p>The heart is drawn from God
by these means.</p>
               <p>1. By distrusting of God, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 38. From this distrust ariseth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:104646:29"/>
First, impatiency in suffering af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 14. 13. 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a tempting of God, and
this is when the man that distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and contemneth God, seeks an
experiment of Gods truth and
power, <hi>Matth. 4. 7. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 9.
10.</p>
               <p>3. A desperation, <hi>Genes.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
               <p>4. A doubting concerning the
truth of God, or concerning his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
either present, or to come,
<hi>Ps.</hi> 116. 11.</p>
               <p>2. By confidence of Creatures,
as 1. when a man putteth trust in
the strength of the Creatures, as
<hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 5. or 2. In riches, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.
24. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 5. or 3. In defenced pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 40. 16. or 4. In pleasures,
or dainties, and who so trusteth in
these doth make his belly his God,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. or 5. In Physicians,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 12. or 6. In the Devil
and his works. Thus Magicians
trust in the Devil: and Witches,
and all such as seek help at their
hands, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:104646:29"/>
3. The heart is drawn away
from God, by loving the Creature
too much, and more than God,
<hi>Matth. 10. 37. Joh.</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 43.</p>
               <p>And by self Love, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
               <p>4. By hatred and contempt of
God, as when a man declining from
God, doth fly from God, and is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with God when he punisheth
sin, <hi>Rom. 8. 7. and</hi> 1. 30.</p>
               <p>5. By want of the fear of God,
<hi>Ps.</hi> 36. 1.</p>
               <p>6. By fearing the Creature
more than the Creatour.</p>
               <p>7. By hardness of heart and
carnal security, as when a man will
neither acknowledge Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
nor his own sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5.
<hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34.</p>
               <p>8. By pride, and presumption,
as when a man ascribeth that to his
own industry and merit, which is
onely due to God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. 7.
<hi>Genes.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>The highest stair of prides lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
is that fearfull presumption of
men, of climbing rashly into Gods
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104646:30"/>
seat of Majesty, as if they were
Gods, <hi>Act. 12. 22. 23. 2 Thes.</hi> 2. 4.</p>

               <p>Here we are forbidden these
things.</p>
               <p>First, to represent God by any

whatsoever, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 15. 20.</p>
               <p>For all idols are lies, <hi>Habak.</hi> 2.
18. <hi>Zach. 10. 2. Jer.</hi> 10. 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are here forbidden
the least approbation of idolatry,
<hi>Hosea 13. 2. Gen.</hi> 48. 10. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all processions, plays, feasts,

<hi>Isai</hi> 30. 22.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we are here forbidden

3. 4. <hi>Malach. 2. 11. Ezra</hi> 9. 14.

               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:104646:31"/>
1. Because it doth obscure Gods
glory, and maketh him in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
either unwilling, or unable to
aid his Church.</p>
               <p>2. Because in so doing we shall
without doubt infect our selves

               <p>3. Because we are thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered

With idolaters we are also forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

               <p>We are also forbidden with ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
all Trials in Law, before

14 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9.</p>
               <p>1. Such vows as these are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
repugnant to the Law of

mans nature can perform. 3. They
do disanull Christian Liberty, and
make such things necessary as are

5. They are idolatrous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

               <p>First, to make a glorious shew
of serving God, and yet to seek no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else by it, but the pomp and
glory of the World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to observe and take
notice of other mens faults, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
and not to see, or minde
our own.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to be more zealous,
and curious in the observation of
the Ancient Traditions, then of the
Statutes and Commandments of
Almighty God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to strain at a gnat,
and swallow a Camel; or to omit
serious affairs, and the weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Gods word, and to hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
trifles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 24.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, to do all things to be

seen of men, <hi>Matth. 6. 5. and</hi> 23. 5.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, to fast with an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Merit is Hypocrisie, and to
make a distinction of meats for the
same; The like also is all external
abstinence from meats, if it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an internal abstinence from sin,
and unlawfull desires, <hi>Isai</hi> 58. 5. 6.</p>
               <p>6. We are here forbidden all
contempt, neglect, and intermission
of Gods service, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 15. 16.</p>
               <p>7. We are here forbidden all
corrupting of Gods worship, and
of that order of government, which
he hath ordained for his Church;
And this we do when we either add
to Gods worship, or diminish it, or
mangle it, <hi>Deut</hi> 12. 32.</p>
               <p>8. We are here forbidden all

               <p>9. We are forbidden all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

all kindes of Magick.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:104646:33"/>
The Devil effects wonders and
merveils, not by making a new
thing which was not at all before,
but by moving, transporting, and
applying natural things diversly, by
making a thin body thick and fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and by bewitching and holding
of mens senses.</p>
               <p>The foundation of Magick is a
Covenant with Sathan.</p>
               <p>And this Covenant is such a
contract, as doth make, men mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
to have to do with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</p>
               <p>The Original of this mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
is this. First,<note place="margin">The foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick is a contract with the Devil.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Sathan, or the Devil makes choice
of such men to be his servants, as
are by nature, either notorious bad
persons, or else very seemingly sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or indeed, silly Souls.</p>
               <p>Then doth he offer to them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
means, either by Magicians, or
by their writings, or by teaching
and instruction from himself.</p>
               <p>The means which the Devil of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
for this purpose, are such as are
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104646:34"/>
used for the producing of such an
effect, as by their own nature they
were never ordained for: Nor is
there any word of God for the
doing of them, but against it.</p>
               <p>These Satanical means are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
words, and words of Scripture
wrested and abused; Holy water,
Sieves, Seals, Glasses, Images, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the knee, and such like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
gestures, The use of which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own will, and to his
own purpose, he teacheth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by secret whispers, or sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions;
and sometimes, either, by the
words, or writings of Magicians.
And when they have embraced
these means, and do declare their
Satanical confidence by their
earnest endeavour to use, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
this kinde of wickedness by
these means, the Devil standeth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to assist them, and he alone it
is that doth by these means, which
are void of all such vertue as is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
effect that which his wicked
instrument intended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:104646:34"/>
Then having brought them on
thus far, the Devil Counterfeits
God, and makes as though he was
God. And as God hath his word
and Sacraments, and Faith; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Devil hath his Characters,
Gestures, &amp; Sacrifices, which are as
it were his Sacraments, by which
he doth signifie to his Devilish Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians;
his own Devilish pleasure,
and by the use of the same they do
testifie their obedience to him.</p>
               <p>And as God is delighted with
his servants calling upon him. So
likewise the Devil is delighted with
the Magical ceremonies of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and with their invocations.</p>
               <p>The Covenant with the Devil is<note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Devil is either se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, or express.</note>
either secret, or express.</p>
               <p>The secret Covenant with the
Devil is, when the party doth not
expresly compact and Covenant
with the Devil, but yet in heart
doth allow of his means, and doth
assuredly believe that by the using
of such means wonders may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:104646:35"/>
Express Covenant with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is when the party doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
trust in him, but also Covenant
with him, and give himsel holely to
him upon condition that he may

of those that swear in their drink;
and the Oaths of Frantick, furious
men, Fools, and children binde them
not.</p>
               <p>The end of an Oath is to confirm
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104646:37"/>
some necessary truth in question, as
<hi>Heb. 6. 16. Rom. 1. 9. 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 23.</p>
               <p>An Oath is either publick, or
private.</p>
               <p>A publick Oath is, when a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
without any peril to him
that sweareth, doth upon just cause
desire a Testimony under the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

               <p>A private Oath is that, which

               </p>
               <p>An asseveration is like an Oath,
but is no Oath.</p>
               <p>An asseveration is nothing else
but an earnest assertion of our
meaning,<note place="margin">An Asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration what it is?</note> the name of a Creature

               <p>An asseveration without the use of

you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 1.</p>
               <p>An asseveration with the use of

Though it be unlawfull to swear
by Creatures, yet thus far may we
use them in an Oath, as to make
them pledges, and as it were cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sances

And so likewise the Oath of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Woman by her Husband in the
day that he heareth it, <hi>Num.</hi> 30. 3. 6.</p>
               <p>If a Man swear to perform things
unlawfull, either out of ignorance,
errour, infirmity, or any other way,
his Oath is to be recalled, for we
must not add sin to sin, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.
21. 22. 33.</p>
               <p>Here we are commanded to

               <p>The means of the sanctification

               <p>The Negative part of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment

               <p>1. Here Perjury is forbidden, that

or about such things as do depend
upon Mans free-will, (and so are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

can neither be foreseen nor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,)
and not upon the Heavens.</p>
               <p>It is impossible by the bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

The Stars have indeed a great
force, but such as doth manifest it
self onely in the operation, which it
hath in the four principal qualities
of natural things, as in heat, cold,
moisture, driness.</p>
               <p>The Stars can not at all force the
will, or give the least inclination to
it. It is beyond the reach of man
to define how great the force of the
Stars is.</p>

Moon,<note place="margin">Effects of the Sun &amp; Moon.</note> are apparent in the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution

But the effects of the Planets and
of the fixt Stars, though they be of
great force, and innumerable, are
not so manifest unto us. And now,
because a man can know but some
Stars onely, and their operations,
and not all the Stars, and all their
operations and forces, he can not
certainly foretell future things, or
things to come; yea, though they
did depend on the Stars. For
though the position of certain Stars
do demonstrate such an effect to

that this Art, is of the same

               <p>1. Because the word of God rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth

               <p>Six days shalt thou labour, and do
all thy work.</p>
               <p>But the seventh day is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
of the Lord thy God: in it
thou shalt not do any work, thou
nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter,
thy man servant, nor thy maid ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
nor thy Cattel, nor thy stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that is within thy gates. For in
six days the Lord made Heaven
and Earth, the Sea, and all that in

               <p>We do keep it holy if we do

               <p>As a preparation to the sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

The Sabbath is either Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,

               <p>It is Ceremonial.<note place="margin">Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> 1. In respect of

their continual resting from the
work of sin, (<hi>Exod. 31. 13. Ezek.</hi>
20. 12.) And of the blessed rest of
the faithfull in the Kingdom of
Heaven, <hi>Heb. 4. 10. Isa.</hi> 66. 23.</p>
               <p>And as it was observed the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth

               <p>It is also moral, because servants

               <p>The very first act of repentance

               <p>A Sacrament is that, whereby

<hi>Genes. 17. 11. Rom.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
               <p>The parts of a Sacrament are the

               <p>The thing signified is Christ.</p>
               <p>The matter, or signs of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

that receiveth them holy; this is
the alone work of the holy spirit,
which indeed doth ever accompany
the signs when at any time they are

               <p>So that the sign doth onely signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
grace, either already received, or

               <p>The thing signified is, 1. Christ,

               <p>The action about Christ is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,

               <p>The action of God is the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

               <p>By a figure called a Metonymie,
one thing is put for another in the

               </p>
               <p>1. Knowledge of the Gospel by
the illumination of Gods spirit,
<hi>Isai</hi> 53. 11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3.</p>
               <p>To this knowledge in those that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104646:76"/>

meditation of the promises in
the Gospel.—</p>
               <p>—Which Meditation is stirred
up by a sensible feeling of their own
beggery.</p>
               <p>And after this knowledge there
doth arise a general Faith in all
such as are enlightned, whereby
they subscribe to the truth of the
Gospel, <hi>Heb. 4. 2. 1 Tim. 1. 19. and</hi>

that is the full
assurance of understanding, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.
2. <hi>Rom. 14. 14. Luk. 1. 1. 1 Thes.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>2. Hope of pardon, by which a
sinner believeth that his sins are
pardonable, though he doth not
yet feel them certainly pardoned,
<hi>Luke</hi> 15. 18.</p>
               <p>3. Hungring and thirsting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
grace, which is offered to us in
Christ Jesus, <hi>Joh. 6. 35. and</hi> 7. 37.
<hi>Revel. 21. 6. Matth.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
               <p>4. An approching with boldness
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:104646:77"/>
to the Throne of Grace, that so we
flying from the terrour of the Law,
may take hold on Christ, and finde
favour with God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
               <p>This approching of the Throne
of Grace is done, 1. by an humble
confession of our sins in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God, as did <hi>David, Psal.</hi>
32. 5. 2 <hi>Sam 12. 13. Luke</hi> 15. 19.</p>

same purpose, <hi>Luke 15. 21. Act.</hi> 8.
22. <hi>Rom. 8. 26. Hosea</hi> 14. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>3. An especial perswasion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
in the heart by the holy

man doth apply all the promises of
the Gospel to himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>and 15. 28. Gal.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
               <p>This perswasion is, and ought to
be in every one, before he have any
experience of Gods mercie, <hi>Matth.</hi>
15. 22, 27. <hi>Joh. 20. 29. Heb.</hi> 11. 1.</p>
               <p>In natural Phylosophy we do
first see things true by experience,
and afterwards assent unto them;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104646:77"/>
Thus we are perswaded that water
is hot, because we perceive the heat
by putting our hand into it.</p>
               <p>But in the practise of Faith, we
must first stedfastly believe, and
then the experience and feeling of
comfort will follow, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 20. 20.</p>
               <p>It is therefore very ill done of
any, that they should doubt of their
salvation, because they do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
feel the especial motions of
Gods holy spirit in themselves.</p>
               <p>The lowest degree of Faith is

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, a weak Faith,
or a little Faith, like to a grain of
Mustard-seed, or to smoaking flax,
which cannot flame nor give out
heat, but onely smoak, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.
25. 26 <hi>and 7. 20. Isai.</hi> 3. 4 2.</p>
               <p>Faith may be then said to be fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when either the first of the five
motions, or the last of them is weak
and feeble; yea, though the other
three motions do remain strong,

1. A serious desire to believe,

is the seed of this Faith,
<hi>Matth. 5. 6. Rev 21. 6. Psal.</hi> 145. 19.</p>
               <p>2. An earnest use of means to
encrease the least spark of Faith,
that so it may get growth by little,
and little, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Faith is stirred up by earnest
prayer, and meditation, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
progress, and going on in the
ways of perfection, and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise

               <p>The highest degree of Faith, is

give him eternal life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20.
<hi>and 8. 38. 1 Sam. 17. 36. Ps.</hi> 23. 6.</p>
               <p>A man doth not come to high

By this, through the obedience

<hi>Rom.</hi> 5 19.</p>
               <p>The parts of justification are,
1. Remission of sins, with a freeing

               <p>2. Imputation of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,

have the guilt of their sins covered,
and are accounted just in the sight
of God, <hi>Phil. 3. 8, 9. Rom.</hi> 4, 3, 4,

               <p>The obedience of Christ is called
the righteousness of God, and of

               <p>By this the power of sin is aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

<hi>Rom. 6. 2, 3. 4. Gal.</hi> 5. 24. Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is wrought in us by the power
of the holy Spirit, abolishing sin in

13. 4. to the 19.</p>
               <p>This temptation must be resisted

receive the word, that so through

in our hearts, and spring in us,
<hi>Luke 8. 15. Heb. 4. 2. Jam.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
               <p>Preservatives for the resisting of

               <p>1. Meditate on the power, and use
of the word, <hi>Eccles. 1. 17. and</hi> 5. 1.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:104646:85"/>
6. Be doers of the word, <hi>Jam.</hi>
1. 22.</p>
               <p>7. Consent always to the truth
of the word preached, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37.</p>
               <p>8. With <hi>David</hi> hide, or treasure
up the word of God in your hearts
that you sin not, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 11.</p>
               <p>9. Reverence, and tremble at the

               <p>In the hearing of the word the
fall is coldness in hearing, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of it, or else a falling into
errours.</p>
               <p>The remedy here is to restore by
the spirit of meekness, and that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we our selves are also subject

               </head>
               <p>The second assault is concerning
Faith.</p>
               <p>The temptation here is this, the
Devil putteth it into the heart of a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104646:85"/>
godly man that he is not elect, that
he is not justified, that he hath no
Faith, and that therefore he will be
condemned for his sins, <hi>Matt.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
               <p>To weaken a mans Faith, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
will take occasion to tempt him.</p>
               <p>1. From his adversities, dangers,
losses, persecutions, and grievous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.
Thus he dealeth with <hi>David,
Psal.</hi> 73. 12. and <hi>Job</hi> 13. 23, 24, 25.</p>
               <p>2. From the remembrance of sin
past, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 26.</p>
               <p>3. From a feeling of death, even
already at hand.</p>
               <p>Here resistance must be thus made.
In the power of true Faith, we must
apply Christ, and all his benefits to
our selves. Thus</p>
               <p>I assuredly believe that I shall
not be condemned, that I am elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and justified in Christ, and I am
out of all doubt that all my sins are
pardoned, <hi>Isai 53. 11. Rom.</hi> 8. 38, 39.</p>
               <p>In this temptation the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
from the fall is stedfastly to
look unto, and rely upon Christ,
the object of our Faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12.
to the 14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:104646:86"/>
The fall upon this temptation is
doubtfulness, and distrust of Gods
mercy, and of our own elections,
as in <hi>David, Ps. 76. 6, 7, 8. and</hi> 21. 1.
The remedies to recover this fall are</p>
               <p>1. The powerfull operation of the
holy spirit in encreasing Faith, and
stirring of it up, <hi>Phil. 1. 6. Luk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 17. 5.
2. Holy Meditations, as</p>
               <p>1. That it is the commandment
of God that we should believe in
Christ, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23.</p>
               <p>2 That the promises of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel

exclude themselves, <hi>Isai</hi> 55. 1.
<hi>Matth. 11. 28. Joh.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
               <p>3. That doubtfulness, and despair
are most grievous sins.</p>
               <p>4. That with <hi>Abraham</hi> we must
under hope believe against hope,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
               <p>5. That the mercies of God, and
the merits of Christs obedience do
belong unto all those that believe,
<hi>Isai 54. 10. Ps. 103. 11. 1 Joh.</hi> 2, 1. 2.
<hi>Ps.</hi> 130. 7.</p>
               <p>6. That God measureth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104646:86"/>
due unto him more by the
affection, and true desire of the
heart to obey, than by the external
act, and outward performance of
obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5, 7. and the 7.
20, 21, 22. <hi>Malach.</hi> 3. 17.</p>

               <p>8. That Grace and Faith are not

of Gods word. 2. Confession of
sins before God, and an earnest
entreaty of pardon for the offence
at his hands, <hi>Ps. 32. 5. 2 Sam.</hi> 12. 3.

sin, and to be fully renewed in life.

to embrace, &amp; keep his Cammand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
7. A holy revenge, which a
man must take of himself for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,

afterwards he should again fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same offence.<note place="margin">Second part of self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial.</note>

The second part of self-denial is,
The patient bearing of the Cross.</p>
               <p>The Cross is nothing else but that

passeth under, in his travelling

his own troubles, but when God
layeth affliction upon a man, he is
to bear it willingly, and patiently,

               <p>

from Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 29, 30.
Then the elect and faithfull seing
this, shall lift up their heads and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.
But at this sight the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

be burned up, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>At the same time when all these
things shall come to pass, the sound

sounded by the Arch-Angel, <hi>Matt.</hi>
44 31. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
               <p>Then shall Christ the Lord come

3. At the sound of this Trumpet
all the dead shall rise.</p>

shall be changed in the twinckling

they fall into sin, and God hateth

is neither an antecedent, nor a

               </p>
               <p>3. Condemnation.</p>
               <p>1. The acknowledgment of Gods
calling is, when Reprobates do for
a time subject themselves to the
calling of God, which calling is
workt by the preaching of the
word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 14.</p>
               <p>There are of the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods calling five degrees.</p>
               <p>1. An enlightning of their mindes,
whereby they are instructed of the
holy Ghost, that they may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and know the word, <hi>Heb</hi> 6.
4. 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 20.</p>
               <p>2. The second degree of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of Gods calling, is
a certain kinde of penitency, by
this penitency the reprobate do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their sins, as did the
Children of <hi>Israel, Deut.</hi> 1. 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:104646:100"/>
And are pricked with a feeling of
Gods wrath for sin, as was <hi>Cain,
Gen.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
               <p>And they are grieved for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of sin, as was <hi>Ahab,</hi>
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 27.</p>
               <p>And do confess their sin, as did
<hi>Judas, Matth.</hi> 27. 3.</p>

just in punishing of sin, <hi>Num.</hi> 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10</p>
               <p>And do desire to be saved, as
<hi>Baalam, Numb.</hi> 23. 10.</p>
               <p>And do in their misery and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
promise repentance, saying,
we will sin no more, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 32,
33, 34, 35.</p>
               <p>3. Degree of the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods calling is:</p>
               <p>1. A Temporary Faith, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
is content with a general
Faith, he doth confusedly believe
the promises made in Christ, but he
doth never apply the promises of
God to himself; Nay, he hath no
purpose to desire, or endeavour to
apply the same; he hath no wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or striving against security,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104646:101"/>
carelesness, or distrust, he believeth
that some shall be saved, but not
particularly that he himself shall be
saved, <hi>Jam. 2. 29. Matt.</hi> 13. 20, 21.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>4. The fourth Degree of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of Gods calling is:</p>
               <p>A tasting of heavenly gifts, as of
1. Justification, 2. Of sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
3. Of the powers, and virtues
of the world to come.</p>
               <p>This tasting of heavenly gifts is a
sense in their hearts, by which they
do feel and perceive the excellency
of Gods benefits, but they do not
enjoy the same; For they do not
feed on these banckets, nor are they
nourish'd by them, but they do
onely taste of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>5. The fifth Degree of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of Gods calling is:</p>
               <p>1. An outward holiness of life
for a time, under this is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
a zeal in the profession of
Religion, 2. A reverence and fear
towards God, 3. An amendment
of life in many things, as it was in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104646:101"/>
                  <hi>Herod, Mark.</hi> 6. 20. and in <hi>Simon
Magus, Acts</hi> 3. 13.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">2. Degree of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a falling away af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> Degree of the execution of
the decree of reprobation in those
that are called by an uneffectual
calling is:</p>
               <p>A falling away again after cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
this cometh to pass after this
manner. 1. The reprobate is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by some sin. 2. His heart is
hardened by the same sin. 3. His
heart being hardened becometh
wicked, and perverse. 4. Upon this
followeth unbelief, so that he will
not consent unto Gods word,
though he heareth it, &amp; knoweth it.
5. There doth immediatly upon
this unbelief follow an Apostasie,
or a falling away from Faith in
Christ, <hi>Heb. 3. 12. 13. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
               <p>Apostasie is sometimes a sin
against the holy Ghost; The sin
against the holy Ghost is so called,
because it is done contrary to the
illumination of the holy Ghost:
It is a set, and a stubborn, obstinate
malice done knowingly, against
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104646:102"/>
God and against Christ, and that
after illumination, or enlightning
by the holy Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. It
is a general, or totall defection, and
Apostasie from God, after enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by the holy Spirit, out of meer
stubborness, and malice of heart,
<hi>Heb. 10. 29. and</hi> 6. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>It is hard to know when a man
committeth this sin, 1. because the
root of it, which is malice, lurketh
secretly in the heart, and therefore
it cannot be easily discerned. This
sin is not found in all the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
because many of them die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are enlightned by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Those that commit this sin do
never repent, and therefore can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
receive pardon.</p>
               <p>The elect cannot commit this sin,
therefore those, who do feel in
themselves a sure Testimony of
their election need never dispair.</p>
               <p>After Apostasie followeth pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the very fulness of all
iniquity, and it is altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104646:102"/>
to sanctification, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15 16.</p>
               <p>He doth not Apostatise, nor sin
against the holy Ghost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in
time of persecution doth either
rashly, or for fear deny Christ, for
<hi>Peter</hi> thus for fear did deny Christ,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 29. 73, 74, 75.</p>
               <p>He that doth ignorantly perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

not sin this sin, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 1 13. And

this, by which they do become void
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104646:103"/>
of all sorrow for their sins, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.
18. 3. There doth follow this
hardness of heart a reprobate sense,
that is, an extinguishing of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

                  </note>
it may be known whether it
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:104646:105"/>
doth come from the Spirit of God,
or from her own carnal presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thus:</p>
               <p>1. By a full perswasion which
they shall finde in themselves, for
the holy Ghost will not onely say
it, but perswade them that they are
Gods children.</p>
               <p>And the flesh can in no wise do
this.</p>
               <p>2 By the manner of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
the holy Ghost doth not
perswade men that they are elect
by reasons drawn from their own
works, or worthiness, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
drawn from the free grace,
love, and favour of God. And
this perswasion doth exceedingly
differ from that which Satan useth.</p>

or perswasion; For</p>
               <p>If this perswasion cometh from

               <p>5. By our love to Christians, to
Ministers, to Brethren, and by our
readiness to lay down our lives for
them, and with them if need so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
<hi>Matth. 10. 42 1 Joh.</hi> 3 16.</p>
               <p>6. By our earnest and fervent
calling upon God, and that with
hearty tears, in the sensible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of those sins which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to his dishonour, and therefore
may have just cause to think he
may be displeased with them.</p>
               <p>7. By a desire and love to the

of judgement, that there may be
an end of the days of sin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.

               <p>6.<note place="margin">Rule.</note> If so be that the godly finde
all these notable effects of the spirit

drawing him to himself by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

               <p>8.<note place="margin">Rule.</note> No man can certainly say of
himself, or of any other that he is

prefer those to be in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which in the sight of men
seem to be most estranged from his
favour; and above them also which
in outward appearance, and in the
judgement of men are the Children
of the Kingdom; Thus were the
Publicanes and Harlots, preferred
before the Pharisees by Christ,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 31.</p>
               <p>And many a man is called even
at the eleventh hour. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 6.</p>
               <p>A notable example of this we
have in the Thief upon the Cross;
<hi>Luke</hi> 23. 40, 43.</p>
               <p>The uses of this Doctrine for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
be these:<note place="margin">The uses of this Doctrine.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. There is no justification by
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:104646:107"/>
works, nor any works of ours that
are Meritorious.</p>
               <p>For election is by the grace of
God, and therefore justification
also.</p>
               <p>In the work of Salvation, grace
challengeth all to it self, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 5.
2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. Phil. 1. 29. Rom.</hi> 3. 24.
<hi>Tit. 3. 5. Ezek. 36. 27. Rom.</hi> 6. 23.</p>
               <p>2. Hence we learn that judicial
Astrology, or the foretelling of
what men will be by the casting of
their Nativities is false: For this
doth determine such and such men
shall be like in life and conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whom God in his predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath made unlike; As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> were born
of the same parents, and almost in
the same moment of time, and yet
they were most unlike in dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and had divers events</p>
               <p>The like we may see in all Twins
born at the same time.</p>
               <p>3. Hence we learn that God is
most wise, omnipotent, just, and
mercifull, <hi>Rom. 11. 33. Eph.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:104646:108"/>
Here we are advised, 1. to fight
against all doubtings &amp; distrust of
our Salvation, because it doth not
depend upon our works, but upon
Gods grace <hi>Luke 10. 20. Rom.</hi> 8. 33.</p>
               <p>2. To humble our Souls under
the mighty hand of God, because
we are in his hand, even as clay in
the hand of the Potter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 20.
21.</p>
               <p>3. To give all the glorie to God,
as to whom alone it is due, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>
2. 13.</p>
               <p>4. To bear crosses, or afflictions
patiently, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by this means we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to Christ, and made like
unto him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10</p>
               <p>5. To do good works, and that
because God hath created us in
Christ Jesus unto this purpose,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
               <p>To whom with the Son and holy
Spirit be all glory, honour &amp; praise,
now and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
