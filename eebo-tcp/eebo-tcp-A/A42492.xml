         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the men of this world conceived, their unbridled power brought forth, or the
Sun beheld.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as not by my aſſent, ſo neither by my ſilence muſt I have any
hand in the midwifery of ſo monſtrous productions, which ſeeme to threaten
the ruine of the King, and the ſubverting the fundamentall conſtitutions of
Parliament, Lawes, and Liberties.</p>
            <p>Next, to the betraying and killing of Chriſt, was their ſin, who either
denied, or deſerted Him.</p>

and Covenants, ſacred and civill ties will not obtaine ſo much of Loyall and
religious Subjects, as by a word or two both decently and ſeaſonably to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe,
when (as the Lord liveth) there ſeems to be but a ſtep between the
life of our Soveraign Lord the King, and ſome violent death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Me thinks I heare His Majeſty in His Agony, ſolitude, and expectation
of an enforced death, calling to me, and all other His Subjects,</hi> You that
never believed My Life was ſought after in the bottome of this Warre
but My ſafety and Honour, you that never fought for Me, yet profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to abhorre the fighting deſtinately againſt Me, or deſtroying of Me;
Cannot you, dare not you now ſpeak one word to ſave My Life, and
your own Soules? ſhall your ſilence ſeem to encourage and make up
their ſaffrages, who therefore pretend they may, and will deſtroy Me,
becauſe it pleaſeth you, and the generality of My people?</p>
            <p>For my owne part, as I hope to have communion with God in Chriſt, I dare
not have any fellowſhip with ſo foule a ſinne, as the Killing of the King, but
rather I ought to reprove it, and fairly conteſt againſt it: whatever His ſin
may be, yet I thinke Him not criminall or obnoxious to any Tribunall but
that of God, whoſe Deputation, Authority, or Commiſſion they can in no ſort
(that I ſee) produce to any ſatisfaction of religious minds, who at preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake

the KING is in their power. Whereas Gods Commiſſion warranting
ſuch an Act ought to have not onely the ſtamp and image of prevalent power
on one ſide, (which the moſt flagitious actions oft have) but alſo the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of his word, and the expreſſe ſignatures of his will, in the municipall
Lawes on the other ſide, by all which, power is derived, limited and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
to act with moderation and right couſneſſe.</p>
            <p>I beſeech God to reſtrain power, to ſoften hearts, and to fruſtrate thoſe
purpoſes, which to me ſeem to have ſo much of ſinne, Hell, and horrour; that
if I hated the Actors the moſt of any men, (which God knowes, I doe not
but love and pity them, and pray for them) I could not ſhew my hatred more
againſt them, than by wiſhing them ingaged, and ſuffering them to go on, and
thus to fill up the meaſure of their ſinnes, by deſtroying Him, for whom I
have alwaies been taught, and now moſt of all to think it my duty to cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,

concerned, yet my ſelfe and others are like to be involved in
the ſucceſſe of your actions, both as to my temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
well-fare if I either approve or diſſent. My humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
to you is, That without contracting your diſpleaſure, I
may uſe that liberty which God and Reaſon hath allowed me,
and your ſelves have not yet forbiden to me or others in this
way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94809:5"/>
Happily I might with more ſafety in ſilence tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and humbly adore the Juſtice and Power of the great
God, which he hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y your meanes, and yet may carry on
further againſt the ſins of this Nation, yet I conſider not you
only, but my ſelfe am highly reſponſible both to God and
Man, for what you doe and I ſeem to conſent unto in matters
ſo enormous, of ſo vaſt and publique influence, both to the
preſent Age and Poſteritie.</p>
            <p>You are not ignorant that Succeſſe is a great Bribe and
Snare to the Judgement, where the heart is not very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
over it ſelfe, and much in Prayer to God for his wiſedom
and Grace, which is moſt ſet forth in the uſing Succeſſes hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and honeſtly, to the advantages of Piety and Charity.</p>
            <p>Proſperous Power is loth to ſtop it ſelfe with moderate
bounds, or to ſuſpect it ſelfe, either to want or goe beyond
the line and limits of Juſtice; It is compaſſed about with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
applauders and flatterers, who eaſilie miſtake the fact it
ſelfe, or the confidence of the Agents, for the rule of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
and interpret Gods permiſſion of what may bee
very wicked and un-juſt, as his approbation and witneſſing to
their Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The rule and ſtandard of which (that is humane Juſtice)
I thinke to be fixed and immovable, either as to thoſe generall
expreſſes which are in Gods written word, or thoſe ſetled
Lawes of humane ſocieties, by which his Providence (for the
good of men) hath in wayes of publique and Nationall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
cleerely brought forth that light of common and politick
reaſon, which but dimly ſhines in mans heart, ſingly and apart,
the divine goodneſſe confining by ſuch publique and ſetled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations
thoſe exorbitant varieties to which mens private
Reaſon, Will and Power, are prone to breake forth in the
fulfilling of their particular Luſts to the injury of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and the detriment of the publique good: I confeſſe I
am not able to reſolve my ſelfe, by any thing yet ſet forth, as
to any grounds of God's or Man's Lawes, or your own ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94809:5"/>
declared Principles, ſo as in the leaſt kind to juſtify what
you formerly or lately have done, without and againſt the
minde of the two Houſes of Parliament, yet I ſee much of
Gods light in their and your darkneſſe, of his Order and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in theſe Common Confuſions.</p>
            <p>But there are many Perſons of abilities far beyond mine,
who in the point of their Priviledges are more Perſonally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to vindicate and aſſert them, againſt the impreſſions
by force upon them, who were undoubtedly the fathers and
fountaine of your Power, as Soldiers, and their Commiſſion,
the Limitter as well as Licencer of your Military Actions.</p>
            <p>What is paſt upon the Houſes, can only have ſuch a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and reparation as Providence ſhall ſee meete to grant.</p>
            <p>That which ſtrikes my Soule with the greateſt horror and
aſtoniſhment is, how to reconcile your declared purpoſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King, either with the faire opinion I deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of your Perſons, or with that common tenderneſſe and
duty which both you, and my ſelfe ought to beare toward his
Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The Juſtice you pretend to doe againſt him, ſeemes to mee
moſt queſtionable both for the matter or merit, as alſo for the
manner and forme of the doing it: Since no power, that I
know, hath; or can under Heaven, inveſt you with any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to doe what you ſeeme to intend.</p>
            <p>The Lawes of this Kingdom (I preſume your ſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
and others have evidently evinced) are fully againſt you,
giving no Subjects, in any Caſe, Judiciall power over the life
of their King, or his Soveraigntie.</p>
            <p>The Word of God (ſo farre as he hath given me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it, neither affords any Precept, nor commends any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample,
in this kinde, to your imitation, but in both is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
againſt you: you cannot be ignorant of <hi>Davids</hi> both
Conſcientious and Generous reſpect to <hi>Sauls</hi> ſafety and life,
whom he leaves to Gods Juſtice, by no uſurpation of power,
ſucceſſe, or oportunities of revenge, ſuffers himſelfe to bee
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94809:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tempted to prevent the hand of God.</p>
            <p>Never any man in the Church of God, of any name
for piety and holyneſſe, are recorded to have done any ſuch
Act of violence againſt their lawfull Kings, ſuch as ours is
confeſſed to be; never did Chriſt or his Apoſtles, by practice
or precept, give the leaſt intimation of the will of his father,
as agreeing to what you declare to bee your purpoſes; yea, I
am fully perſwaded in my Soule, that if my Saviour Jeſus
Chriſt were now living upon Earth, he would bee utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
your Councels and Actions in this point; agreeable to
whoſe moſt holy minde, doctrine and example, all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that have truly feared God, have alſo honoured their
Kings.</p>
            <p>Such hath beene the violence of pretorian Souldiers, Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
and Mamalukes, ſuch as have followed a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or a
<hi>Scilla,</hi> or a <hi>Marius,</hi> not knowing the minde of God in
Chriſt: But never of any Chriſtian Souldiers, living in the
power of Godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>So that being thus wholy deſtitute of any ſupport from
God's word or Man's Lawes, either for rule or example, to
game my approbation to what you meane to perpetrate in a
way expoſed to ſo many horrid aggravations: Truly I ſhould
thinke it not only my infinite ſinne to declare for you, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by my ſilence to betray you (in other things ſo gallant
men) as much as in mee lies, to ſo great, and almoſt unexpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a ſinne: where you being deſtitute of any cleere grounds
muſt needs ſin more againſt the cleere light which ſhines upon
you, and againſt your proceedings; ſince to your Soules, I
owe and beare a great Charity, next to the ſalvation of mine
owne.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, by my ſilence, I ſhould faile of that poore
remainder of duty which yet lies as the laſt point of my
power to expreſſe to my Soveraigne Lord and King,
being one of his Subjects, and upon whom the many

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94809:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all faire waies to promote His both Honour, and Safety.</p>
            <p>You ſeem to take the firſt and greateſt riſe, for the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of your proceedings from thoſe advantages of meere,
natural, or martiall power, which are in your hands: of which
you can have no comfort, as any token of Gods gracious and
ſpeciall favour to you, though never ſo proſperous, unleſſe
you have <hi>his feare before your eyes,</hi> which teacheth you to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine,
and depart from doing evill;</hi> by keeping the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of your Power within thoſe bounds of morall and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
good, to which God calls you by his Word, the Lawes
of the Land, and moſt particularly, by your owne derived
Commiſſion: To all which, not onely the prime ties of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to God, and Allegiance to the KING, but thoſe alſo
of Honour, Faithfulneſſe, Modeſty, and Limited Truſt from
the Parliament ſhould oblige you as men of true worth, and
ſober valour, whoſe will ſhould never be the meaſure of their
Power (as is in Pyrats and Robbers) but their Power is, and
alwaies ought to be conteined in thoſe Religious and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
bounds, wherein Godly men alwaies keep their
mortified and ſubdued wills, as DAVID did, when he had to
the perſonall injuries offer'd to him, the advantages added
both of Power and Opportunity againſt King SAUL, for that
of <hi>Samuel's</hi> ſeverity againſt AGAG, you know that neither is
the KING an <hi>Agag</hi> to you, nor you as <hi>Samuel</hi> to Him.</p>
            <p>Your next ſupport, ſeemes to be ſetled upon the Peoples
Petitioning, and ſeeming to Aſſent to what you intend to
doe; when as I am very confident, and your ſelves cannot be
ignorant of, That if Free ſuffrages, or Subſcriptions of all the
People were taken in the three Kingdomes, you would find
twenty to one againſt your Judgment, and Proceedings; and
theſe of very grave, ſober, and conſiderable men.</p>
            <p>So that I cannot in order to my owne, and others eternall
peace with God, but in all freedome (yet with all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and due reſpects) but exhibit to you, as the chief Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours
and Managers of <hi>the preſent Deſignes</hi> againſt the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94809:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
KING, this my Loyall and Religious <hi>Proteſtation againſt it,</hi>
and earneſt obteſtation of you; not to bring upon your ſouls,
and the Kingdome, (as much as in you lies) <hi>the bloud of</hi> HIS
MAJESTY, <hi>the Lords Anointed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I may at leaſt, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Aremathea,</hi> keep my ſelf
unſpotted from it, whoſe voice cannot but cry as much ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
than any other mans unjuſtly ſhed; as the bloud of <hi>Adam</hi>
would have done if <hi>Gain</hi> had ſlain him being his Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>Abel</hi> his Brother.</p>
            <p>You know the Caveat of the wiſe King SOLOMON, given
and repeated, <hi>There is a way which ſeemeth right unto a man,
but the end thereof are the waies of death,</hi> Prov. 14. ver. 12. &amp;
ch. 16. v. 25.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you therefore, in the name of God, and for the
love of Jeſus Chriſt, let not your being advanced ſo far be any
hindrance to your penitent and juſt retreat; to which I think
God calls you, as by many others worthier and abler than my

charity to your ſoules eternall good, as well as the
KING's and Kingdomes temporall welfare, may, and will
with men that have any touches of Gods Spirit in them, plead
my excuſe, for my thus preſuming to contradict your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
or intercept your Proceedings.</p>
            <p>Matters of ſo high a nature, ſhould either not be attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,
or publickly argued, with the greateſt calmneſſe, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ,
and freedome; the laſt of which, you have ſo obſtructed,
that moſt of thoſe Lords, and Gentlemen, who are as much
related to the KING, and intereſſed in the Affaires of the
Kingdome as your ſelves, are denied to uſe, or enjoy it.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you to remember what mercies you proclaime to
the world, God hath already ſhewed you, and what mercies
you may yet ſtand in need of; what pretenſions and aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Moderation and Loyalty, you ſometimes made to the
KING: O let not the World find in the event, that your
pretended mercies were intended cruelties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94809:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
After ſo long and ſo hard a reſtraint which the King hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
with ſo much patience, after ſo many Conceſſions to his
own diminutions, in order to the ſatisfaction of the <hi>Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
the <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> and the <hi>Armies</hi> Intereſt, both joynt and ſeverall:
how can you in cool bloud, without any colour of due Authority
from God or Man, deſtroy your and our King; who caſt himſelf
into His Subjects Armes, and was received with all aſſurances of
ſafety and Honour?</p>
            <p>If His Majeſty erred in His Judgement or Councell, which put
Him, as He thought, upon the neceſſary vindication of His juſt
Rights, againſt thoſe, whom He was jealous went about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
Him of them, yet can no leſſe revenge ſerve Subjects upon
their King, or Sons, towards their miſtaken Parent, then after
long and many heavy Afflictions, utterly to deſtroy Him, and
His?</p>
            <p>Forget not (as I hope you doe not) the common Errours, to
which all men are ſubject; and thoſe notorious ones, with which,
mutuall re-criminations have aſperſed both Parliament and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and with which we have all cauſe to fear, the moſt juſt Judge
of Heaven and Earth will charge the moſt preſuming Innocence
of us all.</p>
            <p>O do not ſtain the Renown of your valour by ſo mercileſſe an
Act, as the deſtroying your KING; Renowned even by ſome of
your ſelves, for the greatneſſe of His underſtanding, and many
other Princely vertues, and incomparable endowments.</p>
            <p>You are Gentlemen that pretend to walk by the rule of a good
Conſcience before God and Man; which muſt needes fail you,
when God hath not given you either any Scripturall command, or
any Magiſtratick power, over or againſt the King; nay, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

to the contrary upon you, as well as other Subjects, by no fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of the KING, or any earthly Power to be diſpenſed with.</p>
            <p>The preſage of that deluge of miſeries, likely to follow the
ruine of the KING in theſe miſerable Kingdomes, doth not ſo
much terrifie me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as thoſe ſins which have deſerved and brought
upon us, ſo vaſt Judgements. To all which, the Addition of this
both grand Sin and Judgement of deſtroying the KING; againſt
all Lawes of God and Man, of Warre and Peace, of Valour and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94809:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Honour; muſt needs become ſo far the Heavier, as it becomes the
more Nationall, by drawing with it the conſent of others.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I thought it my duty, being exempted through the
love of God, and Charity to your Soules, from that ſpirit of
Bondage, which makes too many ſervilely fear your power;
thus to endeavour as much as in me lies, to hinder the contagion
of ſo great a Sin, and ſtand in the gap, both againſt the Sin, and
enſuing Judgments: Having no other end in theſe ſudden lines,
but to witneſſe to the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> (as I conceive it) to the
Honour of the true <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> to my particular <hi>Duty,</hi>

bear to the welfare of my <hi>Country,</hi> and your own <hi>Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had rather you ſhould ſee and prevent your ſins in ſuch glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of free and fair Remonſtrances, then hear of them too late
by the <hi>Clamours, Curſes,</hi> and bitter <hi>Reproaches</hi> of others, or in
the fearfull <hi>Ecchoes</hi> of your own moſt troubled and terrified
<hi>Conſciences,</hi> and the juſt wrath of God upon <hi>You</hi> and the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I earneſtly beſeech God, the moſt wiſe and juſt diſpoſer of all
things, (whoſe executive power wicked men oft unjuſtly uſurp;
but gracious men never either invade or execute, without an

more miſerable then the KING, or any man can be, under the

further ſanctifie to Him.</p>
            <p>That great God and King will (I hope) incline your hearts to
thoſe wayes, which are clearly his will; not as to private imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,

            <p>With regard to both, which moſt clear and conſtant lights;
that which you call Juſtice againſt the KING, ſeemes to me the
