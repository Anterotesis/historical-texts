         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Cenſure (and the Execution thereof) as I dare ſay, all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
layd together, cannot bee paralled in any age of man
throughout the Christian World, and I thinke I may take in even
the World of Pagans and Heathens to it. Which, though it bee not
drawne up in ſo eloquent a ſtraine, as it was delivered &amp; deſerved,
nor all the Heavenly words and eloquent ſpeeches recorded, which
were uttered by theſe Three Worthies of the Lord, both in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Lords themſelves at their Cenſure, and alſo at the place
of Execution: Yet I earneſtly beſeech you in the bowels of Ieſus
Christ, that you doe not in the least manner under-valu the glory
and dignitie, eyther of the Perſons, or the cauſe, but rather lay
the blame upon the rudenes and meane capacity of the Compoſer,
who is an unfeyned Wel-wiſher to them. <hi>Fare well.</hi>

               <p>I had thought M. Prynne had had no eares, but me
thinkes hee hath eares, which cauſed many of the Lords
to take the ſtricter view of him; and for their better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
the Uſher of the Court was commanded to turne
up his haire, &amp; ſhew his eares: Upon the ſight wherof the
Lords were diſpleaſed they had beene formerly no more
cut off; and caſt out ſome diſgracefull words of him.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>To which M. Prynne replied; </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Pryn.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, there is

            </sp>
            <p>The Lord Keeper replied againe;</p>

               <speaker>M. Pryn.</speaker>
               <p>M. Prynne then humbly deſired the Court to give

he mooves,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that their Honours would be pleaſed to accept of

               <speaker>L. Keeper</speaker>

               <p>I hope your Honours will not refuſe it, being it is on

               <speaker>M. Pryn.</speaker>
               <p>Why then, My Lords, I have a ſecond motion, which
I humbly pray your Honours to graunt; which is, That
your Lordſhips will be pleaſed to diſmiſſe the Prelates,
here now ſitting, from having any voyce in the cenſure of
this cauſe, (being generally knowne to be Adverſaries) as
being no way agreeable with equity or reaſon that they,

               <p>In good faith, it's a ſweet motion, is't not? Herein you

            </sp>
            <p>Which was read, being very large; and theſe
five Bookes annexed thereunto (viz.) a Booke of D.

            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond, a little Booke, intituled,</hi> Newes from Ipſwich.

               <hi>The Kings Counſell (being five) tooke each of them a ſeverall Booke,

               <speaker>M. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. Attorney began firſt with D. Baſtwickes Latin
Booke, picking out here &amp; there particular concluſions,
that beſt ſerved for his owne ends, (ſo did all the other
Counſell out of the former other Bookes) to the great
abuſe of the Authors, as themſelves there immediately
complain'd, intreating them to reade the foregoing
grounds, upon which the ſaid concluſions depended,
without which they could not underſtand the true

againſt that unreprooveable Booke (as all that read it
with an honeſt and orthodox heart may clearely percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve)
ſwearing: In good faith, My Lords, there is never a
page in this Booke, but deſerves a heavier and deeper
Cenſure then this Court can lay upon him.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1168:4"/>
Next followed A. B. who in like manner deſcanted
upon the <hi>Newes from Ipſwich,</hi> charging it to be full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious
lyes, and eſpecially vindicating the honor of
<hi>Mathew Wren,</hi> Biſhop of Norwich, as being a learned,
pious, and Reverend Father of the Church.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</speaker>
               <p>In the fourth place, followes the Kings Solicitor, who
acts his part upon the Divine Tragedy; To which part of
it, concerning <hi>Gods judgements on Sabbath-breakers,</hi> he had
little to ſay, but onely put it off with a ſcoffe; ſaying, That
they ſate in the Seate of God, who judged thoſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
which fell out upon perſons ſuddainly ſtrooken, to
be the judgement of God for Sabbath breaking, or words
to the like effect: but enlarged himſelfe upon that paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
which reflected upon that late Reverend (as he termed
him) and learned Profeſſor of the Law, and his Majeſties
faithfull Servant M. William Noy, his Majeſties late At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney,
who (as hee ſaid) was moſt ſhamefully abuſed
by a ſlaunder layd upon him; which was, That it ſhould
be reported, <hi>That Gods judgement fell upon him for ſo eagerly
proſecuting that innocent perſon M. Prynne;</hi> which judgement
was this; That he, laughing at M. Prynne, while hee was
ſuffering upon the Pillory, was ſtrooke with an iſſue of
blood in his privy part, which by all the art of man could
never bee ſtopped unto the day of his death, which was
ſoone after. But the truth of this my Lords (ſaith he) you
ſhall finde to be as probable as the reſt; for we have here
three or foure Gentlemen of good credit and ranke, to
teſtify upon oath, that hee had that iſſue long before, and
thereupon made a ſhew, as if he would call for them in
before the Lords, to witneſſe the truth thereof, with theſe
particular words, <hi>Make roome for the Gentlemen to come in there,</hi>

               <p>My Honourable good Lords, ſuch a day of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
there came a <hi>Subpoena</hi> from your Honours, to enter
my appearance in this Court; which being entred, too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
forth a copy of the Information, which being taken,
I was to draw my Anſwere, which I endeavoured to
doe, but being ſhut up cloſe priſoner, I was deſerted
of all meanes, by which I ſhould have done it; for I was
no ſooner ſerved with the <hi>Subpoena,</hi> but I was ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhut up cloſe priſoner, with ſuſpention of Pen, Inke
and Paper; which cloſe impriſonment did eat up ſuch a
deale of my time, that I was hindred the bringing in of
my Anſwer. You did aſſigne me Counſell, 'tis true,
but they neglected to come to me, and I could not come
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1168:5"/>
to them, being under lock and key. Then upon motion
in Court, yee gaue me liberty to goe to them; but then
preſently after that motion (I know not for what cauſe,
nor upon whoſe commaund) I was ſhut up againe: and
then I could not compell my Counſell to come to me, &amp;
my time was ſhort, and I had neither Pen nor Incke, nor
Servant to do any thing for me, for my Servant was then
alſo kept cloſe priſoner under a Purſevants hands; This
was to put impoſſibilities upon mee. Then upon a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
motion for Pen &amp; Inke (which was graunted me)
I drew up ſome Inſtructions, &amp; in a fortnight time ſent
40. ſheetes to my Councell; ſuddainly after I drew up
40. ſheetes more, and ſent to them; My Lord, I did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but by the adviſe of my Counſell, by whom I was
ruled in the drawing up of all my anſwer, and payd him
twice for drawing it, and ſome of my Counſell would
have ſet their hands to it. Here is my Anſwer, I tender
it upon my oath, which your Lordſhips cannot deny
with the Iuſtice of the Court.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</speaker>
               <p>Wee can give you a Preſident, that this Court hath
proceeded &amp; undertaken a cauſe <hi>pro confeſſo</hi> for not put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in an Anſweare in ſix dayes; you have had a great
deale of favour ſhewed in affording you longer time,
&amp; therefore the Court is free from all calumny or aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
for rejecting your Anſwer, not ſigned with the
Counſels hands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Pryn.</speaker>
               <p>But one word or two (my Lords) I deſire your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to heare me; I put a caſe in Law, that is often plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
before your Lordſhips, <hi>One man is bound to bring in two
witneſſes,</hi> if both, or one of them faile, that hee cannot
bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in, doth the Law (my Lords) make it the mans
act? You aſſigned me <hi>two Counſellors;</hi> one of them fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
I cannot compell him; Here now he is before you,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1168:5"/>
let him ſpeake, if I have not uſed all my endeavours to
have had him ſigned it (which my other Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell would
haue done, if this would haue ſet his hand to it with
him) and to have put in long ſince.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Counſell.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, there was ſo long time ſpent ere I could
doe any thing; after I was aſſigned his Councell, that it
was impoſſible his Anſwere could bee drawne up in ſo
ſhort a time as was allotted; for after long expectation,
ſeeing he came not to me, I went to him, where I found
him ſhut up cloſe priſoner, ſo that I could not have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
to him: Whereupon I motioned to the Lieftenant
of the Tower, to have free libertie of ſpeech with him
concerning his aunſwear; which being graunted mee, I
found him very willing &amp; deſirous to have it drawne up;
whereupon I did moove in the Court for Pen and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
which was graunted, the which hee no ſooner had
gotten, but hee ſet himſelfe to draw up Inſtructions, and
in a ſhort time, ſent me 40 ſheetes; and ſoone after I
received 40 more; but I found the Anſwer ſo long,
of ſuch a nature, that I durſt not ſet my hand to it, for
feare of giving your Honours diſtaſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Pryn.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, I did nothing, but according to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of my Counſell, only I ſpake mine owne words,
my anſwear was drawne up by his conſent, it was his
owne act, and hee did approove of it; and if he will
be ſo baſe à Coward, to doe that in private which he
dares not acknowledge in publick, I will not ſuch a ſin
lye on my conſcience, let it reſt with him. Here is my
Anſwer, which, though it be not ſigned with their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,
yet here I tender it upon my oath, which you cannot
in Iuſtice deny.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Keeper.</speaker>
               <p>But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Prynne, the Court deſires no ſuch long An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
Are you guilty or not guilty?</p>

               <p>My good Lord, I am to Anſwer in a defenſive way, Is
here any one, that can witnes any thing againſt me? Let
him come in. The Law of God ſtandeth thus; that a
man is not to be condemned, but under the mouth of
two or three witneſſes. Here is no witneſſe comes in
againſt me, my Lord, neither is there in all the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
one clauſe that doth particularly fall on me, but
onely in generall, there is no Booke laid to my charge.
And ſhall I be condemned for a particular act, when no
accuſation of any particular act can bee brought againſt
mee? This were moſt unjuſt and wicked. Here I tender
my aunſwere to the Information upon my oath; My
Lord, you did impoſe impoſſibilities upon me, I could
doe no more then I was able.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>My Honorable Lords, Mee thinks you looke like an

called the Sonnes of God: And ſince I have compared
you to Gods, give me leave a little to paralell the one

God and you doth hold in this noble and righteous

or execute judgement, he would firſt come downe,
and ſee whether the crime was altogether according to
the cry that was come up. And with whom doth the
Lord conſult, when he came downe? With his Servant
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and hee gives the reaſon; <hi>for I know</hi> (ſaith hee)
<hi>that Abraham will commaund his children &amp; houſehold after
him, that they ſhall keepe the way of the Lord to doe Iuſtice &amp;
Iudgment.</hi> My good Lords, thus ſtands the caſe between
your Honours and us this day; there is a great cry come
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1168:6"/>
up into your eares againſt us from the Kings Attourney;
bee novv pleaſed to deſcend and ſee if the crime be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

Lords; give us leave to ſpeake in our owne defence; wee
are not conſcious to our ſelves, of any thing we have
done that deſerves a Cenſure this day in this Honourable
Court, but that vve have ever laboured to maintaine the
Honour, Dignity, &amp; Prerogative Royall of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Lord the King, let my Lord the King live for ever.
Had I a thouſands lives, I ſhould thinke them all too little
to ſpend for the maintenance of his Majeſties Royall

before you know my cauſe? I dare undertake, that
ſcarce any one of your Lordſhips have read my Bookes;
And can you then Cenſure me for what you know not,
and before I have made my defence? O my Noble
Lords! is this righteous judgement? This were againſt
the Law of God and Man, to condemne a Man, before
you know his crime. The Governour before whom S.
Paul was carried (who was a very Heathen) would firſt
heare his cauſe before he would paſſe any Cenſure upon
him; And doth it beſeeme ſo Noble and Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly

are ſome honourable Lords in this Court, that have beene
forced out as combatants in a ſingle duell, it is betweene
the Prelates and us, at this time as betweene two that
have appointed the field. The one being a coward goes
to the Magiſtrate, &amp; by vertue of his Authority diſarmes
the other of his weapons, &amp; gives him a Bullruſh, and then
challenges him to fight. If this be not baſe cowardice, I
know not what belongs to a Souldier. This is the caſe
betweene the Prelates and us, they take away our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
(our Anſwers) by vertue of your Authority, by
which we ſhould defend our ſelves, and yet they bid us
fight. My Lord, doth not his ſavour of a baſe cowardly
ſpirit? I know, my Lord, there is a Decree gone forth, for
my Sentence vvas paſſed long ſince, to cut of our eares.</p>

O my Noble Lords? is this righteous judgement? I may
ſay, as the Apoſtle once ſaid, <hi>What, whipp a Roman?</hi> I have
beene a Souldier, able to lead an Army into the field, to
fight valiantly for the honour of their Prince; Now I am
a Phyſitian, able to cure Nobles, Kings, Princes, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors:
And to curtolize a Romans eares, like a Curre, O
my honourable Lords! is it not too baſe an act for ſo noble
an aſſembly, and for ſo righteous and honourable a cauſe?
The cauſe my Lords is great, it concernes the glory of
God, the honour of our King, whoſe Prerogative we
labour to maintaine and to ſet up in a high manner, in
which your Honours Liberties are engag'd: And doth
not ſuch a cauſe deſerve your Lordſhips conſideration,
before you proceed to Cenſure? Your Honours may be
pleaſed to conſider, that in the laſt cauſe heard and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in this Court, between S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Iames Bagge, &amp; the Lord
Moone, wherein your Lordſhips tooke a great deale of
paines, with a great deale of patience, to heare the Bills
on both ſides, with all the Anſwers &amp; Depoſitions largely
laid open before you; which cauſe when you had fully
heard, ſome of your Honours now ſitting in Court, ſaid,
You could not in conſcience proceed to Cenſure, till
you had taken ſome time to recollect your ſelves. If in a
cauſe of that nature, you could ſpend ſo much time, and
afterwards recollect your ſelves before you would paſſe
Cenſure: How much more ſhould it moove your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
to take ſome time in a cauſe wherein the glory of
God, the Prerogative of his Majeſtie your Honours dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

good Lords, it may fall out to be any of your Lordſhips
caſes to ſtand as Delinquents at this Barre, as we now doe:
It is not unknowne to your Honours, the next cauſe that
is to ſucceed ours, is touching a perſon that ſometimes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1168:8"/>
hath beene in greateſt power in this Court: And if the
mutations and revolutions of perſons and times be ſuch,
then I doe moſt humbly beſeech your Honours to looke

prevaile with your Honours, to peruſe my Bookes; and
heare my Anſwer read, which here I tender upon the

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</speaker>
               <p>In my judgement, and as I can proove it, it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rayling not ſcandalous; I conceive that a Miniſter
hath a larger liberty then alwayes to goe in a milde
ſtraine: being the Paſtor of my people, whom I had in
charge, and was to inſtruct, I ſuppoſed it was my duety
to informe them of thoſe innovations that are crept into
the Church, as likewiſe of the danger and ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of them: As for my anſwer, yee blotted out
what yee would, and then the reſt which made beſt for
your owne ends, you would have to ſtand; And now for
your owne turnes and renounce the reſt, were to deſert
my cauſe, which before I will doe, or deſert my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

at Weſtminſter, the <hi>30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</hi> day of Iune laſt 1637. at the ſpectation
whereof the number of people was ſo great (the place being very large) that
it cauſed admiration in all that beheld them; who came with tender affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to behold thoſe three renowned Souldiers and Servants of Ieſus
Chriſt, who came with moſt undaunted and magnanimous courage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
having their way ſtrawed with ſweet hearbes from the houſe out of
which they came to the Pillary, with all the honour that could bee done
unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dr. Baſtwijcke</hi> and <hi>Mr. Burton</hi> firſt meeting, they did cloſe one in the
others armes three times, with as much expreſſions of love as might bee,
rejoycing that they met at ſuch a place, upon ſuch an occaſion, &amp; that
God had ſo highly honoured them, as to call them forth to ſuffer for his
glorious Truth.</p>
               <p>Then immediately after, <hi>M. Prynne</hi> came, the D. and hee ſaluting
each other, as <hi>M. Burton</hi> and hee did before. The D. then went up firſt
on the Scaffold, and his wife immediately following, came up to him, and
like a loving Spouſe ſaluted each care with a kiſſe, and then his mouth;
whoſe tender love, boldnes, and cheerefullnes ſo wrought upon the peoples
affections, that they gave marvailous great ſhowte for joy, to behold it.
Her Huſband deſired her not to bee in the leaſt maner diſmay'd at his
ſuffrings: And ſo for a while they parted, ſhe uſing theſe words: Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
my Deereſt, be of good comfort, I am nothing diſmay'd. And then
the D. began to ſpeake theſe words.</p>
               <p>There are many that are this day Spectators of our ſtanding here,<note place="margin">D. Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wijcke.</note> as
Delinquents, though not Delinquents, we bleſſe God for it. I am not
conſcious to my ſelf wherein I have committed the leaſt treſpaſſe (to take
this outward ſhame) either againſt my God, or my King. And I doe the
rather ſpeake it, that you, that are now beholders, may take notice, how
farre innocency will preſerve you in ſuch a day as this is; for wee come
here in the ſtrength of our God, who hath mightily ſupported us, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
our hearts with greater comfort then our ſhame or contempt can bee.
The firſt occaſion of my trouble was by the Prelates, for writing a Booke
againſt the Pope, and the Pope of Canterbury ſayd I wrote againſt him:
and therefore queſtioned me: But if the Preſſes were as open to us, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they have been, we would ſhatter his Kingdom about his eares: But
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1168:10"/>
bee ye not deterred by their power, neither bee affrighted at our ſufferings;
Let none determine to turne from the wayes of the Lord, but goe on, fight
couragiouſly againſt Gog &amp; Magog. I know there be many here who have
ſet many dayes apart for our behalfe, (let the Prelates take notice of it)
and they have ſent up ſtrong prayers to heaven for us, we feele the ſtrength
and benefit of them at this time; I would have you to take notice of it;
we have felt the ſtrength &amp; benefit of your prayers all along this cauſe. In
a word, ſo farre I am from baſe feare, or caring for any thing that they
can do, or cast upon me, that, had <hi>I</hi> as much blood as would ſwell the
Theames, I would ſhedd it every droppe in this cauſe, therefore be not
any of you diſcouraged, be not daunted on their power, ever labouring to
preſerve Innocency, &amp; keep peace within, goe on in the ſtrength of your
God, and hee will never fayle you in ſuch a day as this; As I ſayd before,
ſo I ſay againe; Had I as many lives as I have heires on my head, or
droppe of blood in my veines, I would give them up all for this cauſe; this
plot of ſending us to thoſe remote places, was firſt conſulted and agitated
by the Jeſuites, as I can make it plainly appeare. O ſee, what times we
are fallen into, that the Lords must ſit to act the Ieſuites plots! For our
owne parts, wee owe no mallice to the perſons of any of the Prelats, but
would lay our necks under their feet to doe them good as they are men, but
against the uſurpation of their power, as they are Biſhops, we doe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
our ſelves enemies till doomes day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Prynne ſhaking the Dr. by the hand, deſired him that hee
might ſpeake a word or two. With all my heart, ſayd the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Te cauſe (ſayd Mr. Prynne) of my ſtanding here, is, for not bringing
in my Anſwer, for which my cauſe is taken <hi>pro confeſſo</hi> againſt mee.
What endeavours J uſed for the bringing in thereof, that, God and my
owne conſcience, and my Counſell knowes, whoſe cowardiſe ſtands upon
Record to all ages. For rather then J will have my cauſe a leading cauſe, to
deprive the ſubjects of that libertie which J ſeek to maintaine, J rather
expoſe my perſon to a leading example, to beare this puniſhment: And J
beſeech you all to take notice of their proceedings in this cauſe, when J
was ſerved with a <hi>Subpoena</hi> into this Court, J was ſhut up cloſe priſoner,
that J could have no acceſſe to Counſell, nor admitted pen, inke or paper
to draw up my anſwere by my Jnſtructions, for which J feed them twice
(though to no purpoſe) yet when all was done, my Anſwer would not be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1168:11"/>
accepted into the Court, though I tendered it upon my oath. <hi>I</hi> appeale to
all the world, if this were a legall or juſt proceeding. Our accuſation is in
point of Libell (but ſuppoſedly) againſt the Prelates: to cleere this now,
<hi>I</hi> will give you a little light what the Law is in point of Libell (of which
profeſſion <hi>I</hi> have ſometimes beene, and ſtill profeſſe my ſelfe to have ſome
knowledge in) you ſhall finde in caſe of Libell, tvvo ſtatutes: The one,
in the ſecond of Queene Mary; The other, in the ſeventh of Queene
Elizabeth. That in the ſecond of Queene Mary, the extremity and
heighth of it runs thus: That, if a Libeller doth goe ſo farre and ſo high
as to Libel againſt King or Queene, by denomination, the high and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of the Law is, that they lay no greater fine on him then an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds, vvith a moneths impriſonment, And no corporall Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
except hee doe refuſe to pay his fine; and then to inflict ſome
puniſhment in lievve of that fine, at the moneths end. Neither was this
Cenſure to be paſſed on him, except it vvere fully prooved by tvvo vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
vvho vvere to produce a certificat of their good demeanor for the
credit of their report, or elſe confeſſed by the Libeller. You ſhall finde
in that Statute 7. Eliz. ſome further addition to the former of 2. Marie,
and that onely in point of fine &amp; puniſhment, and it muſt ſtill reach as
high as the perſon of King or Queen. Here this ſtatute doth ſet a fine of
two hundred pounds; the other, but one: This ſets three moneths empri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment;
the former but one: So that therein onely they differ. But in this
they both agree, namely, at the end of his impriſonment to pay his fine, and
ſoo to goe free vvithout any further queſtion: But if hee refuſe to pay his
fine, then the Court is to inflict ſome puniſhment on him correſpondent to
his fine. Novv, ſee the diſparity between thoſe times of theirs, and ours.
A libeller in Queen Maries time, vvas fined but an hundred pounds, in
Queen Elizabeth time tvvo hundred; In Queen Maries daeys but a
moneths impriſonment; In Queen Elizabeths three moneths; and not
ſo great a fine, if they libelled not againſt King or Queen. Formerly the
greatest fine vvas but tvvo hundred pounds, though against King or
Queen; Novv five thouſand pounds, though but against the Prelates, &amp;
that but ſuppoſedly, vvhich cannot be prooved: Formerly, but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
impriſonment; Novv perpetuall impriſonment: Then, upon pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fine, no corporall puniſhment vvas to be inflicted; But novv, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
puniſhment, vvith the loſſe of blood, and all other circumſtances
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1168:11"/>
that may aggravate it. See novv vvhat times vve are fallen into, vvhen
that Libelling (if it vvere ſo) againſt Prelates onely, ſhall fall higer, then
if it touched Kings and Princes?</p>
               <p>That vvhich <hi>I</hi> have to ſpeake of next, is this: The Prelates finde
themſelves exceedingly agrieved and vexed against vvhat vve have
vvritten concerning the uſurpation of their calling, vvhere indeed vve de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their calling not to be <hi>Iure divino. I</hi> make no doubt, but there are
ſome Intelligencers or Abbertors vvithin the hearing, vvhom <hi>I</hi> vvould
have vvell knovv and take notice of vvhat <hi>I</hi> novv ſay. <hi>I</hi> here in this
place make this offer to them: That, if I may be admitted a faire diſpute,
on faire termes, for my cauſe, that <hi>I</hi> vvill maintaine, and doe here make
the challenge against all the Prelates in the Kings Dominions, and
againſt all the Prelates in Chriſtendome, (let them take in the Pope, and
all to help them) that their calling is not <hi>Iure Divino. I</hi> will ſpeake it
againe; <hi>I</hi> make the challenge, againſt all the Prelates in the Kings
Dominions, and all Christendome to maintaine, that their calling is
not <hi>Iure Divino.</hi> If I make it not good, let mee bee hanged up at the
Hall-Gate: Where upon the people gave a great ſhout.</p>
               <p>The next thing that <hi>I</hi> am to ſpeake of, is this: The Prelates find
themſelves exceedingly agrieved and vext against vvhat I have vvritten
in point of Lavv, concerning their Writs and Proces, That the ſending
forth of Writs and Proces in their ovvne name, is against all Lavv and
Iuſtice, and doth entrench on his Majesties Prerogative Royall, and the
Subjects Liberties. And here novv <hi>I</hi> make a ſecond challenge againſt al the
Lavvyers in the Kingdom in way of fayre Diſpute, That <hi>I</hi> vvill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
the Prelates ſending forth of Writs and Proces in their ovvne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
to be against all Lavv and Iustice, and entrencheth on his Majesties
prerogative Royall, and ſubjects Liberty. Lest it ſhould bee forgotten, <hi>I</hi>
ſpeake it again, <hi>I</hi> here challenge all the vvhole Society of the Lavv upon
a fayre diſpute, to maintaine, that the ſending forth of Writs and Proces in
the Prelates ovvne names, to be against all Lavv and Iustice, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trencheth
on the Kings Prerogative Royall, &amp; the Subjects Liberty. If <hi>I</hi>
bee not able to make it good, let mee bee put to the tormentingest death
they can deviſe.</p>
               <p>Wee praiſe the Lord, vvee feare none but God and the King: Had
vvee reſpected our Liberties vvee had not ſtood here at this time: it vvas
for the generall good and Liberties of you all, that vve have now thus farre
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1168:12"/>
engaged our ovvn Liberties in his cauſe. For did you know, how deeply
they have entrenched on your Liberties in point of Popery; If you knew
but into what times you are caſt, it would make you looke about you: and
if you did but ſee what changes and revolutions of perſons, cauſes and
actions, have beene made by one man, you would more narrowly looke
into your priviledges, and ſee how farre your Liberty did lawfully extend
and ſo maintaine it.</p>
               <p>This is the ſecond time that I have beene brought to this place who hath
beene the Author of it, <hi>I</hi> thinke you all well know: For the firſt time, if I
could have had leave given me, <hi>I</hi> could eaſily have cleered my ſelfe of
that vvhich was then laid to my charge: As alſo <hi>I</hi> could have done now,
if I might have been permitted to ſpeake. That booke for vvhich <hi>I</hi> ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

<hi>I</hi> quoted out of Gods vvord, and ancient Fathers, for vvhich notvvithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

men exempted from ſuffering: Here is a <hi>Reverend Divine</hi> for the ſoule,
a <hi>Phiſition</hi> for the Body, and a <hi>Lawyer</hi> for the Eſtate: <hi>I</hi> had thought
they vvould have let alone their ovvne Society, and not have meddled vvith
any of them. And the next (for ought I knovv) may bee a Biſhop. You
ſee they ſpare none of vvhat ſociety or calling ſoever, none are exemted
that croſſe their ovvne ends. Gentlemen, looke to your ſelves; If all the
Martyrs that ſuffered in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> dayes, are accounted and called
<hi>Schiſmaticall hereticks, and Factious Fellowes:</hi> What ſhall vve looke
for? Yet ſo they are called in a Booke lately come forth under Authority.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1168:12"/>
And ſuch Factious Fellovves are vvee, for diſcovering a Plot of Popery.
Alas poore England! vvhat vvill become of thee, if thou looke not the
ſooner into thine ovvne Priviledges, and maintaineſt not thine ovvne
lavvfull Liberty? Chriſtian people: <hi>I</hi> beſeech you all, ſtand firme, and

               <head>Mr. Burtons heavenly and moſt comfortable Speech, which he
made at the time of his fuffering, both before and while he ſtood in the Pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which was ſomething diſtant from the other double Pillary, wherein Dr.
Baſtwicke and Mr. Prynne ſtood.</head>
               <p>THE night before his ſuffering, about eyght a clock, when he
firſt had certaine notice thereof, upon occaſion of his Wives
going to aſke the Warden, whither her Huſband ſhould ſuffer the
next day, immediately he felt his ſpirits to be rayſed to a farre hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher
pitch of reſolution and courage to undergoe his ſufferings,
then formerly he did, ſo as he intreated the Lord to hold up his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
at that heigth all the next day in his ſufferings, that he might
not flagg nor faint, leaſt any diſhonour might come to his Majeſtie
or the cauſe: And the Lord heard him: For all the next day in his
ſuffering (both before and after) his ſpirits were carried aloft as it
were upon Eagles wings (as himſelfe ſaid) farre above all appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of ſhame or paine.</p>
               <p>The next morning (being the day of his ſufferings) hee was
brought to Weſtminſter, and with much cheerefullnes beeing
brought into the Pallace-yard unto a Chamber that looked into
the Yard, where he viewed three Pillaries there ſet up: Me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
(ſaid hee) I ſee Mount Calvery, where the three Croſſes (one
for Chriſt, and the other two for the two theeves) were pitched:
And if Chriſt were numbred among theeves, ſhall a Chriſtian (for
Chriſts cauſe) thinke much to be numbred among Rogues, ſuch as
wee are condemned to be? Surely, if I be a Rogue, I am Chriſts
Rogue, and no mans. And a little after, looking out at the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
toward the Pillary, hee ſayd: I ſee no difference betweene
looking out of this ſquare window, and yonder round hole poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards the Pillary) hee ſaid: It is no matter of difference, to
an honeſt man. And a little after that, looking ſome what wiſhly
upon his Wife, to ſee how ſhee did take it; ſhee ſeemed to him to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1168:13"/>
be ſomething ſadd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom hee thus ſpake: Wiſe, why art thou
ſo ſadd? To whom ſhee made anſwer; Sweet heart, I am not ſadd:
No, ſaid hee? See thou be not, for I would not have thee to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the day, by ſhedding one teare, or fetching one ſigh: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
therefore thy comfort, my triumphant Chariot on the which
I muſt ride for the honour of my Lord &amp; Maſter: And never was
wedding day ſo welcome and joy full a day, as this day is; and ſo
much the more, becauſe I have ſuch a noble Captaine and Leader,
who hath gone before mee with ſuch undauntednes of Spirit, that
hee ſayth of himſelfe, I gave my backe to the ſmiters, my cheekes
to the nippers, they pluckt off the haire, I hidd not my face, from
ſhame and ſpitting, for the Lord God will helpe mee; therefore
ſhall I not be confounded, therefore have I ſet my face like a flint,
and I know I ſhall not be aſhamed. At length being carried toward
the Pillary, hee met D. Baſtwicke at the foot of the pillary; where
they lovingly ſaluted and embraced each other; and parting a little
from him, hee returned (ſuch was the ardency of his affection) and
moſt affectionately embraced him the ſecond time, being heartily
ſorry hee miſſed Mr. Prynne, who was not yet come before hee
was gonne up to his Pillary, which ſtood alone next the Starre-Chamber,
and about halfe a ſtones caſt from the other double
Pillary, wherein the other two ſtood: ſo as all their faces looked
Southward, the bright Sun all the while for the ſpace of two ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
ſhining upon them: Being ready to be put into the Pillary
ſtanding upon the Scaffold, he ſpied Mr. Prynne new come to the
Pillary, &amp; Dr. Baſtwicke in the Pillary, who then haſted of his
band, &amp; called for a Handkercher, ſaying: What, ſhall I be laſt? or
ſhall I be aſhamed of a Pillary for Chriſts, who was not aſhamed of a
Croſſe for mee? Then being put into the Pillary, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ſayd: Good
people, I am brought hither to be a ſpectacle to the world, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and men. And howſoever I ſtand here to undergoe the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of a Rogue, yet except to bee a faithfull ſervant to
Chriſt, &amp; a loyall Subject to the King, be the property of a rogue,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1168:14"/>
I am no Rogue. But yet if to bee Chriſts faithfull Servant, and the
Kings loyall Subject, deſerve the puniſhment of a Rogue, I glory
in it, and I bleſſe my God, my conſcience is cleare, &amp; is not ſtained
with the guilt of any ſuch crime, as I have beene charged with,
though otherwiſe I confeſſe my ſelfe to be a man ſubject to many
frailties &amp; humane infirmities. Indeed, that Booke intiteled, <hi>An
Apology of an Appeale with ſundry Epiſtles, and two Sermons, for God and
the King,</hi> charged againſt me in the Information, I have, and doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
(the miſprinting excepted) to be mine, and will by
Gods grace never diſclaime it whilſt I have breath within mee. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
while, hee having a Noſegay in his hand, a Bee came and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
on the Noſegay, &amp; began to ſuck the flowers very ſavourly,
which hee beholding and well obſerving, ſaid: Doe yee not ſee
this poore Bee? She hath found out this very place to ſuck ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
from Chriſt. The Bee ſucking all this while, and ſo tooke her
flight. By and by, hee tooke occaſion from the ſhining of the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
to ſay: You ſee how the Sunne ſhines upon us, but that ſhines
as well upon the evill as the good, upon the juſt and unjuſt, but
that the Sonne of righteouſnes (Ieſus Chriſt, who hath healing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his wings) ſhines upon the ſoules and conſciences of every
true beleever onely, and no clowd can hide him from us, to make
him aſhamed of us, no not of our moſt ſhamefull ſufferings for
his ſake: And why ſhould wee be aſhamed to ſuffer for his ſake
who hath ſuffered for us? All our ſufferings be but fleabitings to
that bee endured, hee endured the Croſſe, and deſpiſed the
ſhame, and is ſet on the right hand of God: Hee is a moſt
excellent patterne for us to looke upon, that, treading his ſtepps,
and ſuffering with him, wee may bee glorified with him.
And what can wee ſuffer, wherein hee hath not gone before
us, even in the ſame kinde? Was hee not degraded, when
they ſcornefully put on him a purple Robe, a Reede into his
hand, a thorny Crowne upon his head, ſaluting him with <hi>Hayle
King of the Iewes;</hi> and ſo diſrobed him againe? was not hee depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1168:14"/>
when they ſmote the Shepherd, and the Sheepe were ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?
Was not violence offered to his ſacred perſon, when hee was
buffited, and ſcourged, his hands and his feet pierced, his head
pricked with thornes, his ſide goared with a Speare, &amp;c.? Was
not the Croſſe more ſhamefull, yea and more painfull then a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary?
Was not hee ſtript of all he had, when he was left ſtarke
naked upon the Croſſe, the Souldiers dividing his garments, and
caſting lots upon his veſture? And was hee not confin'd to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
cloſe impriſonment in mans imagination, when his body was
layd in a Tombe, and the Tombe ſealed, leaſt hee ſhould breake
priſon, or his Diſciples ſteale him away? And yet did hee not riſe
againe, and thereby brought deliverance and victory to us all, ſo as
we are more then Conquerors through him that loved us? Here
then we have an excellent Patterne indeed. And all this hee utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
(and whatſoever elſe hee ſpake) with marvailous alacrity.</p>
               <p>One ſayd unto Mr. Burton, Chriſt will not be aſhamed of you
at the laſt day. Hee replied, Hee knew whom he had beleeved, and
that Chriſt was able to keep that he had committed to him againſt
that day. One aſked him how hee did? Hee ſaid, never better, I
bleſſe God, who hath accounted mee worthy thus to ſuffer. The
Keeper, keeping of the people from preſſing neere the Pillary; hee
ſayd, Let them come and ſpare not, that they may learne to ſuffer.
This ſame Keeper, being weary, and ſitting him downe, aſked Mr.
Burton, if he were well, and bad him be of good comfort. To
whom hee replied, Are you well? If you be well, I am much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
and full of comfort, I bleſſe God. Some aſked him, if the Pillary
were not uneaſy for his neck and ſhoulders. Hee anſwered: How
can Chriſts yoake be uneaſy? This is Chriſts yoake, and he beares
the heavier end of it, and I the lighter, &amp; if mine were too heavy,
hee would beare that too. O good people! Chriſt is a good and
ſweet Maſter, &amp; worth the ſuffering for! And if the world did but
know his goodnes, &amp; had taſted of his ſweetnes, all would come
and be his ſervants; and did they but know what a bleſſed thing it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1168:15"/>
were to beare his yoake, O! who would not beare it?</p>
               <p>The Keeper going about to eaſe the Pillarie, by putting a ſtone
or a bricke-batt betweene, Mr. Burton ſayd, Trouble not your
ſelfe, I am at very good eaſe, and feele no wearines at all. And
eſpying a young man at the foote of the Pillary, and perceyving
him to looke pale on him: Hee ſaid, Sonne, Sonne, what is the
matter you looke ſo pale? I have as much comfort as my heart can
hold, and if I had need of more, I ſhould have it. One aſked him
a while after, if he would drinke ſome <hi>aqua vitae.</hi> To whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
that he needed it not; for I have, ſayd he, (laying his hand
upon his breaſt) the true water of life, which, like a well doth
ſpring up to eternall life. Pawſing a while, he ſayd with a moſt
cheereful, &amp; grave countenance, I was never in ſuch a Pulpit befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
but little doe ye know (ſpeaking to them that ſtood about him)
what fruits God is able to produce from this drye tree; They
looking ſtedfaſtly upon him, hee ſayd, Marke my words, and
remember them well, I ſay, Little doe you know, what fruites
God is able to produce from this dry tree: I ſay, remember it
well, for this day will never be forgotten; and through theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
(poynting to the Pillary) God can bring light to his Church.
The Keeper going about againe to mend the Pillary, he ſayd: Doe
not trouble your ſelfe ſo much: But indeed we are the troublers
of the world. By &amp; by after, ſome of them offering him a cup of
wine; He thanked them, telling them, he had the wine of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
within him, &amp; the joyes of Chriſt in poſſeſſion, which the
world could not take away from him, neither could it give them
unto him. Then he looked towards the other Pillary, and making
a ſigne with his hand, cheerefull called to Dr. Baſtwicke, and Mr.
Prynne, aſking them, how they did? Who anſwered, Very well.
A woman ſaid unto him, Sir, every Chriſtian is not worthy this
Honour, which the Lord hath caſt upon you this day. Alas (ſaid
he) who is worthy of the leaſt mercy? But it is his gracious favour
&amp; free gift, to account us worthy in the behalf of Chriſt to ſuffer
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1168:15"/>
any thing for his ſake. Another woman ſaid, There are many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
which by Gods aſſiſtance wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d willingly ſuffer, for the
cauſe you ſuffer for this day. To whom he ſaid, Chriſt exalts all of
us that are ready to ſuffer afflictions for his Name with meeknes
&amp; patience: But Chriſts military diſcipline in the uſe of his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
warfare in point of ſuffering, is quite forgotten, and we have
in a manner loſt the power of religion, in not denying our ſelves,
and following Chriſt as well in ſufferings as in doing. After a while
Mr. Burton calling to one of his friends for a Handkercher, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it againe, ſaying: It is hott, but Chriſt bore the burthen in
the heate of the day; Let us alwayes labour to approove our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
to God in all things, and unto Chriſt, for therein ſtands our
happines, come of it what will in this world.</p>
               <p>A Chriſtian friend ſayd to Mr. Burton, The Lord ſtrengthen
you. To whom hee replied, I thanke you, and I bleſſe his name
hee ſtrengthens. For though I am a poore ſinfull wretch, yet I
bleſſe God for my innocent conſcience in any ſuch crime as is laid
againſt mee; and were not my cauſe good, and my conſcience
ſound, I could not enjoy ſo much unſpeakeable comfort in this
my ſufferings as I doe: I bleſſe my God. Miſtris Burton ſends
commendation to him by a friend: Hee returned the like to her,
ſaying, Commend my love to my wife, and tell her, I am hartely
cheerefull, and bidd her remember what I ſayd to her in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
namely, That ſhe ſhould not blemiſh the glory of this day with
one teare, or ſo much as one ſigh. She returned anſwer, that ſhee
was glad to heare him ſo cheerefull; and that ſhee was more chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull
of this day, then of her wedding day. This Anſwere excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
rejoyced his heart, who thereupon bleſſed God for her,
and ſayd of her, Shee is but a young Souldier of Chriſts, but ſhee
hath already endured many a ſharp brunt, but the Lord will
ſtrengthen her unto the end: And hee having on a payre of new
gloves, ſhewed them to his friends there about him, ſaying: My
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1168:16"/>
wife yeſterday of her owne accord bought me theſe wedding glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
for this is my wedding day.</p>
               <p>Many friends ſpake comfortable to Mr. Burton, and hee againe
ſpake as comfortably to them, ſaying: I bleſſe my God, that called
me forth to ſuffer this day. One ſaid to him, Sr. by this (Sermon)
your ſuffering God may convert many unto him. Hee anſwered:
God is able to doe it indeed. And then he called againe to Dr.
Baſtwicke and Mr. Prynne aſking them how they did? Who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
as before. Some ſpeaking to him concerning that ſuffering
of ſhedding his blood: Hee anſwered, What is my blood to
Chriſts blood? Chriſts blood is a purging blood, but mine is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
and polluted with ſin. One friend aſked another, ſtanding
neere Mr. Burton, If there ſhould bee any thing more done unto
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. Burton overhearing him, anſwered: Why ſhould there
not be more done? For what God will have done, muſt bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compiſhed.
One deſiring Mr. Burton to be of good cheere: To
whom hee thus replied: If you knew my cheere, you would be
glad to be partaker with mee; for I am not alone, neither hath
God left me alone in all my ſufferings, &amp; cloſe impriſonment, ſince
firſt I was apprehended. The Halbertmen ſtanding round about,
one of them had an old ruſty Halbert, the Iron whereof was tac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to the ſtaffe with an old crooked naile; which one obſerving,
and ſaying, What an old ruſty Halbert is that? M. Burton ſaid,
This ſeemes to mee to be one of thoſe Halberts, which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
Iudas, when he went to betray &amp; apprehend his Maſter. The
people obſerving Mr. Burtons cheerefulnes, and courage in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
rejoyced, and bleſſed God for the ſame. Mr. Burton ſaid
againe, I am perſwaded that Chriſt my Advocate, is now pleading
my cauſe at the Fathers right hand, and will judge my cauſe,
(though none be found here to plead it) and will bring forth my
righteouſnes as the light at noone day, &amp; cleere my innocency in
due time. A friend aſking M. Burton, if he would have bin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this particular ſuffering? To whom hee ſayd, No: not for a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1168:16"/>
world. Moreover, he ſayd, that his conſcience is the diſcharge of
his Miniſteriall duety and function, in admoniſhing his people to
beware of the creeping in of Popery &amp; Superſtition, exhorting
them to ſticke cloſe unto God &amp; the King, in duties of obedience
was that which firſt occaſioned his ſufferings, &amp; ſayd, as for this
truth I have preached, I am ready to ſeale it with my blood, for
this is my Crowne both here and hereafter. I am jealous of Gods
honour, and the Lord keepe us that wee may doe nothing that
may diſhonour him, either in doing or ſuffering, God can bring
light out of darkenes, and glory out of ſhame: And what ſhall I
ſay more? I am like a Bottle which is ſo full of liquor, that it
cannot runne out freely; So I am ſo full of joy, that I am not able
to expreſſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In concluſion: ſome tolde him of the approach of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
and prayed God to ſtrengthen him. Hee ſayd, I truſt hee
will, why ſhould I feare to follow my Maſter Chriſt, who ſayde:</hi>
I gave my Backe to the ſmiters, and my cheecke to the nippers, that plucked
of my haire, I hidde not my face from ſhame and ſpitting, for the Lord God
will helpe mee, therefore ſhall I not bee confounded, I have ſet my face like
a flint, and I know that I ſhall not bee aſhamed.</p>
               <p>When the Executioner had cut off one eare, which hee had
cut deepe and cloſe to the head, in an extraordinary manner: Yet
this Champion of Chriſt never once mooved or ſtirred for it,
though he had cut the veyne, ſo as the blood ranne ſtreaming
downe upon the Scaffold, which divers perſons ſtanding about
the Pillary, ſeeing, dipped their Handkerchers in, as a thing moſt
precious, the people giving a mournefull ſhout, and crying for the
Chyrurgeon, whom the crowd and other impediments for a time
kept off, ſo that hee could not come to ſtop the blood; This Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
all the while held up his hands, and ſayd, Bee content, It is
well, bleſſed bee God. The other eare, being cut no leſſe deepe,
hee then was freed from the Pillary, and come downe, where the
Chyrurgeon waiting for him, preſently applyed remedy for ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1168:17"/>
the Blood after a large effuſion thereof, yet for all this hee
fainted not in the leaſt manner, though through expenſe of much
blood hee waxed pale. And one offering him a little wormwood
water, hee ſayd: It needs not, yet through importunitie he onely
taſted of it, and no more, ſaying, My maſter Chriſt was not ſo well
uſed, for they gave him Gall and Veniger, and you give me ſtrong
water, to refreſh mee, bleſſed be God. His head being bound up,
two Friends led him away to an houſe provided for him in Kings
Street, where being ſet downe, and bid to ſpeake little, yet hee
ſayd after a pawſe, This is too hot to hold long. Now, leſt they
in the roome, or his wife ſhould mis-take, and thinke he ſpake of
himſelfe concerning his paine, hee ſayd; I ſpeake not this of my
ſelf: for that which I have ſuffered is nothing to that my Saviour
ſuffered for mee, who had his hands &amp; feete nayled to the Croſſe:
And lying ſtill a while, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e tooke Mr. Prynnes ſufferings much to
heart, and aſked the people how he did, for (ſaid he) his ſufferings
have beene great. He aſked alſo how Dr. Baſtwicke did, with
much compaſſion and griefe, that hee (being the firſt that was
executed) could not ſtay to ſee how they two fayred after him.
His wife being brought to him, behaved herſelf very graciouſly
towards him, ſaying: Wellcome Sweet heart, wellcome
home. He was often heard to repeate theſe words:</p>
