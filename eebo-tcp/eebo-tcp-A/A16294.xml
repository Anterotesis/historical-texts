         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Translators Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow hard a thing it is to translate
from one language to another,
and make the same word for word
to answer one another, as face an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
face in a glasse; the right
sense, phrase, grace, and proprietie thereof
obserued, is not vnknowne to the learned, who
haue acknowledged, and found by experience,
this so great a difficultie. Much more hard (I
say) then to compose a thing anew, and bring
forth a mans owne free conceptions: which yet
is both hard and painefull, as all new births be.
Neither is it to be expected, or possible for any
one, alwayes so exactly to expresse the very
words &amp; phrase, which in diuers languages are
different: a libertie therein left to all Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
which here I challenge. Nor haue I varied
much from the Authors words herein, but only
in some few places (and that consulting with
better iudgements then my owne:) which had
I translated verbatim, might haue remayned
very obscure. And so I referre it to the censure
of all those who fauour the equitie of this so
Christian a cause. Being an answere to an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
(or rather <hi>mis-information</hi>) of the
Aduersaries both of Truth and Religion, who
<pb facs="tcp:21926:3"/>
are now growne to that height of impudency,
as they will <hi>Informe,</hi> affirme, yea and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
and denie almost any thing, though as
cleare as the Sunne, either in matter of right or
fact, to maintayne their owne desperate cause.
Witnesse all those idle rumors wee haue heard
with our eares, from time to time dispersed
amongst vs, and daily heare: which Time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
in part hath shewed to bee palpable and
false, and (I hope) will doe more and more;
comming from the father of lyes, and his mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
instruments: with such contumelious and
vnworthy aspersions, vpon that most Noble
and Heroicall Prince, now King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
and his proceedings; whereby they endeuour
by all meanes to disable, disgrace, and dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
him, (and so haue done euen from the time
of his Nuptials to this last Action, which hath
set them all on fire) as (I hope) God in due time
will make all the world eye witnesses and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
thereof by the euent; <hi>Exitus acta probat:</hi>
and hereupon wee will ioyne issue with them.
If <hi>Rome</hi> be not <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> fall not,
then are we palpable lyers (as they call vs) like
themselues, <hi>neither hath the Lord spoken by any
of his Prophets:</hi> but if it bee, then let them bee
lyers (as they are, and the children of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Deuill) <hi>and God only true, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:</hi>
in the meane time, <hi>desinant maledicere,</hi> I
say no more. If there bee any escapes either in
this translation, or the former impression of the
<pb facs="tcp:21926:3"/>
Latin (whereof I was an ouer-seer) as also of
the other <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> formerly
published, (wherein was promised further sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
and iustification of the cause, since
made good, both by the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and other his seruants and well-willers)
I say as then: <hi>Me, me adsum qui feci;</hi> I hope the
Christian Reader will pardon and passe ouer
them. If those of the aduerse part, friends and
well-willers to the <hi>Informer,</hi> perhaps meete and
quarrell with such small matters, they shall but
only bewray their distrust, and weaknesse of
their owne cause, not finding greater matters
to challenge, therefore carping at the least: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that saying (whereof they make
good vse) <hi>Calumniare audacter, semper aliquid
haeret.</hi> And so I conclude with the Author in
this his prooeme following, referring (as before)
the further censure hereof to the discreete
and iudicious Reader: <hi>let the wise iudge
whether is more solid; and let the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Reader adhere and cleaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that which is the plainer,
and grounded vpon
best proofes.</hi>

            <head>The Bohemian Lawes or Rights
defended,
Against the Informer.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT most excellent cleere Lampe of
right reason, is not so altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
by the fall of mans nature, but
that some little sparke, (and so much)
remayneth, that euen those who doe
most of all offend against right reason, and confound,
and ouerthrow both diuine and humane Lawes, doe
yet couet, and would be thought to doe those vniust
things they doe, (or indeauour to doe) by Law and by
right. There bee some goe a fowling after King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and hunt after Scepters: and send abroade
their hounds, that they may assault the wild Beast ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hid safe and secure in her owne Lords Parkes:
pretending her now to belong to the iurisdiction of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
lest they should seeme iniurious to any. Such a
hound we see a certaine <hi>Informer</hi> to bee: who, tooth
and nayle, by right and wrong, would (if hee could)
draw the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia</hi> (in hope deuoured of
his Lord) to the iurisdiction and rights of the same
Lord of his: that hee might bee thought but only to
seize vpon his owne prey, and not to driue another
mans away. From the mouthing, and biting of this
so great a Dogge, to deliuer this noble wild Beast,
were a worke both iust and equall, well worth the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
<pb facs="tcp:21926:4"/>
that she might be detayned vnder her owne law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and friendly Keeper, in her owne proper Pastures:
and not exposed to the ouergreedy iawes of others, to
be deuoured, and swallowed vp. Our <hi>Informer</hi> knew
very well, no right at all to the Kingdome of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
to belong to the most Illustrious <hi>Archduke Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
now <hi>Emperor.</hi> He saw the lawes and rights
of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> (by them explicated in a short
summe) among honest minded men, and all of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
sort, to bee held impregnable, not to bee shaken.
What should hee then doe? Not to perswade the Wise:
(for of that hee is out of hope) but to the intent hee
might induce the base, and rude multitude into that
opinion; that the writings of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> are
sufficiently answered; and that the Lawes in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
are by him wholly shaken: he hath caused to be
printed a certaine Treatise, here and there patched
vp to that effect; that (at leastwise by the printed
booke) The ignorant might perswade themselues the
reasons of the Bohemians to bee sufficiently confuted.
If the <hi>Informer</hi> would haue dealt with the prudent
only, and experienced in affaires, and in the lawes of
gouernement, there was no cause why he should publish
those vaine commentaries, secretly and by stealth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed.
For hee had aduersaries very ready, who
were able to discouer vnto him sufficiently, the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,
arts, deceits, and wilinesse of those commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries:
and lay open the matter before the wise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
disguising and fallacies; yet did hee promise to
himselfe the victorie, if hee first could communicate
those things (which were only debated among the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
<pb facs="tcp:21926:5"/>
sort) in print to the ignorant multitude. There
was no cause truely (I confesse) wherefore by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the aduerse part, the reasons of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians</hi>
more largely explicated, and in vaine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned,
should haue beene committed to the multitude
in print; bua that the other <hi>Informer,</hi> hath euen in
forced good men; fauouring the equitie of the cause
hereunto! who surely (lest he should seeme both to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and others ouer wise) haue thought this
Information very fit to be published. Let the
wise iudge whether is more solid: and let
the prudent Reader adhere, and
cleaue vnto that which is the

            <p>Is not this <hi>tergiuersation</hi> more then ridiculous? For

of Historians in these cases are well to be weighed. For
scarce (or not at all indeed) any succession of a new Prince
is at any time described, where there is not mention
made of the conuocations, (at leastwise) of the Nobles
of the Kingdome, and of the consultations for the ELE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTING

            <p>After this, those that were descended from the Dukes

the Duke <hi>Anno</hi> 1109. being slaine in battaile, the
Emperour at that time present, spake thus to the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians:
My Lords, I call God to witnesse, I take the death of
this Prince heauily; but seeing it was his will, it is your parts
now, which soeuer of his sonnes suruining, you had rather, to

<q>Though he were dull, and void of vnderstanding, yet for

was saluted Prince in the castle of Visserade, <hi>Vicinus</hi>

And after,

            <p>Here a man may easily see, that to the States of the

renewed the royall dignitie. Hence so many letters, so
many priuiledges, so many reuersals, and the explications
thereof following thereupon. For from the verie first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECTION
euen to that time, without the benefit or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of any Emperour, by no confirmation regall, or any

their free ELECTION. But afterwards (the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
dignitie with the dependences thereof comming in

Nor yet, that the said Emperors did offer any manner of
preiudice to the liberties and priuiledges of the <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
but rather ratifie, and more perfectly confirme them,
the Letters of <hi>Philip</hi> the Emperour doe witnesse.</p>

            <p>The same in a certaine priuiledge of <hi>Frederick</hi> 2. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
is confirmed in the words following:

Hence it appeareth manifestly, the Emperour to haue
reserued to himselfe and the Empire only, the recogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Regall dignitie, as proceeding from him and
the Empire: but the right of free ELECTION to haue
left altogether vntouched. For the Bohemian Kings and
Princes themselues, did neuer interprete these things any
otherwise. For when as <hi>Anno 1216. Wenceslaus</hi> Sonne to
King <hi>Primislaus</hi> (his Father yet liuing) was ELECTED:
hereupon such letters of the Emperors approbation were
erected:
<q>Our faithfull and well-beloued <hi>Henrie</hi> Marquesse of
<hi>Morauia,</hi> and the whole State of the Lords, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> haue declared to our Highnesse, that
by common consent, and assent of our well beloued <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocarus</hi>
King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> they haue ELECTED
for their King <hi>Wenceslaus,</hi> the first borne sonne of the
Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Behold here a testimonie more then authenticke of a
most free ELECTION, where (to wit) the sonnes of the
Kings themselues, could no other way bee aduanced to
the Crowne of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but by the free and lawful ELE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTION
of the States preceding: which also by euery
approued Writer of the Bohemian affaires may bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
And although seldome they ouer-passed them who
were sprung of the bloud Royall; yet sometime also it
hapned: Examples, King <hi>Rodulph, Albertus</hi> Duke of
<hi>Bauaria, Georgius Podibradius,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Nor more doth the continued Succession of bloud of
the former Kings serue to the pretended Inheritance,<note place="margin">Fauour not to be drawne as a consequent, nor good deeds to be rewarded with euill.</note>
than that of the Polonians, which (by reason of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECTION
of the Sonne of a precedent King) hath bin
alwayes the same. Insomuch as euen to their present
King (though otherwise a<note n="*" place="margin">Of Sweden.</note>

Mothers Line originally deriued from the Posteritie of
<hi>Iagellus,</hi> sometime Prince of <hi>Pole,</hi> was much auaileable
to him for the obtayning of that Crowne of <hi>Polonia.</hi>
Meane while, yet this Kingdome, without any contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to be plainly and most freely ELECTIVE, no man
euer denyed. For seeing that these two Kingdomes haue
(almost) both the selfe-same foundation, (to wit from
<hi>Czechius</hi> and <hi>Lechus</hi> brethren) and time, and people:
yea and Language but a very little differing (as all Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
witnesse,) what should hinder, but that they euen
from the first beginning, in this point of Politike Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
haue resembled each other? But besides this
of Poland,<note place="margin">Both the Son and Nephew, and Nephewes Son and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew (the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead) are elected.

haue succeeded one to another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> albeit they could haue no
iust claime, or hope grounded vpon Hereditarie Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Surely the Ancesters of the Bohemians neuer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the most free right of ELECTION to be wrested
out of their hands: in so much as they opposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with all their might to <hi>Iohn</hi> the sonne of <hi>Henrie</hi>
the seuenth Emperour, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1311. elected King. For
that he had a purpose to exchange <hi>Bohemia</hi> with the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiate:</hi>
this being repugnant to their free ELECTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON,
which granteth to no King (without the consent of
the States) any power either of treatie, transaction, or
disposall, or testament, or translation any other way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
made, that may bee hurtfull to their Priuiledges.
The Letters giuen to the King by the States at that time
solemnely assembled at <hi>Cubit,</hi> (commonly called <hi>Elbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi>)
doe declare this sufficiently, the tenour whereof is
such:
<q>We are ignorant (Sir) for what desert on our parts your
Maiestie should goe about to ouerthrow our free, and
most ancient Rights of ELECTION. It cannot be
hid from your Maiesty, that neither of force nor arms,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21926:12"/>
but only of our propense loue towards you, you haue bin
ELECTED King. Wherefore not without iust
cause, wee maruell, that by any pretensed exchange,
your Maiestie would seeme to subiect vs to <hi>Lodwick</hi>
of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> spoyle vs of our most free Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of ELECTION. Surely <hi>Lodwick</hi> shall
neuer by any meanes (except by force of Armes, or our
free ELECTION) beare rule ouer vs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This resolution of the Bohemians seene, King <hi>Iohn</hi>
both procured the cassation of the Treatie,<note place="margin">Haiec. Fol. 388.</note> and also made
a reconciliation with the States of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This also testifieth <hi>Dubrauius</hi> in these words:
<q>There in a verie great Assembly of the Bohemians,<note place="margin">Pag. 193.</note> 
                  <hi>Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick
by his owne testimonie,</hi> doth purge the King of
that so grieuous a suspicion they had of him, and
sheweth vnto them in writing the Paction or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alreadie begunne with the King: wherein it was
expresly and plainly added; the same to remaine rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and firme, <hi>If it were confirmed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
assent of the Bohemians.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>By this short deduction a man may easily see; the
States alwayes to haue preserued the Right of ELEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION;
and that from the first Originall of the Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Nation, not to haue acquired or sought the same from
any, either Emperour, or King. But <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth,
when to him as Emperour, the aforesaid Priuiledges of
<hi>Fredericke</hi> the second, concerning the receiuing of the
Regall Dignitie, were to bee confirmed: mooued no
doubt with the loue hee carryed to his Posteritie, and in
hope to confirme the Hereditary Succession, limited thus
(but of his owne head) the free ELECTION of the
Bohemians.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:21926:13"/>
In case onely and euent, where none Male or Female shall
remayne aliue, legitimate, (which God forbid) des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
of the Linage, Progenie, Seed, or Royall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>But to <hi>Charles</hi> it belonged not to insert a new clause
to the Confirmation, and by this meanes to ouerthrow
the States <hi>free Election,</hi> no more then to his Father <hi>Iohn,</hi>
to exchange <hi>Bohemia</hi> with the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> Also no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
doth adde any new thing. Neither doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to any King to ouerthrow the fundamentall Lawes
of the Kingdome: especially seeing they proceeded not
from the precedent Kings, but had their beginning euen
with the Nation it selfe. Wherefore also the said clause
(the which for default or want of power and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
by it selfe is nothing) was neuer obserued by the
States. Also <hi>Charles</hi> in another Priuiledge both of the
same day and yeare with the former, approouing in
the words following, the free ELECTION of <hi>Wences<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi>
the eldest Sonne of <hi>Primislaus Ottocarus,</hi> is most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently
contrarie to himselfe. The words be these:
<q>And the Letters of the sacred King of the Romanes,
<hi>Frederick,</hi> wherein is expressed that the illustrious
<hi>Henrie</hi> Marquesse of <hi>Morauia,</hi> and the whole body
of the Lords, and Nobles of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> by the assent,
and will, of the Illustrious <hi>Ottocar,</hi> sometime King
of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> our most deare great Grand-Father, haue
chosen for their King the Illustrious <hi>Wenceslaus,</hi> his
eldest Son: &amp; the same ELECTION by the afore-said
<hi>Frederick</hi> King of the Romanes was approued.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And againe, seuen whole yeares after the afore-allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Confirmation, to wit, <hi>Anno</hi> 1355. the same <hi>Charles</hi>
doth alleage the ELECTION of the said <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> in
these words:
<q>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:21926:13"/>
Who is knowne to haue held the same Marquisate, with
all the Honours, Dominions, and appurtenances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
by no other meanes, than as by this example our
selfe hold from the Illustrious <hi>Iohn</hi> of famous memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
sometime King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> our most deare Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
As also that may be a verie probable Argument,
out of the Letters of the sacred King of the Romanes,
<hi>Frederick,</hi> wherein is expressed, that the Illustrious
<hi>Henrie,</hi> then Marquesse of <hi>Morauia,</hi> and the whole
body of the Peeres, and Nobles of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> with the
assent of the Illustrious <hi>Ottocar,</hi> our great Grand-father,
elected for their King his Illustrious first-borne
Sonne <hi>Wenceslaus,</hi> and the same ELECTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON
by the afore-said <hi>Frederick</hi> was confirmed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore <hi>Charles</hi> himselfe doe both acknowledge
and approoue the ELECTION of the Sonne of the King
yet liuing; by what right doth he endeuour of his owne
braine, to bring in that often mentioned restraint, which
doth altogether oppugne this free ELECTION? And
how otherwhere can hee deny to the States power of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting,
the Royall Issue yet remayning? Doe not all
these things sauour of manifest Contrarieties? Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the words of <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, well considered, it
will appeare he speaketh of the Males, or Females surui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<hi>of the Royall Bloud only of Bohemia.</hi> What can this
therefore profit <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> borne of the Arch-dukes
Bloud of <hi>Austria?</hi> Neither is that instance of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi>
(so farre fetched from his great Grand-mothers Mother)
any thing materiall, which were it of any force, that Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Bloud would extend it selfe <hi>in infinitum:</hi> and so a <hi>free
power of Electing,</hi> should neuer be granted to the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians.
Which yet <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth expresly set downe;
and others also might be found both nearer, and worthy
to bee preferred before <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> Hence therefore it is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21926:14"/>
euident, that the intention of <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, can by
no meanes bee extended beyond his owne Children; as
also the disposall of <hi>Vladislaus</hi> which also the clause of
<hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, (which eight yeares after hee put in
the Golden Bull Imperiall) doth approue. These are the
words of the Bull:
<q>Sauing yet alwayes the Priuiledges, Rights, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
of our Kingdomes of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> as touching
the ELECTION of a King in case of vacancie,
by the inhabitants of that Kingdome, who haue right of
Electing a King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> doing according to the
contents of their Priuiledges, and long obserued Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
from the sacred Romane Emperours, or Kings
obtayned: the which by this Imperiall Decree, wee
minde in nothing to preiudice: Yea, wee doe order
the same now and euer hereafter, in all the tenour and
forme thereof, shall be of most vndoubted strength and
validitie.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing therefore <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, here-hence in the
now cited Bull Imperiall, doth so strictly in case of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancie
of the Kingdome, prescribe the maner of Electing
<hi>according to the Priuiledges and long obserued Custome</hi> of
the Bohemians: And that there the Customes and Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of the Bohemians, haue nothing at all which may
make for the aforesaid clause of confirmation. Yea, in as
much as <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> (his Father <hi>Ottocarus</hi> yet liuing) by
no other Right but of ELECTION attayned to the
Kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this ELECTION approoued, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth himselfe: It followeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
that now <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth hath debarred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from the right of that clause, and that in no wise it
can bee extended further than the Issue descended of his
Family, now at this day extinct. And if others of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
Line descending from <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, should be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21926:14"/>
substitute; assuredly both Kings, and Electours, and
Dukes, (whereof hereafter more at large) from thence
also drawing their Pedigree, would be found much nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to the Crowne. Adde hereunto that by the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, <hi>de Anno</hi> 1356. the Sons
of the Kings could by no meanes reigne without ELEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION
going before. The States also afterwards obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
this very strictly, and chiefly, <hi>Anno</hi> 1438. For so
saith <hi>Dubrauius:</hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>Albertus</hi> made haste into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> that by his owne
presence hee might approoue, and confirme the ELE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTION
there of him made, against all those who
not only dissented from it; but had made choice of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
for their King (a verie Child) to wit, <hi>Casimire,</hi>
brother to the King of <hi>Polonia.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Curaeus</hi> a Writer of <hi>Silesia,</hi> (one of the incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Prouinces of <hi>Bohemia</hi>) hath these expresse words:
<q>
                  <hi>Sigismund</hi> the Emperour dying without Heire Male,
before his death was a chiefe Authour, and meanes to
the Nobles of both Kingdomes (to wit, <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and
<hi>Bohemia</hi>) that they would ELECT <hi>Albertus</hi> Prince
of <hi>Austria,</hi> with whom <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Daughter of
<hi>Sigismund</hi> was ioyned in Marriage. The counsaile
of <hi>Sigismund</hi> was yeelded vnto, and the Gouernment
conferred vpon <hi>Albertus.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If the Kingdome had beene Hereditarie, and to haue
fallen by right of Succession to the Daughter of <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi>
the Wife of <hi>Albertus,</hi> what needed the Authoritie
of <hi>Sigismund</hi> or his Counsell? After the death of this
<hi>Albertus,</hi> notwithstanding hee had a Sonne borne after
his death, they ELECTED <hi>Albertus</hi> Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:21926:15"/>
without any respect at all had, either of Bloud or Linage.
These are the words of <hi>Syluius.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>The Bohemians (after the death of <hi>Albertus</hi> was knowne)
assembling at <hi>Prage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 57.</note> 
               <hi>make one bodie of the whole</hi>

<hi>Albertus</hi> Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> by the greater part of

            <p>And here is very remarkeable the reason of Duke <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi>
refusing of the Kingdome:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Albertus</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaria,</hi> why hee refused the Kingdome.</note> which (as <hi>Dubrauius</hi>
testifieth) was not in respect either of Bloud, or not of
competent Election: but of the difference onely of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and of discord. For so expresly writeth DVERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIVS:
<q>
                  <hi>Albertus</hi> Prince of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> contrarie to all mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
excused himselfe for not accepting of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> Answering that hee had rather dye

            </p>

            <p>In this Election there can no Historian bee alleaged,

alleaged his double right, as well in respect of
his Wife, <hi>Anne</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Lodwick</hi> that was dead,
as also in respect of the Pactions of the Family; yet the
States (none of all these things regarded) did make haste
to the solemne ELECTION. And ordayned out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
of the three Prouinces eight ELECTORS for the
choosing of a King: yet taking first a solemne Oath to
elect the most worthy. It is true indeed that <hi>Ferdinand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

was elected but for other causes; wherefore also thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
he renounced those Rights before pretended and
by his Ambassadors moued, by expresse reuersalls: the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
whereof is this:
<q>We <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by the grace of God King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
Infant of <hi>Spaine,</hi> Archduke of <hi>Austria,</hi> Marquesse
of <hi>Morauia,</hi> Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh, Silesia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of <hi>Lusatia,</hi> &amp;c. Doe make knowne to all men by
the tenour of these presents, how that the Barons, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and also Cities, and the whole Comminaltie of the
Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> of their free and meere good
will, according to the Liberties of that Kingdome, haue
ELECTED vs for the King of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee acknowledge that wee haue vnderstood this
thing from their Ambassadours, and know (indeed)
and find, that the fore-said States and Comminaltie of
that Kingdome, not of any right, but so as before is
written (choosing vs for King of <hi>Bohemia</hi>) of their free
and meere good will haue made that ELECTION.
Witnesse these our Letters confirmed with our Seale an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed:
Giuen in the Citie of <hi>Vienna</hi> the 13. of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
1526.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:21926:17"/>
For the answer of these reuersalls, that they (to wit,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1545. and 1547. in the Parliament) were changed,
the States with the Prouinces incorporate, doe alledge
Ignorance altogether: and they of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi>
seeing they affirme it, let them also looke vnto it, how
they will proue it: yea, if further inquirie should bee
made into this Parliament, it would easily be euicted,
their proceeding to haue been verie preiudiciall and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to the liberties and priuiledges of the <hi>Bohemians.</hi>
And so the <hi>Bohemians</hi> shall be destitute of no defence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of exception of default of authoritie, or of constraint
by violence, or feare, or of other things that may make
for them.</p>
            <p>After that, in the yeare 1549, <hi>Maximilian,</hi> at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of his father <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> in the same manner alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as the sonne of <hi>Prim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

and after his fathers death, <hi>Anno</hi> 1562, was crowned.</p>
            <p>The same happened, <hi>Anno</hi> 1575, with <hi>Rodolph</hi> the
sonne of <hi>Maximilian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How <hi>Matthias, Anno</hi> 1608, came vnto the Crowne,
there is no man ignorant: for the reuersall Letters, aswel
of <hi>Rodolph,</hi> as of <hi>Matthias,</hi> doe plainely shew, that he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the Crowne of <hi>Bohemia</hi> neither by transaction,
or disposall, or priuiledge, or treatie, or by the clause of
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, or any other Right: but onely by
the free and lawfull ELECTION of the States. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersalls
of <hi>Rodulph,</hi> among other things, are in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<q>We haue required the States of <hi>Bohemia</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The reuersall Letters of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulph</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and King of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
                  </note> that if we should
happen to die without heires Males, they would accept
for their future King, the Archduke <hi>Matthias,</hi> our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Brother: after that hee hath lawfully sought it of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21926:17"/>
them, according to their priuiledges, and that after
our death, they would ELECT and crowne no other
but him; stedfastly hoping that the States, both for the
aforesaid weightie reasons, and the generall good of the
Kingdome, will condescend to this our friendly petition.
We on the other side, for vs, our heires, and all our suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
of the kingdome of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> do promise, that this
acceptation (and after our death, ELECTION, and
coronation of our welbeloued Brother) shall no way bee
fraudulent, or preiudiciall, neither to their receiued pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges,
statutes, donations, customes, &amp;c. especially
from the time of <hi>Ottocarus, Iohn,</hi> Emperors; <hi>Charles,
Wenceslaus, Sigismund, Albert, Ladislaus, George,
Lodwicke, Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Maximilian,</hi> our most deare
Father. In witnesse, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The words of the reuersall Letters of <hi>Matthias</hi> are
these:
<q>We haue often desired our Lord and Brother the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Rodolph,</hi> that during his life time he would desire
the States, for the acceptation of vs, (wee notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
first lawfully demanding the same) as the eldest bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Maiestie, so as his Maiestie dying without

(a large proposition being made from his Maiestie,<note place="margin">The reuersals of <hi>Matthias</hi> the Emperour, King of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> that now is.</note>
and our Embassadours present) we haue there promised,
that if the petition of his Maiestie bee yeelded vnto, this
shall nothing at all der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gate from their liberties, priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and ancient obserued customes. Which done, the
States with a free and ioynt consent, vpon his Maiesties
proposition and our petition, haue declared vs for the
time to come, and after the deceasse of his Maiestie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
heires Males, (as the eldest brother of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie)
to be elected and crowned King, &amp;c.</q>
               <q>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:21926:18"/>
And this declaration of the States, wee doe promise shall
not derogate, or any way be hurtfull to their priuiledges,
nor ought to be, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By that which hitherto hath beene said, it may easily
appeare, the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia</hi> to be altogether E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECTIVE,
and not at all hereditarie; yea, and that the
<hi>right of</hi> ELECTION can neuer by any treatie, disposal,
paction, or any other way be infringed, or limited. For
the <hi>right of</hi> ELECTION (as hath beene often remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred)
tooke her beginning, not from any Prince, but
from the most ancient foundation of the Kingdome, euen
to this day inuiolate, and vntouched, in a continued
course and order without any interruption at all. And
although against the aforesaid acts, lawes, and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
some things might be obiected, yet the reuersals
of <hi>Rodolph</hi> and <hi>Matthias</hi> now alreadie produced, doe
proue an vndoubted right of ELECTION. And if the
pretended right of <hi>Succession</hi> were or euer had beene so
manifest, what needed so many words and reuersals? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
it is to be noted, that the said treaties of the two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>Rodolph</hi> and <hi>Matthias,</hi> (which they begun by
a mutuall consent with the States) are of more force than
all other declarations, and precedent disposals: not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in respect of time, but also in respect of forme and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For there expresly the common consent of all the
States is alledged, which no otherwhere, neither in the
priuiledge of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, or the disposall of <hi>Vla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dislaus</hi>
or in any other writing is to be seene; nor yet the
said priuiledge or disposall of any Emperour, one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
found to be confirmed: which surely doth put vpon
this whole matter no small suspition. And by good right
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Vladislaus,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> (seeing they
alwaies spake in fauour of themselues and their posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
are reported to haue beene but bad witnesses in their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21926:18"/>
owne cause; neither were their letters confirmed by the
succeeding Emperour. But if they had bin approued by
the common consent of the States, they might in some
sort haue beene borne withall: but seeing the Kings are
both actors and witnesses, verie well in this case may
their testimonie be reiected.</p>
            <p>By all these things may any one (not ouer-taken with
passion) easily see, that the States in all ages euen to this
day, by force of their proper libertie, haue strongly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and preserued, the <hi>free and absolute power of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECTING
<hi>Kings:</hi> so that none whosoeuer is able law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to pretend any right at all to the Crowne of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
but onely by the lawfull and free ELECTION of
the States, ELECTED. And also he that shall attempt
any thing against the <hi>free</hi> ELECTION of the States, <hi>ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
facto</hi> doth disable himselfe of the Crowne.</p>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Now let vs see the Arguments of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
INFORMATION.</head>
               <p>First of all, hee citeth priuiledges, and in the Margen,<note place="margin">The friuolous and feeble grounds of the Informer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. <hi>Fol.</hi> 1.</note>
the Golden Bull Imperiall of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth. But
the Author of the Information seemeth to haue put the
same of purpose out of the List of the other fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
reasons: for by the former alledged words of the said
<hi>Bull,</hi> it is manifest that the same doth rather make against
him than for him, no mention at all beeing made of the
Royall issue, either Male or Female.</p>
               <p>Therefore the first fundamentall reason in order is,<note place="margin">Fol. 1.</note> the
confirmation of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, of the said priuiledge
of <hi>Fredericke</hi> the Second. Hereunto euen now and alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
is answered, and to any one looking well into this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
it may easily appeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:21926:19"/>
First, That the same is called the <hi>Golden Bohemian Bull,</hi>
in title onely.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it is no other thing then the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the priuiledge of <hi>Fredericke</hi> the Second.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Further, that nothing else was demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the Deputies of the States at that time, whose
Names are prefixed in the said writing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The words of the said writing doe testifie
the same.</p>
               <p>Fifltly, Therefore, that the clause of the successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the royall issue, annexed by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, to
the aduantage of himselfe and his children, was inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the great preiudice of the libertie of the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, Neither did the <hi>Bohemians</hi> euer allow the
same. Also in later times (although there were many
Emperors of the house of <hi>Austria</hi>) there appeareth yet
no ratification of any Emperour: all which doe argue
the manifest inualiditie of the said clause, and the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of their pretence or claime. There is yet in the
said confirmation this clause:
<q>In case or euent, where the Male or Female not suruiuing,<note place="margin">This clause is subiect to a thousand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and ambiguities.</note>
or by any other way shall happen to be vacant.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By the force of this confirmation, and clause in other
places alledged against the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> it seemeth easie to
proue that these things make for the States, and that the
vacancie of the Kingdome doth not simply and meerely
consist in the default of heires Males or Female, but also
in other defaults. But howsoeuer this be, daily practise
(as is aforesaid) is altogether contrarie to the strict re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
of this confirmation. And although the often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
clause of the said <hi>Bull,</hi> together with the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the <hi>Austrians</hi> drawn from thence, were of some
moment; yet it is manifest that the Ofspring descending
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21926:19"/>
from the house of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> by the elder sister <hi>Anne,</hi>
the wife of <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> the eldest daughter of
the Emperour <hi>Albert,</hi> of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
come nearer the Crowne of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> then those of
the house of <hi>Austria</hi> at this day liuing. For the <hi>Austri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
doe descend from the younger sister, to wit, <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
the second daughter of <hi>Albertus</hi> the Emperour, and

among them of the house of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi>

the true intent and meaning of this disposall, onely to
assure the States of the Education and Marriage of the

the Succession of <hi>Anne</hi> the Kings Daughter,
that is only spoken incidentally and by way of narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not to prooue any thing at all. Neither was it in the

to be vnderstood not of all <hi>in infinitum,</hi> descending from
the said <hi>Anne,</hi> but onely of her selfe, and so the same for
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> appeareth to be of no efficacie.</p>
               <p>As for the third Argument of the <hi>Informer,</hi> to wit,<note place="margin">

himselfe, <hi>Anno</hi> 1526. (not as then ignorant of his owne
pretences, nor needing to be informed thereof, nineteene
yeares after to haue vnderstood of them,) doth clearely
confesse, and declare sufficiently both by his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
at that time sent, and Letters reuersals: that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hee doth renounce all those his pretences. Surely that
those Reuersals, either after the space of nineteene yeares,
or for other aduerse accidents, <hi>Anno</hi> 1545. and in the
yeares following (whereof more in their due time and
place) should suffer shipwracke and miscarrie, there is no
reason that can indure to heare of it. And in whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
manner and sense the Reuersals of the yeare 1545. be
taken, yet they doe alwayes make mention of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed

of the said <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the second, both that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
violence to their Priuiledges and Liberties: as
also that the alleaged Confirmations, and Reuersals,
(sometimes approuing <hi>Hereditarie Succession,</hi> sometimes
<hi>ELECTION of free and meere good will,</hi> with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of gratuitie) are altogether contradictorie; and so

onely for that time, neither can be drawne to any further
consequence: and the tenor of the said Oath doth seeme
to disagree with the intent of the Informer. For behold
the expresse words of the Oath:
<q>The Heires and Successours descending of the Line
Masculine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it appeareth that the vigor of that Oath was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired
for default of the Line Masculine of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi>

               <p>The Informer saith:

                  </q>

               <p>For confirmation hereof, the <hi>Informer</hi> alleageth Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
when as it is altogether manifest that they
meant another thing. For they say it was done by ELE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTION,

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21926:22"/>
Kingdome to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Henrie</hi> the Emperour,
which though the Emperour rather desired for his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Walramus,</hi> then for his onely Sonne, as yet of more
tender age, notwithstanding vpon the great instance of
the Ambassadours (as they had in command) at length
the said <hi>Iohn</hi> marryed to Wife the Daughter of the King
of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> And so was first elected, and afterwards by
reason of this ELECTION marryed to the Kings
Daughter. See the words of <hi>Dubrauius:</hi>
                  <q>In the Parliament at <hi>Numburge,</hi> there publikely in the
Assembly with open voyces they desired another more
fit King; hereunto enclined the voyces and suffrages of
all, that <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Henrie</hi>
the Emperour should be made choice of, for King to the
Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And this history by <hi>Haiecius</hi> is more at large described,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Carin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore depriued of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note>
by reason of <hi>Henrie</hi> of <hi>Carinthia,</hi> who marryed the eldest
Daughter of <hi>Wenceslaus.</hi> The Informer, saying that hee
was deiected from the Throne of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> for rebellion
against the Romane Empire, speaketh childishly: for not
the pretended rebellion of the Informer, but his extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and cruelties made him odious to the people. The
words of <hi>Dubrauius</hi> are these:
<q>That they might bee deliuered from the intollerable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of <hi>Henrie.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Neither could the Wife and Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> (had
the Kingdome beene Hereditarie) for his fault haue been
depriued of their Right. Neither did the Daughter of
<hi>Henrie</hi> (although nobly marryed, or his Sonne euer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any right at all to this Kingdome. It is false there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the Kingdome fell to the younger Sister, by the
elder Sister and her Husbands falling from their right,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21926:22"/>
but by vertue of Election: and this <hi>Henrie</hi> to haue been
ELECTED, and not to haue obtained the Kingdome by
right of Succession. <hi>Dubrauius</hi> testifieth expresly in these
words:
<q>The States assembled in a lawfull Parliament, doe striue
with great contention for ELECTING of a King:
some altogether despising a stranger-King, the rest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
betwixt <hi>Rodolph</hi> the sonne of <hi>Albertus</hi> the
Emperour, and <hi>Henrie</hi> of <hi>Carinthia</hi> who was present.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Succession of the House of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi>
and of <hi>Albertus</hi> the Emperour, as also the <hi>ELECTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON</hi>
of the Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> &amp; those things that follow,
is alreadie answered: and the solemne and free ELEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION
of <hi>Albertus</hi> sufficiently proued. Neither is it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
that the Morauians did expostulate with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians
(whereof notwithstanding the Historie maketh
no mention,) for the said free ELECTION of <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi>
For to the deciding of our case this doth nothing
at all appertayne. The ELECTION of <hi>Podiebratius</hi>
was not onely lawfull, but also confirmed by <hi>Frederick</hi>
the Emperour himselfe, the head of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi>
and to <hi>Podiebratius</hi> his Predecessor, <hi>Ladislaus</hi> at the
point of death speaketh thus:
<q>I must now dye, the Kingdome to come into thy hands: I
aske of thee two things; one that thou gouerne the
Prouincials iustly, &amp;c. The other that those who haue
followed mee out of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the other Prouinces
thou send them backe safe into their Countrie without
any violence offered them. <hi>Where is this Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Succession?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore the words of the <hi>Informer</hi> concerning the
Successor of <hi>Podiebratius,</hi> where he saith:
<q>

After the death of <hi>George,</hi>

               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Podiebratius</hi> signified to <hi>Casimire,</hi> King of <hi>Polonia,</hi>
that hee would ordayne one of his sonnes,<note place="margin">Lib. 27. P. 393.</note> (with the
consent of the States of <hi>Bohemia</hi>) for his Successour;
his owne sonnes neglected; not by any Hereditarie
right of a Kingdome (which is none at all among a
free Nation) but by a singular inclination and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the <hi>Bohemians</hi> towards <hi>Casimire,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Language with the <hi>Polonians.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Where is this <hi>ordinarie succession,</hi> which the <hi>Informer</hi>
dreameth of? Is it to bee found in the designation of
<hi>Podiebratius?</hi> or in the inclination of the Bohemians? or
in the communion of Language with the <hi>Polonians?</hi> or
lastly, in the words now repeated, <hi>Not by any Hereditarie
Right of the Kingdome, which is none at all among a free
Nation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here for conclusion it is to be knowne, and noted wel,
that <hi>Lodwick</hi> King of <hi>Hungarie</hi> and <hi>Polonia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad pag. 156.</note> had two
Daughters; the elder whereof <hi>Marie,</hi> marryed <hi>Sigismund</hi>
the Emperour, and King of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> the younger, <hi>Iagel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
Prince of <hi>Lituania.</hi> After the death of <hi>Lodwicke, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismund</hi>
was ELECTED King of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and <hi>Iagel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
of <hi>Polonia.</hi> And although afterwards, the Queenes
both of them dyed without any issue at all, yet the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
remayned to both the Kings: the reason, because
they were both of them not Hereditarie (otherwise they
had falne to the Queenes next Allies) but meerely Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue.
And although after that, the said Kings contracted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21926:23"/>
other marriages nothing at all pertaining to the Bloud-royall
of the aforesaid <hi>Lodwicke,</hi> or his Daughters, yet
the children by them begotten were ELECTED after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for Kings. You see here <hi>succession,</hi> nothing at all
to haue preuailed, but onely <hi>the free</hi> ELECTION <hi>of
the</hi> States. Surely in Kingdomes hereditarie it is farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
<hi>Philip</hi> the Second, King of Spaine, being ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in marriage with <hi>Marie</hi> Queene of England, after
her death was forced to quitte all and be gone, and the
Kingdome fell to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the sister of Queene <hi>Marie:</hi>
the reason, because it was <hi>hereditarie,</hi> and not (as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
Kingdomes) ELECTIVE.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and his wife <hi>Isabel</hi> heire of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile,</hi>
dying, &amp; leauing behind them many daughters, the
eldest daughter (the wife of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi>) was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before the rest in the succession of all those King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes:
The reason, because all those Kingdomes were
<hi>hereditarie,</hi> and not (as ours is) ELECTIVE.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert,</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> leauing behind him three Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the eldest of them (the two younger excluded) was
admitted into the possession of the whole kingdome:
the reason, because that Kingdome is <hi>hereditarie.</hi> And so
this is to be obserued in all Kingdomes where women
succeed. You see here betweene the Kingdomes of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Hungarie</hi> (which are ELECTIVE:)
and the Kingdomes of <hi>England, Castile, Naples,</hi> &amp;c.
(which are <hi>hereditarie,</hi> that also women succeed) verie
great differences of succession. For if our Kingdomes
should haue beene translated to women, surely <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>
and <hi>Iagellus</hi> (their wiues being dead) should haue
beene forced to haue left all and departed. Which not
being done, it necessarily followeth the said Kingdomes
to sauour of no hereditarie succession at all.</p>
               <p>Hitherto briefly the ELECTIONS successiuely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
one another, with their principall circumstances,
haue beene declared: to demonstrate the <hi>Bohemians</hi> not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21926:24"/>
to be guiltie at all of rebellion, disloyaltie, and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie
as the preiudicate <hi>Informer</hi> vrgeth. And if the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former</hi>
doe truely accuse them of such crimes, why doth
he not expresse their cases? which if he had done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt the <hi>Bohemians</hi> would easily haue confuted
them. Also the <hi>Informer</hi> doth proceed to that audacitie,
as to denie those Kings (whom he nameth) to haue been
ELECTED: and so by his glosses is not ashamed to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
violence to a language, whereof (perhaps) he is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.
Whenas notwithstanding the same Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
especially <hi>Iohn, Albert,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(yea and that in the Latine Tongue, and Latine phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

the free ELECTION of the <hi>States.</hi>

precedent consanguinitie, but onely by ELECTION)
then to the rest which were either brothers or sonnes of

               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Informer</hi> persisteth:</p>

Answer.<note place="margin">Haiec. fol. 233.</note> The ancient obserued customes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

<q>That if at any time the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>The <hi>Informer</hi> proceedeth:<note place="margin">Fol. 6.</note>
                  <q>It is against equitie, that any one should be both an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,

1608. and 1611. that it was in the middest of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyls

maketh nothing for a free ELECTION, is altogether
ridiculous. For the order there, (as those solemne acts

right of ELECTION is confirmed) is most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Yea if no other reason remained to the States,

            <head>AN APPENDIX
To the Reader.</head>
            <p>SEeing (gentle Reader) the person of the <hi>Archduke
Ferdinand</hi> now Emperour, and the question concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him, (to wit, Whether he by that ELECTION,
or by Admission, and Coronation, which he had in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi>
purchased the Right of that Scepter) doth require
a speciall Treatise, which (God-willing) very shortly
(vnder the title of <hi>An Answere to the Information against
the Apologies and Writings of the States of</hi> Bohemia, <hi>the
second Part</hi>) shall follow: I would haue thee to know
for a conclusion of this first Part, and for a Prooeme to
that which is to follow: that no Regall Right at all to
that Kingdome came to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by the said ELEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION,
or by Admission and Coronation. For the same
to bee Electiue, and not at all Hereditarie, in this Part is
sufficiently prooued. I omitt now to say that ELEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION
not to haue beene lawfull, because it was not free,
but for the most part surreptitious, fraudulent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Lawes of the Kingdome: wherefore also it
was no ELECTION, but altogether void, which being
matter of Fact, I come to the point of Right: yea, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that they had proceeded lawfully, freely, and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
after a voluntarie manner therein.</p>
            <p>And first the nullitie of that Admission, and Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for that reason is manifest, because by supposition,
that Kingdome is Electiue; therefore no man can acquire
any Regall Right therein, but by the ELECTION of
those to whom it belongeth to elect, according to the
Lawes and Customes of that Kingdome. But <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
was not elected, neither by ELECTION entred into
the Kingdome (as his owne Writings confesse, by which
it is manifest that he would not be elected, but onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by Hereditary Right, as the adopted Sonne of
the last lawfull King <hi>Matthias,</hi> or by some other right of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21926:26"/>
Bloud) therefore he was not elected. But Coronation in
an Electiue Kingdome doth presuppose a lawfull ELE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTION,
which if it do not first precede, all such Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Right is friuolous, and none at all. Neither can
they call that Admission (in what manner soeuer it was)
ELECTION, or reduce it to ELECTION, because
they doe expresly deny themselues to challenge that
Kingdome by Right of ELECTION, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
onely to Succession. When as therefore it shall bee
proued, that Kingdome to bee Electiue and not Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onarie,
by this onely proofe, whatsoeuer shall bee done
without that which is properly called true and lawfull
ELECTION, falleth to the ground.</p>
            <p>Secondly be it, that the said ELECTION were free,
voluntarie, and lawfull; it is plaine that the same was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall:
to wit, that during the life of <hi>Matthias, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
should not entermeddle with the Gouernment of
the Kingdome, and should sweare to the Pactions, and
obserue them: which Conditions doe quite take away all
force from ELECTION, if any thing be done against
them. Because ELECTION is not absolute, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall:
Now where the Conditions are wanting, there
ELECTION is not ELECTION; for ELECTION
ought to be voluntary; but a thing voluntarie conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
is not voluntary, except the condition bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> hath broken the Conditions, (as is
manifest in Fact) therefore his ELECTION is of no
force, and consequently neither his Coronation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this ELECTION although it were an ELE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTION,
yet indeed it was none at all, of no validitie, or
efficacie; because, (the King liuing and reigning) no other
can in any wise be elected: Argument C. in Apibus 7. 9.
&amp;c. And the reasons are two, and both euident. The first,
because the Electours haue not power of Electing, but
when the seate of the Kingdome is vacant: therefore he
was elected of such as had no power then of Electing.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21926:26"/>
They may designe, and promise (as much as in them is for
their time) a future Election, but can by no means make a
present Election, because the right of Electing is not then
open vnto them. <hi>Bald.</hi> in <hi>C. licet de vitanda Electione.</hi> The
other reason is because iniury is done to the true Electors,
which shall be lawfull, and haue a full power of Electing
when the seat is vacant: whose power is vsurped by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupation
of them, whereof (perhaps) not one, or very
few shall be Electors when the seat shall be vacant. And
it sufficeth (if the iniurie be done to one onely) to make
the whole Act vniust, and therefore vnlawfull. <hi>Bald.</hi> vt
supra, &amp; <hi>Iason</hi> in <hi>L.</hi> fin. <hi>C.</hi> de Pact. There may (perhaps)
two at once reigne together as if they were one, (as in
times past they that were fellowes in the Empire:) the
King also liuing, may resigne his Regall Right, to the end
his Sonne, or some other may bee elected; but in our case
there is no such thing: because neither <hi>Matthias</hi> resigned
his Regall Right, but manifestly retayned it, neither did
he assume <hi>Ferdinand</hi> as his companion. And that Election
and Coronation was made with expresse reseruation of
all full Royall Power wholly and entyrely in <hi>Marthias,</hi>
and with an inhibition, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> by no meanes
should intrude himselfe into the Gouernment of that
Kingdome. These reasons likewise doe constrayne
vs vtterly to deny that hee is lawfully chosen King
of the Romanes, who is chosen King of the Romanes,
that is to say, future Emperor while the present Emperor
liueth, and doth not resigne the Right of the Kingdome
of the Romanes: that is to say, the Romane <hi>Empire:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Electours then Electing, had not in act, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but onely in habit, power of Electing, the seat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not yet vacant. And iniurie is done to the Electours,
when the seate of the <hi>Empire</hi> is vacant, whose actuall
power was vnlawfully vsurped. Therefore might the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
of the <hi>Empire</hi> come to a new Election, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
being dead, the King of the Romanes (who was
wrongfully chosen,) excluded. The same reasons doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21926:27"/>
nullifie all Reuersions, &amp; benefits in expectance,
as also may easily be proued out of the Lawes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">See the Pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in the Kingdomes of <hi>Hungarie</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the Prouinces thereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayning, for the further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the truth; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to this Appendix.</note> (to conclude) that Election and Coronation
of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> although it were of validitie, (which wee
haue shewed to be false) yet well might hee be depriued
thereof by the Kingdome; because now hee consented to
the oppression of the libertie of the Kingdome, vexing
the Kingdome with Armes, and endeauouring of Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
to make it Successionarie; and to translate the same
Kingdome after him to others; and notwithstanding as
yet not actually possessed of the Kingdome, nor hauing
receiued power from God: by men therefore hee might
vpon iust cause be depriued of that right which hee had,
not in the thing, but to the thing onely. For a King is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
for the preseruation of the Kingdome, and not for
the destruction. And a Kingdome may defend her owne
proper libertie lawfully against any whosoeuer; yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her owne King: especially such a one who hath bin
onely designed, and thereby become an Enemie of the
Kingdome, &amp; an vniust oppressor of the liberty thereof.</p>
            <p>The same reasons also proue that the <hi>Hungarians</hi> might
iustly come to another Election (<hi>Ferdinand</hi> excluded,) it
being supposed likewise, that Kingdome also to be Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
as they prooue. For there was no Election of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi>
but an Admission, and if it were an Election, (the
lawfull King as yet liuing and reigning) yet was it void:
Neither is it materiall that the <hi>Hungarians</hi> held as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
their Election of the person of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> after the
death of <hi>Matthias,</hi> (which yet the <hi>Bohemians</hi> haue not
done) because that ratification, whether it were tacite &amp;
vertuall, yea, or also expressed, is of no effect: For that
which is nothing cannot bee accounted ratified. SYLV.
<hi>consensus q. vlt.</hi> vnlesse the Electors knew their Election
to be of no validitie at all, and knowing it doe not ratifie
the same but make a new Election. And if they thinke it
was of validitie, when it was not, and doe ratifie it, not
making a new Election, this ratification is of no force.
