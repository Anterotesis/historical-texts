         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by any Christian Prince, Dated <hi>March</hi> 25. and in the

<hi>April 27th.</hi> he set forth two <hi>Barks</hi> under the Command
of Mr. <hi>Philip Amadas,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arther Barlow,</hi> which arrived on that part
of <hi>America,</hi> which that Virgin Queen named <hi>Virginia:</hi> and thereof in

her Majesties name there took possession <hi>July</hi> 13. And having taken a view
of, and liking the Country; and having had conference, and some trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Savages, observing about fourteen sorts of sweet smelling
timber Trees, and many other commodities; bringing with them two of
the Savages, they returned home in <hi>September</hi> following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1585. Sr. <hi>Richard Greenvile</hi> was sent by Sr. <hi>Walter
Rawleigh</hi> with a Fleet of seven Sail, which Landed in the Isle of St. <hi>John
de Porto Rico. May</hi> 12. and there fortified themselves, and built a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> promised to furnish them with Victuals, but did
not: whereupon, they took two <hi>Spanish</hi> Frigots. In <hi>Hispaniola</hi> they had
friendly greetings, and some trade with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> from whence
they came to an Anchor at <hi>Wokocon,</hi> whereby the unskilfullness of the
Master, their Admiral strook on ground and sunk: <hi>July</hi> 25. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
for <hi>England,</hi> and by the way they took a <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship of Three
hundred Tun, richly laden. In <hi>Virginia</hi> they left a Colony under the
Goverment of Mr. <hi>Ralph Lane</hi> and others, besides an hundred men.
The Governour wrote from his new Fort in <hi>Virginia,</hi> that if they had
Kine, and Horses in a reasonable proportion, no Country in Christendom
was to be compared to it. They discovered from <hi>Roanoack</hi> to the
<hi>Chesipians</hi> above one hundred and thirty miles, and to <hi>Chawanock North-West,</hi>
as far. In the beginning of <hi>June</hi> 1586. the Natives conspired
against the <hi>English,</hi> for which, the chiefest of them lost his head: and
Sr. <hi>Francis Drake</hi> coming thither after he had Sacked diverse of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>

her departure, Sr. <hi>Kichard Greenvile,</hi> General of <hi>Virginia,</hi> with three
Ships arrived there, and neither hearing of the Ship, nor the Colony which
he had left there the year before; after long search in vain, he left fifteen
men to keep possession of the Country in the Isle of <hi>Roanoack,</hi> furnished
for two years, and so returned, by the way spoiling some Towns of the
<hi>Azores,</hi> and taking diverse <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1587. Sr. <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> (notwithstanding former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements)
sent another Colony of One hundred and fifty Persons
under the Government of Mr. <hi>John White,</hi> with twelve Assistants, to
which he gave a Charter, and incorporated them by the name of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
and Assistance of the City of <hi>Rawleigh</hi> in <hi>Virginia.</hi> These arrived
<hi>July</hi> 22. at <hi>Hatorask,</hi> where they went ashore to seek the fifteen men left
there the year before, intending to plant at <hi>Chesopiok:</hi> But they were
informed by a Native called <hi>Manteo,</hi> that the Savages had secretly slain
some of them, and the other were fled they knew not whither. This
<hi>Manteo</hi> was afterwards Baptized, and by Sr. <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was made
Lieutenant of <hi>Roanock.</hi> Here also Mrs. <hi>Dare</hi> the Governours Daughter
was delivered of a Daughter, that was Baptized by the name of <hi>Virginia.
Aug.</hi> the 27. they departed and returned into <hi>England.</hi>

The <hi>Winds</hi> are variable, which yet purifie the air, as doth the Thunder
and Lightning, which sometimes is very terrible. Sometimes there are
great droughts, and othersometimes great raines, yet the <hi>European</hi> Fruits
planted there prospered well. There is but one entrance by Sea into
the Country, and that is at the mouth of a very goodly Bay, which is
about eighteen or twenty miles wide. The Cape of the <hi>South side</hi> is
called <hi>Cape Henry:</hi> the Land there is white sand, and along the shore are
great plenty of Pines, and Firrs</p>
               <p>The <hi>North</hi> Cape is called <hi>Cape-Charles:</hi> The Isles before it are called
<hi>Smiths Isles.</hi> The Country is full of large and pleasant navigable Rivers.
In it are Mountains, Hills, Plains, Valleys, Rivers, and Brooks; this Bay
lieth <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> in which the water flowes near two hundred miles,
and hath a Channel for One hundred and forty miles, of depth between
seven and fifteen fathom: the breadth makes ten or fourteen miles. <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
from the Bay the Land is Mountanous, from which fall some Brooks,
which after make five Navigable Rivers: the entrance of these Rivers
into the Bay being within twenty or fifteen miles one of another.</p>
               <p>The Mountains are of divers natures, some of Stone for Millstones,
some of Marble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many pieces of Chrystal are brought down
from them by the raines. The Soil generally is lusty and rich, being
generally of a black sandy mould: In some places a fat slimy clay: In
other places gravel. The Countrey generally hath such pleasant plain
Hills, and fertile Valleys, one prettily crossing another, and watered so
conveniently with sweet Brooks, and chrystal Streams as if Artists had
devised them. By the Rivers are many Marshes, some of 20, 30, 100.
yea 200 Acres, some more, some less. On the <hi>West</hi> side of the Bay, and
neerest to its mouth, is the River called <hi>Powhatan,</hi> according to the name
of a principal Countrey that lies upon it: the mouth of it is near three
miles in breadth: Its Navigable One hundred and fifty miles as the
Channel goes: In the farthest place which the <hi>English</hi> discovered, are
Falls, Rocks, and Shoales which hinder any farther Navigation. In a
<hi>Peninsula</hi> on the <hi>North</hi> side of this River, the <hi>English</hi> first planted, in a
place which they called <hi>James Town.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As our men passed up one of their Rivers, there came to them some
called <hi>Sasquesahanocks</hi> with Skins, Bows, Arrows, Targets, Beads, Swords,
and Tobacco-pipes for Presents. They were great and well proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men, so to the <hi>English</hi> they seemed like Giants; with much ado
they were restrained from adoring their discoverers. Their Language
well seeming their proportion, sounding from them as it were a great
voice in a Vault: their attire was the skins of Bears, and Wolves.
One had a Wolves-head hanging in a Chain for a Jewel: his Tobacco-pipe
was three quarters of a yard long, prettily carved with a Bird,
a Bear, a Dear, being at the great end sufficient to beat out a mans brains:
their Bows, Arrows, and Clubs are suitable to their proportions. One
of the biggest of them had the calf of his Legg measured, which was
three quarters of a yard about, and all the rest of his limbs answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thereto. His Arrows were five quarters long, headed with Flints,
formed like a heart, an inch broad, and an inch and an half long, which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51178:4"/>
he wore in a Wolves Skin at his back:<note place="margin">The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> In one hand a Bow, and in the
other a Club.</p>
               <p>The Natives of <hi>Virgina</hi> have generally black hair, but few of them
have Beards. The men have half their heads shaven, the hair of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
half long: The Women are their Barbers, who with two Shells
grate away the hair of what fashion they please. The Womens hair is
cut in many fashions according to their eyes, but ever some part of it
is long. They are very strong, of able bodies and nimble: they can lie
in the Woods under a Tree by the fire in the coldest Weather, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Grass and Weeds in Summer: They are inconstant, crafty,
timerous, quick of apprehension, and very ingenious. They are very
covetous of <hi>Copper, Beads,</hi> and such trash. They are soon angry, and so
malicious, that they seldom forget an injury. They seldom steal one
from another, lest their Connivers should reveal it. Their Women are
careful to avoid suspition of dishonesty without the leave of their
Husbands. Each House-keeper knows his own Lands, and Gardens, and
most live of their own labour.</p>
               <p>They are sometimes covered with the Skins of wild Beasts,<note place="margin">Their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel.</note> which in
Winter are dressed with the Hair inward, but in Summer without.
The better sort use large Mantles of Dear-skins, some Embroidered with
white Beads, some with Copper, and others are painted. But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sort have scarce wherewith to cover their nakedness, but with
Grass or Leaves. Some have Mantles made of Turkey Feathers, so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly
wrought, and Woven with Thred, that nothing could be discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but Feathers. These were exceeding neat and warm. The Women are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
about their middles with a Skin, and much ashamed to be seen bare.
They adorn themselves with Copper and Painting; They Have, their
Leggs, Hands, Breasts, and Faces cunningly wrought with divers Works,
as Beasts, Serpents, &amp;c. artificially wrought in their flesh with spots. In
each Ear commonly they have three holes, whereat they hang Chains,
Bracelets, or Copper. Some of their men wear in those holes a small
green, and yellow coloured Snake, near half a yard long, which crawling
and wrapping her self about his neck, oftentimes familiarly kisses his
lips: Others wear a dead Rat tied by the tail. Some on their heads
wear the wing of a Bird, or some large Feathers with the tail of a Rattle-Snake.
Many have the skin of a Hawk, or some strange Fowl, stuffed
with the Wings stretched abroad. Others a piece of Copper; And
some the hand of an enemy dried. Their heads and shoulders are paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
red, with a certain Powder mixed with Oyl, which they hold in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
to preserve them from heat, and in Winter from cold. He is most
gallant that is most monstrous to behold.<note place="margin">Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Houses.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Their habitations are mostly by the Rivers, or not far from some fresh
Spring. Their houses are built like our Arbours, of small Sprigs bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and tied together, and so close covered with Mats, or the bark of
Trees, that notwithstanding Wind, Rain, or Weather, they are as warm
as Stoves, but smoky, though they leave a hole on the top right over the
Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51178:5"/>
Their Lodging is by the Fire side on little Hurdles made of Reeds,<note place="margin">Their Lodging and Beds.</note>
and covered with a Mat. On these round about the house they lie, heads
and points, one by another, covered with Mats or Skins, and some stark
naked: Of these they are from six to twenty in an house. Their houses
are in the mid'd of their Fields or Gardens, which are plots of ground:
From twenty to one hundred, or two hundred of these houses stand some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
near together.</p>
               <p>Men,<note place="margin">Their child-birth and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> Women, and Children have their several names according to
the phansie of their Parents. Their Women are easily delivered of
child, yet they love their children very dearly; and to make them har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
in the coldest Mornings they wash them in the Rivers, and by
Painting and Ointments they so tan their skins, that after a year or two
no Weather will hurt them.</p>
               <p>The Men spend their time in Fishing,<note place="margin">Women laborious and men idle.</note> Hunting, Wars, and such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Exercises, scorning to be seen about any Womanly Exercise, which
makes the Women very painful, and the men oft very idle; <hi>The women
and children do all the work;</hi> they make Mats, Baskets, Pots, Morters;
they pound their Corn, make their Bread, prepare their victuals, plant
and gather their Corn, bear all kinds of burdens, &amp;c. Their Fire they
kindle by chafing a dry pointed stick in a hole of little square piece of
Wood, which taking fire, will kindle Moss, Leaves, and such dry
things.</p>
               <p>In <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April</hi> is their Fishing time,<note place="margin">Their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets.</note> wherein they live on <hi>Fish,
Turkies,</hi> and <hi>Squerrils.</hi> In <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> they plant their Fields, and
then they live most upon <hi>Acrons, Walnuts</hi> and <hi>Fish:</hi> Some upon <hi>Crabs,
Oisters,</hi> land <hi>Tortoises, Strawberries, Mulberries,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>June, July,</hi> and
<hi>August,</hi> they feed upon the roots of <hi>Tocknough, Berries, Fish,</hi> and green
<hi>Wheat;</hi> and their bodies alter with their Diet, as those of Deer, and
wild beasts do: <hi>And accordingly they are Fat or Lean, Strong or
Weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They use much their Bows and Arrows in Fishing,<note place="margin">Their Bows and Arrows.</note> Hunting, and the
Wars. They bring their Bows to the form of ours, by scraping them
with a Shell: Their Arrows are made of strait young Sprigs, which they
head with bone, two or three inches long: With these they shoot at
<hi>Squirils.</hi> Other Arrows they have made of Reeds, pieced with Wood,
and headed with Christals or Flint, &amp;c. For Knives they have the splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of a Reed, wherewith they cut the Feathers of their Arrows into
form: With these Knives they will joynt a Deer, or any other Beast,
shape their Shooes, Buskings, Mantles, &amp;c. To make the notch of their
Arrows, they have the Tooth of a <hi>Bever</hi> set in a stick, with which they
grate it by degrees. Their Arrow heads they quickly make with a little
bone, which they ever wear at their bracer, of a splint of stone or glass,
in form of a Heart which they glew to their Arrows; their Glew they
make of the Sinews of Deer, and the tops of Deer Horns which will not
dissolve in cold water.</p>
               <p>In their Wars they use round Targets made of the Bark of Trees,<note place="margin">Their weapons in War.</note> and
Swords of Wood, or the Horn of a Deer put through a piece of Wood,
in the form of a Pickax.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:51178:5"/>
Their Fishing is much in Boats,<note place="margin">The Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Boats, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> which they make of one Tree, by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and scraping with Stones and Shels till they have made it in the
form of a Trough. Some of them are a Ell deep, and fourty and fifty
foot long, and will bear from ten to fourty men, according to their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
For Oars they use paddles and sticks, with which they will Row
faster than our Barges. The Women use to spin the Bark of Trees, Deer
Sinews, or a kind of Grass called <hi>Pemmenaud,</hi> of which they make a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good thred, which serves for many uses about their houses, Apparel,
Fishing-nets, Lines for Angles: Their hooks are either a bone grated in
the form of a hooked Pin, or of the splinter of a Bone tied to the cleft of
a little stick, and with the end of the Line they tie on the bait. They also
use long Arrows tied to a Line, with which they shoot at Fishes in the
River, or Darts which they throw at them.</p>
               <p>They take extream pains in their Huntings and Fishings,<note place="margin">Their Huntings.</note> whereunto
they are enured from their Child-hood: And by their continual rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
about, they know all the places and Advantages most frequented
with <hi>Deer, Beasts, Fishes, Fowls, Rooks, Bemes.</hi> At their Huntings they
leave their Habitations, and in several companies go to the most Desert
places with their Families towards the Mountains, or heads of Rivers
where there is plenty of Game. It's a marvel how they can pass
these Deserts of three or four dayes journey over, without missing their
way. The Women bear their Hunting Houses after them with <hi>Corn, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crons,
Mortars, and Bagg and Baggage which they use.</hi> When they come
to the place of Exercise, every man endeavours to shew his best Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for hereby they get their Wives. They will shoot level about fourty
yards, near the Mark, and one hundred and twenty is their best at Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
When they have found the Deer, they environ them with
Fires, and betwixt the Fires they place themselves; and some take
their stand in the mid'st. The Deer being frighted with the Fires, and
their voices they chase them so long within that Circle, that oftimes
they kill six, eight, ten, or fifteen at a hunting. Sometimes also when
they find them in a point of Land, they force them into a River, where
with their Boats they kill them. When they have shot a Dear by Land,
they follow him like Blood-hounds, by the blood and stain, and oftimes
so take him. <hi>Hares, Partridges, Turkies, or Eggs, fat or lean, young or old,
they devour all they can come by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they intend Wars,<note place="margin">Their Wars.</note> the <hi>Werowances</hi> Corks, consult with their
Priests and Connivers, and Ancient Alleys, and Friend: They have Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
over every Nation, which are lusty young men. They rarely make
Wars for Lands or Goods, but for Women and Children, Before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
they paint and disguise themselves in the fiercest manner they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise:
Either Army hath his General, they take their stands a Musquet
shot one from another: Rank themselves fifteen a breast, and so place
themselves, that the Rear can shoot as well as the Front. Then from
either part a Messenger is sent with these conditions, <hi>That whosoever is
vanquished, upon their submission within two dayes after, shall live; but
their Wives and Children shall be prize for the Conquerors;</hi> upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the Messengers, they approach in their Order. On each Flank
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51178:6"/>
is a Serjeant, and in the Reer a Lieutenant, all duly keeping their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
yet leaping and singing as they go. Upon the first flight of their
Arrows they give an horrible shout; and when their Arrows are spent,
they joyn together, charging and retiring, each rank seconding the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
As they get advantage, they catch their Enemy by the hair of his head,
and then down he goes, and with his Wooden Sword he beats out his
brains, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Their Musick is a thick Cane on which they Pipe as on a Recorder.<note place="margin">Their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</note>
For their Wars they have a great deep Platter of Wood, which they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with a skin, upon which they beat as upon a Drum; of these they
have Base, Tenor, Countertenor, Mean, and Trebble. If any great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
come to the Habitation of a <hi>Werowanee,</hi> they spread a Mat for him
to sit upon, setting themselves just opposite to him; then all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with a tunable voice of shouting, bid him welcome. Then some of
the chiefest make an Oration to him, which they do with such vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that they sweat till they drop again. Such victuals as they have they
spend freely upon him; <hi>and where his Lodging is prepared, they set a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
finely painted with Red to be his bedfellow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their trading with the <hi>English</hi> is for <hi>Copper, Beads, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> for which they
give <hi>Skins, Fowl, Fish, Flesh, Mais,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They have a Religion amongst them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> All things that were able to hurt
them beyond their prevention, they adore with Divine Worship: As fire,
water, thunder, lightning; The great Guns of the <hi>English,</hi> Muskets,
Horses, &amp;c. But their chief God is the Devil whom they call <hi>Oke,</hi>
and serve him more for fear than love. In their Temples they have his
image in an ilfavoured shape, and adorned with <hi>Chains, Copper,</hi> and
<hi>Beads,</hi> and covered with a skin. <hi>By him is commonly the Sepulchres of
their Kings:</hi> Their bodies are first bowelled, then dried upon Hurdles;
About their neck, and most of their joynts they hang Bracelets, Chains
of Copper, Pearl, and then they wrap them up in white Skins, and roule
them in Mats for their Winding-sheets, laying them orderly in their
Tombs, which are Arches made of Mats: <hi>the rest of their Wealth they set
at their feet in Baskets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For their ordinary Burials they dig a deep hole in the Earth,<note place="margin">Their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers, and Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</note> and the
Corps being wrapped in Skins, and Mats, with their Jewels, they lay them
upon sticks in the ground; and then covet them with Earth. The Burial
being ended,<note place="margin">Their mournings:</note> the Women having their faces painted with black, sit
twenty four hours in their houses mourning and lamenting by turns,
with such yellings and howlings as may express their great sorrow. In
the Woods they have some great houses filled with the Images of their
Kings and Devils, and Tombs of their predecessors, which they count so
holy, that none but their Priests, and Kings dare come into them.</p>
               <p>They have a chief Priest,<note place="margin">The Priests Attire.</note> differenced from the inferiour by the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his head, which are twelve, sixteen, or more Snake-skins stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
with Moss, the Skins of Weesels and other Vermin; all which they
tye by the Tails, so as the Tails meet on the top of their head like a Tas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
about which a Crown of Feathers; the Skins hang down about
him, and almost cover his face. The Priests faces are painted as ugly as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51178:6"/>
they can devise, and they carry Rattles in their hands. Their Devotion
is most in Songs, which the chief Priests begins, and the rest follow.
Their Solemn Meetings are upon great distress of want, fear of Enemies,
times of Triumph, and of gathering their Fruits; <hi>at which time all both
men, women and children meet together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The people are very Barbarous,<note place="margin">Their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> yet have they Government amongst
them, and their Governours are well obeyed by their subjects.</p>
               <p>The form of their Government is <hi>Monarchical.</hi> One of their Chief
Rulers is called <hi>Powhatan</hi> from the place of his Habitation: Some part
of the Countrey came to him by Inheritance, the rest by Conquest. In se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts of his Dominion he hath Houses built like Arbors, some thirty
or fourty yards long; and in each house provision for his entertainment
according to the times. About the Kings person is ordinarily attending
a Guard of fourty or fifty of his tallest men: every night upon the four
quarters of his House stand four Sentinels, and every half hour, one from
the <hi>Corps dugard</hi> doth hollow, unto which each of the Sentinels doth
answer; <hi>If any fail, he is extreamly beaten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One House he hath wherein he keepeth his treasure of Skins, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
Pearl, and Beads, which he stores up against his burial; none comes
to this House but the Priest. At the four corners stand as Sentinels four
Images of a Dragon, a Bear, a Leopard, and Giant-like man, all ilfavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
made according to their best workmanship.</p>
               <p>Their King hath as many women as he will,<note place="margin">The Kings Women and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</note> whereof, when he lies on
his bed, one sitteth at his Head, and another at his Feet: But when he
sits, one sits on his Right Hand, another on his Left. When he is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of any of them he bestows them upon those that deserves best at his
Hands. When he Dines or Sups, one of his Women, before and after
Meat, brings him Water in a Wooden platter to wash his Hands. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
waits with a bunch of Feathers to wipe upon instead of a Towel,
and the Feathers were dried again. His Kingdom descends not to his
Sons, but first to his brethren, and after their decease to his sisters, and to
the heirs of his eldest sister.</p>

<hi>His inferiour Kings</hi> whom they call <hi>Werowances,</hi> are tied to Rule by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
yet have they power of Life and Death: they all know their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Lands,</hi> and <hi>Habitations,</hi> and <hi>Limit,</hi> to <hi>Fish, Fowl,</hi> and <hi>Hunt in:</hi> but
they hold all of their great King, to whom they pay tribute of <hi>Skins,
Beads, Copper, Pearl, Deer, Turkies,</hi> wild <hi>Beasts,</hi> and <hi>Corn;</hi> with great fear
and adoration they all obey him. At his feet they present whatsoever
he commands; at his frown their greatest spirit will tremble: Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
he causeth to be broyled to death; or their brains to be beaten out;
their ordinary correction is to beat them with Cudgels, for which yet they
will never cry nor complain.</p>

                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1611. the <hi>L. de La Ware</hi> upon his return from <hi>Virginia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the Plantation of the <hi>English.</hi>
                  </note>
gave this account of it. That the number of men which he left there was
above two hundred, the most in health, and provided of ten moneths
victuals in the Store house, besides other quantities of Corn, and shew
much friendship.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51178:7"/>
For the securing of the Colony he built three Fronts: two of them
being seated near <hi>Point Comfort,</hi> had adjoyning to them a large circuit
of ground, open, and fit for Corn. The third Fort was at the <hi>Falls,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an Island environed with Corn ground. The Country is wonderful
fertile and rich: The <hi>English</hi> Cattel were much encreased, and did thrive
excellent well. The kine in a hard Winter when the ground was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Snow, lived (with one anothers help) upon the Grass which
they found, and prospered well; the Swine encreased much.</p>
               <p>That year Captain <hi>Argoll</hi> went with his Ship up <hi>Pembroke River,</hi> where
he met with the King of <hi>Pastancy,</hi> and procured of him and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Eleven hundred bushes of Corn, besides three hundred for his own
Company, with which he returned to <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Town,</hi> and delivered it into
the Store. Then did he return and discover <hi>Pembroke River</hi> to the head
of it, which was about Sixty five Leagues within Land, and Navigable
for any Ship: then marching into the Country, he found great store of
Beasts as big as Kine,<note place="margin">Elks</note> of which, they killed two, and found them to be
good and wholesom meat, and yet easie to be killed being but heavy,
and slow Creatures. He found also a Mine and a strange kind of Earth,
which the <hi>Indian</hi> used for Physick, and it cures the pain of the Belly:
He found also a Water issuing out of the Earth which tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like Allom water; it was good and wholsom: He found an Earth
like a Gum, white and clear; and another red, like <hi>Terra Sigillata:</hi> an
other white, and so light, that being cast into water, it swims.</p>
               <p>Their Dear have usually three or four Fawns at a time,<note place="margin">Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Deer.</note> none under

mostly two young ones,<note place="margin">Their Beasts and Fowles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> so fruitful is the Country: they have Beavers,
Otters, Foxes, Racoons, (as good meat as a Lamb) Hares, wild Catts
with rich Furrs; Musk-Rats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wild Pidgeons in Winter number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
the flocks of them will be three or four hours together flying

Owles, Swans, Geese, Brants, Droeis, Shell-Drakes, Teal, Widgeon,
Curlews, Puits, Black-birds, Hedg-Sparrows, Oxeies, Wood-peckers, and
in Winter flocks of Parakitoes.</p>
               <p>Their Rivers are plentifully stored with Fish:<note place="margin">Their Fish.</note> as Sturgeon, Porpass,
Base, Carp, Shad, Herring, Eele, Cat-Fish, Pearch, Trout, Flat-Fish, Sheeps-head,

They acknowledg (saith he) that there is a great good God, but know
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51178:7"/>
him not, having the eyes of their understandings yet blinded; wherefore
they serve the Devil for fear, after a most base manner, sacrificing som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
their own children to him: His Image they paint upon one side of
a Toad-stool, much like to a deformed Monster: Their Priests are no
other, but such as our <hi>English</hi> Witches are. They live naked in body,
as if the shame of their sin deserved no covering: they esteem it a virtue
to lie, deceive, and steal, as their Master the Devil teacheth them.</p>
               <p>The Natives are not so simple as some have conceited:<note place="margin">The quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Natives.</note> For they are
of Body strong, lusty, and very nimble; they are a very understanding
Generation, quick of apprehension, sudden in their dispatches, subtile in
their dealings, exquisite in their inventions, and industrious in their
labour. The World hath no better marks-men with their Bows, and
Arrows than they be: they will kill Birds flying, Fishes swimming, and
Beasts running: They shoot with marvellous strength, for they shot one
of our <hi>English,</hi> being unarmed, quite through the Body, and nailed both
his Armes to his Body with one Arrow. Their service to their God
is answerable to their lives, being performed with great fear and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and many strange dumb shews are used in it, stretching forth
their limbs, and straining their bodies exceedingly.</p>
               <p>They stand in great awe of their Priests which are a Generation of
Vipers,<note place="margin">Their Priests.</note> even of <hi>Satans</hi> own brood. The manner of their life is much like
that of the <hi>Popish Hermites:</hi> For they live alone in the Woods, in Houses
sequestred from the common course of men; neither is any man suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to come into their House for to speak with them but when the Priest
calls them. He takes no care for his Victuals, for all necessaries of bread,
water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are brought to a place near to his House, and are there left
which he fetches at his pleasure. If they would have Rain, or have lost
any thing, they have recourse to him, who Conjures for them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times he prevaileth. If they be sick, he is their Physitian: if they
be wounded, he sucks them. At his command they make War and Peace
neither do they any thing of moment without him.<note place="margin">Their Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernment.</note> They have an
evil Government amongst them, a rude kind of Common-wealth, and
rough Government, wherein they both honour, and obey their Kings,
Parents, and Governours: they observe the limits of their own Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Murther is rarely heard off: Adultery, and other gross offences
are severely punished.</p>
               <p>The whole Continent of <hi>Virginia</hi> situated within the Degrees of 34.
and 47. is a place beautified by God with all the Ornaments of Nature,<note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note>
and enriched with his earthly Treasures. That part of it which the
<hi>English</hi> chiefly possess, begins at the Bay of <hi>Chesapheac,</hi> and stretching it
self in Northerly Latitude to the Degrees of 39. 40. and is interlined with
seven most goodly Rivers, the least wherof is equal to our <hi>Thames:</hi> and
all these Rivers are so nearly joyned, as that there is not very much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of ground between either of them, and those several pieces of
Land betwixt them are every where watered with many veins, and
creeks, which sundry wayes do cross the Land, and make it almost Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable
from one River to another, the commodity whereof is very
great to the Planters, in respect of the speedy and easie Transportation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51178:8"/>
of Goods from one River to another. The River <hi>Powhatan</hi> ebbs and
flowes One hundred and forty miles into the Main; at the mouth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are the two Forts of <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Charles.</hi> Forty two miles upward is
the first and Mother Town of the <hi>English</hi> seated, called <hi>James Town:</hi>
and seventy miles beyond that upward, is the Town of <hi>Henerico</hi> built.
Ten mile beyond this is a place called the <hi>Falls,</hi> because the River hath
there a great descent, falling down between many Mineral Rocks which
be there. Twelve miles beyond these Falls is a <hi>Chrystal Rock</hi> with which
the <hi>Indians</hi> use to head most of their Arrows.</p>
               <p>The higher ground in <hi>Virginia</hi> is much like to the mould of <hi>France,</hi>
being clay and Sand mixed together at the top, but digging any depth, its
red Clay full of glistering spangles. As for Iron, Steel, <hi>Antimony,</hi> and
<hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> they are very frequent. The air of the Country, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
about <hi>Henerico,</hi> and upwards, is very temperate, and agrees well
with our <hi>English</hi> bodies. The extremity of <hi>Summer</hi> is not hot as in <hi>Spain,</hi>
nor the cold in <hi>Winter</hi> so sharp as ours in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest</hi>
are the two longest seasons, and very pleasant. The <hi>Summer</hi> and
<hi>Winter</hi> are both but short. The <hi>Winter</hi> for the most part is dry and fair;
but the <hi>Summer</hi> ofttimes watered with great and sudden showers of Rain,
whereby the cold of <hi>Winter</hi> is warmed, and the heat of <hi>Summer</hi> is
cooled.</p>
               <p>Amongst the Beasts in <hi>Virginia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Strange Beasts.</note> there are two kinds most strange. One
of them is the Female <hi>Possowne,</hi> which hath a bag under her belly, out
of which she will let forth her young ones, and take them in again at
her pleasure. The other is the flying <hi>Squerril,</hi> which, by the help of
certain broad flaps of Skin, growing on each side of her fore-legs, will
fly from one Tree to another at twenty or thirty paces distance, and more
if she have the benefit of a little puff of Wind. The <hi>English</hi> Kine, <hi>Goats,
Hoggs, &amp;c.</hi> prosper very well.</p>
               <p>They have <hi>Hawkes</hi> of several sorts,<note place="margin">Their Hawks and other Fowl.</note> and amongst them <hi>Auspreis, Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Hawkes,</hi> and <hi>Cormorants.</hi> In the <hi>Winter</hi> they have great store of
<hi>Cranes, Herons, Pidgeons, Patridges,</hi> and <hi>Black-birds.</hi> The Rivers and
Creeks are over-spread with <hi>Swans, Geese, Brants, Divers,</hi> and those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
named before. The Woods have many kinds of Rare and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Birds.</p>
               <p>The Rivers abound with Fish,<note place="margin">Birds and Fish.</note> both small and great, as <hi>Pike, Carp, Eele,
Perches</hi> of six several sorts, &amp;c. The Sea-fish come into their Rivers in
<hi>March,</hi> and continue till the end of <hi>September.</hi> Frst come in great Skuls
of <hi>Herrings:</hi> Then big <hi>Shads,</hi> and <hi>Rock-fish</hi> follow them. Then <hi>Trouts,
Base, Flounders,</hi> and other dainty Fishes come in before the other be gone.
Then come in multitudes of great <hi>Sturgeons,</hi> and divers others.</p>
               <p>Some five miles about <hi>Henerico</hi> by land,<note place="margin">Bermudas City.</note> but by water fourteen miles.
Sr. <hi>Tho. Dale, Anno Christi</hi> 1611. began to build a City, called the <hi>New

PLANTATION

               <p>The Temperature of the Aier; The Nature of the

            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese Islands were first Discovered by one <hi>Bermudas,</hi> from
whence they received that name; and afterwards from
Sr. <hi>George Sommers</hi> an <hi>English</hi>-man, they were called <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
Islands.</hi> They lie in the <hi>Western</hi> Ocean, and in that
part of the World commonly called <hi>America,</hi> and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
the <hi>West-Indies.</hi> Their Latitude, or Elevation is
32. Degrees, 25. Minutes, which is almost the same with
the <hi>Madaeraes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are environed round about with Rocks, which <hi>North-ward,</hi> and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51178:10"/>
               <hi>Westward, and Southward</hi> extend far, by reason whereof they are very
strong, there being only three places whereby Ships can come into them,
which places also are well fortified. But within there is room to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a great Fleet: In most places the Rocks appear at a low water, and
are not much covered at an high water, for it Ebbs and Flows there not
above five Foot.</p>
            <p>The Shoar for the most part is a Rock,<note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its soil.</note> so hardned by the Sun, Wind,
and Sea, that its not apt to be worn by the Waves, whose violence also
is broken by the Rocks before they come at the Shoar. The mould is of
diverse colours, neither Clay nor Sand but betwixt both: The red which
resembleth Clay is worst: The white resembing Sand, and blackish is
good: the brown betwixt them both is best.</p>
            <p>Under the Mould two or three foot deep, is a kind of white substance
which they call Rock: the Trees usually fasten their roots in it, and
draw their nourishment from it; neither indeed is it Rock or Stone, nor
so hard, though for the most part harder than Chalk; not so white, but like
a Pumice, and Spongy, easily receiving and retaining much water; and
in some places Clay is found under it: The hardest kind of it (which is
commonly under the red ground) is not so spongy, nor retains much
water, but lies in the ground like Quarries, as it were thick slates, one
upon another.</p>
            <p>Most of their fresh water (whereof they have good store) comes out
of the Sea, drayning through the sand, or thorow the aforesaid substance
which they call the Rock, and leaving its saltness behind it, in the passage
becometh fresh. Somtimes they dig Wells of fresh water within four
or five paces of the Sea-side: and usually they Ebb and Flow as the Sea
doth.</p>
            <p>The Air is most commonly clear,<note place="margin">The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the air.</note> very temperate, moist, with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
heat, very healthful, and apt for the Generation, and nourishing
of all things: so that there is scarce any thing that is transported from
<hi>England</hi> thither, but it yields a far greater encrease: and if it be any liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thing, it becomes fatter and better liking then in <hi>England:</hi> By which
means the Countrey was so replenished with Hens and Turkeys, within
the space of three or four years not being looked after, many of them
forsook the Houses, and became wild and so encreased abundantly.
the like encrease there was of Hogs and other Cattle according to their
kinds.</p>
            <p>There seems to be a continual Spring, which is the cause that some few
things come not to that maturity and perfection as were requisite.
And though the Trees do shed their leaves, yet are they always full
of green.</p>
            <p>Their Corn is the same which is used in most parts of the <hi>West-Indies:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Its fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note>
to wit, <hi>Maiz</hi> which, to such as are used to it, is more hearty and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than our <hi>English</hi> Wheat, and yields a far greater encrease, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a pound of one or two graines: Of this Corn, and divers other
things without either plowing or diging the ground, they have two
Harvests every year: For they set about <hi>March</hi> which they gather in
<hi>July:</hi> and again in <hi>August</hi> which is ripe in <hi>December.</hi> And little slips of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51178:11"/>
Fig-Trees, and Vines do usually bear fruit within a year after they are
planted, sometimes in half a year: the like fertility they have in other
things.</p>
            <p>There is scarce at any time to be perceived either Frost or Snow,<note place="margin">Their Summers, and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> nor
any extream heat, for there is alwayes some wind stirring which clears and
cools the Air: Their <hi>Summers</hi> and <hi>Winters</hi> observe the same times with
ours, but their longest dayes and nights are shorter than ours in <hi>England</hi>
by almost two hours and an half: as also their shortest dayes and nights
are as much longer then ours: For their longest dayes are about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hours, and their shortest ten. When its noon with us, its morning
with them, and when its about five a Clock in the evening with us, its
noon with them; so that while the Sun declines with us it rises with
them, as also it doth in <hi>Virginia,</hi> its apt to Thunder and Lighten
all the year long, and oft times more terrible than in <hi>England,</hi> yet
never any are hurt by it.</p>
            <p>There is no Venemous Creature in this Country:<note place="margin">No veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there.</note> the yellow Spider
which is there making her Webb as it were of Silk, and bringing forth
her young of Eggs, like little drops of quick-silver, neither is it percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be Venemous, yet there is a plant that climbs Trees like our Ivy,
the leafe like that of a Vine, that is somewhat venomous, but of no great
force.</p>
            <p>There is great store and variety of Fish,<note place="margin">Fish</note> and so good as these parts
of the World afford not the like, which being mostly unknown to the

            <p>At the first Plantation of this Country by the <hi>English</hi> it was all over
grown with Woods,<note place="margin">Trees and Plants.</note> and Plants of several kinds; and to such as were
unknown to them they gave such names as best pleased themselves:
such as were known retained their old names; as Cedars, Palmitoes,
Black-wood, White-wood, Yellow-wood, Mulberry-trees, Stopper, trees,
Lawrel, Olive-trees, Mangrowes, Pepper-trees, Yellow-berry-weed,
Red-weed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These and many others they found of Natures Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But since they have Inhabited it, there have been brought, as well
from the <hi>Indies</hi> as from other parts of the World, sundry other Plants,
as Vines of several kinds, Sugar-canes, Fig-trees, Apple-trees, Oranges,
Lemons, Pomgranates, Plantanes, Pines, Parsnips, Raddishes, Artichocks,
Pottatoes, Cassavie, Indico, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In so much that its now become like a
spacious Garden, or Orchyard of many pleasant, and profitable
things.</p>
            <p>There are many Tortoises,<note place="margin">Tortoises or Turtles described.</note> which they call Turtles: they are in
the shape of their bodies like Crab-Fishes, and have four fins, they are
as big as three or four men can carry, the upper part of them in covered
with a great shell, weighing about half a hundred weight, the flesh that
cleaves to the inside of it being roasted against the fire, is almost like the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51178:11"/>
marrow of Beef, excellent good; but the shell of it self harder than
horn: She hath also a shell on her belly, but not so hard as the other,
for when its boiled it becomes soft like the gristles of Beef, and is good
meat: These live in the Sea, spending the Spring, and Summer time
about these Islands, but where they spend the rest of the year is not
known; they are like to Fowl in respect of the smallness and shape of
their heads, and necks, which are wrinkled like a Turkey, but white,
and not so sharp bil'd; they breed their young of Eggs which they lay,
in their Flesh they resemble beasts, for it eats like Veal, but more hard
and sollid: They alwayes feed upon grass growing at the bottom of the
water, neither can they abide any longer under the water then they hold
their breath, which the old ones will do long, but the young ones being
chased to and fro cannot continue two minutes without coming up to
breath.</p>
            <p>Shortly after their coming to those Islands the Male and Female cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which they call <hi>Cooting,</hi> this they continue about three dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
during which time they will scarce separate though a Boat come
to them, nor hardly when, they are smitten. Not long after, the she
Turtle comes up by night upon some sandy Bay, and further up than
the water uses to flow, where she digs a hole with her Fin upon the
sand about two foot deep, and coming up several nights there layes her
Eggs, about half a bushel (which are about the bigness of a Hens Egge,
but as round as a ball) and each time covers them with sand very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously,
so that a man can hardly find the place: These Eggs in time
are hatched by the heat of the Sun, and so creep out of the Earth, the
Dam coming no more at them. They are no bigger than a mans hand
at first, which some Fish will devour: they grow slowly and seem to
live long; they will sleep on the top of the water, and used to sleep
on the Land till the Countrey was Inhabited. They will live also
out of the water about three weeks, and that without meat, but then
they mourn, and pine away. Being turned upon their backs when they
are on the Land, they cannot without help, or some disadvantage reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
themselves; by which means, when they come a shore to lay their
Eggs, they are easily taken; as also they are when they are <hi>Cooting.</hi>
Otherwise they are taken mostly by night, by making a great Light in
a Boat to which they will resort, so that a man standing ready, with a
staff in his hand wherein is a sharp Iron, four square with a line fastned to
it, This Iron he strikes into the upper shell of the Turtle where it sticks
fast, and after she hath tired her self a while with swimming about, she is
easily taken: the head being cut off they will live twenty four hours,
so that if you cut the flesh with a knife, or touch it, it will tremble, and
shrink away; there is no meat that will keep longer, either fresh or
salt.</p>
            <p>There is a Fruit called a prickled Pear,<note place="margin">The prickl Pear.</note> growing in such places as are
scarce fit for any thing else, namely, upon Rocks and Cliffs, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Sea-side, as if the Salt water did something help to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
and nourishing of them: The Tree grows certain years before it
bears Fruit, and then it continues bearing very many years, having almost
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51178:12"/>
all the year long fruit upon it. Though it be called a Tree it hath scarce
any body or branches, but consisteth in a manner wholly of leaves and
fruit soft and brittle; many of these Pears grow upon and about a leaf
without any stalk at all, and having some prickles about the top; being
opened the juyce is of a crimson colour, and they are full of seeds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>There are gray and white Hearns,<note place="margin">Fowls and Birds.</note> gray and green Plovers, wild Ducks
and Mallards, Coots, Redshanks, Sea-widgeons, Gray-Bitterns, Cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants;
many smal Birds like Sparrows and Robbins, Wood-peckers,
Crows, Falcons, Jerfalcons, Hobbies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Cohow, is so called from
his voice, a night bird, being all day hid in the Rocks. The Egge-Bird
which comes constantly in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> when they begin to
lay Eggs almost as big as Hens, and continue laying till <hi>Midsummer,</hi> and
are very tame, their young are excellent meat, their Eggs are white,
and the Cohows, speckled like a Turkeys Egg, as big as Hens. The Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick
Bird hath his name from the place where he is most seen. The
Pemblico is seldom seen by day, and by her crying foretells Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Plants.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plants.</note> The poison Weed, in shape like our Ivy, with the touch of
it causeth Redness, and itching, but after a while pass away of themselves,
without farther hurt. The Red Weed is a tall Plant, whose stalk is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Red Rind. The Root steeped, or a little of the Juice drank
alone, is a strong vomit, and effectual against Distempers of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.
There is a kind of Woodbind near the Sea, that runs up about
Trees likk a Vine: The Fruit is somewhat like a Bean, but flatter,
which eaten, purges strongly, yet without harm: There is another small
Tree that causeth Costiveness. There is also a Plant like a Bramble,
that bears a long yellow Fruit with a hard snell, and within is a hard
Berry which purges gently. Red Pepper is a Fruit like our <hi>Barberries,</hi>
which bruised with the teeth sets all the Mouth on a heat, for the time
violent, but swallowed whole have the same operation with pepper.</p>
            <p>The Sea-Feather is a Plant growing on the Rock in the bottom of the
Sea, in form of a Vine-leaf, but far larger, with veines of a palish Red,
interlaced, and weaved each into the other. There are also store of
<hi>Indian</hi> Pompeons, the water Melon, and the Musk-Mellon, the most
delicate Pineapple, Papawes, &amp;c. <hi>Ambergriece</hi> is many times found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the shoar.</p>
            <p>The most troublesome things in these Islands are the Winds,<note place="margin">Things offensive.</note> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the Spring and Autumn. The <hi>Hurricanes</hi> have sometimes done
much hurt: Muskito's are very troublesome: There is a certain Bugg
which creeping into Chests, by their illsented Dung defile all, besides
their eating. There are Pismires or Ants in the Summer times so trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
that they are forced to dry their Figgs upon high Frames, anointing
their feet with Tar which stops their passage. Worms in the Earth are
destructive to their Corn, and Tobacco, causing them much labour eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51178:12"/>
Their Webs in Summer woven from tree to tree are perfect raw silk,
both in substance and colour, and so strong, that Birds bigger than Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds
are snared in their Nets.</p>
            <p>Of these <hi>Bermudus</hi> Islands there are many,<note place="margin">Their number &amp; bigness.</note> some say five hundred,
if we call all them Islands that lye by themselves compassed with the
Sea, of which some are larger and others less, they lye all in the Figure
of a Crescent, within the circuit of six or seven Leagues at most; the
greatest of them is about sixteen miles in length from the <hi>East North-East,</hi>
to the <hi>West South-West,</hi> standing in thirty two Degrees and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Minutes.</p>
            <p>About these Islands are seen many Whales,<note place="margin">Whale-fight.</note> attended with the Sword-Fish
and the Thresher. The Sword-Fish with his sharp and needle-like
Fin pricking him into the belly when he would dive and sink into the
Sea, and when he starts up from his Wounds, the Thresher with his Club
Fins beats him down again.</p>
            <p>Here is also a kind of Web-footed Fowl,<note place="margin">Strange Birds.</note> of the bigness of our green
Plovers, which all <hi>Summer</hi> are not seen, but in the darkest nights of
<hi>November</hi> and <hi>December</hi> (for in the night only they feed) would come
abroad, making a strange hollow and harsh howling; their colour is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to russet, with white bellies, and the long feathers of their
wings are russet and white, they breed in those of the Islands that are
farthest in the Sea, and there in the ground they have their burrows,
like Conies. Of these, the <hi>English</hi> at their first coming, with a lighted
bough have taken three hundred in an hour. Afterwards they found
out this devise to take them, by standing on the Rocks or Sand by the
Sea-side, they would hollow, laugh, and make the strangest noise that
possibly they could, with which noise these birds would come flocking
to the place, and settle upon the very Armes and Head of him that so
cryed, still creeping nearer and answering that noise themselves, by
which means our men would weigh them in their hands, and those
that weighed heaviest and were best they took, the other they let go,
and thus they have taken twenty dozen of the best of them in two
hours space; they are fat and plump like a Partridge, and very well
relished.</p>
            <p>In <hi>January</hi> they gat great store of their Eggs which are as big and as
well relished as our Hen Eggs;<note place="margin">Rat-plague</note> These they call <hi>Sea-Owles,</hi> because of their
hooting, they have crooked Bills and will bite shrewdly.</p>
            <p>Not long after the <hi>English</hi> had planted in this Island, which was about
the year 1620. it pleased God to send a great Plague upon them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a few Rats that came in a Meal Ship, which though at first few
in number, yet within the space of two years they multiplyed so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
that they did not only fill those places where they first land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but swimming from place to place they spread themselves all over
the Country, insomuch, as there was no Island though severed by the
Sea from all others, and many miles distant from the place where they
first began, but was pestred with them; they had their nests almost in
every Tree, and in all places had their Burrows in the ground, like Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to harbour in: they spared not the Fruits of either Plants or Trees,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51178:13"/>
nay, nor the Plants themselves, but eat all up. When the Planters had
set their Corn, they would come by troops the night following, or as
soon as it spict, dig it up again and eat it. If by diligent watching
any of it escaped till it came to easing, it would very hardly scape
them: yea, it was a difficult matter when they had it in their Houses
to save it from them, for they became noysom even to the persons
of Men.</p>
            <p>They used all diligence for the destroying of them, nourishing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Catts, wild and tame; they used Ratsbane, and many set the Woods
on fire, so that the fire ran half a mile or more before it was extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Every man in the Country was enjoyned to set twelve Traps, and
some voluntarily set neer an hundred, which they visited twice or thrice
in a night. yea, they trained up their Dogs to hunt them, wherein
they grew so expert, that a good Dog in two or three hours space would
kill <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rty or fifty Rats. Other means they also used, yet nothing would
prevail, finding them still to encrease upon them.</p>
            <p>This was a cause of great distress to the Planters; for by this means
they were kept destitute of bread for a year or two, so as when they
had it afterwards again, they were so weaned from it, that they would
easily forget or neglect to eat it with their meat. By this means they
were so destitute of food that many died, and the rest became very fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and weak, whereof some being so, would not, and others could not
stir abroad to seek relief, but dyed in their Houses. And such as did
go abroad were subject through weakness to be suddenly surprized with
a disease called the <hi>Feages,</hi> wherein they had neither pain, nor sensible
sickness, but as it were the highest degree of weakness, depriving them
of power and ability to execute any bodily exercise, as working, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Being thus taken, if any body was present that could mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to them any relief, they would strait wayes recover, otherwise they
died there.</p>
            <p>About this time there came to these Islands a company of Ravens
which continued with them all the time of this mortality and then
departed from them. Never any being seen there before or since: But
it pleased God at length, that the extremity of their distress began to
abate, partly by supplies sent them out of <hi>England,</hi> and partly by some
rest and ease that they got thereby. Yet the Rats continued for some
time after, notwithstanding all the devises and industry that they used
to destroy them. But suddenly it pleased God, (by what means was
not known) so to take them away, that the wild Catts and Dogs that
lived upon them were famished, and many of them leaving the Woods
came down to the Houses, and to such places where they used to gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish
their Fish, and so became tame.</p>
            <p>Here are many wild Palm-Trees growing,<note place="margin">Palm Trees.</note> in fashion, leaves and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
resembling the true Palme: The Tree is high and strait, sappy,
and spungious, having no branches but in the uppermost part of it,
and in the top grow leaves about the head of it: (the most inmost
part whereof they call the <hi>Palmeto,</hi> and it is the heart and pith of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51178:13"/>
Tree, so white and thin as that it will pill off pleats, as smooth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
as white Sattin, into twenty folds in which a man may write, as
in Paper) where they spread and fall downwards about the Tree like
an over-blown Rose: The leaves are as broad as an <hi>Italian Vmbrello,</hi>
under one of which a man may well shelter his whole Body from
rain, for being stiff and smooth, the rain easily slides off. The <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mito,</hi>
or soft top roasted, tastes like a fried Melon, and being sod, it
eates like a Cabbage, but is far less offensive to the Stomach.</p>
            <p>From under the broken Rocks they take forth Cray-Fishes oft times
greater than any of our <hi>English</hi> Lobsters.</p>
            <p>They have also aboundance of Crabs,<note place="margin">Shel-Fish.</note> Oisters, and Wilks; at one
draught they have taken small and great about a Thousand Fishes,<note place="margin">Other Fish</note> as
Pilchards, Breams, Mullets, Rock-Fish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every Cave and Creek be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
furnished with aboundance of them, which lie there sucking in
the water which falls from the high Hills mingled with the juyce of
the Palms and Cedars, and such other sweet woods, whereby they
become both fat and wholsome.</p>
            <p>There are Sparrows fat and plenty; Robbins of diverse colours
green and yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many of the Turtles before mentioned,<note place="margin">Birds.</note> be of a mighty bigness,
insomuch as one of them will suffice Seventy, or eighty men at a meal,
especially, if she be a she Turtle, which will have five hundred Eggs
in her, being as many as fifty or sixty men can eat at a meal, they are
very good and wholesome meat.</p>
            <p>There are Mulberry Trees, Olive Trees, Cedars of colour red, and
very sweet, which bear a kind of berry that is very pleasant to eat.
The top of the Palmito Tree is in season, and good all the year, if
you take but an Hatchet and cut it, or an Augur and bore it, it yields
a very pleasant Liquor, much like to our sweet wines: it bears like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a berry in the bigness of a Prune, and in taste much like it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1609. Sr. <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> and Sr. <hi>George Sommers,</hi>
as they were going to <hi>Virginia</hi> suffered Shipwrack at these Islands,
where they continued till <hi>May,</hi> 1610. in which time they built
there a Ship and a Pinace of Cedar, in which they departed to
<hi>Virginia,</hi> leaving only two men behind them: and shortly after
some of them came back to the <hi>Sommer Islands,</hi> where Sr. <hi>George
Sommers</hi> dying, his men (contrary to his last charge given unto them)
went for <hi>England,</hi> leaving behind them three men who stayed vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily,
who shortly after found in <hi>Sommerset Island</hi> a very great
Treasure of Ambergreece valued at nine or ten thousand pounds
Sterling.</p>
            <p>The discovery of these Islands being made known in <hi>England</hi> to
the <hi>Virginia</hi> Company by these men that returned, they sold it to
One hundred and twenty Persons of the same Company, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a Charter from His Majesty: and in <hi>April</hi> 1612. sent thither
a Ship called the <hi>Plough,</hi> with about Eighty men and women in it,
who arrived there in safety in <hi>July,</hi> where they found the three men
that had voluntarily stayed there before as you heard. These men
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51178:14"/>
had Planted Corn,<note place="margin">More Planters sent over.</note> great store of Wheat, Beans, Tobacco, and Melons,
with many other good things for the use of man: Besides they had
wrought upon Timber, in squaring and sawing Cedar Trees <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were no sooner come within a League of the Land but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Fish met them, and never left them till they came to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
within the Haven, of which with Hooks and Lines they took more
than their whole Company was able to eat. Two dayes after they
went out with their Net and Boat, and if they would have loaded two
Boates they might have done it, which also they might have daily,
there was such plenty of them. The day after they went to the Bird
Islands, where with their hands they took up as many Birds as they
pleased, they were so tame. They took up three for every Boy and
Girl, and four for every Man. Then sent they out some for wild
Hogs, who brought home some, that did eat as well as our <hi>English</hi>

the Weather is more tollerable. And though the cold be sometimes
great, yet is there good store of wood for housing and fires, which makes
the Winter less tedious: And this very cold Weather lasts but eight or
ten weeks, beginning with <hi>December,</hi> and ending about the tenth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary.</hi>
Neither doth the piercing colds of Winter produce so many ill
effects, as the raw Winters here with us in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But these hard Winters are commonly the forerunners of a pleasant
Spring, and fertile Summer, being judged also to make much for the
health of our <hi>English</hi> bodies. The Summers are hotter than here with
us, because of their more <hi>Southerly</hi> Latitude, yet are they tollerable,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51178:15"/>
being oft cooled with fresh Winds. The Summers are commonly hot
and dry, there being seldom any Rain, yet are the Harvests good, the
<hi>Indian</hi> Corn requiring more heat than wet to ripen it: And for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
corn, the nightly Dews refresh it, till it grows up to shade its Roots
with its own substance from the parching <hi>Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The times of most Rain are in <hi>April,</hi> and about <hi>Michaelmas.</hi> The
early Spring and long Summers make the Autumns and Winters to be
but short. In the <hi>Springs</hi> when the Grass begins to put forth, it grows
apace, so that, whereas it was black by reason of Winters blasts, in a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights
space there will be grass a foot high.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New England</hi> being nearer the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> than <hi>Old England;</hi> the days
and nights be more equally divided. In <hi>Summer</hi> the dayes be two
hours shorter, and in <hi>Winter</hi> two hours longer than with us. <hi>Virginia</hi>
having no <hi>Winter</hi> to speak of, but extream hot <hi>Summers,</hi> hath
dried up much <hi>English</hi> blood; and by the pestiferous Diseases, hath
swept away many lusty persons, changing their complexions, not into
swarthiness, but into Paleness; which comes not from any want of food,
the <hi>Soil</hi> being fertile, and pleasant, and they having plenty of Corn, and
Cattel, but rather from the Climate, which indeed is found to be too
Hot for our <hi>English</hi> Constitutions, which <hi>New England</hi> is not.</p>
            <p>In <hi>New England</hi> Men and Women keep their natural Complexions, in
so much as Seamen wonder when they arive in those parts, to see their
Countrey men look so Fresh and Ruddy; neither are they much troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Inflammations, or such Diseases as are increased by too much
heat. The two chief Messengers of Death, are <hi>Feavours,</hi> and <hi>Callentures;</hi>
but they are easily cured if taken in time, and as easily prevented, if men
take care of their bodies. As for our common Diseases they be Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
in <hi>New England.</hi> Few ever have the small <hi>Pox, Measels, Green-sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Headach, Stone, Consumption, &amp;c.</hi> yea many that have carried Coughs
and Consumptions thither, have been perfectly cured of them. There
are as sweet, lusty Children born there, as in any other Nation, and
more double births than with us here: The Women likewise recover
more speedily, and gather strength after child-birth sooner than in
<hi>Old England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Soil</hi> for the general is a warm kind of Earth, there being little
cold spewing Land, no Moorish Fens, nor Quagmires: The lowest Grounds
be the Marshes, which are ovrflown by the Spring-Tides: They are
Rich Ground, and yield plenty of Hay, which feeds their Cattel as well
as the best Upland Hay with us: And yet they have plenty of Upland
Hay also, which grows commonly between the Marshes and the Woods:
And in many places where the Trees grow thin, they get good Hay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
And near the Plantations there are many Meddows never overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and free from all Wood, where they have as much Grass as can be
turned over with a Sithe, and as high as a mans middle, and some high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
so that a good Workman will Mow three Loads in a day. Indeed
this Grass is courser than with us, yet is it not sower, but the Cattel
eat, and thrive very well with it: and are generally larger, and give more
Milk than with us, and bring forth young as well, and are freer from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases
than the Cattel here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:51178:16"/>
There is so much Hay Ground in the Country, that none need fear
want, though their Cattel should encrease to thousands, there being some
thousands of Acres that were yet never medled with; and the more
their Grass is Mowed, the thicker it grows; and where Cattel use to
graze, in the Woods, the Ground is much improved, growing more gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
and less full of Weeds; and there is such plenty of Grass in the Woods,
that the Beasts need not Fodder till <hi>December;</hi> at which time men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to house their milch beasts and Calves. In the Upland Grounds
the Soil varies, in some places Clay, in others Gravel, and some are of a
Red Sand, all which are covered with a black Mould, usually a foot or
little less deep.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Manure their ground with Fish, whereof they have such
plenty, that they know not how otherwise to dispose of them, yet the
<hi>Indians</hi> being too lazy to catch Fish, plant Corn eight or ten years in one
place, without any such help, where they have yet a good Crop. Such
is the rankness of the ground, that it must be Planted the first year with
<hi>Indian</hi> Corn, before it will be fit for <hi>English</hi> Seed. The ground in some
places is of a soft mould, in others so tough and hard, that five Yoke of
Oxen can scarce plow it, but after the first breaking up, it is so easie, that
one Yoak of Oxen and an Horse may plow it. Our <hi>English</hi> Corn prospers
well, especially Rye, Oats, and Barly.</p>
            <p>The ground affords very good Kitchin Gardens, for Turnips, Parsnips,
Carrots, Radishes, Pumpions, Muskmellons, Squashes, Cucumbers, Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and all other <hi>English</hi> Roots and Hearbs prospers as well there as with
us, and usually are larger and fairer. There are store of Herbs both
for Meat and Medicine, not only in Gardens, but in Woods, as sweet
Marjoram, Purslane, Sorrel, Penniroyal, Saxifrage, Bayes, &amp;c. Also Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries
in abundance, very large, some being two inches about. There
be also Goosberries, Bilberries, Rasberries, Treackleberries, Hurtleber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Currants, which being dried in the Sun, are not much inferiour to
those we have from <hi>Zant.</hi> There is also Hemp and Flax, some that
grows naturally, and some that is Planted by the <hi>English,</hi> and Rape-seed.
There is Iron, Stone, and plenty of other stones both rough and smooth,
plenty of Slate to cover houses, and Clay whereof they make Tiles and
Bricks, and probably other Minerals.</p>
            <p>The Country is excellently watered, and there are store of Springs
which yield sweet water that is fatter than ours, and of a more jetty co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and they that drink it, are as healthy, and lusty as those that drink
Beer. None hitherto have been constrained to digg deep for this Water,
or to fetch it far, or to fetch it from several places; the same water ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for washing, brewing, and all other uses. There be also several spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Ponds in many places, out of which run many pleasant and sweet
streams both Winter and Summer, at which the Cattel quench their
thirst, and upon which may be built Water-Mills for necessary uses.</p>
            <p>There is also great store of Wood, not only for Fewel, but for the
building of Ships, Houses, and Mills. The Timber grows strait and tall,
some Trees being twenty, and others thirty foot high before they spread
forth their branches. They are not very thick, yet many of them are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51178:16"/>
are sufficient to make Mill-posts; some being three foot and a half in the
<hi>Diameter.</hi> Neither do they grow so close, but that in many places a man
man may ride a hunting amongst them. There is no underwood but in
swamps, and wet low grounds, in which are Osiers, Hazels, and such like.
Of these Swamps, some are ten, some twenty, some thirty miles. For the
<hi>Indians</hi> use to burn the under-wood in other places in <hi>November,</hi> when
the Grass and Leaves are withered and dry, which otherwise would marr
their beloved sport of Hunting: But where the <hi>Indians</hi> died of the
plague, not many years ago, there is much underwood between <hi>Wessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guscus,</hi>
and <hi>Plimouth,</hi> because it hath not thus been burned. The several
sorts of Timber are thus expressed.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Trees both on Hills and Plains in plenty be,</l>
               <l>The long-liv' Oake, and mournful Cypress Tree,</l>
               <l>Sky-towring Pines, and Chesnuts coated rough,</l>
               <l>The lasting Cedar, with the Walnut tough;</l>
               <l>The Rosin-dropping Fir for Masts in use,</l>
               <l>The Boatmen seek for Oars, light, neat grown Spruse;</l>
               <l>The brittle Ash, the ever trembling Aspes,</l>
               <l>The broad spread Elme, whose concave harbours Wasps;</l>
               <l>The watry spungy Alder good for nought,</l>
               <l>Small Elder by th' <hi>Indian</hi> Fletchers sought,</l>
               <l>The knotty Maple, pallid Birch, Haw thorns,</l>
               <l>The Horn-bound Tree that to be cloven scorns;</l>
               <l>Which from the tender Vine oft takes his Spouse,</l>
               <l>Who twines imbracing arms abut his Boughs;</l>
               <l>Within this <hi>Indian</hi> Orchard Fruitr be some,</l>
               <l>The ruddy Cherry and the jetty Plumb,</l>
               <l>Snake murthering Hasel with sweet Saxafrage,</l>
               <l>Whose spouts in Beer allayes hot Feavers rage,</l>
               <l>The Diars Shumack, with more Trees there be,</l>
               <l>That are both good for use, and and rare to see.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The chief and common Timber for ordinary use is Oake, and Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut.
Of Oakes there be three kinds, Red, White, and Black, whereof
one kind is fittest for Clap-board, others for sawn-board, others for ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and others for houses. They yield also much Mast for Hoggs, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
every third year, the Acron being bigger than our <hi>English:</hi> The
Walnut-trees are tougher than ours, and last time out of mind: The hut
is smaller than ours, but not inferiour in sweetness and goodness, having
no bitter Pill. In some places there is a Tree that bears a Nut as bigg
as a small Pear. The Cedars are not very big, not being above eighteen
inches in <hi>Diameter,</hi> neither is it very high, and its fitter for ornament
than substance, being of colour White and Red like Yew, &amp; smells like Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper,
they use it commonly for sieling of Houses, for making of Chests,
Boxes, and Staves. The Fir, and Pine-trees grow in many places, shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up exceeding high, especially the Pine: They afford good Masts,
Boards, Rozin, and Turpentine, they grow in some places for ten miles
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51178:17"/>
together, close by the Rivers sides, where by ships they may easily be
transported to any desired Ports. Their Ash is blittle, and therefore
good for little, so that the Walnut is used for it. The Horn-bound tree
is exceeding tough, which makes it very difficult to be cleft, yet its very
good for Bowls and Dishes, not being subject to crack: It grows with
broad-spread Arms, the Vines winding their curling branches about
them, which afford great store of Grapes, very bigg, both Grapes and
Clusters, sweet and good. They are of two sorts, Red and white: there
is also a smaller Grape growing in the <hi>Islands,</hi> which is sooner ripe, and
more delicious; doubtless as good wine might be made of them as at <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>
in <hi>France,</hi> it lying under the same degree: The Cherry Trees
yield great store of Cherries, which grow on Clusters like Grapes; they
are smaller than ours and not so good, if not very ripe: The Plumbs are
somewhat better, being black and yellow, as big as <hi>Damasens,</hi> and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
well tasted. The White Thorn yields Hawes as big as our
Cherries, which are pleasant to the tast, better than their Cherries.</p>

                  <l>Immured in the self same Castle are,</l>

                  <l>The grim-fac't Ounce, and ravenous howling Woolf,</l>
                  <l>Whose meager pauch, sucks like a swallowing gulph,</l>
                  <l>Black-grittering Otters, and rich coated Bever,</l>
                  <l>The Civet-sented Muscat smelling ever.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Lions there be some, but seen very rarely. Bears are common, which
be most fierce in Strawberry time, when they have young ones; they
will go upright iike a man, climb trees, and swim to the <hi>Islands:</hi> At
which time if an <hi>Indian</hi> see him, he will swim after him, and overtaking
him, they go to Water-cuffs for bloody noses, and scratched sides; at
last the man prevails, gets on his back, and so rides him on those watry
Plains, till the Bear can bear him no longer.</p>
               <p>In the Winter they retire to Cliffs of Rocks, and thick Swamps to
shelter them from the cold, where they live by sleeping and sucking their
Paws, and with that will be as fat as they are in Sommer: Yet the
Woolves will devour them: A kennel of them setting upon a single
Bear, will tear him in pieces. They are good meat, and seldom prey
upon the <hi>English</hi> Cattel, or offer to assault any man, except they be
vexed with a shot.</p>
               <p>The Moose is somewhat like our Red Deer as big as an Ox, slow of
foot, headed like a Buck, some being two yards wide in the head; his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51178:17"/>
flesh is as good as Beef, his Hide is good for clothing; they bring forth
three young ones at a time; fourty miles to the <hi>North-East</hi> of <hi>Massechusets</hi>
Bay, there be great store of them; they are oft devoured by the Woolves.
The Fallow Dear are much bigger than ours, of a brighter colour, more
inclining to Red, with spotted bellies; They keep near to the Sea, that
that they may swim to the <hi>Islands</hi> when they are chased by the Woolves
They have commonly three young ones at a time, which they hide a
mile from each other, giving them suck by turns, and this they do, that
if the Woolf should find one, they may save the other; their horns
grow strait, over-hanging their heads, so that they cannot feed on things
that grow low, till they have mused their heads.</p>
               <p>The Porcupine is small, not much unlike to an Hedghog, only some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bigger: He stands upon his Guard against man or beast, darting
his quills into their Leggs or Hides, if they approach too near him. The
Rackoon is a deep furred Beast, not much unlike a Badger, having a
Tail like a Fox, and is as good meat as a Lamb. In the day time they
sleep in hollow Trees, in the light nights they feed on Clams by the
Sea side, where they are taken with Doggs.</p>
               <p>The Squirrels be of three sorts, the great gray Squirrel, almost as
big as our Conies. Another almost like our <hi>English</hi> Squirrels; the
third is a flying Squirrel, which is not very big, with a great deal of
loose skin, which she spreads square when she flies, which with the
help of the Wind, wafts her Batlike body from place to place.
The Conies are much like ours in <hi>England.</hi> The Hares are some of them
white, and a yard long; both these creatures harbour themselves from
the Foxes in hollow Trees, having a hole at the entrance no bigger than
they can creep into. The hurtful Creatures are Squncks, Ferrets, Foxes,
whereof some be black, and their Furrs of great esteem.</p>
               <p>The Ounce, or wild Cat is as big as a Mungrel. Its by nature fierce
and dangerous, fearing neither Dogg nor Man: He kills Deer, which he
effects thus: Knowing the Deers tracts, he lies lurking in long weeds,
and the Deer passing by, he suddenly leaps upon his back, from thence
he gets to his neck, and scratches out his throat. He kills Geese also;
for being much of the same colour, he places himself close by the water,
holding up his bob tail, which is like a Gooses neck, which the Geese
approaching nigh to visit, with a sudden jerk he apprehends his desired
prey. The <hi>English</hi> kill many of them, and account them good meat.
Their Skins have a deep Fur, Spotted White and Black on the
belly.</p>
               <p>The Woolves differ something from those in other Countries; they
never yet set upon any man or woman, neither do they hurt Horses or
Cows; But Swine, Goats, and red Calves (which they take for Deer)
are oft killed by them. In Autumn and the Spring they most frequent
our <hi>English</hi> Plantations, following the Deer which at those times come
down to those parts: They are made like a Mongrel, big-boned, thin
paunched, deep breasted, having a thick neck and head, prick ears, and
a long snout, with dangerous teeth, long stairing hair, and a great bush
tail. Many good Mastiffs have been spoiled by them. Once a fair
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51178:18"/>
Grayhound, ran at them, and was torn in pieces before he could be res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued;
they have no Joynts from the Head to the Tail. Some of them
are black, and one of their skins is worth five or six pound.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of Beasts living in the Water.</head>
               <p>Their Otters are most of them black, and their skins are almost as good
as Bevers; Their Oyl is of rare use for many things. Martins also have a
good Fur for their bigness. Musquashes are almost like Beavers, but
not so big, the Males stones smells as sweet as Musk, and being killed
in Winter or the Spring they never loose their sweetness: they are no
bigger than Cony-skins, and yet are sold for five shillings a piece. One
good Skin will perfume a whole house full of Clothes. The Bevers
wisdom and understanding makes him come nigh to a reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
His body is thick and short, with short leggs, feet like a Mole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and behind like a Goose, a broad tail like a shoo-sole, very tough
and strong: His head is something like an Otters, saving that his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth
be like Conies, two above and two beneath, sharp and broad, with
which he cuts down Trees as big as a mans thigh, or bigger, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
he divides into lengths according to the uses they are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for. If one Beaver be too weak to carry the Log, than another helps
him: If two be too weak, three or four will assist, being placed three
to three, which set their teeth in one anothers tough tails, and laying
the load on the hindermost, they draw the Logg to the desired place, they
tow it in the water, the youngest getting under it, bearing it up that it
may swim the lighter. They build their houses of Wood and Clay,
close by a Ponds side, and knowing their seasons, they build their houses
answerably, three stories high, that when the Land Floods come they
may shift higher, and when the waters fall, they remove lower. These
houses are so strong that no Creature, save an industrious man with his
penetrating tools can pierce them, their ingress and egress being under
water. They make very good Ponds; for knowing where a stream
runs from between two rising Hills, they will pitch down Piles of Wood
placing smaller Rubbish before it, with clay and sods, not leaving till by
their Art and Industry they have made a firm and curious Dam-head,
which may cause admiration in wise men. They keep themselves to
their own Families, never parting so long as they are able to keep house
together. Their wisdom secures them from the <hi>English,</hi> who seldom
kill any of them, wanting time and patience to lay a long siege, or to
be often deceived by their cunning evasions. So that all our Beavers
come from the <hi>Indians,</hi> whose time and experience fits them for that
imployment.</p>

               <p>The Eagles be of two sorts, one like ours in <hi>England,</hi> the other some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bigger, with a great white head, and white tail, commonly called
Gripes, they prey upon Ducks, and Geese, and such Fish as are cast upon
the Sea-shore; yet is there a certain black Hawk that will beat this Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
so that he is constrained to soar so high, that his enemy cannot reach
him: The Hawk is much prized by the <hi>Indians,</hi> who account him a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamores</hi>
ransom.</p>
               <p>There are diverse kinds of Hens, Partridges, Heathcocks, and Ducks. The
Hum-bird is no bigger than an Hornet, having Spider-like legs, small
claws, a very small Bill; in colour she represents the glorious Rainbow:
As she flies she makes a noise like a Humble-Bee.</p>
               <p>The Pidgeons are more like Turtles than ours, and of the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and have long tailes like a Mag Pie, their Feathers are fewer, but
their Bodies as big as our House-Doves, they come into the Country
to go home-ward in the beginning of their <hi>Spring:</hi> at which time (saith
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51178:19"/>
my Author) I have seen innumerable; so that I could neither discern
beginning nor ending, the length nor breadth of these Millions of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions:
neither could the shouting of People, the report of Guns, nor
the pelting of Hail-shot turn them out of their course, but thus they
have continued for four or five hours together: and at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> they
return <hi>Southward:</hi> yet some there are all the year long, which are often
killed. They build some thirty miles <hi>Northward;</hi> from the <hi>English</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in Pine-Trees, joyning nest to nest, and Tree to Tree by their
nests, so that the Sun never sees the ground in that place, from whence
the <hi>Indians</hi> fetch whole Loads of them.</p>
               <p>The Turkey is a long Fowl, of a black colour, yet is his flesh white,
he is much bigger than our <hi>English</hi> Turkey; He hath long Leggs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he can run as fast as a Dog, and can fly as fast as a Goose: Of
these are forty, fifty, sixty, and sometimes an hundred in a flock: They
feed on Acorns, Haws, and Berries, and some will frequent the <hi>English</hi>
Corn. When the ground is covered with Snow, they go to the Sea-side
and feed on Shrimps, and Fishes: If you watch them where they Pearch
at night, about ten or eleven a clock at night you may shoot as oft as
you will, for they stir not except they be wounded: they continue all
the year long, and weigh forty pounds and more apeice. Pheasants are
rare; but Heath-Cocks, and Partridges are common, whereof our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
kill many.</p>
               <p>Ravens and Crows, are much like those in other Countries. There
are no Magpies, Jayes, Cockcooes, Jackdaws, Sparrows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
Stares are bigger than ours, and are as black as Crows, which do much
hurt among the young Corn, and they are so bold that they fear not
Guns. Owles are of two sorts, the one is small speckled like a Partridg
with eares: The other is almost as big as an Eagle and is very good
meat.</p>
               <p>Cormorants are as common as other Fowles, they devour much Fish.
A tame Cormorant, and two or three good Dogs in the water make
excellent sport: Cranes are as tall as a man, their bodies not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the Turkies, they are rarely fat. Also many Swans frequent the
Rivers and Ponds, which are very good meat.</p>
               <p>There be three sorts of Geese; The Brant Goose like one of our wild
Geese. A white Goose about the bigness of ours: Of these there will
be sometimes two or three thousand in a flock. The third is a grey
Goose with a black neck, and a black and white head much bigger than
our <hi>English:</hi> They are killed both flying and sitting. The Ducks are
very large, and in great abundance; and so is their Teale. Their Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives
never leave tatling day nor night, they are somewhat bigger than
a Duck. The Loon is ill-shaped like a Cormorant, but he can neither
go nor fly; He makes a noise somestime like a Sowgelders Horn. The
Humilites, or Simplicites rather, be of two sorts; The one as big as green
Plover, the other is less; they are so simple that one may drive them on
heaps, and then shoot at them, and the living will settle themselves on
the same place again where the dead are, while you shoot again, so that
sometimes above twelve score have been killed at two shoots.</p>

               <head>OF FISH.</head>
               <p>There are great store, and much variety of Fishes thus enumerated.</p>

                  <l>The scale-fenc'd Sturgeon, wry-mouth'd Hollibut;</l>
                  <l>The flouncing Salmon, Codfish, Greedigut;</l>
                  <l>Cole, Haddock, Haike, the Thornback and Scate,</l>
                  <l>Whose slimy outside makes him seld in date;</l>
                  <l>The stately Bass, old <hi>Neptunes</hi> fleeting Post,</l>
                  <l>That tides it out and in from Sea to Coast;</l>
                  <l>Consorting Herrings, and the bony Shad.</l>
                  <l>Big-bellied Alewives, Macrils richly clad</l>
                  <l>With Rain-bow colours, the Frost-fish and the Smelt,</l>
                  <l>As good as ever Lady Gustus felt.</l>
                  <l>The spotted Lamprons, Eeles, the Lamperies,</l>
                  <l>That seek fresh water-Brooks with <hi>Argu's</hi>-eyes.</l>
                  <l>These watry Villages, with thousands more</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>The luscious Lobster with the Crabfish raw,</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Brittish</hi> Oyster, Muscle, Periwig</l>
                  <l>And the Tortoise sought by the <hi>Indian</hi> Squaw;</l>
                  <l>Which to the flats dance many a Winters Jigg:</l>
                  <l>To dive for Cockles, and to dig for clams,</l>
                  <l>Whereby her lazy husbands guts she crams.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>The Seal, called also the Sea-Calf, whose Skin is good for divers uses,
and his body between Fish and Flesh, neither delectable to the Pallat,
nor well agreeing with the Stomack. His Oyl is used in Lamps.</p>
               <p>The Shark is as big as a man, some as big as a Horse, with three rows of
teeth in his mouth, with which he Snaps in two the Fishers Lines; he
will bite off a mans Armor Legg at a bit, they are oft taken, and serve
for nothing but to manure the Ground.</p>
               <p>There are many Sturgious, but the most are caught at <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> and in
the River of <hi>Meramack,</hi> whence they are brought to <hi>England,</hi> they are
twelve, fourteen, and some eighteen foot long.</p>
               <p>The Salmon is as good as ours, and in great plenty in some places: The
Hollibut is like our Plaice or Turbut, some being two yards long, and
one broad, and a food thick. Thornback and Scate is given to the
Doggs, being so common in many places. The Bass is one of the best
Fishes, being a Delicate and fat Fish: He hath a bone in his head that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51178:20"/>
contain a Saucerful of Marrow sweet and good, pleasant and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
they are three or four foot long, they take them with a Hook and
Line, and in three hours a man may catch a dozen or twenty of them.
The Herrings are much like ours. Alewives are much like Herrings,
which in the end of <hi>April</hi> come into the fresh Rivers to spawn, in such
multitudes as is incredible, pressing up in such shallow waters where they
can scarce swim, and they are so eager, that no beating with poles can
keep them back till they have spawned.</p>
               <p>Their Shads are far bigger than ours: The Makarels be of two sorts;
In the beginning of the year the great ones are upon the Coast, some
18. inches long: In Sommer come the smaller kind, they are taken with
Hooks and Lines baited with a piece of Red Cloth. There be many Eels
in the salt water, especially where grass grows, they are caught in Weels
baited with pieces of Lobsters: Sometimes a man thus takes a busnel in a
night, they are wholesome and pleasant meat.</p>
               <p>Lamprons and Lampries are little esteemed. Lobsters are in plenty in
most places, very large, and some being twenty pound weight, they
are taken at low water amongst the Rocks; the smaller are the better;
but because of their plenty they are little esteemed.</p>
               <p>The Oysters be great, in form of a shoo-horn, some of a foot long,
they breed in certain banks, which are bare after every Spring-tide; each
makes two good mouthfuls.</p>
               <p>The Periwig lies in the Oase like a head of hair, which being touched,
draws back it self leaving nothing to be seen but a small round hole,
Muscles are in such plenty that they give them their Hoggs. Clams
are not much unlike to Cockles, lying under the Sand, every six or seven
of them having a round hole at which they take in Air and Water, they
are in great plenty, and help much to feed their Swine both Winter and
Sommer; for the Swine being used to them, will constantly repair eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ebb to the places, where they root them up and eat them. Some are
as big as a Penny Loaf, which the <hi>Indians</hi> count great dainties.</p>

               <head>A Description of the Plantations in New-England as they were
Anno Christi, 1633.</head>
               <p>The outmost Plantation to the <hi>Southward,</hi> which by the <hi>Indians</hi> is
called <hi>Wichaguscusset,</hi> is but a small Village, yet pleasant and healthful,
having good ground, store of good Timber, and of Meddow ground;
there is a spacious Harbor for shipping before the Town; they have store
of Fish of all sorts, and of Swine, which they feed with Acrons and
Clams, and an Alewife River.</p>
               <p>Three miles to the <hi>North</hi> is <hi>Mount Wolleston,</hi> a fertile soil, very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for Farmers houses, there being great store of plain ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Trees. Near this place are <hi>Maschusets</hi> Fields, where the greatest
<hi>Sagamore</hi> in the Country lived before the Plague cleared all: Their
greatest inconvenience is that there are not so many Springs as in other
places; nor can Boats come in at low water, nor Ships ride near the
Shore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:51178:20"/>
Six miles further to the <hi>North</hi> lieth <hi>Dorchester,</hi> the greatest Town in
<hi>New-England,</hi> well Wooded and Watered with good Arrable and Hay
ground, fair comfortable Fields and pleasant Gardens: Here are many
Cattel, as Kine, Goats, and Swine. It hath a good Harbor for ships;
there is begun the fishing in the <hi>Bay,</hi> which proved so profitable, that
many since have followed them there.</p>
               <p>A mile from thence lies <hi>Roxberry,</hi> a fair and handsome Country Town;
the Inhabitants are rich: It lies in the Mains, and yet is well Wooded
and watered, having a clear Brook running through the Town, where
are great store of Smelts, whence its called <hi>Smelt-River.</hi> A quarter of a
mile on the North of it is another River, called <hi>Stony River,</hi> upon which
is built a water Mill. Here is good store of Corn and Meddow Ground.
<hi>Westward</hi> from the Town its somewhat Rocky, whence its called <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry;</hi>
the Inhabitants have fair houses,, store of Cattel, Come-fields
paled in, and fruitful Gardens. Their goods are brought in Boats from
<hi>Boston,</hi> which is the nearest Harbor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boston</hi> is two miles <hi>North-East</hi> from <hi>Roxberry.</hi> Its Situation is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
being a <hi>Peninsula</hi> hemmed on the <hi>South</hi> with the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Roxberry.</hi> On
the <hi>North</hi> with <hi>Charles</hi> River, the Marshes on the back side being not half
a quarter of a mile over, so that a little fencing secures their cattel from
the Wolves. Their greatest want is of Wood and Meddow ground,
which they supply from the adjacent <hi>Islands,</hi> both for Timber, Fire-wood,
and Hay; they are not troubled with Wolves, Rattlesnakes nor Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketoes,
being bare of Wood to shelter them. Its the chief place for ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and Merchandize. This neck of Land is about four miles in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
almost square: Having on the <hi>South</hi> at one corner a great broad
Hill, whereon is built a Fort, which commands all Ships in any Harbour
in the <hi>Hill Bay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the <hi>North</hi> side is another Hill of the same bigness, whereon stands a
Windmil. To the <hi>North-West</hi> is an high Mountain, with three little
Hills on the top, whence it is called <hi>Tremount.</hi> From hence you may see
all the <hi>Islands</hi> that lie before the <hi>Bay,</hi> and such Ships as are upon the Sea
Coast. Here are rich Corn Fields, and fruitful Gardens: The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
grow rich; they have sweet and pleasant Springs; and for their
enlargement, they have taken to themselves Farm-Houses in a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Muddy River,</hi> two miles off, where is good Timber, Ground, Marsh-Land,
and Meddows, and there they keep their Swine or other Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
in the Summer, and bring them to <hi>Boston</hi> in the Winter.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>North</hi> side of <hi>Charles</hi> River is <hi>Charles</hi> Town, which is another
neck of Land, on whose <hi>Northern</hi> side runs <hi>Mistick</hi> River. This Town
may well be paralled with <hi>Boston,</hi> being upon a bare neck, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
forced to borrow conveniencies from the Main, and to get Farmes
in the Country. Here is a Ferry-boat to carry Passengers over <hi>Charles</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which is a deep Channel, and a quarter of a mile over. Here may
ride fourty ships at a time. Up higher is a broad <hi>Bay</hi> that is two miles
over, into which run <hi>Stony</hi> River, and <hi>Muddy</hi> River. In the middle of
this <hi>Bay</hi> is an Oyster bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:51178:21"/>
                  <hi>Medfod</hi> Village is scituated towards the <hi>North-West</hi> of this <hi>Bay,</hi> in a
Creek: A very fertile and pleasant place: Its a mile and a half from
<hi>Charles</hi> Town. At the bottom of this <hi>Bay</hi> the River is very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>By the side of this River stands <hi>New-Town,</hi> three miles from <hi>Charles</hi>
Town. Its a neat and well compacted Town, having many fair build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and at first was intended for a City; The Inhabitants are mostly
rich, and have many Cattel of all sorts, and many hundred Acres of
Ground paled in. On the other side of the River lies their Meddow
and Marsh Ground for Hay</p>
               <p>Half a mile thence is <hi>Water Town,</hi> nothing inferiour for Land, Wood,
Meddows and Water: Within half a mile of it is a great Pond, which
is divided between those two Towns; And a mile and a half from this
Town is a fall of fresh waters, which through <hi>Charles</hi> River fall into the
Ocean: A little below this fall they have made weires, where they catch
great store of Shads, and Alewives, an hundred thousand of them in two
Tides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mastick</hi> is three miles from <hi>Charles</hi> Town; seated pleasantly by the
waters side. At the head of this River are very spacious Ponds to which
the Alewives press to cast their Spawn, where multitudes are taken.
On the <hi>West</hi> side of this River the Governour hath a Farm where he
keeps most of his Cattel. On the <hi>East</hi> side is Mr. <hi>Craddocks</hi> Plantation,
who impailed in a Park for Deer, and some ships have been built
there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Winnisimet</hi> is a very pleasant place for situation, and stands commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.
Its but a mile from <hi>Charles</hi> Town, the River only parting them.
Its the lasts Town in the <hi>Bay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chief <hi>Islands</hi> that secure the Harbor from Winds and Waves, are
first <hi>Deere Island,</hi> within a flight shot from <hi>Bullin</hi> Point. Its so called,
because the Deer often swim thither to escape the Woolves, where six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
of them have been killed in a day.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Long Island,</hi> so called from its length. Other <hi>Islands</hi> are
<hi>Nodless Isle, Round Isle;</hi> the <hi>Governours Garden,</hi> having in it an Orchard,
Garden, and other conveniencies: Also <hi>Slate Island, Glass Island, Bird
Island,</hi> &amp;c. they all abound with Wood, Water, and Meddows: In these
they put their Cattel for safety, whil'st their Corn is on the Ground.
The Towns without the <hi>Bay</hi> are nearer the Main, and reap a greater
benefit from the Sea, in regard of the plenty of Fish and Fowl, and so
live more plentifully than those that are more remoat from the Sea in
the <hi>Island Plantations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Six miles <hi>North-East</hi> from <hi>Winnisimet</hi> is <hi>Sagus,</hi> is pleasant for situation,
seated at the bottom of a <hi>Bay,</hi> which is made on the one side with a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
Shore, and on the other side with a long Sandy Beach: Its in
the circumference six miles, well Woodded with Oakes, Pines, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars;
Its also well watered with fresh Springs, and a great Pond in the
middle, before which is a spacious Marsh.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Black William</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> Duke, out of his generosity, gave this
place to the Plantation of <hi>Sagus,</hi> so that none else can claim it; when a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51178:21"/>
storm hath been, or is like to be, there will be a roaring like thunder
which may be heard six miles off. On the <hi>North</hi> side of this <hi>Bay</hi> are two
great Marshes, divided by a pleasant River that runs between them. The
Marsh is crossed with divers Creeks where are store of Geese and Ducks,
and convenient Ponds wherein to make <hi>Decoys.</hi> There are also fruitful
Meddows, and four great Ponds like little Lakes wherein is store of fresh
Fish; out of which, within a mile of the Town runs a curious fresh
Brook which is rarely frozen by reason of its warmness: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it is built a Water Mill. For Wood there is store, as Oake, Walnut,
Cedar, Elme, and Aspe: Here was sown much <hi>English</hi> Corn.</p>
               <p>Here the Bass continues from the midst of <hi>April</hi> till <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and
not above half that time in the <hi>Bay.</hi> There is also much Rock-Cod, and
Macharil, so that shoals of Bass have driven shoals of Macharil to the
end of the sandy bank, which the Inhabitants have gathered up in
Wheel barrows. Here are many Muscle banks, and Clam-banks, and
Lobsters amongst the Rocks, and grassy holes.</p>
               <p>Four miles from <hi>Saugus</hi> stands <hi>Salem,</hi> on the middle of a neck of Land
very pleasantly, between two Rivers on the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South.</hi> The
place is but barren sandy Land, yet for seven years together it brought
forth excellent Corn, being manured with Fish every third year: Yet
there is good ground, and good Timber by the Sea side, and divers fresh
Springs.</p>
               <p>Beyond the River is a very good soil, where they have Farms. Here
also they have store of Fish, as Basses, Eels, Lobsters, Clams, &amp;c. They
cross the River in <hi>Canows</hi> made of whole Pine Trees, two foot and an
half wide, and twenty foot long, in which also they go a Fowling, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
two Leagues into the Sea. It hath two good Harbours, which lie
within <hi>Derbins</hi> Fort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marvil Head</hi> lies four miles <hi>South</hi> from <hi>Salem,</hi> a very good place for a
Plantation, especially for such as will set up a Trade of Fishing: There
are good Harbours for Boats, and good riding for ships.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agowomen</hi> is nine miles to the <hi>North</hi> from <hi>Salem</hi> near the Sea, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good place for a Plantation. It abounds with Fish and Flesh, of
Fowls, and Beasts, hath great Meddows and Marshes, and Arable grounds,
many good Rivers and Harbours, and no Rattle Snakes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Merrimack</hi> lies eight miles beyond that, where is a River Navigable
for twenty miles, and all along the side of it fresh Marshes, in some
places three miles broad. In the River is Sturgion, Salmon, Bass, and
divers other kinds of Fish.</p>
               <p>Three miles beyond this River is the out side of <hi>Massecusets</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
wherein these are the Towns that were begun in the year,
1633.</p>

               <head>Of the Evils, and Hurtful things in the Plantation.</head>
               <p>Those that bring the greatest prejudice to the Planters, are the rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Woolves, which destroy the weaker Cattel, of which we heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Then the Rattle Snake which is usually a yard and a half long, as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51178:22"/>
thick in the middle as the small of a mans Legg, with a yellow belly:
Her back is spotted with black, russet, and green, placed like scales.
At her taile is a rattle with which she makes a noise when she is molested,
or when any come near to her: Her neck seems no bigger than a mans
thumb, yet can she swallow a Squirrel, having a wide mouth with teeth
as sharp as needles, wherein her poyson lies, for she hath no sting: when
a man is bitten by her, the poyson spreads so suddenly through the veins
to the heart that in an hour it causes death, unless he hath the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote</hi>
to expel the poyson, which is a Root called <hi>Snake-weed,</hi> which

               <p>This Weed is rank poyson if it be taken by any man that is not bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
unless it be <hi>Phisically</hi> compounded with other things. He that is
bitten by these Snakes, his fresh becomes as spotted as a Lepers, till he
be perfectly cured. She is naturally the most sleepy and unnimble Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that is, never offering to leap at, or bite any man, if he tread not
upon her: In hot weather they desire to lie in paths in the Sun, where
they sleep soundly; A small switch will easily kill them. If a Beast
be bitten, they cut his flesh in divers places, and thrust in this Weed,
which is a sure Cure.</p>
               <p>In many places of the Country there be none of them; As at <hi>Plimouth,
New-Town, &amp;c.</hi> In some places they live on one side the River, and if
they swim over, as soon as they come into the Woods, they turn up their
yellow bellies and die. <hi>Other Snakes there be, which yet never hurt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their
man or Beast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be also store of Froggs, which in the Spring time chirp, and
whistle like Birds, and in the end of Sommer croake like other Frogs.
There are also Toads that will creep to the top of Trees, and sit croaking
there to the wonderment of strangers. There be also Pismires, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but neither Fleshworms, nor Moles.</p>
               <p>There be wild Bees or Wasps that guard the Grapes, making her Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web
nest amongst the Leaves: Also a great Fly, like to our Horse flies,
which bite and fetch blood from man or beast, and are most trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
where most Cattel be.</p>
               <p>There is also a Gurnipper, which is a Fly as small as a Flea, and where
it bites it causes much itching, and scratching. Also the Muskito like to
our Gnats: Such as are bitten by them fall a scratching, which makes
their hands and faces swell; but this is only the first year, for they never
swell the second year. Here also are Flies called <hi>Cantharides,</hi> so much used
by Chirurgions; and divers sorts of Butterflies.</p>

               <p>The Country is divided (as it were) into Shires, every several Shire
under a several King. On the <hi>East,</hi> and <hi>North-East</hi> are the <hi>Churchers,</hi>
and <hi>Tarenteens.</hi> In the <hi>Southern</hi> parts are the <hi>Pequants,</hi> and <hi>Naragansets.</hi>
On the <hi>West</hi> are the <hi>Connectacuts,</hi> and <hi>Mowhacks.</hi> Those on the <hi>North</hi>

<hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Churchers are a cruel bloody people, which were wont to come
down upon their poor neighbours, bruitishly spoyling their Corn, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their houses, slaying their men, ravishing the Women, yea sometimes
eating a man, one part after another before his face whil'st he was alive:
But they say, they dare not meddle with a white faced man, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with his hotmouthed weapon. They are tall of stature, have long
grim Visages, slender wasted, and exceeding great arms and thighs,
wherein their strength lies; with a Fillip of their finger they will
kill a Dogg: They live upon Fruits, Herbs, and Roots, but that
which they most desire is Mans flesh.</p>
               <p>If they catch a stranger they keep him in as good plight as they can,
giving him their best fare, and daily pipe to him, paint him, and dance
about him, till at last they begin to eat him piece-meal: They are des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
in Wars, securing their bodies with Sea-horse Skins, and Barks of
Trees made impenitrable, wearing Head-pieces of the same: Their
Weapons are <hi>Tamahauks,</hi> which are Staves of two foot and a half long,
and a knob at the end as big as a Foot-ball; these they carry in their
right hand, and in their left a Javelin, or short spear headed with a sharp
Sea-horse Tooth; they are both deadly Weapons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tarenteens</hi> are little less savage, <hi>only they eat not mans flesh:</hi> They
are enemies to the <hi>Indians</hi> amongst the <hi>English,</hi> and kill as many of them
as they can meet with. They are the more insolent because they have
Guns, which they trade for with the <hi>French,</hi> who will sell his eyes, they
say, for Beaver. So soon as a Boat comes to an Anchor, they enquire
for Sack and strong Liquors, which they much affect ever since the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
traded it with them, so that they will scarce exchange their Beaver
for any thing else. <hi>These are wise, high spirited, constant in friendship
one to another, true in their promises, and more industrious than most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pequants</hi> are a stately Warlike People, just in their Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
requiters of Courtesies, and affable to the <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Narragansetz</hi> are the most numerous people in those parts, the

fetch all their Coin from them: As also they make curious Pendants
and Blacelets, and stone Pipes which hold a quarter of an ounce of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco;</hi>
these they make with Steel Drills, and other Instruments, and
so ingenuous they are, that they will imitate the <hi>English</hi> Mold so exactly
that were it not for matter and Colour you, could not distinguish them;
they make these Pipes of green or black stone; they made also Pots,
wherein they dressed their Victuals before they knew the use of our

thighs, flat knees, and small feet.</p>
               <p>Its beyond belief to conceive how such lusty bodies should be support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by such slender foot: Their houses are mean, their lodging as home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
their commons scant, their drink Water, and Nature their best cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
You shall never see any monstrous person amongst them, or one
whom sickness hath deformed, or casualty made decrepit; most are
fifty years old before a wrinkled brow, or Gray Hairs bewrayes their age:
their smooth Skins proceeds from the oft anointing their bodies with
Oyl of Fishes, and fat of Eagles, and Rackoones, which secures them
also against Muskitoes: Their black hair is Natural, but made more
jetty by oyling, dying, and daily dressing: Sometimes they wear long hair
like women, sometimes they tie it up short like a horse tail: their boyes
must not wear their hair long, till they be sixteen year old, and then
also but by degrees, some leave a foretop, others a long lock on the
crown, or one on each side the head, as best pleases their fancy: They
will not endure any Hair on their Chins, but scrub it up by the roots:
<hi>And if they see one with the appearance of a Beard, they say he is an</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<hi>mans Bastard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their cloathing is a piece of cloth of a yard and a half long put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their Groyns tied with Snake-skins about their middle, with a flap
before, and hanging like a tail behind. The more Aged in the Winter
wear Leather Drawers like <hi>Irish</hi> Trowzes; their shooes are of their own
making, cut out of a <hi>Mooses</hi> Hide; have and some skins which they cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them like <hi>Irish</hi> Mantles, being either Bear, Mooses, or Beaver-skins
sewed together, &amp;c. and in the Winter deep Fur'd Catskins, which
they wear upon that Arm that is most exposed to the weather. When
they are disposed to Trade, they choose a good course Blanket, or piece
of Broad Cloth, which they make a Coat of by Day, and a covering by
Night: They love not to be imprisoned in Cloaths after our Mode.
Though they be poor, yet are they proud, which discovers it self by their
affecting Ornaments, as Pendants in their Ears, forms of Birds, Beasts,
and Fishes carved out of Bones, Shels, and Stones, with long Bracelets of
their curiously wrought <hi>Wampompeag,</hi> and <hi>Mowhacks,</hi> which they wear
about their loins.</p>
               <p>Many of their better sort bear upon their cheeks the Pourtaictures
of Beasts, and Fowls, which they make by rasing of their skin with a
small sharp Instrument, under which they convey a kind of black unchage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Ink which makes them apparent and permanent: Others have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
down the out side of their Arms and Breasts like Stars, which
they imprint by searing Irons. A <hi>Sagamore</hi> with a Hum-bird in his Ear
for a Pendant, a black Hawke on his Head for a Plume, <hi>Mawhack</hi> instead
of a Gold Chain, store of <hi>Wampompeag</hi> about his Loins, his Bow in his

himself nothing inferiour to the great <hi>Cham,</hi> and will say that he is

               <head>Of their Diet, Cookery, Meal-times and Hospitality.</head>
               <p>In the Winter time they have all sorts of Fowls, Beasts, and Pond-fish,
with some Roots, <hi>Indian</hi> Beans, and Clams. In the Sommer they have
all manner of Sea Fish, with all sorts of Berries. These they roast or boil
in great Kettles, which they gat by trading with the <hi>French,</hi> and now of
the <hi>English:</hi> Before, they had good earthen Pots of their own making;
their Spits are cloven sticks sharpned at one end and thrust into the
ground, a dozen of them with Flesh and Fish about a fire, turning them
as they see occasion. This they present to their Guests, dishing it in a rude
manner, and set on the ground, without Linnen, Trenchers, or Knives;
to this they presently fall aboard without Bread, Salt, or Beer, lolling af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Turkish</hi> fashion, not ceasing till their full bellies leave empty plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Their <hi>Indian</hi> Corn they seeth whole, like Beans, eating three or
four corns with a mouthful of Fish or Flesh, filling up thinks with their
Broth.</p>
               <p>In Sommer when their Corn is spent <hi>Isquoterquashes</hi> is their best Bread,
like our young Pumpions. When our <hi>English</hi> invite them to meat, they
eat very moderately, though at home without measure. They all meet
friends at a Kettle, save their Wives, who attend at their backs for their
bony fragments. They keep no set meals, but when their store is spent,
they bite on the bit, till they meet with fresh supplies, their Wives
trudging to the Clam-banks when other Provision fails. Its the greatest
discourtesie you can shew them, not to eat of their Delicates, of which
they are as free as Emperors, and not to sup of their Broth made thick
with Fish, Fowl and Beasts, all boiled together.</p>

               <head>Of their Dispositions, good Qualities, as Friendship, Constancy,
Truth, and Affability.</head>
               <p>These <hi>Indians</hi> are of an Affable, Courteous, and well-disposed Nature,
ready to communicate the best of their wealth to the mutual good one
of another, and the less abundance they have, the more conspicuous is
their love, in that they are as willing to part with their mite in pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as their Treasure in Plenty. He that kills a Deer sends for his friends
and eats it merrily. <hi>He that receives but a piece of Bread from an</hi> English
<hi>hand, gives part of it to his</hi> Comrades, <hi>and they eat it together lovingly.</hi>
Yea, a friend can command a friends house, and whatsoever is his (sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Wife) and have it freely: and nothing sooner disjoyns them
than ingratitude, accounting an ungrateful person, a double Robber,
not only of a mans curtesie, but of his thanks, which he might have from
another for the same profered and received kindness. They so love each
other, that they cannot endure to see one of their Countrymen wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but will defend them stiffly, plead for them strongly, and justifie their
integrity in any warrantableaction.</p>
               <p>

They are true, and faithful to the <hi>English,</hi> and have been the disclosers
of all such treacheries as have been designed by other <hi>Indians</hi> against
them. If any roaving ship be upon the Coast, and chance to harbour in any
unusual Port, they will give the <hi>English</hi> notice of it, which hath been
no small advantage. When the <hi>English</hi> have travelled far into the Couu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
they readily entertain them into their houses, quarter them in their
Rooms, and provide for them the best victuals they can, and give them
kind entertainment, if it be for two or three weeks together. They are
also ready to guide them through the unbeaten Wildernesses, and if any
loose their way, they will not leave them till they have brought them
to their desired place.</p>
               <p>They are very careful to keep good correspondence with our <hi>English</hi>
Magistrates, being ready to execute any service which they require of
them. If any Malefactor withdraw himself from condigne punishment,
they will hunt him out, and not rest till they have delivered him up to
Justice. They are kind and affable, very wary with whom they enter
into friendship; nothing is more hateful to them than a churlish disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or dissimulation: They speak seldom, and then utter not many
words, and those they do, they deliver very gravely. They never fall
out amongst themselves, nor abuse each other in language. Yea, though
in Gaming they lose all their little all, yet is the Loser as merry as the
Winner, and they part good friends.</p>

               <head>Of their Hardness.</head>
               <p>Their hardness is to be admired, no ordinary pains causing them so
much to alter their Countenance: Beat them, whip them, pinch them,
punch them, if they resolve otherwise, they will not winch for it: and
though naturally they fear death, yet the unexpected approach of a
mortal wound by Sword, Bullet, &amp;c. strike no more terrour, causes no
more exclamation, no more complaint, than if it were a shot into the
Trunk of a Tree.</p>
               <p>Some have been shot in at the Mouth, and out under the Ear, others
into the Breast; others run through the flanks with Darts, others recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
desperate wounds, and yet, either by their rare skill in simples, or
by Charms have been cured in a short time. In the night they dare not
stir out of their houses, for fear of their <hi>Abamaco</hi> [the Devil] they
will rather lie by an <hi>English</hi> fire all night, than go a quarter of mile in
the dark to their own houses.</p>

               <p>They being strangers to Arts, are ravished at the first view of any new
Invention: They took the first Ship they saw for a mourning <hi>Island,</hi> the
Masts to be Trees, the Sails, white Clouds, and the discharging of great
Guns, to be Thunder and Lightning: But this moving Island being stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by its Anchor, they manned out their Canows to go and pick stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones
in it; but by the way, being saluted with a broad side, they cryed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51178:24"/>
out, <hi>with much hoggery, so big walk, and so big speak, and by and by kill;</hi>
this made them to turn back, and approach no more till they were sent
for. They wondred much at the first Wind Mill which the <hi>English</hi>
erected, for its strange whirking motion, and the sharp teeth, biting
the Corn so small, and its long Arms, neither durst they stay in so tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
a Tabernacle. The first Plowman they saw was accounted a
Jugler, the Plow tearing up more ground in a day, then their Clamshels
could scrape up in a moneth. yet are they so ingenious, and dexterous
in using the Ax or Hatchet, that probably they would soon learn any
Trade, were they not so much wedded to idleness; so that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
starve than work. In brief, they be wise in their carriage, subtile
in their Trading, true in their promise, just in paying their Debts:
Though their poverty may make them slow, yet are they sure: Some
having died in the <hi>English</hi> debt, have by <hi>Will</hi> left Beaver for their satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
They be constant in friendship, merrily conceited in Discourse,
not Luxurious, in Youth, nor froward in Old Age.</p>

no Courtlike attendance, nor sumptuous Pallaces, yet they account him

at his beck without questioning a reason, though the matter thwart

house, without any other Complements, they desire him to sit down on

that are present sit down by him, one of his Seniors making an Oration
gratulatory to his Majesty for his love, and the many good things they

               <p>A King of large Dominions hath his Vice-Royes under him to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage

their Laws, as their evil manners come short of other Nations, so they
need not so many Laws, yet some they have, which they inflict upon
notorious Malefactors, as Traytors, Murtherers, &amp;c. He that deserves
death, being apprehended, is brought before the King; and some of his
wisest men, and if upon trial he be found guilty, the Executioner comes
in, blindfolds him, and sets him in the publick, and brains him with a
Club; they have no other punishment save Admonitions, or reproofs for
smaller offences.</p>

and with loop holes through which they shoot their Arrows. In war
their only Weapons are Bows and Arrows, only their Captains have long

scraping them smooth with the shels of Clams, and Oysters, cutting
their out-sides with Hatchets of Stone: Others they make of Birch rinds,
which are so light that a man may carry one of them on his back. In
these tottering Boats they will go to Sea, scudding over the waves, row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with a Paddle: If a Wave turn her over, by swimming they turn her
up, and get into her again.</p>

them hence; yet when death approaches, and all hope of recovery is
past, then to see and hear their heavy sobbs, and deep fetched sighs, their
grieved hearts, and brinish tears, and doleful cryes, would fetch tears
from an heart of stone.</p>
               <p>Their grief being asswaged, they commit the bodies of their friends
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51178:26"/>
to the Earth, over whose grave for a long time they weep, groan, and
howl, continuing annual mournings, with a stiff black paint on their
faces: They mourn without hope, and yet hold the immortality of
the Soul, that it shall pass to the <hi>South-West Elysium,</hi> a kind of <hi>Paradise,</hi>
wherein they shall for ever abide, solacing themselves in Odoriferous
Gardens, fruitful Corn-fields, green Meddows, Bathing in cool streams
of pleasant Rivers, and shelter themselves from heat and cold in state-Pallaces
framed by Dame Nature; at the Portal of this Elisium they say
there lies a great Dogg, whose currish snarlings excludes unworthy

               <head>Of their Women, their Dispositions, Imployments, Vsage by their
Husbands, their Apparel, and Modesty.</head>
               <p>These <hi>Indians</hi> scorn the tutorings of their Wives, or to admit them
as their equals, though their qualities, and industry may justly claim the
preheminence, and command better usage, and more conjugal esteem,
their persons and features being every way correspondent, their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
more excellent, being more loving, pitiful, and modest, mild,
provident, and laborious than their lazy husbands. Their imployments
are many, for they build their houses in fashion like our Garden Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
but rounder, very strong and handsome, covered with close wrought
Mats of their own weaving, which deny entrance to a drop of Rain,
though it be fierce and long, neither can the <hi>North</hi> winds find a crany
whereat to enter; they be warmer then ours: At the top is a square
hole for the smoake to pass out, which is close covered in rainy weather:
Yet when they have a good fire, they are so smoky, that they are fain
to lie down under the smoake.</p>
               <p>Their Sommer houses when Families are dispersed upon divers occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
are less: their winter houses are fifty or sixty foot long; fourty
or fifty men lodging in one of them; and when their husbands require
it, the Wives are fain to carry their houses on their backs to Fishing
and Hunting places; or to a planting place, where it abides the longest.
The Wives also plant their corn, which they keep so clear from weeds,
with their Clam-shell Hooes, as if it were a Garden rather than a Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field;
neither suffering Weeds nor Worms to hurt it.</p>
               <p>Their Corn being ripe, they dry it in the Sun, and convey it into their
Barns, which be great holes digged in the ground like brass Pots, lining
them with Rinds of Trees, into which they put their Corn, covering
it from their Gurmundizing Husbands, who else would eat up all their
allowed portion, and reserved Seed if they knew where to find it. But
our <hi>English</hi> Hoggs having found a way to open their Barn-doors, and
to rob their Garners; they are fain to make use of their Husbands
help to rowl the bodies of Trees over them, to secure them against
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51178:26"/>
these Swine, whose thievery they hate as much as they do to eat
their flesh.</p>
               <p>Another of their imployments is, in their Sommer processions to get
Lobsters for their husbands, wherewith they bait their hooks when they
go a fishing for Bass &amp; Codfish. This is their every days walk be the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cold or hot, the Waters rough or calm, they must dive sometimes
over head and ears for a Lobster, which often shakes them by the hands,
with a churlish nip, and so bids them adieu. The Tide being spent
they trudg home two or three miles with an hundred weight of Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
on their backs, but if they meet with none, they have a hundred
scouls from their churlish Hsbands, and an hungry belly for two dayes
after.</p>
               <p>When their Husbands have caught any fish they bring it in their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nows
as far as they can by Water, and there they leave it, sending their
Wives to fetch it home, or they must fast, which done, they must dress
it, cook it, dish it, and present it, and see it eaten before their faces, and
their Loggerships having filled their paunches, their poor Wives must
scramble for their scraps. In the Sommer when Lobsters be in their
plenty and prime, these <hi>Indian</hi> women dry them to keep for Winter,
erecting Scaffolds in the hot Sun, and making fires underneath them, by
the Smoake whereof the flies are driven away, till the fish remain hard &amp;
dry: Thus also they dry Bass, and other Fishes without salt, cutting
them very thin that they may dry the sooner before the Flies spoil them,
or the Rain wet them, having a great care to hang them in their smoaky
houses in the night, and dankish weather.</p>
               <p>In Sommer also they gather <hi>Flags,</hi> of which they make Mats for Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
also <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Rushes</hi> with dying stuff, of which they make curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Baskets</hi> with intermingled colours, and <hi>Pourtraictures</hi> of Antique
Imagery. These <hi>Baskets</hi> are of all sizes, from a Quart to a Quarter, in
which they carry their Luggage.</p>
               <p>In Winter they are their Husbands Caterers, trugging to the Clam-banks
for their belly-timber: they are also their porters to lug home their
Venison, which their laziness exposeth to the Wolves, till their Wives im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it upon their shoulders. They also sew thir husbands shooes, and
weave Turkey Feathers for them, besides all their housholds drudgery
which daily goes through their hands, and a big belly hinders no bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
nor doth their childbirth hinder much time, but the young child
being greased and sooted, wrapped up in a Beavers Skin, bound to his
good behaviour, with his feet up to his Bum, upon a board two foot long,
and one foot broad, his face being exposed to the most nipping wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this little <hi>Pappouse</hi> travels about with his barefooted Mother, to
paddle in the Icy Clamb-banks, being not above three or four dayes
old.</p>
               <p>The womens carriage is very Civil, smiles being the greatest grace of
their mirth. Their Musick is <hi>Lullabies</hi> to quiet their Children,
who yet are generally as quiet as if they had neither Spleen nor Lungs.
To hear one of these <hi>Indian</hi> Women unseen, a good ear might easily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
their untaught voice for the warbling of a well tuned Instrument.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51178:27"/>
Their modesty suggest them to wear more cloathes than their Husbands,
having alwayes a short Coat of cloth, or Skin wrapped like a Blanket a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their loins reaching to their hams, which they never put off in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>If a husband sels his Wives Beaver Petticote, as sometimes he doth,
she will not put it off, till she hath another to put on. Their mild car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and obedience to their husbands is very commendable; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all their churlishness, and salvage inhumanity towards them, yet
will they not frown, nor offer to word it with their Lords, nor presume
to proclaim their superiority to the usurping of the least tittle of their
Husbands charter, but are contentedly quiet with their helpless condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
esteeming it to be the Womans portion.</p>
               <p>Since the arrival of the <hi>English</hi> comparison hath made their yoake
more miserable: For seeing the kind usage of the <hi>English</hi> men towards
their wives, they cannot but as much condemn their own husbands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness,
as they commend the <hi>English</hi> mens love. But in the mean
time, their husbands commend themselves for their wit in keeping their
wives in subjection, and to labour as much as they condemn the <hi>English</hi>
husbands for their indulgence and folly in spoiling such good working
creatures.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Indian</hi> women do oft resort to the houses of the <hi>English</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
those of their own Sex, they do somewhat ease their misery by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of their thraldom, and seldom part without some relief; and
if their husbands come to seek for their <hi>Spaws</hi>(for so they call all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)
and do begin to bluster for their idleness, the <hi>English</hi> woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
her to her Arms, which are the warlike Ladle, and the scalding Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
threatning blistering to the naked Runaway, who is soon dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
back by such hot comminations. In a word, the love of these wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to the <hi>English,</hi> deserves no small esteem, whom they are ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
with something that is rare or desired, as Strawberries, Hurtleber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Rasberries, Gooseberries, Cherries, Plums, Fish, and such other gifts
as their poor Treasury affords.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>New Englands Prospect. Of their Religion.</head>
               <p>The Natives of <hi>New-England</hi> conceive of many Divine powers:<note place="margin">The good God,</note> but
one whom they call <hi>Keihtan</hi>(they say) is the principal, and maker of
all the rest, and himself is made by none. He created the Heavens, Earth,
Sea, and all Creatures contained therein. He also made one man and
one Woman, of whom oll mankind came. But how they came to be
so far dispersed, they know not. At first (they say) there was no
<hi>Sachem</hi> or King, but <hi>Keihtan,</hi> who dwells above the Heavens, whither
all good men go when they die to see their friends, and have their fill
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51178:27"/>
of all thins. Thither bad men go also, and knock at his door, but he
bids them <hi>walk abroad,</hi> for there is no piace for such, so that they wander
in restless want, and penury. Never man saw this <hi>Kiehtan;</hi> only old
men tell them of him, and bid them tell their children; yea, to charge
them to tell it to their posterities, and to lay the like charge upon them.
This power they acknowledge to be good; and when they would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any great matter, they meet together, and cry unto him; and when
they have plenty and victory, &amp;c. they sing, dance, give thanks, and
hang up Garlands in memory thereof.</p>
               <p>Another power they worship called <hi>Hobbamock,</hi> which is the Devil;
Him they call upon to cure their wounds, and Diseases. And when they
are curable, he perswades them that he sends the same for some concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
anger against them; but upon their calling upon him, he can, and
doth help them. But when they are mortal and incurable, he tells
them that <hi>Kiehtan</hi> is angry, and sends them, whom none can cure, which
makes them doubt whether he be simply good, and therefore in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
they never call upon him. This <hi>Hobbamock</hi> appears in sundry
forms unto them; As in the shape of a Man, a Deer, a Fawn, an Eagle,
&amp;c. But most ordinarily like a snake. He appears not to all, but to
the chiefest, and most judicious amongst them, though all of them strive
to attain that Hellish honor. He chiefly appears to three sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
Of the first Rank they are few, and they are highly esteemed of,
and they think that no weapon can kill them: The second sort are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Powahs:</hi> and the third <hi>Priests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Powahs</hi> chief Office is to call upon the Devil, and to cure the
sick and wounded. The common people joyn with him in his Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by saying <hi>Amen</hi> to what he saith. The <hi>Powah</hi> is eager and free
in speech, fierce in countenance, and joyneth many Antick and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
gestures with the same over the party diseased. If the party be
wounded, they suck his wounds; but if they be curable, the Snake or
Eagle sits on his shoulders and licks the same. Him none sees but the
<hi>Powah.</hi> If the party be otherwise diseased, its sufficient if in any shape
he but comes into the house, and it is an undoubted sign of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Powahs</hi> in their speech promise to sacrifice many Skins of Beasts,
Kettles, Hatchets, Beads, Knives, and the best things they have to the
Fiend, if he help the diseased party. When women are in desperate and
extraordinary hard travel in in Child-birth, they send for the <hi>Powahs</hi> to
help them. Many sacrifices they use, and sometimes kill their Children.
The <hi>Nanohiggansets</hi> exceed in their blind Devotion, and have great
spacious houses, into which their Priests only come. Thither at certain
times most of the People resort and sacrifice almost all their riches to
their gods, as Kettles, Skins, Hatchets, Beads, Knives, &amp;c. all which
the Priest casts into a great fire made in the midst of that house, where
they are consumed. To this Offering every man brings freely, and he
that brings most, is best esteemed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Priests</hi> are men of great courage and wisdom, and to these the
Devil also appears more familiarly than to others, and covenants with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51178:28"/>
them to preserve them from death by wounds of Arrows, Knives, Hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
&amp;c. One of these will chase almost an hundred of their enemies: They
are highly esteemed of all, and are of the <hi>Sachems</hi> Councel, without
whom he will neither make War, nor undertake any great matter. In
War the <hi>Sachems</hi> for their more safety, go in the midst of them. They
are usually men of the greatest stature and strength, and such as will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
most hardness, and yet are discreet, and courteous in their carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<note place="margin">How they increase the Priests.</note> scorning theft, lying, and base dealing, and stand as much upon
their Reputation as any men. And to encrease the number of these, they
train up the likeliest Boyes from their Childhood unto great hardness,
and cause them to abstain from dainty meat, and to observe divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Rules, to the end that the Devil may appear to them when
they are of age. They also cause them to drink the Juice of Centuary,
and other bitter Herbs, till they vomit it into a platter, which they must
drink again, till at length, through extraordinary pressing of Nature, it
looke like blood: And this the Boyes will do at first eagerly, and so
continue, till by reason of faintness they can scarce stand on their leggs,
and then they must go forth into the cold. Also they beat their shins
with sticks, and cause them to run through Bushes, Stumps, and Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to make them hardy and acceptable to the Devil, that so in time he
may appear unto them.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Sachems</hi> are not all Kings,<note place="margin">Their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> but only some few of them, to whom
the rest resort for protection, and pay them Homage: Neither may they
make War without their knowledge and approbation. Every <hi>Sachim</hi>
takes care for the Widdows, Fatherless, Aged, or maimed, if their friends
be dead, or not able to provide for them. A <hi>Sachim</hi> will not marry any
but such as are equal in birth to him, lest his Seed prove ignoble; and
though they have many other wives, yet are they but Concubines, or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and yield obedience to the Queen, who orders the Family, and
them in it. The other Subjects do the same, and will adhere to the
first during their lives, but put away the other at their pleasure.
Their Government is successive, not elective. If the <hi>Sachims</hi> child be
young when his Father dies, he is committed to the Protection, and
Tuition of some one amongst them, who rules for him till he be of
age.</p>
               <p>Every <hi>Sachem</hi> knows the bounds and limits of his Kingdom,<note place="margin">They maintain their Kings.</note> out of
which, if any of his men desire Land wherein to set their Corn, he gives
them as much as they can use. In these limits, he that Hunts and kills
any Venison, gives the <hi>Sachim</hi> his Fee; if it be killed on the Land, he
hath part of the flesh; if in the water, then the Skin only: The great
<hi>Sachems</hi> or Kings know not their bounds so well. All Travellers or
Strangers usually lie at the <hi>Sachims</hi> house, and when they come, they
tell them how long they will stay, and whither they are going; during
which time they are entertained according to their quality. Once a
year the <hi>Priests</hi> provoke the People to bestow much Corn on the <hi>Sachim,</hi>
and accordingly at a certain time and place, the people bring many
Baskets of Corn, and make a great Stack thereof near to the <hi>Sachems</hi>
house. There the <hi>Priests</hi> stands ready to return them thanks in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51178:28"/>
name of the <hi>Sachim,</hi> who fetches the same, and is no less thankful,
bestowing many gifts upon them.</p>
               <p>When any are visited with sickness,<note place="margin">Their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> their friends resort to them to
comfort them, and oft continue with them till death or recovery; If they
dye they stay to mourn for them, which they perform night and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for many dayes after their Burial: But if they recover, because their
sickness was chargeable, they send them Corn and other gifts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they Feast, and Dance.<note place="margin">Their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and mournings</note> When they bury their dead, they sew
the Corps up in a Mat, and so bury it. If a <hi>Sachim</hi> dyes, they cover him
with many curious Mats, and bury all his Riches with him, and inclose
the Grave with a Pale. If it be a child, the Father will put all his own
special Jewels, and Ornaments into the grave with it: Yea, he will cut
his Hair, and disfigure himself, in token of his great sorrow. If it be the
Master or Dame of the Family, they will pull down the Mats, and leave
the Frame of the house standing, and bury them in, or near the same,
and either remove their Dwelling, or give over house-keeping.</p>
               <p>The younger sort reverence the Elder,<note place="margin">Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</note> and do all mean Offices for
them when they are together, though they be strangers. Boyes and
Girls may not wear their hair like men and women, but are distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby. One is not accounted a man, till he doth some notable act,
and shews his Courage and Resolution answerable to his place: The
men take much Tobacco, but its counted very odious in a Boy so to
do.</p>
               <p>All their Names are significant and variable.<note place="margin">Their names of their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, Their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> For when they come
to be men and women, they alter them according to their deeds, or
dispositions. When a Maid is given in Marriage, she first cuts her hair,
and then wears a covering on her head till her hair is grown again. Of
their Women some are so modest, that they will scarce talk together
whilst men are by, and are very chast: Others are light, lascivious, and
wanton. If a Woman hath a bad Husband, or affect him not; If there
be War between that and any other people, she will run away from
him to the contrary party, where she never wants welcome; for where
there be most women, there is most plenty.</p>
               <p>When a Woman hath her Courses,<note place="margin">Their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty.</note> she retires her self from all other
company, and lives in a house apart; After which she washes her self,
and all that she hath touched or used, after which she is received into
her Husbands Bed or Family. The Husband will beat his Wife, or put
her away for Adultery. Yet some common Strumpets there are, but
they are such as either were never married, or are Widdows, or
that have been put away for Adultery: For no man will take such an
one to wife.</p>
               <p>In matters of injustice or dishonest dealing, the <hi>Sachim</hi> examines and
punisheth the same.<note place="margin">Their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.</note> In cases of theft; For the first offence he is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully
rebuked: For the second, he is beaten by the <hi>Sachim</hi> with a
Cudgle on the naked back: For the third, he is beaten with many stripes,
and hath his Nose slit, that all men may both know and shun him. If
one kill another, he certainly dies for it. The <hi>Sachim</hi> not only senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the Malefactor, but executeth the same with his own hands, if
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51178:29"/>
the party be present, otherwise he sends his own Knife, if he be senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to dye by the hands of another that executes the same. But if the
Offender be to receive any other punishment, he will not receive it but
from the <hi>Sachim</hi> himself, before whom being naked, he kneels, and
will not offer to run away, though he beat him never so much, it being
a greater disparagement for a man to cry when he is corrected, than was
his offence and punishment.</p>
               <p>They are a very witty and ingenious people:<note place="margin">Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</note> They keep account of
the time by the Moon, or by Sommers or Winters; They know divers
of the Stars by name: They have also many names for the Winds:
They will guess shrewdly at the Wind and Weather before hand, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
in the Heavens.</p>
               <p>Their Language is very copious and large,<note place="margin">Their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</note> and hard to be learned;
And though in an hundred miles distance their Languages differ, yet
not so much, but they can understand each other.</p>
               <p>Instead of Records and Chonicles,<note place="margin">Their Chonicles.</note> where any Remarkable Act is done,
in memory of it, either in the very place, or by some Path neer adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they make a round hole in the Ground a foot deep, and as much
over, which, when others passing by, behold, they enquire the cause
and occasion of it, which being once known, they carefully acquaint
others with it. And lest such holes should be filled, as men pass
by, they will oft renew them. So that if a man travels, and can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

               <p>You have heard before of the State of <hi>New-England</hi> in the year 1633.
when she was but in her childhood, but being now grown up to more
maturity; Take this account of it, which was written by a Reverend
Minister, in <hi>January 1668/9,</hi> who had lived there 40. years, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath great reason, and good opportunities to be acquainted with
the condition of it.</p>
               <p>WHen we came first to <hi>New-England</hi> in the year 169. there
was then but one Town in the Country, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>New-Plimmouth,</hi>
which had stood alone for nine years. From that time to
this year now beginning 1669. is just fourty years; in which time there
has been an increase of fourty Churches in this Colony (but many
more in the rest.) And Towns in all <hi>New-England,</hi> 120. which for the
most part lie along the Sea Coast for somewhat more than two hundred
miles; only upon <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, there are thirteen Towns lying
neer together; and about the <hi>Massacusets Bay,</hi> here are above thirty
Towns within two, three, four, or five miles asunder. And from the Sea,
which hath rendred <hi>Boston</hi> a very considerable place, and the <hi>Metropolis</hi>
of <hi>New-England,</hi> all the other Towns on the Sea Coast, and those in the
Country depending upon it. I have lately heard some Merchants that
knew old <hi>Boston,</hi> say that this is far bigger, and hath ten times more
Trade than that, having many Ships and Catches, and they say no less
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51178:29"/>
than an hundred Catches went from the Country this winter to trade in
<hi>Virginia;</hi> besides many others to the <hi>West Indies,</hi> and to several parts
of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was doubted for some years, whether there would be a staple Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
in <hi>New-England;</hi> but God and time have shewed many, as Furs,
Fish, Masts, Pipestaves, and Deal-board, and such plenty of Corn and
Cattel, that abundance of Provision has been yearly transported for the
supply of <hi>English</hi> Plantations, the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and other parts; in so much
as though many Gentlemen of great Estates in the first year spent their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
and some of them that were very brave men of publick spirits, were
brought very low, both they and theirs: Yet in the latter years, many
that have risen out of the dust, by a way of Trading and Merchandising,
have grown unto great Estates; some to ten, others to twenty, yea thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or fourty thousand pound estate.</p>
               <p>In the year 1643. began the combination of the united Colonies of
<hi>New-England,</hi> which have much encrersed since then; every one of them
having their distinct Pattents, except <hi>New-Haven,</hi> which for want of a
Pattent, was since the coming in of our King, taken into the Colony of
<hi>Connecticut;</hi> And though very many of the first commers are now dead
and gone, yet there is grown up such a numerous Posterity here, that it's
thought there are twenty times more <hi>English</hi> people now in the Country,
then ever came into it. And it's believed by many observing men, that
there are many above ten hundred thousand souls. Most of the first
Magistrates are dead, and not above two left in the <hi>Massacusets;</hi>
but one in <hi>Plymouth,</hi> one at <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and not one at <hi>New-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There came over from <hi>England</hi> at several times, chiefly before the
year 1640. ninety fore Ministers, of which twenty seven returned to
<hi>England</hi> again, and there are now dead in the Country thirty six; and
as yet living in the Country thirty one. The Ministers bred up in <hi>New-England,</hi>
are one hundred thirty two, of which two are dead in the
Country, fourty one have removed to <hi>England,</hi> most of them from our
Colledges, besides other Schollars that have in <hi>England</hi> turned to other
Professions, and eighty one that are now living in the Country, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the Ministery in several places.</p>
               <p>There have been several <hi>Synods</hi> in <hi>New-England;</hi> The first at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
in the year 1637. wherein the <hi>Antinomian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Familistical</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
were confuted and condemned by the Word of God. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in the year 1646. wherein the Magistrates power
and Duty in Matters of Religion, and the Nature and Power of
<hi>Synods</hi> was cleared. The third, in the year 1648. where it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that in Point of Doctrine, these Churches consented to the
Confession of Faith, put forth by the <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>Westminster;</hi> and in
Point of Discipline, the Platform of the Discipline of these Churches,
was then published. The fourth was at <hi>Boston</hi> in the year 1662. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Subject of <hi>Baptism,</hi> and Consociation of Churches.</p>
               <p>

It hath pleased the Lord to give such a blessing to the Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Indians,</hi> that in divers places there are not only many
civilized, but divers that are truly Godly, and shame the <hi>English,</hi>
and are much hated by others of their own Country men, though
that Work has met with many Obstructions and Remoraes; chiefly by
the Death of some of the Choicest Instruments, and many of the best
of the <hi>Indians;</hi> Yet it may be well believed, that there is such a
Seed of the Gospel scattered among them, which will grow unto
a further Harvest in God's time.</p>

OF

With an Account of the
Trees, Plants, Herbs, Roots, Fowls, Birds, Beasts,
Fishes, Insects, &amp;c. As also of their Sugar-Canes, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genio's
and manner of making their Sugars.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first Discovery made of this Island was by a Ship of
Sir <hi>William Curte'us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Barbadoes first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</note> which returning from <hi>Pernambock</hi>
in <hi>Brasile,</hi> being driven by foul Weather upon this
Coast, chanced to fall upon this Island, which is not far
out of the way, being one of the most Windwardly
Islands of all the <hi>Carribies;</hi> and Anchoring before it,
they stayed some time to inform themselves of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of of the place, which by tryals in several places, they found to
be so over grown with Wood, as that there could be no Champion
Ground discovered wheron to Plant; Nor found they any Beasts, or
Cattel there, save Hoggs, whereof there were abundance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugals</hi> having long before put some on shore for breed,<note place="margin">Hoggs found there.</note> in
case they should at any time by foul Weather be driven to, or cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51178:32"/>
on this Island, that so they might there find fresh meat to serve them upon
such an exigence.<note place="margin">Hunted by the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </note> And the Fruits and Roots that grew there, afforeded
them so great plenty of food, that now they were multiplied abundantly.
In so much as the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Leeward Islands that were within sight,<note place="margin">Fine Pots.</note>
coming thither in their Canoos, and finding such Game to hunt as these
Hoggs were, whose flesh was so sweet, and excellent in tast, they came
often thither a hunting, staying sometimes a moneth together before
they returned home, leaving behind them certain tokens of their being
there, which were Pots of several sizes made of Clay, so finely
tempered, and turned with such Art, as the like to them for fineness
of Mettle, and curiosity of turning, are not made in <hi>England,</hi> in which
they boiled their meat.</p>
            <p>This discovery being made,<note place="margin">The first Painters.</note> and advice thereof sent to their friends in
<hi>England;</hi> other ships were sent with Men, Provisions, and Working
Tools, to cut down the Woods, and clear the Ground wherein to plant
Provisions for their sustentation, till then, finding Food but straglingly
in the Woods. But when they had cleared some quantity of Land,
they Planted <hi>Potato's, Plantines,</hi> and <hi>Maies,</hi> or <hi>Indian Wheat,</hi>
with some other Fruits, which together with the Hoggs, which they
found there, served only to keep life and soul together. And their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
from <hi>England</hi> coming so slow, and so uncertainly, they were oft dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to great extremities: And the Tobacco that grew there, was so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and worthless, as that it gave them little or no return from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or other places; so that for a while they lingered in a doubtful
condition. For the Woods were so thick, and most of the Trees so
large and massy, as that they were not to be faln by so few hands: And
when they were laid along, the Boughs were so thick and and unweldy,
as required more help of strong and active men to lop, and remove
them off the ground; which continued so for many years, in somuch
as they Planted <hi>Potato's, Maies,</hi> and <hi>Bonavists</hi> between the Boughs as the
Trees lay on the ground.</p>
            <p>Yet not long after they planted <hi>Indigo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Indico Planted. Cotton, and Fus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</note> and ordered it so well, as that
it <hi>sold</hi> in <hi>London</hi> at very good Rates: And their <hi>Cotten Woll,</hi> and <hi>Fustick
Wood,</hi> proved very good and staple Commodities: So that having these
four sorts of commodities, to traffique with all; Some Ships were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in hope of gain by that Trade, to come and visit them, bringing for
exchange, such Commodities as they wanted, to wit, Working-Tools,
Iron, Steel, Clothes, Shirts, Drawers, Hose and Shooes, Hats, and more
Hands. So that beginning to find good by this Trade, they set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
hard to work, and lived in much better condition.</p>
            <p>But when their Sugar-Canes had been planted three or four years,<note place="margin">Sugar Canes planted.</note>
they found that to be the principal Plant whereby to raise the value of
the whole Island; and therefore bent all their endeavours to improve
their knowledge and skill in Planting them, and making Sugar.
Which knowledg, though they studied hard, was long in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>This Island which we call <hi>Barbado's</hi> lies in thirteen Degrees and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thirty Minutes of Northern Latitude:<note place="margin">The scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Island.</note> The usual Bay into
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51178:30"/>
which Ships put, is <hi>Carlile Bay,</hi> which without exception is the best in
the Island, and is somewhat more than a League over, and from the
Points of the Land to the bottom of the Bay,<note place="margin">The chief Towns unhealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> is twice as much.</p>
            <p>Upon the innermost part of this Bay stands a Town called the <hi>Bridge;</hi>
for that a long Bridge was at first made over a little Nook of the Sea,
which yet indeed is rather a Bogg than a Sea. This Town is ill scituated;
the Planters looking more after conveniencie than health. But one
house being erected, another was set up by it for Neighbourhood, and
than a third, and a fourth, till at last it became a Town: Divers storehouses
were also built there wherein, to stow their goods, being so neer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for the Harbour. But their great oversight was to build a
Town in so unhealthfull a place. For the ground being somewhat
lower within the Land than the Sea banks are, the Spring-Tides flow
over, and so remain there, making much of that flat a kind of Bog, or
Marish, which sends out so loathsome a Savour, as cannot but breed ill
blood, and probably is the occasion of much sickness to those that live
there.</p>
            <p>The ground on either side this <hi>Bay</hi> (but chiefly that to the <hi>Eastward)</hi>
is much firmer, and lies higher, and therefore with some charge, may be
made as convenient as the Bridge, and much more healthfnl.</p>
            <p>Three more <hi>Bayes</hi> there be of note in this Island.<note place="margin">The Baies.</note> One to the <hi>Eastward</hi>
of this, which they call <hi>Austins Bay:</hi> The other are to the West of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile-Bay.</hi>
The first whereof is called <hi>Mackfields Bay;</hi> the other <hi>Spikes
Bay;</hi> but neither of these three are environed with Land, as <hi>Carlile Bay</hi> is;
but being to the Leeward of the Island, and of good Anchorage, they
seldome are in danger, unless in the time of the <hi>Turnado,</hi> when the
Winds turn about to the South; And then if they be not well moved,
the Ships are subject to fall foul one upon another, and sometimes are
driven a ground. For the Leeward part of the Island, being rather
shelvy than Rocky, they are seldom or never cast away.</p>
            <p>The leng the hot Island is twenty eight miles,<note place="margin">The big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Island. Ils beauty</note> and the breadth in some
places seventeen miles, in others twelve; so that they make about three
hundred nitety two square miles in the whole Island. It rises highest
in the middle, so that when you come within sight of this happy Island,
the nearer you come, the more beautiful it appears to the Eye. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it self exceeding beautiful, it's best discerned, and best judged of
when your eyes become full Mistris of the Object. There you may
see the high, large, and lofty Trees with their spreading branches, and
flourishing tops, which seem to be beholding to the Earth and Roots
that gave them such plenty of sap for their Nourishment, which makes
them grow to that perfection of beauty and largeness: Whil'st they by
way of gratitude return their cool shade to secure and shelter the Earth
from the Suns heat, which otherwise would scorch and dry it up. So
that Bounty and Goodness in the one, and Gratefulness in the other,
serve to make up this Beauty, which alwayes would lie empty and
waste.</p>
            <p>By the Commodity of the Scituation of this Island, which is highest
in the midst, the Inhabitants within have these advantages. First, a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51178:31"/>
free prospect into the Sea; then a reception of a opure and refreshing air,
and Breezes that come from thence: The Plantations overlooking one
another, so as the more in most parts are not debarred, nor restrained of
their liberties of the view to the Sea by those that dwell between them
and it.</p>
            <p>Whil'st the Sun is in the <hi>Aequinoctial,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The length of the Days</note> or within ten degrees of either
side, there is little change in the length of the dayes, for at six and six
the Sun rises and sets: But when its nearer the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi>
and in thirty seven degrees from them, then the dayes are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
shorter, and this shortning begins about the end of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eight Moneths in the year the Weather is very hot,<note place="margin">The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.</note> yet not scald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but that Servants, both Christians and Slaves labour and travel ten
hours in a day. For as the Sun rises, there rises with it a cool Brees of
Wind; and the higher, and hotter the Sun rises, the stronger and cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the Breeses are, and blow alwaeis from the <hi>North-East</hi> and by <hi>East,</hi>
except in the time of the <hi>Turnado:</hi> For then it sometimes chops about
into the <hi>South</hi> for an hour or two, and so returns about again to the
Point where it was.</p>
            <p>The other four Moneths it is not so hot, but is near the temper of
the Air in <hi>England</hi> in the midst of <hi>May.</hi> And though in the hot sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the Planters sweat much, yet do they not find that faintness which
we find in <hi>England</hi> in the end of <hi>July,</hi> or in the beginning of <hi>August.</hi>
But with this heat, there is such a moisture as must of necessity cause the
Air to be unwholsome.</p>
            <p>The Planters there are s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eldom thirsty, unless they over heat their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
with extraordinary labour,<note place="margin">Diseases,</note> or with drinking strong drink, as our
<hi>English</hi> Spririts, or <hi>French</hi> Brandy, or the drink of the <hi>Island,</hi> which is
made of the scummings of the Coppers that boil the Sugar, which they
call <hi>Kill-devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For though some of these be needful in such hot Countries when they
are used temperately, yet the immoderate use of them over-heats the
bodie, which causeth Costiveness, and Gripings in the Bowels; which
is a Disease that is very frequent there, and hardly cured, and of which
many die. Their blood also is thinner and paler than ours in <hi>England:</hi>
Nor is their Meat so well relished as it is with us, but flat and insipid;
the Hogs-flesh only excepted, which is as good as any in the World.
Their Horses and Cattel seldom drink, and when they do, its but
in a little quantity, except they be over heated with work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>The moisture of the Air causes all their <hi>Knives,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the air.</note> 
               <hi>Tweeses, Keys,
Needles, Swords, &amp;c.</hi> to rust, and that in an instant. For if you grind
your rusty Knife upon a Grind-stone, wipe it dry, and put it into your
sheath, and pocket, in a little time after draw it again, and you shall
find it beginning to rust all over; which in longer time will eat into the
Steel and spoil the Blade. Locks also which are not often used, will
rust in the Wards and become useless. And Clocks and Watches will
seldom or never go true, and all this is occasioned by the moistness of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51178:32"/>
the Air. This great heat and moisture together is certainly the cause
that <hi>Trees</hi> and Plants, grow to such a vast height, and largeness as they
do there.</p>
            <p>There is nothing so much wanting in this Island as <hi>Springs</hi> and <hi>Rivers</hi>
of Waters;<note place="margin">A want of water. The only River or Lake.</note> there being but very few, and those small and inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
There is but one River, which may yet be termed rather a Lake
than a River. The Springs that run into it are never able to fill it: And
out-let to the Sea it hath none; but at Spring-Tides the Sea comes in
and fills it, and at Neep-Tide it cannot run out again, the Sea-banks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
higher than it. Yet some of it issues out through the Sand, and
leaves a mixture of fresh and salt water behind it.</p>
            <p>Sometimes these Spring-tides bring some Fishes into it, which will
remain there, being more willing to live in this mixt water, then in the
salt.</p>
            <p>Sometimes there have been taken in it Fishes as big as <hi>Salmons,</hi>
which have been over-grown with fat and very sweet and firm. But
Fish is not often taken in this place, by reason that the whole Lake
is filled with <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Roots,</hi> so that no Net can be drawn, nor
Hook laid, without danger of breaking and losing.</p>
            <p>The River or Lake reaches not within Land above twelve score
yards, and there is no part of it so broad, but that you may cast a Coit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it.</p>
            <p>The Spring-tides about this Island seldom rise above four or five foot
upright. Into these Rivolets there come from the Sea little Lobsters,
but wanting the great Claws before,<note place="margin">Excellent Lobsters.</note> they are the sweetest, and fullest
of Fish that can be eaten.</p>
            <p>But the water which the people in this Island most relie upon, is rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,
<note place="margin">Their ponds.</note> which they keep in Ponds, and have descents to them, so that
what falls upon other grounds about, may run into them; the bottom
of these Ponds are Clay. For if the water find any leak to the Rocky
part, it gets into the clifts and sinks in an instant. About the end of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
these Ponds are filled, and with the help they have by weekly
showers, they mostly continue so, yet sometimes they find a want. This
water they use upon all occasions, and to all purposes, as to boil
their Meat, to make their Drink, to wash their Linnen, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In these <hi>Ponds</hi> are neither Fish nor Fry, nor any living or moving
things, except some <hi>Flies</hi> that fall into them; but the water is clear and
well tasted; here their Cattel drink also. They also save rain water
from the houses, by Gutters at the Eves which carries it down into
Cisterns.</p>
            <p>If any tumult or disturbance be in the Island,<note place="margin">Speedy warning of dangers</note> the next neighbour to
it discharges a Musquet, which gives an Allarum to the whole Island.
For upon the report of that, the next shoots, and so the next, and the
next, ill it go through all, and upon hearing of this all make ready.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of their Bread.</head>
               <p>Bread which is the staff and stay of mans life,<note place="margin">Bread of C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssury.</note> is not so good here as in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51178:33"/>
                  <hi>England;</hi> Yet do they account it both nourishing and strengthening.
It's made of the root of a small Tree or Shrub, which is called <hi>Cussary.</hi>
This Root is large and round, like the body of a small Still, and as they
gather it, they cut sticks or blanches that grow neerest to it of the same
Tree, which they put into the ground, and they grow: So that as they
gather one, they plant another.</p>
               <p>This Root when its first gathered is an absolute poison, and yet by
good ordering it becomes wholesome and nourishing. First, they wash
it clean, and lean it against a wheel, whose sole is about a foot broad,
covered with Latine made rough like a greater. This Wheel is turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with the foot, as Cutlers use to turn theirs, and as it grates the
Root, it falls down into a large Trough which is appointed to receive it.
This they put into a strong piece of double Canvas, or Sack-cloth, and
press it so hard, that all the juice is squeezed out, and then drying it in
the Sun, its fit to make Bread, which they do after this manner.</p>
               <p>They have a Plate of Iron round,<note place="margin">How its made.</note> about twenty inches in the <hi>Diameter,</hi>
a little hollowed in the mid'st, with three feet like a Pot, above six inches
high, that they may keep fire under. They heat this <hi>Pone</hi> (as they call
it) so hot as that it may bake but not burn. Then the <hi>Indians</hi> (who
are best acquainted with the making of it) cast the Meal upon the <hi>Pone</hi>
the whole breadth of it, and put it down with their hands, and it will
presently stick together, and when they think that that side is enough,
they turn it with a thing like a Battle-dore; and so turn and re-turn it
till it be enough, which is presently done. Then laying it upon a flat
boord, they make others, till they have made enough for the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
They make it as thin as a Wafer, and yet purely white and crisp.
Salt they never use in it, though probably it would give it a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.
They can hardly make Py-crust of it; For as they knead, or roul
it, it will crack or chop, so that it will not hold any Liquor, neither
with, nor without Butter or Eggs.</p>
               <p>There is another sort of Bread which is mixed, being made of the
flower of <hi>Maise,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bread of Maise, and Cussary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> and <hi>Cussary:</hi> For the <hi>Maise</hi> of its self will make no
Bread, it is so extream heavy: But these two being mixed, they make it
into large Cakes two inches thick, which tastes most like to our <hi>English</hi>
Bread. Yet the <hi>Negroes</hi> use the <hi>Maise</hi> another way. For they tost the
ears of it at the fire, and so eat it warm off the fire.</p>
               <p>The Christian Servants are fed with this <hi>Maise,</hi> who pound it in a
large Morter, and boil it in water to the thickness of Frumentry,
and then put it into a Tray and so eat it; they give it them cold, and
scarce afford them salt to it;<note place="margin">Lob-Lolly</note> This they call <hi>Lob-lolly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third sort of Bread which they use, is only Potatoes, which are
the dryest, and largest which they can choose, and this is the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sort of Bread used at the Planters Tables.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of their Drink.</head>
               <p>Their Drink is of sundry sorts.<note place="margin">Potatoes used for Bread. Their drink <hi>Mob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> how made.</note> The first, and that which is most used in
the Island is <hi>Mobby;</hi> a Drink made of <hi>Potatoes;</hi> thus,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51178:33"/>
They put the Potatoes into a Tub of water, and with a Broom wash them
clean; Then taking them out, they put them into a large Brass or Iron
Pot, and put to them so much water as will only cover a third part of
them, then covering the Pot close with a thick double cloth, that no
steam can get out, they stew them over a gentle fire, and when they are
enough, take them out, and with their hands squeeze and break them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
small in fair water, letting them stand till the water hath drawn all
the spirits out of the Roots, which will be done in an hour or two. Then
they put the Liquor and Roots into a large linnen Bag, and let it run
through that into a Jar, and within two hours it will begin to work:
and the next day it's fit to be drunk; And as they will have it stronger
or weaker, they put in a greater or a less quantity of Roots.</p>
               <p>This Drink being temperately made, doth not at all fly up into the
head, but is sprightly, thirst-cooling drink. If it be put up into Runlets, it
will last four or five dayes, and drink the quicker. It is much like
<hi>Renish</hi> Wine on the Must. There are two several layers wherein these
Roots grow; The one makes the Skins of the Potatoes white, the other
Red, and the Red Roots make the Drink Red like <hi>Claret</hi> Wine, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
white. This is the most general Drink used in the Island, but it
breeds Hydropick Humours.</p>
               <p>Another drink they have which is much wholsomer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Perino</hi> how made.</note> though not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
so pleasant, which they call <hi>Perino,</hi> much used by the <hi>Indians,</hi>
which is made of the <hi>Cussavy</hi> Root. This they cause their old toothless
women to chaw in their mouthes, and so spit into water, which in
three or four hours will work and purge it self of the poisonous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
This Drink will keep a moneth or two, and drink somewhat like
our <hi>English</hi> Beer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grippo</hi> is a third sort of Drink,<note place="margin">Grippo.</note> but few make it well, and it's rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>
                  <hi>Punch</hi> is a fourth sort,<note place="margin">Punch.</note> which is made of Water and Sugar mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which in ten dayes standing will be very strong, and fit for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers.</p>
               <p>A fifth is made of wild Plumbs which they have in great abundance
upon very large Trees. These they press and strain, and they have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sharp and fine Flavour: But this being troublesome in making is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
used.</p>
               <p>But the Drink made of the Plantane is far beyond all these.<note place="margin">Plantane drink.</note> These
they gather when they are full ripe, and in the heighth of their sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

after they have stood a night, they strain it, and bottle it up, and at a
weeks end drink it. Its a very strong and pleasant Drink, as strong as
Sack, and will fly up into the head, and therefore must be used mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately.</p>
               <p>The seventh sort of Drink they make of the Skimmings of their Sugar,
which is exceeding strong, but not very pleasant: This is commonly,
and indeed too much used, many being made drunk by it. This they
call <hi>Kill-Devil.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The eighth sort of Drink they call <hi>Beveridge,</hi> made of Spring-water,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51178:34"/>
White-Sugar, and Juice of Oringes. And this is not only pleasant,
but wholesome.<note place="margin">Pine-drink the best of all.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The last and best sort of Drink which the World affords, is the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Wine of <hi>Pines.</hi> And this is made of the pure juice of the fruit
it self without mixture of Water, or any thing else, having in it self a
natural compound of all the most excellent tasts that the world can
yield. I'ts too pure to keep long. It will be fine within three or four
dayes. They make it by pressing the Fruit, and straining the Liquor,
and keep it in Bottles.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Three sorts of Meat.</head>
               <p>They have several sorts of Meat there,<note place="margin">Hogs flesh.</note> whereof the Hoggs-flesh is
the most general, and indeed the best which the Island affords. For
the Swine feeding daily upon Fruit, the Nuts of Locust, Pompianes, the
bodies of the Plantanes, Bonanas, Sugar-Canes, and Maise, make their
flesh to be exceeding sweet. At the first coming of the <hi>English</hi> thither,
they found Hoggs of four hundred pound weight, the Intrals taken
out, and their Heads cut off.</p>
               <p>Beef they seldome have any that feeds upon that Island,<note place="margin">Beef.</note> except it die
of it self: Only such a Planter as was Sir <hi>James Drax</hi> (who lived there

Pullen, and <hi>Muscovy</hi> Ducks, which being larded with the fat of their
Pork, and seasoned with Pepper and Salt, is an excellent Bak'd
Meat.</p>
               <p>Turtle Doves they have of two sorts,<note place="margin">Turtle Doves. Pidgeons.</note> and very good meat. There are
also Pidgeons which come from the Lee-ward Islands in <hi>September,</hi> and
stay till <hi>Christmas</hi> to feed upon Fruits. Many of these they kill upon
the Trees, and they are exceeding fat, and tast excellently.</p>
               <p>Tame Rabbets they have,<note place="margin">Rabbets.</note> but they tast faintly, more like Chickens

               <head>Of their Fish.</head>
               <p>Now for fish, the Island want not plenty about it, yet the Planters
look so much after their profit on the Land,<note place="margin">Several sorts of fish.</note> that they will not spare
time to catch it, nor to send to the Bridge to buy that which is caught
to their hands. But when any have a mind to feast themselves with
Fish, they go to the Taverns at the Bridge where they have plenty, and
well drest.</p>
               <p>Butter they seldom have that will beat thick; but instead thereof they
use Vineger, Spice, and fry much of their Fish in Oyl, and eat it hot;
yet some they pickle, and eat it cold. Yet Collonel <hi>Humphrey Walrond</hi>
having his Plantation near the Sea, hath a Saine to catch Fish withall,
which his own servants and Slaves put to Sea twice or thrice a week, and
bring home store of small and great Fishes, as <hi>Snappers</hi> red and gray, <hi>Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51178:34"/>
Macarel, Mullets, Cony-Fish,</hi> and divers other sorts of firm and sweet
Fish; and some bigger then <hi>Salmons,</hi> of the rarest colours that can be
imagined, being from the back fin which is the middle of the Fish, to the
end of the tail, of a most pure grass green, as shining as Satin: The Fins
and Tail dappled with a most rare hair-colour; and from the back
Fin to the Head, a pure hair-colour dappled with green. The Scales
as big as an half Crown piece.</p>
               <p>It is an exccent sweet Fish;<note place="margin">The green Turtle.</note> only there is one kind of Fish here wanting,
which are very rife in the adjacent Islands, which is the green Turtle,
which the best meat that the Sea affords.</p>
               <p>In other places they take an infinite number of them by turning them
upon their backs with staves, where they lie till they are fetcht away.
A large Turtle will have in her body half a bushel of Eggs. When they
are to kill one of them, they lay it on his back upon a table, and when
he sees them come with a knife to kill him, he vapours out the most
grievous sighs that ever you heard creature make, and sheds as large
tears as a Stag. He hath a joynt or crevis about an inch within the
utmost edge of his shell, into which they put the knife and rip up his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which they call his <hi>Calipee,</hi> and take out his bowels, and heart,
which had three distinct points, and this being laid in a dish will stir
and pant ten hours after the Fish is dead: It's of a delicate taste and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>When the chief Planters make a Feast for their friends,<note place="margin">An Inland Feast.</note> its either made
by such as live within Land, or neer the Sea side. For this Inland Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
my Author instanceth in Sir <hi>James Draxe,</hi> at whose Table he
hath seen these several sorts of Meat well dressed: And this Feast was
alwayes made when he killed a Beef, which he fed very fat, by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it a dozen Acres of Bonavist to feed in.</p>
               <p>First, he mentions Beef as the greatest rarity in that Island of which he
had these Dishes; A Rump boiled, a Chine rosted, a large piece of the
breast rosted, a Cheek baked, the Tongue and part of the Tripes in
Minced-pies, feasoned with sweet Herbs finely minced, Suet, Spice and
Corrans. The Leggs, pallats, and other ingredients for an <hi>Oleo Podigro,</hi>
and Maribones.</p>
               <p>The Guests having eaten well hereof, the Dishes were taken away,
and then came in a potato-pudding, a Dish of <hi>Scotch</hi> Collips, of a Legg of
<hi>Pork,</hi> Fricacy of the same, a dish of boiled Chickens, a shoulder of a
young Goat; a Kid with a Pudding in his belly, a young Pigg exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fat and sweet; a shoulder of Mutton which is there a rare Dish: A
Pastry made of the side of a young Goat, and a side of a young Porket
upon it, well seasoned with pepper, Salt, and some Nutmegs: A Loin of
Veal, to which they have plenty of Oringes, Lemons, and Limes;
three young Turkies in a Dish, two Capons very large and fat,
two Hens with Eggs in a Dish; four Ducklings, eight Turtle Doves, and
three Rabbets; And for cold Baked Meats, two <hi>Muscovy</hi> Ducks larded

Tongues, Botargo, pickled Oysters, Caviare, Anchoves, Olives, and

Plantanes, Bonanoes, Gnavers, and these Fruits preserved by themselves;
Cheesecakes, Puffs, sometimes Tansies, Fraises, or Amulets: And for
raw fruit, Plantaxes, Bonanoes. Gnavers, Milions, prickled Pears, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chove

but these are small rough, and somewhat porous: Being burnt they

their Stones and make them to endure the weather.</p>
               <p>The other sort of stone they find in Rocks, and Massy pieces in the
Ground which are soft, and therefore they saw them to what Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
they please, and the longer it lies above ground the harder it

               <head>Of their Servants and Slaves.</head>
               <p>In the Island are three sorts of Men, Master, Servants, and Slaves.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51178:36"/>
The Slaves and their Posterity being subject to their Masters for ever,<note place="margin">Of their servants and slaves.</note>
they take more care of them then of their Servants, which are theirs but
for five years by the Law of the Island. So that for the time the servants
have the worser lives: For they are put to hard labour, ill lodging, and
slighted diet. Formerly the servants had no bone-meat at all, except a
Beast died, and then they were feasted as long as that lasted. Till they
had planted good store of Plantans the <hi>Negroes</hi> were fed with <hi>Bonavisto,</hi>
and <hi>Lob-Lolly,</hi> and some ears of <hi>Maise</hi> tosted; but now they are well
pleased with their Plantans, wherein they much delight, and thus they
dress it. It's gathered for them before it's full ripe, by the keeper off
the Plantan Groves, who is an able <hi>Negro,</hi> and laid upon heaps till they
fetch them away, which they do every Saturday night about five a clock;
for then they give over work sooner then ordinary, partly for this
work, and partly because the fire in the Furnace is to be put out,
and the <hi>Ingenio</hi> to be made clear; besides they are to wash, shave, and
trim themselves against the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a fine sight to see an hundred of these <hi>Negroes,</hi> men and women,
every one with a Grass-green bunch of Plantans on their heads, every
bunch twice so big as their heads, all marchin gone after another. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
brought it home, they pill off the skin of so much as they will use,
and boil it, making it into Balls, and so eat it.</p>
               <p>One bunch a week is a <hi>Negroes</hi> allowance, which they have no bread,
nor drink but water, their Lodging at night is a boord, with nothing
under, nor any thing above upon them.</p>
               <p>The usage of the Christian Servants is much as the Master is,<note place="margin">How their servants are used.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
merciful, or cruel. Such as are merciful, use their servants well,
both in Meat, Drink, and Lodging. But the lives of such servants as
have cruel Masters, is most miserable. When any ships bring servants
thither, the Planters buy such of them as they like, and with a Guide
send them to their Plantations, where they must presently build them a
Cabin, or else lie upon the Ground. These Cabins are made with sticks,
withs, and Plantane Leaves, under some little shade that may keep off
the Rain.</p>
               <p>The food is a few Potatoes for meat, and water or <hi>Mobby</hi> for drink.
At six of the clock in the Morning they are rung out to work with a
Bell, with a rigid Overseer to command them, till the Bell ring again at
eleven of the clock, and then they go to Dinner, either with a Mess of
<hi>Lob-lolly</hi> Bonavist, or Potatoes. At one of the Clock they are rung out
again, where they work till six, and then home to a Supper of the same.
But now their lives are much better; For most servants lie in Hamocks,
in warm rooms, and when they come home wet from work, they have
shifts of shirts and Drawers, which is all the Clothes they wear, and
are fed with Bone-meat twice or thrice in a week.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of their great Fires.</head>
               <p>Sometimes through carelesness of servants,<note place="margin">Dreadful fire.</note> whole fields of Sugar
Canes, and Houses have been burnt down: For if the Canes take fire,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51178:36"/>
there is no quenching of them, they burn so furiously, and make a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
noise;<note place="margin">How quenched.</note> For each knot of every Cane, gives as great a report as a
Pistol. There is no way to stop it but by cutting down, and removing
all the Canes before it for the breadth of twenty or thirty foot down
the wind; and there the <hi>Negroes</hi> stand and beat it out as it creeps along;
and some of them are so earnest to stop it, as with their naked feet to
tread, and to roll their naked bodies upon it, so little do they regard
their own smart in regard of their Masters benefit.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Negroes</hi> are brought to be sold,<note place="margin">Of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes.</note> the Planters go to the ship to
buy them, where they find them stark naked, and therefore cannot
be deceived in any outward infirmity. The strongest, youngest, and
most beautiful yield the best prizes; thirty pound is the price for the best,
and about twenty five pound for a woman <hi>Negro;</hi> Children are much
cheaper. They are very chast people. For when at sometimes they
are altogether naked,<note place="margin">Their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiy.</note> they will not so much as cast their eyes upon those
parts which ought to be covered.</p>
               <p>Jealous they are of their wives, and, and take it hainously if any make
the least Courtship to them.<note place="margin">Their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie.</note> And if any woman hath two children at a
birth, her Husband provides a cord to hang her, concluding that she
hath been false to his bed: And if by the authority of his Master, he be
overawed, yet he never loves her after. The Planters allow some of
them two or three Wives, but no women above one husband.</p>
               <p>When a Wife is brought to bed,<note place="margin">Of their easie travel</note> the Husband removes into another
room, leaving his Wife upon a boord on which she lies, and calls a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to her, who makes her a little fire near her feet, and that serves
for Possets, Broths, and Candles. In a fortnight she is at her work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
with her <hi>Pickaninny</hi> (so they call their Children) at her back, as
merry as any other.</p>
               <p>They have times of suckling their Children, and refreshing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the fields; and good reason, for they carry a burden on their
backs, and work too. Some of them when their children are three years
old, as they stoop in their weeding-work, will set their <hi>Pickaninnies</hi> a
stride on their backs, where he will spur his Mother with his heels, and
crow on her back, clapping his hands as if he meant to fly, which the
Mother is so well pleased with, that she will continue her painful stoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
work longer then she would do, rather then discompose her jovial
<hi>Pickaninny,</hi> so glad she is to see him merry.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sabbath</hi> dayes they have wholly to their pleasures: In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons
they have Kettle-Drums to make them Musick, and they all go
to dancing,<note place="margin">Dancing.</note> the men by themselves, and the women by themselves,
and sometimes the men wrestle amongst themselves.</p>
               <p>When any of them die,<note place="margin">The Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</note> they make a grave, and bury him in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

ropes, and to tar those ropes and the roofs over them.</p>
               <p>When a Carpet upon a Table is covered over with them, if you kill
many, and let them alone but a while, they will carry away all the dead

branches grow, and of somewhat a fainter willow colour. The tree is
soft, with a Knife a man may cut down one that is as thick as a mans

and near of the colour, only the upper end is somewhat blunter: It's
soft and of a delicate tast, within is a pulpy substance full of small seeds,
like a Figg, some are white, and some of a Stammel colour. These when
they have passed through the body of man or Beast, wheresover
they are emptied, they grow, and do much hurt in the pastures where
Cattel go that eat of them: For they over run all, and are hardly root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

having a green Skin without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and between that and the shell a pulpy
substance, of which when it's dry they make ropes, being like Hemp

               <p>The shell is full of a clear and well-tasted Liquor, very delicious; It's

so thick, that one may lie upon them. The Nuts are 3. inches and a half

               <p>These Branches are of several lengths, the most inward are the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;
and each stalk is adorned with leaves, and each of these leaves
sharp at either end; the Stem is of a pure grass green shining like Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,

               <p>The Branches sprout from the middle of tree, one at once, and as

withers, and hangs down till the wind blows it off.</p>
               <p>Then comes forth another, and another, and still there is a Pike, and
a dead leaf, a Pike and a dead Leaf as the tree growes higher and higher,

               <p>About thirty or fourty yeas old she begins to bear her fruit, which is
of the bigness of large Grapes, some green, some yellow, some purple,
and then they are ripe when they come to be purple, and fall down; and
then the Green turns yellow, and the yellow purple, and so take their
turns till the tree gives over bearing.</p>
               <p>These trees grow till some of them be two hundred, yea three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

then a Swans Quil; But there are many of them, and they fasten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Rock which makes the Tree, though so high, and big,

more then the best polished Coral.</p>
               <p>The other is of the same colour, and glisters as much, but is shaped
like a large Button of a Cloake; they have both the same quality; so
violently strong, that when they break but the Skin, it causes them to
Cough for a quarter of an hour after the fruit is removed; But whil'st
they are grabling of it, they never give over. It grows on a little shrub
no bigger then a Goosbberry-bush.</p>
               <p>They have excellent good Cucumbers from the beginning of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
to the end of <hi>February,</hi> they eat them cold with Oyle, Vineger,

               <p>Millions they have likewise for those four moneths: For the most

they are like an Apple for colour, but in tast waterish and wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish.
It's rarely cooling and excellent against the Stone. The Seeds
are of a pure Purple; they are full of these seeds.</p>
               <p>Grapes they have which are indifferently well tasted, but they are
never ripe together: There are alwayes some green, some ripe, and

The fruit of the <hi>Plantane</hi> is of great use,<note place="margin">Plantanes.</note> and beauty too. In Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them they put a root into the ground six inches deep, and in a
very short time there will come out three or four sprouts, whereof one
hath the precedence.</p>
               <p>As this Sprout grows, it springs from the intrinsick part of the Stem,
and the out Leaves hang down and rot; But still new ones come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and rise up as the <hi>Palmeto</hi> does, like a Pike which opens with the
Sun, and becomes a Leaf, and when it's eight or ten foot high, the Pikes
and Leaves will be of their full bigness, and so continue till the last
Sprout comes forth, which is the Soul of the Plant, and will never be a
Leaf: But is the Stem upon which the fruit must grow.</p>
               <p>When the Leaves come to their full bigness, they rot no more, but
continue in their first beauty, a rich green with stripes of yellow.</p>
               <p>These Leaves are most of them above six foot long, and two foot
broad; smooth, shining, and stiff as a Lawrel Leaf, falling from the
middle to the end like a Feather: And when it comes to the full
heighth, the Leaves will be fifteen or sixteen foot high, the Stem upon
which the fruit grows being a foot higher, with a green branch on the
top, which branch is very heavy, and then the leaves open and shew the
Blossome, which is of a pure purple, and like a heart with the point
downwards, being of a pound weight; when this is fallen, the Fruit
grows.</p>
               <p>In six moneths space this Plant will be grown, and the fruit ripe,
which is pleasant, wholesome, and nourishing, yellow when it's ripe:
But the <hi>Negroes</hi> desire it green, for they eat it boiled, and it's the only
food they live upon. When it's gathered they cut down the Plant, and
give it to the Hoggs, for it will grow no more.</p>
               <p>In three moneths another Sprout will come to bear, and so another,
and another for ever. Groves they make of these Plants of twenty A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres

               <p>The wild <hi>Plantane</hi> grows much as the other doth,<note place="margin">Wild plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes.</note> but the leaves
not so broad, and more upright: The Fruit of a Scarlet colour, and
almost three square, but good for nothing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bonano</hi> differs nothing from the <hi>Plantane</hi> in the Body and Leaves,
but only that the leaves are somewhat less,<note place="margin">tanes. Bonanoes.</note> and the body hath here

it, is adorned with small Blossomes, of several colours: The Fruit
stands upright like a bunch of Puddings, each of them between four
and five inches long.</p>

               <p>A Slip taken from the body of this Plant, and set in the ground, will

               <p>In a quarter of a year it will be a foot high, and the leaves about se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight inches long, appearing like a Semicircle: The colour most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Frost upon Green, intermixt with Cornation, and the edges of the
Leaves have teeth like Sawes.</p>
               <p>The Leaves fall one over another, the points of the lowest touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ground.</p>
               <p>In a quarter of a year more, the Blossome appears on the top of the
stem, as large as a great Cornation, the colours, Cornation, Crimson,
and Scarlet, in streaks intermixt with yellow, blew, and peach colour-leaves,
intermixed again with Purple, Sky-colour, Orange-tauny, Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daline,
and Gingeline, White, and Philamot: So that the flower repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
the variety to the sight, which the fruit doth to the tast.</p>
               <p>When the flowers are fallen, there appears a little bunch of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a Walnut, which hath in it all these colours mixt, which were
disper'st in the Leaves, and so it grows bigger for two moneths more;
when it's perfect, it is of an Oval Form, and at the upper end grows out a
Crown of Leaves much like the former in colour, but more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>Some of them six inches long; the out Leaves shorter by degrees.</p>
               <p>This Fruit is inclosed with a Rind, which begins with a Skrew at the
Stalk, and so goes round to the top, or Crown, gently rising, which
Screw is about a quarter of an inch broad, and the figures that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered
upon it, near of the like dimension, and divisions between;
Which divisions are never one over another in the screw, but are always
under the middle of the Figures above, which so vary in their colours,
as that if you see one hundred Pines, they are not like one another;
And every of those Figures hath a little tuft, some Green, some Yellow,
some Ash-colour, and some Carnation.</p>
               <p>There are two sorts of <hi>Pines,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Queen-Pine.</hi> The
<hi>Queen</hi> is far more delicate, and hath her Colours of all Greens, which
shadows intermixt with faint Cornations, but most of all, Frost upon
Green, and Sea-greens.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King-Pine</hi> hath mostly all sorts of yellows shadowed with Grass-greens.</p>
               <p>Some of them are fourteen inches long, and six in the <hi>Diameter:</hi>
Most of them having heavy bodies, and slender stalks, bowed down till
they are on the ground.</p>
               <p>Some of them have a dozen little ones round about the prime Fruit,
which are ripe by turns, and all very good.</p>

When it's ripe it hath an admirable smell, when they come to eat
them, they first cut off the Crown, and send that to be planted: Then
they pare off the most beautiful Rind, and cut the Fruit into slices in a
Dish, and there issues out a Liquor as clear as Spring-water about six
spoonful, which in tast is in a high degree delicious, and in eating the
Fruit, the delicate variety of tasts will change and flow so fast upon your
Pallat, as your fancy can hardly keep way with them, to distinguish
the one from other.</p>

lay two Canes one by another along the bottom of the Trench, and
so continue them the whole lengh of the trenches, then they cover
them with earth; and at two foot distance they do the like,
till they have planted all the Field.</p>
               <p>But they plant not too much together, but so that it may ripen suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively,
that their work may come in in order, that they be not idle:
for if they be not cut and used when they are ripe, they will rot.</p>
               <p>From these Canes thus buried, comes forth a sprout at every knot.
They begin to appear a moneth after their setting, and in a moneth
more they are two foot high at the least, and in the mean time they weed
them, and supply where there are any defects.</p>
               <p>These Canes with their tops are about eight foot high, the bodies
about an inch in the Diameter; the Knots five or six inches distant
one from the another. When they are ripe they cut them with little
hand Bills, six inches above the ground, and divide the tops from the
Canes; And then holding the Cane by the upper end, they strip off all
the blades, which with the tops they give to their Horses; the Canes
they bind in Faggots, and send them home upon <hi>Asinegoes,</hi> each of them
carrying three Faggots; two upon crooked sticks on the sides, and

Girls</hi> take out the Canes, and corry them away, laying them on a
heap at a Distance.</p>
               <p>Under the Rollers there is a Reciever into which the Liquor falls,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51178:43"/>
and from thence by a Pipe of Lead, is carried into a Cistern, which is
near the stairs that goes down from the Mill to the Boyling-House.</p>
               <p>From thence it passes through a Gutter to the Clarifying Copper:
And as it Clarifies in the first Copper, and the Scum rises, it's conveyed
to a second Copper, where it's again scummed, both which scums be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very Drossy, are thrown away; But the Skimming of the other
three Coppers are conveyed to the Stilling-house, where it stands in
Cisterns till it be a little sowre.</p>
               <p>Thus the Liquor is refined from one Copper to another, and the
more Coppers it passes through, the finer and purer it is. When it
comes to the tach it must have much keeling and stirring, and as it
boiles, they throw into the four last Coppers a Liquor made of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Withs, which they call <hi>Temp,</hi> without which the Sugar would
be clammy and never kern.</p>
               <p>When it's boiled enough, they poure two spoonfulls of Sallet-Oyl
into the Tach, and then it gives over to bubble, then after much keel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they take it out of the Tach with Ladles, and remove it into the
cooling Cistern.</p>
               <p>This work continues from Monday morning till Saturday night,
without any intermission, day and night, with fresh supplies of Men,
Horses, and cattel.</p>
               <p>The Liquor being so cool as that it's fit to put into Pots; first stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the sharp end of the Pots with Plantane Leaves, they fill them, and
let it stand till it be cold, which will be in two dayes and two nights;
Then they remove them into the Trying-house, and pulling out the
stopples; the <hi>Molosses</hi> runs out into a Gutter that carries it into Cisterns
again, and that they call <hi>Peneles,</hi> which is a Sugar somewhat inferiour
to <hi>Muscovados,</hi> which will sweeten pretty well, and is of a reasonable
good colour.</p>
               <p>When it's well cured, they remove the Pots from the Curing Room
into the Knocking Room, and turning them upside down, they knock
them till the Sugar falls out, in which there are three sorts.</p>
               <p>The first is Brown, Frothy, and light; The bottom is of a darker
colour, Gross and Heavy, and full of <hi>Molosses,</hi> both which they cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
and boil them again with <hi>Molosses</hi> for <hi>Peneles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The midle, which is more then two thirds of the whole, is a White
colour, dry, and sweet, which they send to their Storehouses at the
Bridge, there to be put in Casks and Chests to be shipt away.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Muscovado</hi> Sugars require but a moneths time in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
after it is boiled, yet White Sugar requires four Moneths, and
its made thus.</p>
               <p>They take Clay and temper it with Water to the thickness of Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentry,
and pour it on the top of the <hi>Muscovado-Sugar</hi> as it stands in
the Potts, and there let it remain four Moneths, and when it comes to
be knock't out of the Pots, the top and bottom will be like <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covadoes,</hi>
but the middle perfect White, and excellent Lump Sugar.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51178:44"/>
The Skimmings before spoken of, when they have stood till they are
a little soure, they still it; and the first spirit that comes, is a small Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
which they call <hi>Low-Wines,</hi> which they Still over again, and then
comes off a very strong Spirit, which is very Soveraign when they are
ill with Colds, which the <hi>Negroes</hi> are oft subject to, having nothing to
lye upon but aboard, and nothing to cover them.</p>
               <p>And though the Dayes be hot, the Nights be cold, and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hot, and sweating from their dayes labour, are subject to catch
cold; and when they feel themselves amiss, one dram of these Spirits
cures them.</p>
               <p>And the Christian Servants, when their Spirits are exhausted by their
hard labour and sweating in the Sun ten hours every day, and their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks
weakened, a Dram or two of these Spirits is a great comfort and
refreshing to them.</p>
               <p>They make much money also of them by selling them at the bridge,
so that they make weekly so long as they work, 30. l. Sterling, besides
what is drunk by their servants and slaves.</p>

               <head>WITHS.</head>
               <p>There is another Plant which they call a <hi>With,</hi> which is exceeding
harmful; For it pulls down all it can reach to, Canes and all other
Plants.</p>
               <p>If it comes into a Garden, it will wind about all Hearbs, and Plants
that have stalks, and pull them down and destroy them.</p>
               <p>If into an Orchard, it will climb up by the bodies of the Trees into
the Branches, and draws them as it were into a purse (for out of the
main stock hundred of sprigs will grow) and if any other Tree be near
it will find the way to it, and pull the tops of them together, and
hinder the growth of the Fruit; and cut the main stock at bottom in
hope to kill it; the moisture in the Branches above will cast down a new
root into the ground; yea, it will reach the highest Timber, and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrap
their branches as to hinder their growth; and oftentimes it fastens
one Tree to another, so that one shall hinder the growth of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>If you clear a passage of ten foot broad between a Wood where it
grows, and your Canes over night, and come the next morning, and
you shall find the way crossed all over with Withs, and got near to the
Canes, and if they once get amongst them, you cannot destroy the one
without the other; for wheresoever they touch ground, they get new
Roots, and so creep into every place, and as they go pull all down. Yet
have they some good virtues; for they serve for all uses where ropes
or cords are required; as for binding their Wood and Canes into Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,
&amp;c. And without them they were in an ill condition, having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wood fit for hoops for their Hogsheads, Barrels, and Tubs; and
they can have them of what length and bigness they please; And for
such uses they are very good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:51178:44"/>
There are several kinds of these Withs, some that bear fruit some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bigger then the Cod of a Bean, which being divided long-wise with
a Knife you shall perceive the most various and beatiful colours that can
be, and so well matched, as to make up a very great beauty.</p>
               <p>Many Canes there be in the Island,<note place="margin">Canes.</note> some large enough to hide five
hundred men; the runaway <hi>Negroes</hi> oft shelter themselves in for a long
time, and in the nights range abroad, and steal Pigs, Plantanes, Potatoes,
and Pullen, and feast all day upon what they stole in the night: And
the nights being dark, and their bodies black, escape undiscovered.<note place="margin">Old withs.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Another sort of Withs they have that are made of the Gum of Trees,
which falls from the boughs drop after drop, one hanging by another
till they touch the ground, from whence they receive nourishment and
grow larger: And if three or four of them come down so near as to
touch one another, and the wind twists them together, they appear like
ropes.</p>
               <p>Aloes they have growing there very good, and its a beautiful Plant, and
the leaves four Inches broad,<note place="margin">Aloes.</note> and three quarters of an inch thick, and a
foot and half long, with prickles on each side, and the last Sprout
which rises in the middle, bears yellow Flowers, one above another,
which are two foot higher then the Leaves.</p>
               <p>These thick Leaves they take and cut them through, and out of
them issues the <hi>Aloes,</hi> which they set in the Sun that rarifies it, and makes
it fit to keep: They save the first running, for if it run too long it will
be much worse.</p>
               <p>This Plant in <hi>England</hi> we call <hi>Semper vivens.</hi> Of this is there to be
be made an admirable Medicine for a Burn or Scald.</p>

the fire again, and put to it a small quantity of the Spirits of Wine, and
so much Yellow Wax as will bring it to the consistence of a Linement

               <p>There also the sensible Plant, which closes the Leaves upon any
touch with your hand, or that end of the staff by which you hold, and
in a little time will open again.</p>
               <p>There are few flowers in the Island, and none of them sweet.</p>
               <p>The White Lilly, and Red Lilly are much fairer then ours, and very
beautiful, but neither of them sweet.</p>
               <p>The Saint <hi>Jago Flower</hi> is very beautiful, but of an unpleasing smell.</p>
               <p>Another flower they have that opens not till Sun setting, and is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

<hi>Rohan</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which are Fusils, or Lozenges, are to be seen in the
wood, and stones, through all his Country: so that if you break a

brings forth Flowers onely; the Female Fruit, but the
Flowers of the Female will not open unlesse the boughs,
and Flowers of the male be joyned unto them: and if they

               <p>2. Neer unto the <hi>Grand-Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> is a Garden environed with
a strong Wall; in the Garden is a large fountain, and in the middest of
it groweth the only <hi>Balm</hi>-tree bearing true balm, that is in the world: it
hath a short stock or body, and beareth leaves like unto Vine-leaves,
but not altogether so long. <hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> v. 2. p. 838.</p>
               <p>3. In the Country of <hi>Indostan</hi> they have a pleasant clear liquor
which they call <hi>Taddy,</hi> issuing from a spongy Tree that grows straight,
and tall, without boughs to the top, and there spreads out into bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
somwhat like to an <hi>English</hi> Colewort, where they make incisions,
under which they hang earthen pots to preserve the influence: that
which distils forth in the night, is as pleasing to the taste, as any
white Wine, if drunk betimes in the morning; and of a peircing,
and medicinable quallity, excellent against the stone. But in the heat
of the day the Sun alters it, so that it becomes heady, Ill-relished, and
unwholesome. <hi>P. Pil.</hi> v. 2. p. 1469.</p>
               <p>4. For <hi>Cotton</hi> Wooll, they plant seeds, which grow up into shrubs
like unto our Rose-bushes: It blows first into a yellow blossome,
which falling off, there remains a Cod about the bignesse of a
mans thumb, in which the substance is moist, and yellow, but as
it ripens, it swells bigger, till it break the Cod, and in short time
becomes as White as Snow, and then they gather it. <hi>P. Pil.</hi> v.
2. p. 1470.</p>
               <p>5. The <hi>Cynamon</hi> tree is a small tree, and low, having leaves like to
our Bay-tree: In the month of <hi>March,</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> when the sap go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up to the top of the tree, they cut the bark off the tree round
about in length; from knot to knot, or from joynt to joynt, above,
and below, and then easily with their hands they take it away, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in the Sun to dry, and yet for all this the tree dyes not, but
against the next year it will have a new bark, and that which is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
every year is the best <hi>Cynamon:</hi> that which grows longer is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51178:49"/>
great, and not so good. <hi>P. Pil.</hi> v. 2. p. 1709.</p>
               <p>6. In <hi>India</hi> is a tree called <hi>Arbore de Ray's</hi> or the <hi>Tree of roots,</hi> it
groweth first up like other trees, and spreadeth the branches, out of
which there come strings, which seem a far off to be cords of hemp,
which growing longer till they reach the ground, there take root a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
so that in the end one tree will cover a great peece of ground,
one root crossing within another like a Maze, each of these young
trees will in time grow so big, that it cannot be discerned which is
the principal trunk, or body of the tree.</p>
               <p>6. There is also a tree called <hi>Arbore-triste,</hi> or the <hi>sorrowful-tree,</hi> so
called, because it never beareth blossoms but in the night-time, and
so it doth, and continueth all the year long: So soon as the Sun sets,
there is not one blossom seen upon the tree, but presently within half
an hour after, there are as many blossoms as the tree can bear, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to behold, and smelling very sweet; and as soon as the day comes,
and the Sun is rising, they all presently fall off, and not one is to be
seen on the tree, which seems as though it were dead, till evening
comes again, and then it begins to blossom as it did before: its as big
as a <hi>Plumb-tree:</hi> it groweth up quickly, and if you break but a branch
of the tree, and set it into the earth, it presently takes root, and
grows, and within a few days after it beareth blossoms, which are
like <hi>Orange</hi>-tree-blossoms, the flower white, and in the bottom some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
yellow, and redish. <hi>P. Pil.</hi> v. 2. p. 1780.</p>
               <p>8. There is also an herb in <hi>India,</hi> called by the <hi>Portugals, Herba
sentida,</hi> or feeling Herb, which if a man touch, or throw Sand, or
any other thing upon it, presently it becomes as though it were wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
closing the leaves together, and it comes not to it self a
gain, as long as the man standeth by it, but presently after he is
gone, it openeth the leaves again, which become stiffe, and fair, as
though they were newly grown: and touching it again, it shuts, and
becomes withered as before, so that its a pleasure to behold the
strange nature of it <hi>P. Pil.</hi> v. 2. p. 1781.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Pepper</hi> is planted at the root of some other tree, and runs up
it like <hi>Ivie:</hi> the leaves are like the <hi>Orange</hi>-leaves, but somewhat
smaller, green, and sharpe at ends: the Pepper groweth in bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
like Grapes, but lesse, and thinner; they are always green
till they begin to drye, and ripen, which is in <hi>December,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi>
at which time it turns black, and is gathered. <hi>Pur. Pil.</hi>
v. 2. p. 1782.</p>
               <p>10. The best <hi>Ginger</hi> grows in <hi>Malabar;</hi> it groweth like thin, and
young <hi>Netherland Reeds,</hi> two or three spans high, the root whereof is
the <hi>Ginger,</hi> which is gathered in <hi>December,</hi> and <hi>January.</hi> P. Pil. v. 2.

               <p>11. The <hi>Clove</hi>-trees are like <hi>Bay</hi>-trees, the blossoms at the first white,
then green, and at last red, and hard, which are the Cloves; these
Cloves grow very thick together, and in great numbers: In the place
where these trees grow, there is neither grass, nor green herbs, but
is wholly drye, for that those trees draw all the moisture unto them.

12. The <hi>Nutmeg</hi>-tree is like a Pear-tree, but that its lesse, and
with round leaves, the fruit is like great round <hi>Peaches,</hi> the inward
part whereof is the Nutmeg; this hath about it an hard shell like
wood, and the shell is covered over with Nutmeg-flowers, which is
the <hi>Mace,</hi> and over it is the fruit, which without, is like the fruit of
a Peach. <hi>P. Pil.</hi> v. 2. p. 1783.</p>
               <p>13. <hi>Gumme-Lac</hi> comes most from <hi>Pegu:</hi> where are certain very
great <hi>Pismires</hi> with wings, which fly up the trees like Plumb-trees,
out of which trees comes a certain Gumme which the <hi>Pismires</hi> suck
up, and then they make the <hi>Lac</hi> round about the branches of the trees,
as Bees make Wax; and when it is full, the owners come, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off the branches, lay them to dry; and being dry, the branches
shrink out, and the <hi>Lac</hi> remains. <hi>P. Pil.</hi> v. 2. p. 1783.</p>
               <p>14. <hi>Amber-greese,</hi> is usually cast upon the Sea-shore, which as some

the <hi>Whale</hi> consolidated by lying in the Sea. <hi>P. Pil.</hi> v. 2. p. 772.</p>
               <p>15 The Herb <hi>Addad</hi> is bitter, and the root of it so venemous, that

               <p>16 Of <hi>Palm</hi>-trees, which they keep with watering, and cutting
every year, they make Velvets, Satins, Taffaties, Damasks, Sarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
and such like, all which are spun out of the leaves cleansed,
and drawn into long threads. <hi>P. Pil.</hi> v. 2. p. 985.</p>
               <p>17. <hi>Frankincense</hi> grows in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and is the gumme that issueth

               <p>18. In <hi>Mozambique, Manna</hi> is procreated of the dew of Heaven,
falling on a certain tree, on which it hardens like Sugar, sticking to
the wood like <hi>Rozen,</hi> whence its gathered, and put into jars, and is
used much for purging in <hi>India. Idem.</hi> p. 1554.</p>
               <p>19. <hi>Mastick</hi>-trees grow only in the Island of <hi>Sio:</hi> the trees are low
shrubs, with little crooked boughs, and leaves: In the end of <hi>August</hi>
they begin their <hi>Mastick</hi>-harvest, men cutting the bark of the Tree
with Iron instruments; out of which the Gum distills uncessantly
for almost three months together. <hi>Idem.</hi> p. 1812.</p>
               <p>20. <hi>Spunges</hi> are gathered from the sides of Rocks, fifteen fathom
under water, about the bottom of the Streights of <hi>Gibralter,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that get them, being trained up in diving from their child-hood,
so that they can indure to stay very long under water, as if it were
their habitable Element.</p>
               <p>21. In <hi>Manica,</hi> is a tree called the <hi>Resurrection</hi>-tree, which for the
greatest part of the year is without leaf, or greenness: but if one
cut off a bough, and put it into the water, in the space of ten
houres, it springs, and flourisheth with green leaves; but draw it
out of the water, as soon as it is dry, it remaineth as it was before.
<hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> v. 2. p. 1537.</p>
               <p>22. There is in the Island of <hi>Teneriff</hi> (which is one of the Canaries)
a Tree as big as an <hi>Oke</hi> of a middle size, the bark white like <hi>Hornbeam,</hi>
six, or seven yards high, with ragged boughs, the leaf like the <hi>Bay</hi>-leaf.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51178:50"/>
It beareth neither fruit, nor flower; it stands on the side of an
hill, in the day its withered, and drops all night (a cloud hanging
thereon) so that it yeelds water sufficient for the whole Island,
wherein are eight thousand souls, and about an hundred thousand
Cammels, Mules, Goats, &amp;c. The water falls from it into a pond
made of brick, paved with stone; from whence its conveyed into
several ponds, thorough the whole Island. They also water there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
their Corn-ground, for they have no other water in the Island,
except Rain-water. The Pond holds twenty thousand Tun of water,
and is filled in one night. Many of our <hi>English</hi> that have been there
have attested the truth hereof. <hi>Idem.</hi> p. 1369.</p>

to break with it: which leaves they cut in small peeces, and cast
them into a clean pit made in the ground, and paved: there it lies to
ferment in the heat of the Sun, whereby the juice floweth forth,
which they put in skins, and hang them up in the wind to drye,
whereby it hardens. <hi>P. Pil.</hi> v. 1. p. 419.</p>
               <p>24. <hi>Indico</hi> groweth in the <hi>Moguls</hi> Country, having a small leaf like
that of <hi>Sena:</hi> the branches are of a wooddy substance like Broom:
It grows not above a yard high, the stalk about the bignesse of a
mans thumb: The seed is included in a small round Cod of an inch
long. This once sowed lasteth three years: that of the first year
makes a weighty reddish <hi>Indico,</hi> that sinks in water, being not yet
come to its perfection: that of the second year is rich, very light,
and of a perfect Violet-colour, swiming on the water: that of the
third year is weighty, blackish, and the worst of the three. This herb,
when its cut, is put into a Cistern, and pressed down with stones,
then covered over with water, where it remains till the substance
of the herb is gone into the water: then its drawn forth into another
Cistern, and laboured with staves till it be like Batter, then they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51178:51"/>
let it seeth, and so scum off the water two or three times, till nothing
but a thick substance remains, which taking forth, they spread on a
cloath, dry it in the Sun, then make it into balls, dry it on the sand,
which causes the sandy foot: That is best, which is of a pure grain;
Violet-colour, is glossie, dry, and light. <hi>Idem.</hi> p. 430.</p>
               <p>25. Sir <hi>James Lancaster</hi> in his <hi>East-Indy</hi> Voyage, in the Isle of <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brero</hi>
found on the Sea-sands, a young twig growing up to a tree, and
offering to pluck up the same, it shrank down into the ground, and
when it was by strength pulled up, a great Worm was the root of it,
and as the Tree groweth in greatnesse, the Worm diminisheth: This
Tree plucked up, the leaves and pill stripped off, by that time its
dryed, is turned into a hard stone; so that this Worm was twice
transformed into different natures, after a wondrous manner: Of these
he brought home many. <hi>P. Pil.</hi> v. 1. p. 152.</p>
               <p>26. About <hi>Saffron Walden</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> there grows great store of <hi>Saffron,</hi>
which was first brought into <hi>England,</hi> in the reign of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the third. This in the month of <hi>July</hi> every third year, being pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up, and after twenty dayes, having the root split, and set again
in the earth, about the end of <hi>September</hi> it putteth forth a whitish-blew
flower; out of the midst where of there come three chives, which are
gathered in the morning before Sun-rising, and being plucked out of
the flower, are dried by a soft fire; and so great is the increase that
commeth thereof, that out of every Acre of ground, there are made
fourscore, or an hundred pound weight of <hi>Saffron,</hi> whilst it is moist,
which being dryed, yeeld some twenty pound weight. And the ground
which three years together hath brought <hi>Saffron,</hi> is so enriched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that it will bear very good Barley, many yeares together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>27. All along the shores of the <hi>Red-sea</hi> are abundance of <hi>Palm-Trees</hi>
of a very strange nature: They grow in couples, Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male:
both thrust forth cods full of seed: but the Female is only
fruitful, and that not except growing by the male, and having her
seed mixed with his. The pith of these Trees is an excellent sallet,
better than an Artechoke: Of the branches are made bedsteads, Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,
&amp;c. Of the leaves, Baskets, Mats, Fans, &amp;c. Of the outward
husk of the cod, cordage; of the inward, brushes. The fruit it beareth is
like a Fig, and finally it is said to yeild whatsoever is necessary for
the life of Man. It is the nature of this tree, that if never so great a
weight be laid upon it, it will lift &amp; raise up it self the more; for which
it was given to conquerors in token of victory. <hi>Herb. Trav.</hi>

liquor, at which time they put a vessel under it, and take it away full
every morning, and evening, and then distilling it, they make a very
strong liquor of it. Of the Nuts also they make great store of Oil:
out of the tree they make Bows, Bedsteads: of the leaves also they
make very fine mats, which whilest green, are full of an excellent
sweet liquor, with which if a man be thirsty, he may satisfie himself:
with the bark they make spoons, dishes, and platters for meat. The
first rind of the Nut they stamp, and make thereof perfect Ockam:
and the store of these Nuts serve for merchandise. So that out of this
one Tree, they build and rig ships, furnish them with meat, drink, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensils,
and merchandise, without the least help of any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.

               <p>32. Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> in his Travels thus describes it. The Tree that bears
the Coco, is strait, &amp; lofty, without any branches, save at the very top,
where it spreads its beautiful plumes, and Nuts like Pearles, or Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
adorning them. It is good Timber for Canoes, Masts, Anchors:
The leaves for Tents or thatching: the rind for sailes, Matteresses,
Cables, and Linnen: the shels for furniture: the meat for victualling.
The Nut is covered with a thick rind equal in bignesse to a Cabbage.
The shell is like the skull of a man, or rather a deaths-head, the eyes,
nose, and mouth, being easily discerned: within it is contained a quart
of sweet and excellent liquor, like new white-wine, but far more aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
tasted: the meat or kernel, is better relished than our Phel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds,
and is enough to satisfy the appetite of two reasonable men.</p>

bigness of a mans thigh, compacted of many leaves, wrapped one
upon another, adorned with leaves in stead of boughs from the very
ground, which are for the most part about two ells long, and an ell
broad, having a large rib in the middle thereof. The fruit is a bunch
of ten, or twelve Plantans, each a span long, and as big almost as a
mans wrist; the rind being stripped off, the fruit is yellowish, and of
a pleasant taste. <hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> p. 416.</p>
               <p>33. The <hi>Cedars</hi> of Mount <hi>Libanus</hi> grow higher than Pines, and so
big, that four or five men with their armes can but fathom them; the
boughs rise not upward, but stretch out a cross, largely spread, and
thickly enfolded one in another, as if done by Art, so that men may
sit, and lie along upon the boughs: the leaves are thick, narrow,
hard, prickly, and alwayes green; the wood is hard, incorruptible,
and sweet smelling; the fruit like the Cones of Cypress, gummy, and
marvellous fragrant. <hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> v. 2. p. 1500.</p>
               <p>34. In <hi>Africa</hi> are many <hi>Palmeta</hi> trees, whence they draw a sweet,
and wholsome Wine, by cutting, or boring holes into the body of
the Tree, into which a Cane is put that receives the sap, and conveys
it into Gourds: It tastes like white Wine, but it will not last above
four and twenty hours. <hi>Idem.</hi>

               <p>35. In <hi>New-Spain</hi> there are many trees which they call <hi>Manguey:</hi> It
hath great, and large leaves, at the end whereof is a strong, and sharp
point, which they use for pins, and needles, and out of the leaf they
draw a kind of thred which they use much to few with. The body
of the Tree is big, which when it is tender, they cut, and out of the
hole proceeds a liquor which they drink like water, being fresh, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51178:52"/>
sweet. This liquor being sodden, becomes Wine, which being kept
till it be sower, makes good Vinegar: Boil it it a litle more than for
Wine, and it makes a fine Syrup; and boil it till it be thick, and it
makes Hony. <hi>Idem.</hi> v. 3. p. 957.</p>
               <p>36. There is a certain Tree in <hi>New-Spain</hi> called <hi>Tunalls,</hi> in whose
leaves breed certain small worms, which are covered with a fine web,
compassing them in daintily. This in the season they gather, and let
it drye, and this is that <hi>Cochenille,</hi> so famous, and dear, wherewith

the <hi>Jack</hi> for shew and bigness resembles a Pumpeon: without, it is
of a gold yellow, mixt with veins; within, its soft, and tender, full
of golden coloured cloves, each full of kernels, not unlike a great
<hi>French</hi> Bean, but more round, each of them hath an hard stone within
it, the fruit is somewhat unpleasant at the first taste; tis glutinous, and
clammy in the mouth, but very restorative, and good for the
back.</p>
               <p>38. The <hi>Ananas</hi> is not inferiour to the <hi>Jack</hi> in bulk, and round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
It ariseth from no seed, or sowing, but from a root like an
Artichok: when they are ripe they shew themselves, and are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
two foot high: without, it is covered with a drie rind, hard,
and skaley; within, its wholesome and pleasant, and though a little
of it seems to satiate the appetite, yet the stomach likes it well, and
its easie of digestion.</p>
               <p>39. The <hi>Duroyen</hi> is somewhat like the <hi>Jack,</hi> in shape round, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vertue, is far greater than the outward beauty: at first opening
it hath an unpleasant smell: the meat is whitish, and divided into a
dozen cells, or partitions, filled with stones as big as Chesnuts, white
and cordial. Its a fruit nutritive, and dainty, and may well be called
an Epitome of all the best, and rarest fruits in the the Orient.</p>
               <p>40. The <hi>Arec</hi>-tree is almost as high as a Cedar, but more like the
Palmeto: I'ts of a fuzzie, hollow substance, adorned at every top
with Plumes, wherein the fruit hangs in clusters; its in shape and
bigness like a Wallnut; white and hard within; hath neither taste,
nor smell: they never eat it alone, but wrap it in a leaf of Bettle, and
are frequently chawing of it: some adde to it a kinde of Lime made
of Oister-shels, it cures the Chollick, removes Melancholly, kills
Worms, provokes lust, purges the maw, and prevents hunger. Its
much used in the <hi>East-Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>41. The <hi>Palmeto</hi>-tree is long, strait, round, and soft, without leaf,
bough, or branch, save at the top, and those are few, green, and
sedgie: under which branches there appear certain codded seeds:
Both the Male, and Female bear blossoms, but the Female only
beares fruit, and yet not that, unlesse a flowring branch of the Male
tree be yearly inoculated: The leaves serve for many uses. At
the top of this tree there is a soft pith, in which consists the life
of it: for that being cut out, the Tree dyes. This pith is in bignesse
like small Cabbage, in taste like a nut kernel, and being boiled it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51178:53"/>
eats like a Colly-flower. But of more value is the <hi>Palmeta</hi> Wine,
which is sweet, pleasant, and nourishing in colour, and taste not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<hi>Muskadine:</hi> It purges, cures obstructions, and kills the Worms.
If it stand two dayes in the Sun it makes good Vinegar. The
Wine is thus gotten. They cut a small hole in two or three Trees
that grow together, which in a short time are filled with the sap that
issues in them, which with a Cane, or Quill, they draw forth. <hi>Pur.

               <p>1 <hi>ANno Christi</hi> 1204. at <hi>Oreford</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> a fish was taken by the
Fishermen at Sea, in shape resembling a wild man, and by
them was presented to Sir <hi>Bartholomew de Glanvil,</hi> Keeper of
<hi>Oreford</hi> Castle. In all his limbs and members he resembled a
man, had hair in all the usual parts of his body, only his head was bald.
The Knight caused meat to be set before him, which he greedily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
and did eat fish raw, or sod: that which was raw he pressed
with his hand, till he had squeezed out all the moisture: He uttered
not any speech, though to try him, they hung him up by the heels,
and grievously tormented him. He would get him to his Couch
at the setting of the Sun, and rise again at the Sun-rising. One day
they brought him to the haven, and let him go into the Sea, but
to prevent his escape, they set three rows of very strong nets before
him to catch him again at their pleasure: but he, straitwayes diving
to the bottom, crept under all their nets, and shewed himself again
to them, and so often diving, he still came up, and looked
upon them that stood on the shore, as it were mocking of them.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51178:56"/>
At length after he had sported himself a great while in the water, and
there was no hope of his return, he came back to them of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and remained with them two months after. But finally, when
he was negligently looked to, he went to the Sea, and was never after

by the water side, in the harbour of St <hi>Johns,</hi> he espied a strong
Creature swimming very swiftly towards him like a women, looking
chearfully upon him: Her Face, Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Chin, Ears,
Neck, and Forehead were like a womans. It was very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and in those parts well proportioned, having hair hanging
down round about the head: He seeing it come within a pikes length
of him, stepped back, whereupon it dived under water, swimming to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place, whereby he beheld the shoulders, and back down to the
middle, which was as square, white, and smooth as the back of a man;
from the middle to the hinder part it pointed in proportion like a
broad-hooked Arrow: Afterwards it came to a Boat wherein some
of his men were, attempting to come in to them, till one of them
struck it a full blow upon the head: Others of them saw it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

hand, if it stir not, it produceth no effect; but if it move it self never
so little, it so torments the body of him that holds it, that his arteries,
joints, sinews, &amp; all his members feel exceeding great pain, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

of which are above two spans long a peece; the two lower stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;
the two upper are turned like a <hi>Boars</hi> tush; they live in the
water, but feed on the land upon grass: they have teats wherewith

the tail was flat, but at the end round, and somewhat sharp: It snort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

their Creator, who for their safety hath given them fins, which
serve in-stead of wings: they are of such a delicate skin interlaced
with fine bones as may cause admiration in the beholder: These
fishes are like to <hi>Pilcherds,</hi> only a little rounder, and bigger: they flye
best with a side wind, but longer than their wings are wet, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
flye; so that their longest flight is about a quarter of a mile. The
<hi>Dolphins,</hi> and <hi>Bonitos</hi> do continually hunt after them, to prey upon
them: whereupon for safety they take the air: but then there is a
Fowle called an <hi>Alcatrace,</hi> much like a <hi>Hern,</hi> which hovers in the air

his enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Swordfish,</hi> and the <hi>Thresher.</hi> The <hi>Swordfish</hi> is not
great, but strongly made, and between his neck and shoulders he hath
a bone like a Sword, of about five inches broad, and above three
foot long, full of prickles on either side. The <hi>Thresher</hi> is a bigger fish,
whose tail is broad, and thick, and very weighty. The fight is in this
manner; the <hi>Swordfish</hi> placeth himself under the belly of the <hi>Whale,</hi>
and the <hi>Thresher</hi> above with his tail thresheth upon the head of the
<hi>Whale,</hi> till he forceth him to give way, which the <hi>Swordfish</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
wounds him in the belly with the Sword, and so forceth him to
rise up again. In this manner they torment him, that the fight is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
heard above three leagues off, the <hi>Whales</hi> roaring being heard
much further, his onely remedy in this case is to get to the shore,
which he laboureth to do as soon as he sees his enemies: for then
there can fight but one with him, and for either of them hand to
hand he is too good. <hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> v. 4. p. 1377.</p>

by one of their men, that was nine foot and an half in length, and they
found in her paunch fifty and five young ones, each of them a foot in
length, all which go out and in at their pleasures: She is armed with a
double row of venemous teeth: and is guided to her prey by a little
<hi>Musculus,</hi> or Pilot-fish that scuds to and fro to bring intelligence, the
<hi>Shark</hi> for his kindnesse suffering it to suck when it pleaseth.</p>

her shell is flatter: by overturning them they are easily taken, being
hereby dis-enabled either to sink, or help themselves: they taste wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
and cause Fluxes: they superabound in eggs, one of them having
in her neer two thousand, which eggs are pale, and round, and will
never be made hard with boiling. <hi>Herberts Travels.</hi> p. 26.</p>
               <p>17. In the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea is an <hi>Eagle-fish,</hi> whose eyes are five quarters

small tail, and it is rather to be wondered at then to be eaten.</p>

monster, with an horn, struck against the ship with such violence, that
shook it, whereupon the Master looking overboard, saw the Sea all
bloody, but knew not what should be the cause, till coming into <hi>Port-Desire,</hi>
where they cleansed and trimmed their ship, they found seven
foot under water, a Horn sticking in the ship, for bignesse, and fashion
like an Elephants tooth: yet not hollow, but all solid of hard bone,
which had pierced through three double planks, and was entred into
a rib of the ship, it stuck about half a foot deep in the ship, and by
great force was broken off, which caused that great monster to bleed
so much as discoloured the water. <hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> v. 1. p. 90.</p>

like a <hi>Buffalo's,</hi> her eyes small and round, having hard gums instead
of teeth: they feed much on the shore, which makes them taste like
flesh of veal: their intrails differ little from a <hi>Cows:</hi> their bodies are
commonly three yards long, and one broad, they swim slowly wanting
fins, in the place whereof they have two things like paps, which are
their stilts when they creep on the shore to graze, where they sleep
long, sucking in the cool aire: they cannot keep under water above
half an hour. The stone generated in their head is most esteemed, being
soveraign against choller adust, the stone collick; and dissenteryes, if

upon the surface of the Ocean, of a round form, throwing abroad her
strings like so many lines, which she can spread at pleasure, therewith
angling for small fishes, which she catches at leasure: you may call
her a Sea-Spider: for when she sees her web too weak, she can blow

the fields, but lives for the most part in the water: the hinder-parts of
it are like unto a Cow, and it eats like veal. <hi>Idem.</hi> v. 3. p. 930.</p>

hair, skin, cheeks, and tongue, they are like Oxen: their eyes small
with lids to open and shut; which no other fish hath: It breatheth, and
therefore cannot be long under water: Instead of fore-feet, it hath
two arms of a cubit long, with two round hands, and on them five fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
close together, with nails like a mans; under these arms the female
hath paps wherewith she nourisheth her young, she brings forth but one
at once. It hath no fins but the tail, which is also round and close: their
bones are all maffie, and white like Ivory: of this Fish they make great
store of sweet Oil: they feed most upon the land. <hi>Idem.</hi> v. 4. p. 1313.</p>

the Island of <hi>Celebes,</hi> which is wholly overgrown with wood: amongst
the Trees night by night, they saw infinite swarms of fiery worms
flying in the air, their bodies no bigger than of our <hi>English</hi> Flyes,
which made such a shew, and gave such a light, as if every twig or
tree had been a burning candle. In which place also were great store
of Bats, as big as large Hens. <hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> v. 1. p. 56.</p>

fell into the strangest, and fearfullest water that ever any of them had
seen, the water giving such a glaring light about the ship, that they
they could discern letters in a book thereby, whereas a little before it
was so dark, that they could discern nothing. This made them fear
that it had been the breach of sunken ground: But finding that they
had failed half an hour in it, and saw no alteration, they perceived
at length, that it was a multitude of Cuttle-fish that made this fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
shew. <hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> p. 352.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>1. IN one of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Islands there is a rare kind of Fowl un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to other Countrys, called <hi>Colca,</hi> little lesse than a <hi>Goose:</hi>
They come thither every year in the spring, hatch, and nourish
their young ones: About which time they cast all their feathers,
and become stark naked all their bodies over, and then they get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Sea, and are no more seen till the next spring: Their
feathers have no quill, as other feathers have, but are all like unto
Down, wherein is no hardnesse. <hi>Descr. of Scot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In the North Seas of <hi>Scotland</hi> are great loggs of Timber found,
in which are ingendred after a marvellous manner, a sort of Geese,
called <hi>Claik-geese:</hi> and they do hang by the beak till they are grown
to perfection, and then they receive life and fall off: they are many
times found, &amp; kept in admiration for their rare manner of Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
They are very fat, and delicious to be eaten. <hi>Idem.</hi> Some question
the truth hereof.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Storks</hi> are so careful of their parents? that when they grow
old, and so are unable to help themselves, the young ones feed them:
and when in passing the Sea their wings fail them, the young ones
will take them on their backs, and carry them over. And this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
about them.</p>
               <p>4. The Town of <hi>Delph</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> is so seated for the
breeding, and feeding of those Birds, that it is hard to see an house
wherein they do not build. In this Town upon the third of <hi>May, Anno
Christi</hi> 1536. a great fire happened when the young <hi>Storks</hi> were grown
pretty big: the old ones perceiving the fire to approach to their Nests,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51178:58"/>
attempted to carry away their young ones, but could not, they were
so weighty, which they perceiving, never ceased with their spread
wings to cover them, till they all perished in the flames together. <hi>Belg.
Common Wealth.</hi> p. 63.</p>
               <p>5. In <hi>America</hi> there are certain small Birds called <hi>Viemalim,</hi> with
small and long bills, that live upon the dew, and of the juice of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and roses, like Bees: their feathers are of very curious colours:
they dye, or sleep every year in <hi>October,</hi> sitting upon the bough of a
Tree in a warm place, and in <hi>Aprill</hi> following, when the Flowers are
sprung, they awake again. <hi>I have one of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. In the <hi>Arabian</hi> Deserts there are great store of <hi>Ostriches,</hi> that go in
flocks, and often affright passengers that are strangers, with their fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eches, appearing a farr off like a Troop of horsmen. Their
bodies are too heavy to be born up by their wings, which, though
uselesse for flight, yet serve them to run with greater speed, so that
a swift Horse can scarce overtake them: whatsoever they finde, be
it stones or iron, they greedily swallow it down, and concoct it: when
they have laid their eggs, (which are as big as a Culverin Bullet)
they forget where they left them, and so return no more to them: but
they are hatched by the heat of the Sun in the warm sands: hence
those expressions, Lam. 4. 3. <hi>The Daughter of my people is become cruel,
like the Ostriches in the wildernesse:</hi> whereupon she is made the <hi>Embleme
of folly,</hi> Job 39. 14. &amp;c. <hi>She leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth
them in the dust, and forgets that the foot may crush them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>7. In <hi>Brasile</hi> there is a little bird, which they call <hi>The risen,</hi> or <hi>Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Bird,</hi> because it sleeps six months, and awakes the other six. It
hath a Cap on its head of no one colour, but on what side soever you
look, it sheweth Red, Green, Black, and other colours, all very fine,
and shining: the Breast also shews great variety of colours, especially
Yellow, more fine then Gold; the Body is Grey, and it hath a very
long small Bill, and yet the tongue is twice as long as the Bill: it flyes
very swiftly, and makes a humming like a <hi>Bee.</hi> It always feeds flying.

               <p>8. In <hi>Socotera</hi> there are <hi>Bats,</hi> whose bodies are almost as big as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
their Heads are like Foxes with an hairy Furr upon them: In
other things they are like our <hi>Bats.</hi> One of them being killed by some
<hi>English,</hi> his wings when they were extended, were an ell in length.
their Cry is shril and loud. <hi>Idem.</hi>

with Fire in their Tailes. <hi>Raimunds Mercu. Ital.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. In <hi>China</hi> there is a Fowl of a prodigious shape, and bignesse: It
is three foot high: the body being exceeding great, more than a man
can fathom: their feathers are all white like a Swans, their feet broad
like Fowls that swim: their neck half a fathom long, and their beak
half an ell, the upper part of it being crooked. From the nether part
of the beak there hangs a very great and capable bag of a yellow gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
colour, resembling Parchment. With these Fowls the Natives
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51178:59"/>
use to fish, as we do in <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Cormorants.</hi> They will catch fish
with great dexterity, and when they have filled their great bag,
which will hold divers fishes of two foot long a peece, they will bring
them to their Masters. <hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> v. 2. 1643.</p>
               <p>11. In the <hi>African</hi> Desarts is a certain Fowle called a <hi>Nesir,</hi> some
call it a <hi>Vultur.</hi> Its bigger than a Crane. In flying it mounts very high,
yet at the sight of a dead carkass, it descends immediatly. She lives
long, and in extream old age looseth her feathers, and then return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her nest, is there fed by the young ones of the same kind.

               <p>12. Near unto the <hi>Streights of Magellane,</hi> there is an Island called
<hi>Penguin</hi> Island, wherein are abundance of Fowls called <hi>Penguins</hi> that
go upright, their wings, in stead of feathers, are only covered with
down, which hang down like sleeves faced with white. They flye
not, but walk in paths of their own making, and keep their divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and quarters orderly. They are a strange Fowle, or rather, a
miscellaneous creature, of Beast, Bird, and Fish: but most of Bird.
<hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> v. 1. p. 536.</p>
               <p>13. In the Isle of <hi>Man,</hi> there is a sort of Sea-Fowles called <hi>Puffins,</hi>
they are of a very unctious constitution, and breed in Cony-holes
(the Conies leaving their burrows for that time) they are never seen
with their young, but very early in the morning, and late in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening:
they nourish their young (as it is conceived) with Oil drawn
from their own bodyes, and dropped into their mouths; for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
opened, there is found in their crops no other sustenance, save
a single Sorrel-leaf, which the old give their young (as is conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
for digestions-sake; the flesh of them, whilst raw, not savoury,
but powdered, it may be ranked with Anchoves, and Caviare; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
they are in their feathers, and oil, which they use much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their Wooll.</p>
               <p>14. the Isle of <hi>Mauritius</hi> is a Fowle called a <hi>Dodo;</hi> Her body is
round, and extream fat, which makes her pace slow: few of them
weigh less than fifty pound: Her Wings are so small, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lift her above the ground: Her head is variously dressed, the one
half-hooded with downy black feathers; the other wholly naked, of
a whitish colour, as if a transparent Lawn had covered it: her bill
is very hooked, bending downwards, the breathing place being in the
midst of it, from which part to the end, the colour is light green,
mixt with a pale yellow: Her eyes are round, and small, and bright
as Diamonds: her cloathing is of the finest down; her train is of
three or four short-feathers, her legs thick, and black; her tallons
sharp; her stomach so hot, that she digests stones, or Iron, as doth
the <hi>Ostrich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15. In <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> there is a Bird called a <hi>Dotterel,</hi> so named of his
doltish foolishness: Its a bird of an apish kinde, ready to imitate what
it sees done: they are caught by Candle-light by the Fowlers ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures;
for if he put forth and arm, they stretch forth a wing: if he
sets forward a leg, or hold up his head, they likewise do the same:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51178:59"/>
In brief, whatsoever the Fowler doth, the same also doth this fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
bird, until it be caught within the net. <hi>Camb. Brit.</hi> p. 543.</p>
               <p>16. There is an Island called <hi>Bas,</hi> bordering upon <hi>Lathaien</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
unto which there resort a multitude of Sea fowls, especially of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Geese,</hi> which bring with them such abundance of Fish, that,
as it is reported, an hundred souldiers that lay there in Garrison for
defence of the place, fed upon no other meat, but the fish that was
thus brought to them: And the said Fowls also bring such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of sticks, and twigs, wherewith to build their nests, that thereby
the inhabitants are also abundantly provided of fewel for the fire:
and such a mighty gain is made of their feathers, and oil, that no
man would scarcely beleeve it, but he that hath seen it. <hi>Camb. Brit.

               <p>17. In <hi>Magallanes</hi> voyage about the world, the King of the Island
of <hi>Bacchian</hi> sent the King of <hi>Spain</hi> two dead birds of a strange shape:
they were as big as Turtle-Doves, with little heads, and long bills,
long small legs, and no wings, but in-stead thereof certain long fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of divers colours, and tails like Turtle-Doves: all their other
feathers were of a tawny colour; they flye not, but when the wind
blows; and they call them <hi>Birds of God.</hi> Pur. Pil v. 1. p. 44.</p>
               <p>18. In <hi>Sofala</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies</hi> is a kinde of Bird called <hi>Minga,</hi>
green, and yellow, very fair, about the bigness of a Pigeon, which
never treads on the ground, their feet being so short, that they can
scarce be discerned: they settle on trees, of the fruit whereof they
live: when they drink, they flye on the tops of the water; and if
they fall on the ground, they cannot rise again; their flesh is fat and
savoury. <hi>Idem.</hi> p. 1546.</p>

                  <p>The wonderful works of God in the Creatures. Of strange Beasts, and Serpents.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. WHilst Sir <hi>Thomas Row,</hi> our <hi>English</hi> Ambassador, was at
the great <hi>Moguls</hi> Court, he saw many stately Elephants
brought before the Emperour: some of which being
<hi>Lord-Elephants</hi> (as they called them) had their chain bells,
and furniture of gold, and silver, each of them having eight, or ten
other <hi>Elephants</hi> waiting on him: they were some twelve companies in
all, and as they passed by, they all bowed down before the King very
handsomely. <hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> v. 1. p. 550.</p>
               <p>2. Though these <hi>Elephants</hi> be the largest of all beasts, yet are they
very tractable, unless at such times when they are mad through lust:
some of them are thirteen, and some fifteen foot high; their colour
is usually black, their skins thick, and smooth without hair; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
much to bathe themselves in water, and are excellent swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51178:60"/>
their pace is about three miles an hour; of all Beasts they are
most sure of foot, so that they never stumble, or fall to indanger
their rider: they lye down, and rise again at pleasure, as other beasts
do; they are most docible creatures, doing almost whatsoever their
Keeper commands them. If he bid one of them affright a man, he
will make towards him, as he would tread him in pieces; and
yet when he comes at him, do him no hurt: If he bid him abuse,
or disgrace a man, he will take dirt, or kennel-water in his trunk,
and dash it in his face, &amp;c. Their trunks are long, grissely snouts hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down betwixt their teeth, which (as a hand) they make use of
upon all occasions. Some <hi>Elephants</hi> the great <hi>Mogul</hi> keeps for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of malefactors; who being brought to suffer death by that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
beast, if the Keeper bid him dispatch the offender presently, he will
immediately with his foot pash him in peeces: If he bid him tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
him slowly, he will break his joynts by degrees one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as men are broken upon the wheel.</p>
               <p>2. An <hi>English</hi> Merchant of good credit being at <hi>Adsmeer</hi> (a City
where the great <hi>Mogul</hi> then was) saw a great <hi>Elephant</hi> daily brought
through the Market-place, where an Hearb-woman used to give him
an handful of hearbs as he passed by. This <hi>Elephant</hi> afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mad; brake his chains, and took his way through the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place;
the people being affrighted, hasted to secure themselves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
whom was this Hearb-woman, who through fear, and haste,
forgat her little childe. The <hi>Elephant</hi> comming to the place where
she usually sate, stopt, and seeing a child lye about her hearbs, took
it up gently with his Trunk, and without harm, laid it upon a stall
hard by, and then proceeded in his furious course. <hi>Idem.</hi> p. 1472.
The Males Testicles lie about his forehead: the Females teates are
betwixt her fore-legs; they carry their young two years in their
wombs: conceive but once in seven years: they are thirty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they come to their full growth, and fulfil the accustomed age of
a man before they die.</p>
               <p>3. As <hi>Pyrrus</hi> King of <hi>Epyrus</hi> was assaulting the City of <hi>Argos,</hi> one
of his <hi>Elephants</hi> called <hi>Nicon. i. e. Conquering,</hi> being entred the City,
perceiving that his governour was stricken down to the ground from
his back with terrible blows; ran upon them that came back upon
him, overthrowing friends, and foes, one in anothers neck, till at
length, having found the body of his slain Master, he lift him up
from the ground with his trunk, and carrying him upon his two tush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
returned back with great fury, treading all under feet whom he
found in his way. <hi>Plut. In vita Pyrri.</hi>

much taken therewith, but they are terrified with the ugly deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his face; and therefore as he goes he hides that part between his
legs, and will not look towards them till he hath gotten them within
his compasse, which when he hath done, he devours them without
mercy: so deals the Devil with wicked men, strewing their way to
Hell with variety of worldly delights, and profits (the thorns of
affliction must not touch their flesh, nor Hells terrors come within
their thoughts) till he hath made them past feeling, then he devours
them. <hi>Plin. nat. Hist.</hi> L. 8 C. 17.</p>

graze but with difficulty. <hi>P. Pil.</hi> p. 1381. <hi>He is also called a Jaraff.</hi>

deformed lean, and crooked creature, having a long and slender tail,
like a Mouse, and is of a slow pace. It lives only upon Flys. It chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
colours according to the variety of places where it comes. It is a

under a Tree, it gets upon a bough just over the Serpents head, &amp; void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

the bignesse of a great dog, more round than long, and the tail above
twice so long as the body, and so full of hair that under it he shelters
himself from rain, heat, cold, and wind. His head is small; and
hath a thin snout: his mouth round, with a tongue three quarters
of a yard long: he is diligent in seeking Ant-hills, which he tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with his claws, and then thrusts in his long tongue, upon which
the Ants run, and when it is full, he licks them in; and this is all his
food. <hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> v. 4. p. 1301.</p>

It hath a long snout, and the body is covered with shels like
Plates, wherewith they are armed: for they are so hard that no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

her eyes clear; hath a long muzzle; sharp, and offensive teeth.
Her hair is parti-coloured, harsh, and bristley, yellow above, and whiter

which is taken forth with a spoon or stick; But when she is wild,
she casts it forth of her own accord, and by the scent it is found by
the passengers.</p>

here was one of their skins brought into <hi>England,</hi> which from
the snout to the top of the tail, contained one and twenty foot in
length. They engender backwards as do Camels, Elephants, Rhinoce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roses,
Ounces, and Tygers. They spare such men as prostrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to them, and prey rather upon men than women, and not at all
on Infants, except compelled by hunger. His tail is his Scepter, by
which he expresses his passion. He shrinks not at danger, except
some covert of woods hides him from witnesses, and then he will take
the benefit of flight, which otherwise he seems to disdain.</p>
               <p>18. The <hi>Hyaena</hi> hath no joints in her neck, and therefore stirs not

face, hollow eyes, long hair upon the brows, his face and ears being
without hair: but his body is all hairy of a dunish colour, &amp;c. He
differs from a man only in his legs, which have no calves: he goes
alwayes upright upon his legs, and he carries his hands clasped in the
nape of his neck, when he walkes upon the ground: They use to
sleep in trees, and live upon fruits and nuts. <hi>Idem.</hi> v. 2. p. 982.</p>

hair on their foreparts than behind, which is like wooll: On the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone
they have maines like horses, and long hair from their Knees
downward, with much long hair on their throats: They are meat,
drink, shooes, houses, fire, vessels, and their masters whole substance.</p>
               <p>27. Other Creatures there are as big as horses, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
for their fine Wooll call Sheep: One of their horns usually weigheth
fifty pounds. <hi>P. Pil.</hi> v. 4. p. 1561.</p>
               <p>28. In <hi>Virginia</hi> is a beast called a <hi>Possown,</hi> the female whereof hath

and taketh them in again at her pleasure. <hi>Idem.</hi> p. 1772.</p>
               <p>29. In <hi>Socotera</hi> are Sheep, whose tails weigh twenty eight pounds
a peece, which therefore are usually cut off from the Ewes, least they

               <p>32. In the Island of <hi>Orknay</hi> the <hi>Ewes</hi> are of such fecundity, that
they bring forth constantly two, and many times three Lambs a peece;
There be neither ravenous nor venemous creatures there; nor if trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported

               <p>33. There are three sorts of <hi>Camels:</hi> the first sort are gross, and
tall of stature: these will usually carry one thousand pound weight a
peece; when they are to be loaden, being beaten on the knees, and
neck with a cudgel, they will kneel down; and when they feel their
load sufficient, they will rise up again of themselves. The second
sort of them have two bunches on their backs, and are fit either for
burthen, or to ride on. The third sort are of a slender, and low sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
called <hi>Dromedaries,</hi> unfit for burthens, but they excel in swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
so that in the space of one day they will travel one hundred
miles, and will so continue for eight, or ten dayes together, with very
little provender; and they will abstain from drink, eight, ten, and
sometimes fifteen dayes together, without any inconvenience, as
they travel through the Deserts.</p>
               <p>34. <hi>Musk</hi> is taken from a little reddish beast, that they beat with
many blows in one place, that so the blood may gather into it: and
when the skin is by this means swoln, and full of blood, they bind it
strait, that the blood may not issue forth, and being put into one, or
more bladders, its dryed on the beasts back, till the bladder fall off
of it self; and so that blood after a month becomes excellent musk.
<hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> v. 2. p. 1500.</p>
               <p>35. Amongst the <hi>Blackmoors,</hi> there is a strange beast called a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle,</hi>
which is seen only by night, having a stone in his forehead
that shineth incredibly, and giving him light whereby to feed: But
when he hears the lest noise, he presently lets fall over it a skin, which
he hath as a natural covering, least his splendor should betray him.
<hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> v. 1. p. 416.</p>
               <p>36. In <hi>Abassia</hi> are Kine with horns like unto Harts-horns: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

v. 2. p. 1495.</p>
               <p>37. There is in the Country of <hi>Mexico</hi> a kinde of sheep, which all
things considered, is a beast of the greatest profit, and least charge
that is: For from them they draw meat and cloathing: They use
them also to carry all their burthens, having need neither of shooes
nor saddles, nor yet of Oats, so that they serve their Masters for
nought, feeding only on Grass which they find in the fields:
There are two kinds of these creatures, the one bearing Wooll,
the other are bare, which are the better for burthen; they are big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than great Sheep, and less than Calves; they have long necks
like a Cammel. They are of divers colours, some white, some
black, and others grey, or spotted; Their flesh is good meat, but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51178:62"/>
that of their Lambs is best: Of their Wooll the <hi>Indians</hi> make cloath
some courser, other finer like half-silk; they also make Carpets, and
Coverings, and other exquisite works of it, which last long, and
have a very good gloss; they die it into sundry colours: upon these
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> carry their bars of silver; one of these sheep carrying
about an hundred and fifty pound weight.</p>
               <p>37. In the stomach, or belly of this beast, is found the <hi>Bezar's</hi>
stone; sometimes one alone, sometimes two, three, or foure: They
are different in form, greatness, and colour; some like Filbeards, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
like Walnuts: Some as big as Pigeons Eggs, some as big as
Hens Eggs: In form some are round, some oval, and of other formes.
For their colour, some are black, some white, some grey, dark green,
and some as if they had been gilded: they are all made of divers
filmes, and skins one upon another. <hi>P. Pil.</hi> v. 3. p. 969.</p>
               <p>38. There is in <hi>Italy</hi> the <hi>Tarantula</hi> (a kind of Serpent) the venome

square, three quarters of a mile in compass: it was made with seven

                     <hi>Trajan</hi> built a Bridge over the River <hi>Ister,</hi> or <hi>Danow,</hi> containing twenty
Arches, each Arch being one hundred and fifty Foot high, sixty thick, and
one hundred and seventy Foot distant one from another: So that the whole
length of it was four thousand seven hundred and seventy Foot, which was
almost a mile long. The River was very deep, and swift, and the bottom
not firm ground, neither could the stream be diverted any other way; all
which made the Work far more difficult, and admirable.</p>
