            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE AVTHOR HIS RE-ADVERTISEMENT to the Iudicious Christian READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat my Promise owed sixe of these Bookes of <hi>Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge against Murther</hi> to the World, the Title, and my Epistle (to the <hi>Reader)</hi> of the first Booke doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly testifie; It is now some ten yeares since that I published the third thereof, since when, my time and leisure hath still beene so interrupted, and (as it were) cut asunder by many different intervening Accidents, that I a long time both doubted and feared that the three last Bookes would have absolutely dyed upon the Designe: But I prayse and blesse God (Hee hath been so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to my desires, and so propitious to my intentions and resolutions) that I have cleered that doubt, and secured this feare; for now (by His sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Assistance and Providence) I have fully and compleatly finished them, and doe here present all Sixe Bookes to thee in one intire Volume. I am not so vaine or presumptuous, to thinke that they deserve to be seene and read of the more Iudicious; for my thoughts aspire to nothing unproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to my meane abilities. I knew it was a singular great and excellent poynt of wisedome in <hi>Socrates,</hi> who (by the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Apollo)</hi> was doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the wisest of Men, to confesse and acknowledge to the World, <hi>That hee knew but one thing, which was, that hee knew nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here, before I proceed farther, I must let the World know, that I understand there are a generation of people, who have beene so strangely ignorant, as to give out that these my <hi>Histories</hi> are not <hi>Originalls,</hi> but <hi>Translations,</hi> either from <hi>Italian</hi> or <hi>French;</hi> all which (with equall Truth and Modesty) I firmely contradict and deny, whether they regard <hi>Matter, Manner,</hi> or <hi>Method,</hi> or <hi>Phrase, Place,</hi> or <hi>Persons;</hi> for contrariwise I found out the grounds of them in my Travells, and (at mine owne leisure) composed and penned them, according to the rule of my weake Fancie and Capacity, they being so farre from <hi>Translations,</hi> that as I have hitherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
<pb facs="tcp:16653:8"/>
to imitate any therein, but my selfe, so had I beene so ambitious or vaineglorious to have given way, or consent to it, some Friends of mine in <hi>Paris,</hi> had long since done the three first Bookes into <hi>French,</hi> from my first <hi>Originall</hi> thereof: But knowing Humility to be the fairest Ornament of a Writer, and Modesty best to beeome Vertuous Mindes, I have hitherto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, and doe still resolve so to doe.</p>
                  <p>Now because as <hi>Idlenesse</hi> makes some too curious, and <hi>Curiosity</hi> makes others too idle, so it hath likewise pleased some (not so discreet as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) to condemne and taxe some of my <hi>Histories</hi> for being too long, and others for being too short, as if I were bound to observe and please their Fancie, more then the Truth, or mine owne Iudgement, or that in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving and penning thereof, I were obliged to delight and content them before my selfe. No, no, as long as I know Men are as different in their Opinions and Censures, as in their Countenances and Complexions, I shall rather connive, and not regard their (worthy to be pittyed) Ignorance, and resolve and content my selfe to contemne and passe by, rather then to esteeme or grieve at it. They will first I hope reade, before they understand; and let mee then request them also, that they will first understand, before they either censure, or taxe any part of what they reade, and so I doubt not, but they will both see, and finde, that (in the penning and publishing of these <hi>Histories)</hi> if I am not worthy of their <hi>Love,</hi> yet (at least) their unjust <hi>Envie</hi> and <hi>Detraction</hi> is every way unworthy of mee; and that although many Bookes of these our Times are not particularly approved and liked of for the present, yet it is not impossible for the future both to respect and honour them; and so I leave these uncharitable <hi>Zoylists</hi> to sleepe standing in the simplicity of their Ignorance, if they will not be rectifyed and reformed by warning: And I will now divert my Pen to the wise and religious Christian <hi>Readers,</hi> who well know what singular good effects it worketh in their Hearts, first to reade with Understanding, and then to apply with Charity and Prudence, for whose sakes soly I have now added these my three last Bookes of <hi>Gods Revenge against the Crying Sinne of wilfull Murther</hi> to the three former; For I send them to the publicke good, whereunto all our Endeavours should tend, to the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Christian Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> among Men, whereat all our Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises should ayme, and to the flourishing Advancement of Gods Honour and Glory, to which all the thoughts of our Hearts, and Faculties of our Soules should chiefly aspire and levell.</p>
                  <p>And because <hi>Sealiger</hi> affirmes, <hi>That nothing so soone allures or drawes a Reader to peruse and reade, as a strange Theame and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:16653:9"/>
Therefore this Path beeing seldome (if ever) troden or beaten by any other, I am so farre from despairing, as I am confident, at least, of thy Acceptance, if not of thy Approbation of these my Labours, and much the sooner, because as thou hast hertofore disburthened my <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner</hi> of the three first of these Bookes, so he (in contemplation thereof) hath now drawne the three last of them from mee to the <hi>Presse,</hi> with a more then common and usuall Importunitie; and I shall beare this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to my Grave, and I hope from thence to Heaven, that in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them all, I shall leave no pernicious Heire behinde me, to infect Youth with Scurrility, or corrupt their Manners and Inclinations with Incentives to Lewdnesse and Uanitie; which as it is the shame of this our Age, so it ought to bee the care of every good man, to shunne that which so many of our lewd and lascivious Pamphlets doe not. In wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heereof, I have consecrated my Pen rather to Instruction then Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and to Charity rather then Curiosity, and have made it my chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Care, Ambition, and Conscience, to profit thy soule, rather then to please thine Eare, and to savour more of Heaven then Earth; Yea, I will affirme (with equall Truth and Boldnesse) that I have written it with so innocent a Penne, that the purest and most unstayned Uirgin shall not need to make her beautifull Cheekes guilty of the least Blush in perusing it all over.</p>
                  <p>It is with no small Cost and Labour, that I first procured, then penned these <hi>Histories,</hi> and have now polished and prepared them to the <hi>Presse,</hi> aswell for the extirpating of that <hi>Execrable Sinne of Murther</hi> (which cryes so loude to Heaven for Uengeance) as also to shew thee Gods sacred Iustice, and righteous Iudgements, in the Vindication of the inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authours thereof; to the end, that (by the knowledge and reading of them) thou mayest become more Charitable, and more hate Crueltie, by their wretched and lamentable Examples, having heerein indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (as much as in mee lyes) to make my <hi>Reader</hi> a Spectatour, first of these their foule and bloudie Crimes, and then of their condigne and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarie Punishments, which (as a dismall Storme and terrible Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest from Heaven) fell on them on Earth, when they least dreamt or thought thereof.</p>
                  <p>And heere to conclude this my <hi>Readvertisement</hi> to thee, I religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from my Heart intreat thee to respect the Matter, not the Wordes, and the Importance and Consequence, more then the Dressing of these Thirty severall <hi>Tragicall Histories,</hi> whiles I will accompt and esteeme it a farre greater Happinesse for my selfe to learne true Charity, and the
<pb facs="tcp:16653:9"/>
true Feare of God in writing them, then to presume of my Ability to instruct and teach others by reading them, because I may justly and truely say with <hi>Lipsius,</hi> That my Aime and Desire in publishing of them, <hi>Is not that I might bee made greater, but better thereby, and (if it please God) others by mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What Spirituall Fortitude, or Benefit, thou reapest by their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Contemplation, I exhort thee, in steed of giving mee any Thankes, to reserve and give them wholly to God, Who is the Giver of all Good things, yea, the Father of Mercie, and the God of all Comfort and Consolation, to whose Grace I commit thee, defiring thee to assist mee with thy favourable Opinion, and daily Prayers to His Throne of Grace, as I shall ever bee ready to requite thee with mine.</p>

NEere <hi>Auxone</hi> (a strong and ancient Towne upon the frontiers of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the free County) dwelt an aged grave Gentleman (nobly descended, and of very faire demaynes) named <hi>Monsieur de Grandmont,</hi> who had to his wife a vertuous Lady, termed <hi>Madammoyselle de Carnye,</hi> the onely daughter of <hi>Monsieur de Buserat,</hi> a worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Citie of <hi>Dole:</hi> this married couple for a long time lived in the greatest height of content, that either Earth could afford, or their hearts desire, for as one way they grew opulent in lands and wealth, so another way they were indewed with three hopefull Sonnes, <hi>Grand Pre, Vileneufe,</hi> and <hi>Masseron,</hi> and with two daughters, <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyselles de Hautefelia,</hi> and <hi>de Cressye:</hi> a faire posterity: they blest in their Parents, and their Parents hoping themselves blest in them: so as (to the eye of the world) this one family promised to make many, (especially sith the youngest of the five had already attained its tenth yeare) but God in his providence ordayned the contrary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grand Pre</hi> (as the first and chiefest pillar of the house) craves leave of his Father that he might serve his apprentiship in the warres, under the command of that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Captaine, <hi>Grave Maurice</hi> then Earle of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> since Prince of <hi>Orenge, Vileneufe</hi> delighting in bookes, his Father thought fit to send to <hi>Pont-au Mousson,</hi> and thinking to retaine <hi>Masseron</hi> with him; he for his beauty was begg'd a Page by that valorous Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall of <hi>France</hi> who so wilfully and unfortunately lost his head in the <hi>Bastile</hi> of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for their two daughters, <hi>Hautefelia</hi> lived with her Parents; and <hi>de Cressye</hi> they presented to a great Lady of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who was long since the most afflicted and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull Wife and Mother to the Barons of <hi>Lux,</hi> Father and Sonne, who were both slaine by that generous and brave <hi>Lorayne</hi> Prince, the Knight of <hi>Guyse.</hi>

                     <p>But behold the inconstancie of fortune, or rather the power and pleasure of heaven, which can soone metamorphose our mirth into mourning, our joyes into teares, and our hopes into despaire: for within the compasse of one whole yeare, wee shall see three of these five Children laid in their graves, and of three severall deaths, for <hi>Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neufe</hi> was drowned at <hi>Pont-au Mousson</hi> as hee bathed himselfe in the River: <hi>Masseron</hi> was killed in a Duell at <hi>Fontaine bleau</hi> by <hi>Rossat</hi> a <hi>Gascon,</hi> being Page to the Duke of <hi>Espernon:</hi> and <hi>Hautefelia</hi> dyed at home of a burning Feaver with her Parents: a triple losse, which doth not onely afflict their hearts and soules, but also seemes to drowne their eyes with a deluge of mournefull and sorrowfull teares.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grandmont</hi> and <hi>de Carny</hi> his Wife, being thus made unfortunate and wretched by the death of three of their Children, they resolve to call home their other two, to bee comforts and props to their old age, but their hopes may deceive them. First, from the Baronesse of <hi>Lux</hi> comes <hi>de Cressye,</hi> who succeeding her sister, we must now terme by the name (or rather by the title) of <hi>Hautefelia;</hi> who hath a great and bloody part to act upon the Theater of this History: and after her very shortly comes <hi>Grand Pre</hi> from <hi>Holland,</hi> where (in divers services) hee left many honourable and memorable markes of his prowesse and valour behind him.</p>
                     <p>Vpon his arrivall to his Fathers house, the flowre of all the nobility and gentry of the Country, come to condole with him, for the death of his brothers and sister, as also to congratulate his happy returne (an office and complement which expresseth much affection and civility) they find <hi>Grand Pre</hi> a brave compleate Gentleman, not in outward pride, but in inward generositie and vertue, not in the vanity of fashions and apparell, but in the perfections and endowments of his mind and body: he is wholy addicted to the exercise of warre, and not to the art of courting of Ladies, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are in the campe of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Bellona,</hi> and not in the Palace of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid,</hi> well knowing that the one will breed him honour and glory, the other shame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; his pastimes are not crisping and powdering of his haire, quarrelling his tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor for the fashion of his clothes, dancing in velvet pumps, and tracing the street in a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16653:16"/>
neat perfumed Boote with jangling Spurres; yea, hee resembleth not young spruce Courtiers, who thinke no heaven to brave Apparell, nor Paradise to that of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse beauty: for hee onely practiseth riding of great Horses, Tilting, running at Ring, displaying the Colours, tossing the Pike, handling the Musket, ordering of Ranke and File, thereby to make himselfe capable to conduct and embattaile an Army, and to environ, fortifie, or besiege a City or Castle, or the like; yea, hee spurnes at the Lute and Viall, and vowes there is no musicke to the rattling of the Drumme and Trumpet, and to the thundring of the Musket and Canon: but this warlike and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall humour of his shall not last long: Wherin wee may observe the vanity of our thoughts, the inconstancy of our delights, and the alteration and mutability of our resolutions; for now we shal shortly see <hi>Grand Pre</hi> hate that he loved, &amp; love that he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yea, we shall see him so plunge and drown himselfe in the beauty of a faire &amp; sweet Gentlewoman, as he shall leave <hi>Holland</hi> for <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Warre for peace, Armes for Love, and Enemies for a Mistris: but time must worke this alteration and Metamorphosis.</p>
                     <p>The old Gentleman his father, seeing <hi>Grand Pre's</hi> martiall disposition, feares lest this ambitious and generous humour of his will induce him to seeke warres abroad, sith he findes none at home; and therefore, desirous of his company and presence, in that it will sweeten his former afflictions, and give life to his future hopes and content, he proffers him the choice of many rich and faire young Gentlewomen for his wife, of the best and most ancient families in and neare <hi>Auxone:</hi> but <hi>Grand Pre</hi> is deafe to these requests and motions, &amp; thinkes it a disparagement and blemish to his valour, if hee should any way listen, or give eare thereto, the which his father perceiving and understanding, he bethinkes himselfe of a further invention, and so resolves at Winter to leave the Countrey, and to reside in the City of <hi>Dijon,</hi> (famous for the ancient seate of the Dukes of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> and for the present Court of Parliament) hoping that there, amongst the multitude of sweet Ladies &amp; Gentlewomen, wherwith that City is adorned, his sonne <hi>Grand Pre</hi> might at last espye some Paragon of Nature, whose beauty might have power to subdue and captivate his affections, and indeed (as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell will shew) the event answereth his expectation.</p>
                     <p>For on a Sunday morning in Lent, as <hi>Grand Pre</hi> went to the royall Chappell to heare Father <hi>Iustinian</hi> (a Capuchin Fryer) preach, he opposite to him espies a most delicat and beautiful yong Lady, slender of body, tall of stature, fair of taynt &amp; complexion, having a quick &amp; gracious eye, with pure and delicate haire of a flaxen colour, being infinitely rich in Apparell, yet farre richer in the perfections and excellencies of a true and perfit beauty; in a word, she was so amiable and so lovely, so sweet, and so pleasing to his eyes, as at her very first sight <hi>Grand Pre</hi> could not refraine from blushing, as being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished with the sweetnesse of so sweet an object, so as his heart panted and beat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, as being not accustomed to encounter with such beauties, or with such sudden passions and alterations.</p>
                     <p>Now by this time this young gentlewoman (whose name we shall anon know) could not but perceive with what earnestnesse and delight <hi>Grand Pre</hi> beheld her, and seeing him to be a proper young Gallant, and richly apparelled and followed, shee could not refraine from dying her Lilly cheekes with a Vermillian blush, which gave such grace to her beauty, and so inflamed our poore <hi>Grand Pre,</hi> as he could no longer resist the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of such amorous assaults; and now it is that his thoughts strike sayle to affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and his heart doth homage to beauty, so as he revokes his former opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd against the power and dignity of Love, which he now holds erronious, and in his heart vowes that there is no such felicity in the world, as to enjoy the Lady of his desires, whom his eyes and soule chiefely honour and adore: But if he be insnared and imprisoned in the fetters of her beauty, no lesse is she in those of his personage, only she

is more coy and precise in the exterior demonstration there of: for as hee cannot keepe his eyes from gazing on her; so shee seemes but to looke on him by stealth, or if she transgresse that Decorum, she immediately, in outward apparance, checks her eyes from ranging beyond the lists of modesty and discretion.</p>
                     <p>But by this time, to the griefe of our new Lovers, the Sermon is ended, and all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to depart, so their eyes with much discontent and unwillingnesse, for that time take leave each of other: and here <hi>Grand Pre</hi> making a turne or two in the Church, is doubly tormented and perplexed, first with griefe, that he is deprived of his Mistris sight, and then with sorrow, that hee neither knowes her, nor her name: But as Love refines our wits, and gives an edge to our intentions, so he shewes her to his Page, and sends him to make secret enquiry what shee is. His Page speedily returnes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes him, that she is <hi>Madamoyselle Mermanda,</hi> eldest daughter to <hi>Mounsieur de Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonuille,</hi> one of the chiefest Presidents of tthe Court of Parliament. <hi>Grand Pre</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely rejoyceth to know what she was, and farre the more, in respect hee sees it no disparagement either to himselfe or his house to marry her: and therefore omitting all other designes and resolutions (and bidding farewell to the Warres) he resolves to seeke her in marriage; to which end, the next day, hee of set purpose, with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or two of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Grand Pre</hi> findes his first entertainment from <hi>Mermanda</hi> to bee respective and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: and so authorized by her curtesy and advice, he taking time at advantage, goes to the old President her father, and bewrayes him his affection to his daughter, and the desire he hath to obtaine her for his wife: so having begunne his suit, he leaves his father <hi>Grandmont</hi> to finish it, and continually frequents the companion of his beautifull Mistresse <hi>Mermanda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Her father <hi>Cressonville</hi> dislikes not this match, but deemes it both agreeable and honourable; onely hee knowes that <hi>Grandmont</hi> hath likewise one only daughter, and himselfe one onely sonne: so he infinitely desires to make this a double match, thereby to contract a more firme and stricter league betwixt their two houses; this is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and debated, as well betweene the young folkes, as the old Parents, and at last it takes effect, so as purposely omitting, first the conference, then the letters sent from <hi>Grand Pre</hi> to <hi>Mermanda,</hi> and from <hi>Mermanda</hi> to <hi>Grand Pre;</hi> from <hi>De Malleray (Cressonvilles</hi> sonne) to <hi>Hautefelia,</hi> and from <hi>Hautefelia</hi> to <hi>De Malleray;</hi> because the inserting thereof would make this briefe History swell into an ample volume. These Marriages, to the joy of the parents, and the sweet content of their sonnes and daughters, are pompously solemnized in <hi>Dijon,</hi> with all variety of feasting, dauncing, and masking, answerable to their degrees and dignities. But these Marriages shall not prove so fortunate as is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and expected, neither was <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> invited thereunto, or if he were, he refused to come; and therfore <hi>Lucina</hi> will likewise save her labor, because she knowes that neither of these two young married Gentlewomen shall live to make use of her assistance.</p>
                     <p>And here before I proceed farther, I wish the event of this History would give the lye to this ensuing position, that there is no pride nor malice to that of a woman; but I have more reason to feare then hope to believe the contrary: for no sooner have our two young couples reaped the fruites of Marriage, and the felicity of their desires, but

wee shall see the Sunne-shine of their joy overtaken with a difmall storme of griefe, sorrow and misfortune; whereby wee may obserue and learne, that there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect nor permanent felicity under the Sunne, but that all things in this world, yea, the World it selfe is subject to revolution and change. The manner is thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hautefelia</hi> envies her sister in Law <hi>Mermanda's</hi> advancement, and contemnes her own; she likes not to give the hand to her, whom she knowes is by descent her inferiour, and to speake truth, preferres a Scarlet Cloake before a Blacke, and a Sword-man before a Pen-man; these ambitious conceits of hers, proceeding from hell, wil breed bad bloud, and produce mournefull effects; yea, peradventure strangle her, who imbraceth and practiseth them.</p>

But <hi>Hautefelia</hi> envying <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda's</hi> prosperity and glory, because she could neither parallel the one, nor equall the other, &amp; seeing with no other eyes then those of ambition and envy, bethinks her selfe she might act her disgrace, and eclipse the splendor of her vertues and glory.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Grand Pre</hi> arrives at <hi>Dijon,</hi> and is welcomed of his Brother and Sister, but he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers her to bee more sorrowfull then accustomed; he is ignorant what these clouds of her discontent import, or from whence they arise: but he shall know too soone, and his curiosity shall pay deare to understand it. Supper ended, they fetch a walke in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and so he is conducted to his Chamber, where his brother in Law <hi>De Malleray</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him the good night, his sister <hi>Hautefelia</hi> with teares in her eyes informes him, that she knowes for certaine, the Baron of <hi>Betanford</hi> is too familiar with his wife <hi>Mermanda,</hi> yea, beyond the bounds of honesty, the which she must needs reveale him, because his honor is hers, which, as she is bound by nature, she wil cherish &amp; preserve as her own life.</p>

After Supper (jealousy being his chiefest dish; and griefe, hers) hee makes three or foure solitary turnes in the Court, and then sends his Page for his wife, who betwixt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and gtiefe, hope and dispaire, presently comes to him: He demands of her whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she will walke with him; shee answereth, that his pleasure shall ever bee hers: and that shee will most joyfully and willingly wayt on him where hee pleaseth: hee brings her to a solitary Grove, and there having choller in his lookes, and fire in his tongue, hee chargeth her of dishonesty with the Baron of <hi>Betanford.</hi>

                     <p>The Chirurgions (in stead of two Gentlemen for their Seconds) dispose themselves according to the order and ceremonies of Duels) to search the Combatants for Coats of Male, or the like: but they might have eased themselves of this labour and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity; for both the Gentlemen were too honorable, to have their valours tainted with this base poynt of cowardize, or treachery; yea, in meere contempt thereof, they both of purpose had left their Dublets behind them.

againe, fall to it with bravery and courage: in which encounter <hi>Betanford</hi> receives a wide wound upon the brawne of his right arme, and <hi>Grand Pre</hi> another thorow his left side, which undoubtedly had proved mortall, and so ended the Combate with his life, had not his sword glanced on a ribbe, and so ranne outwards; and now they both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to take breath, resolving to advance with more fury: they part againe, <hi>Betanford</hi> runnes <hi>Grand Pre</hi> thorow the necke, and hee <hi>Betanford</hi> thorow the small of the arme, where meeting with the sinewes and arteries, it causeth the sword to fall out of his hand, whereat hee is extreamely perplexed and amazed.</p>
                     <p>Here perchance some base fellow (who had never beene trained up in the Schoole of Honour, and therefore not deserved the title of a Gentleman) would have wrought upon the misfortune of this accident, and desired no better advantage to dispatch his Adversary: But <hi>Grand Pre,</hi> whose generosity in this I commend, as much as I detest his jealousy, doth highly disdaine to staine his honour and courage with this infamy, and so puts <hi>Betanford</hi> out of his apprehension and feare with these words; Baron, be couragious and cheerfull, for I will rather dye, then disgrace my selfe so much, to fight with an unarmed man, and so commands his Chirurgion to deliver him his sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>Betanford</hi> is thankfull to him for this courtesy, and vowes he will never forget it.</p>
                     <p>Now although their wounds doe rather ingraine then imbroder their shirts with blood, yet their youth is so vigorous, their courage Io inflamed, and their hearts so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and magnanimous, as they neither can, nor will yet rest satisfyed: in a word, they mannage their horses bravely, and act wonders with their swords; for by this time they having runne foure severall Careres: <hi>Betanford</hi> hath received seven wounds, and given <hi>Grand Pre</hi> ten: but the losse of all this bloud, (which now issued from their bodies rather by spowts then drops) is not capable to coole their courages: and so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with dust, sweat, blould, and wounds, they rather looke like Furies then men, yet they will not refraine fighting.</p>
                     <p>And now their Chirurgians grieving and pittying to see them, as it were drowned in their bloud, and well knowing that they had performed more then they thought possible for men, they both agree, and so running with their hats in their hands, humbly pray them to desist and rest satisfyed, by shewing them that their swords and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had already acted wonder beyond beliefe, and that it was pitty their praents, Prince, and Country should be deprived of such resolute and valorous Cavaliers, then whom, the world (upon so unfortunate an accident) hath seldome seen braver: but they speake to the winde, and receive no other thankes, but this checke from them both, that they are base fellowes, and know not what belongs to their function and duety; and so ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and commanding them away, they once more divide themselves, and with fresh resolution and courage, againe set spurres to their horses; but this encounter proves more happy to <hi>Betanford,</hi> and more dangerous to <hi>Grand Pre:</hi> for as hee makes a thrust to <hi>Betanford,</hi> which mist and past under his right arme, without doing any other harme then piercing and cutting thorow his shirt, <hi>Betanford</hi> (with all the courage and dexterity he had) runne <hi>Grand Pre</hi> thorow the belly into the reynes, with which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate wound, as also with a false pace, his horse then mad, he fell from the Saddle to the ground speechlesse, sprawling and struggling, as if hee were upon the point to take his last farewell of the world: but he was not so happy, for he shall be cured of his wounds, and hereafter dye of a more mournefull and lamentable end.</p>

Reciprocall and singular demonstrations of courtesy and honour in these two Caveliers, which will make their memories famous to posterity.</p>

                     <p>About noone, <hi>Grand Pre's</hi> speech by little and little comes to him, and likewise his memorie, when <hi>Betanford</hi> absenting all from his Chamber, with his Hat in his hand came to his bed side, and having courteously saluted and comforted him, prayes and conjures him, as hee is a Gentleman of Honour, to tell him why and wherefore hee fought with him. Ah Baron (quoth <hi>Grand Pre)</hi> first sweare to mee on thine honour, thou wilt deliver me the truth of a question I will demand of thee, and then I wil shew thee. By my honour and fidelitie, replies <hi>Betanford,</hi> and as I hope for heaven, I will. Then Baron (quoth hee) diddest thou never wrong me and mine honour, in being too familiar with my wife <hi>Mermanda?</hi> The Baron with many solemne protestations and religious oathes, cleares both himselfe and <hi>Mermanda,</hi> and vowes, that his heart never thought it much lesse his tongue ever attempted it. Whereat <hi>Grand Pre</hi> very humbly intreats him to excuse and pardon him, sith he understood and beleeved the contrary, which was the onely cause of his discontent and challenge: adding withall, that hee will, till death, esteeme him as his most honourable friend, and, as long as he liues, will affect and loue his wife dearer than ever he had before. It is as great a happinesse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire and reforme errours, as a misery to commit them.</p>
                     <p>The Baron of <hi>Betanford</hi> stayes very secretly ten dayes with <hi>Grand Pre</hi> at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey house, when seeing his wounds hopefully cured and recovered, they resolve to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. <hi>Grand Pre</hi> kindly thankes <hi>Betanford</hi> for his life, and all other courtesies hee hath received of him, and hee as courteously doth the like to <hi>Grand Pre,</hi> for giving him his sword wherewith he preserved his owne, and so like honourable and intimate friends, they take leave each of other, the Baron taking horse for <hi>Paris,</hi> and freely lending <hi>Grand Pre</hi> his Coach to returne to <hi>Auxone.</hi> Thus wee see courtesie alwayes returneth with interest.</p>

At the knowledge here of, I know not whethet <hi>Mermanda</hi> (like a gracious and curteous wife) doe more grieve at her husbands wounds, then rejoyce at his recovery and life: and now he repenting and detesting his former errour, renewes his love, affection, and friendship to her, the which hee confirmeth and uniteth with a perpetuall and indisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble Gordion knot: neverthelesse the variety of her afflictions, and the excesse of her griefe and discontent, breeds her much weakenesse and sickenesse, which withereth the Roses and Lillies of her beauty.</p>
                     <p>But come wee from <hi>Mermanda's</hi> heavenly Vertues to <hi>Hautefelia's</hi> devillish Vices, which cannot be paralleld or compared, except by <hi>Antithesis:</hi> for as <hi>Mermanda</hi> repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth her selfe under the shaddow of her owne innocencie, and lives in perfect love and charity with the whole world, so her wretched Sister in law <hi>Hautefelia,</hi> seeing her hopes and purposes prevented, will not sleepe in her malice, but sets her wits and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon the Tenter-hookes, to finde out another expedient, to be rid of <hi>Mermanda,</hi> who (in her wicked conceit) shee thought was enemy to her content, and an eye-sore to her ambition and greatnesse.</p>
                     <p>We no sooner fly from God, but the devil followes us; &amp; it proves alwaies a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble folly to be wise in wickednes and sin: <hi>Hautefelia</hi> is resolute in her rage, and cannot or rather will not see heaven for hell, she be thinks her selfe of another invention to send <hi>Mermanda</hi> into another world, and so strikes a bargaine with <hi>La Fresnay</hi> an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary for two hundred crowns to poyson her, who like a limbe of the devil doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and promise it, the which (Ah griefe to thinke thereon) he in lesse then two months performeth; and so this vertuous and harmles young Gentlewoman is most unnaturally and treaherously bereaved of her life, and brought to a mournfull and lamentable end: Which inhumane murther, we shall see, God in his due time will miraculously detect, and severely revenge and punish.</p>
                     <p>Her Husband <hi>Grand Pre</hi> exceedingly bewayles her death, as also all her parents and friends; yea, so infinite were her Vertues, and so sweet her behaviour and carriage, as all that knew <hi>Mermanda</hi> lamented her decease, yet no way suspecting or knowing the violent and extraordinary cause thereof.</p>
                     <p>Now, whiles others mourne, <hi>Hautefelia</hi> exceedingly triumphs and rejoyces hereat: but this bloudy victory shal cost her deare. In the meane time, <hi>Mermanda's</hi> single death can neither quench her revenge, nor satisfy her ambition; for as shee liked not the Sister, so she (as before we have partly understood) never loved the Brother, her owne husband <hi>de Malleray,</hi> whom she observed, very bitterly wept and grieved at his sister <hi>Mermanda's</hi> death; she therefore, resolute to adde sinne to sinnne, resolves to cast the apple of discord betwixt <hi>Grand Pre</hi> her brother, and <hi>de Malleray</hi> her husband, knowing that if the first were slaine, shee were sole heire to her father, if the second, shee would have a noble Husband; a policie, whose invention is as diabolicall, as the execution thereof dangerous.</p>
                     <p>To which effect she informes her husband, that her Brother <hi>Grand Pre</hi> had killed his Wife <hi>Mermanda</hi> with his jealousy, that hee held her to bee the Baron of <hi>Betanford's</hi> strumpet, with whom for the same cause he had fought at <hi>Brie-count Robert,</hi> and which was more, it was shrewdly suspected he had poysoned her, the which she once thought for ever to have concealed, but that she knew her husband was, and ought to be n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But old <hi>Cressonville</hi> (having as well his head in his eyes, as his eyes in his head:) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this suspition and accusation had no firme grounds, that it was an intricate bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse to finde out, that it would breed a scandall to his family, and especially to his deceased daughters reputation, sith it is the nature of calumnie to ayme at the most vertuous persons, as <hi>Cantharides</hi> doe at the fairest flowers; that it would rake up the dust of her tombe, and withall breed him an infinite number of potent and powerfull enemies: Therefore grounding his judgement upon these reasons, and his resolutions upon this his judgement, he holds it best to smother it in silence, and so to brooke his daughters death as patiently as he may.</p>

                        <hi>Grand Pre,</hi> though newly recovered of his late wounds, accepts this Challenge, but not without extreame wonder to see <hi>De Malleray</hi> so passionate and resolute; he makes choice of single Rapier, and so they meet, where, without any other ceremony they throw off their dublets, and giue them to their Chirurgions, whom they command to stay without the next hedge, and not stirre from thence, till the death of the one proclaime the other victor.</p>
                     <p>The Sunne (that great and glorious lampe of heaven) swiftly poasts away from our Horizon to the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> of purpose not to see, or bee accessary to this bloody Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie, when our Champions unsheath their swords, and dispose themselves to fight both with judgement and resolution; <hi>De Malleray</hi> comes up fairely, proffers the first thrust, and gives <hi>Grand Pre</hi> a wound in his left thigh, and in exchange receives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from him in the necke, which he aymed fully at the brest, but that hee bore it up with his Rapier. <hi>Grand Pre</hi> at first gives backe, but seeing <hi>de Malleray</hi> insult and presse on him, he resolutely advanceth, and runnes him thorow the side: but the wound was so favourable, as though it caused much bloud, yet it brought no danger. They make a stand and take breath, and so they very resolutely to it againe: <hi>de Malleray</hi> having hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the worst, doth now resolve to manage his busines with lesse violence and more judgement; when <hi>Grand Pre</hi> driving home to him, hee wardes bravely, and taking time at advantage, thrusts him in the left shoulder with a wide and deepe wound, but himselfe is hurt in the left arme with a wound, which ranne from his wrest to his elbow.</p>

By this time their shirts are deepely besprinkled and gored with their bloud: but this will not appease their courages, they will try againe; for they never thinke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough as long as they can stand, and this encounter proves as fortunate for <hi>Grand Pre,</hi> as fatall for <hi>De Malleray:</hi> for he receives a deepe wound under his left pap, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his life and soule from this world to another; so as without speaking one word, he falls dead to the ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grand Pre</hi> seeing <hi>De Malleray</hi> dead, gives thankes to God for his victory, and so mounts on horse-backe, and with his Chirurgion poasts towards <hi>Dole,</hi> a Parliament City of the free County; belonging now to the Arch Duke <hi>Albertus,</hi> leaving <hi>De Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leray's</hi> Chirurgion, not to cure, but to bury his Master, or at least to convey his dead body to <hi>Dijon,</hi> for President <hi>Cressonville</hi> his father to performe that office,</p>
                     <p>Who is no sooner advertised of his sonnes death, but with teares hee gives the Parliament to understand thereof, and craves justice for the Murther. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment decrees a power to apprehend <hi>Grand Pre;</hi> but hee is not desirous to lose his head on a Scaffold: for by this time hee hath recovered <hi>Dole,</hi> where having stayed some three moneths his parents and friends (by the favour of that generous and true noble Gallant, <hi>Mounsieur le Grand,</hi> his Majesties Lievetennant of that Province of <hi>Burgundy)</hi> procured and sent him his pardon.</p>
                     <p>But in this meane time come wee to his sister <hi>Hautefelia</hi> (the disgrace of her sexe, and the fire-brand of Hell) who no sooner understood the death of her husband, and the flight of her brother, shee having hardly the patience to see him layd in his grave, and resolving rather to breake her necke with malice, then her heart with sorrow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sure of her Dowry, packes up her Iewells, Plate, and chiefest Baggage, and so leaves <hi>Dijon,</hi> and goes home to her father neere <hi>Auxone,</hi> where during the age of her father and mother, and the absence of her brother, she most imperiously swayes and commands all.</p>
                     <p>But this her authority lasteth not long: for now home comes <hi>Grand Pre</hi> from <hi>Dole,</hi> at whose returne she findes matters altered, and her greatnesse and power diminished, and to her grief sees that she cannot so absolutely domineere as before; and which was farre worse, her brother in his absence at <hi>Dole,</hi> having smelt and understood her malice and inveterate hatred, both to <hi>Mermanda,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Betanford, De Malleray</hi> her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and likewise to himselfe (though nothing suspecting or dreaming of her poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning humour) he is so farre from acknowledging or respecting her for his sister, as he will neither indure her company or sight; which she making no shew to perceive, but like a Fury of hell, as she is, dissembling her malice and revenge, she is still constant, and persevers in her humour of bloud and Murther, and hath againe recourse to her exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Apothecary <hi>La Fresnay,</hi> and to the devill her Doctor likewise, to make away her brother <hi>Grand Pre</hi> with poyson, as hee had already <hi>Mermanda</hi> his Wife, and gives him three hundred crownes to effect it. This damnable Apothecary, loving money well, and (as it seemes) the Devill better, doth ingage himselfe speedily to performe it, and, wretched villaine as he is, within two moneths he accomplisheth and finisheth it; and so as <hi>Mermanda</hi> ranne equall fortune with him in life, hee doth the like with her in death; for one deadly Drugge, one bloody Sister, and one devillish Apothecary gives a miserable and lamentable end to them both.</p>
                     <p>And now his blood thirsty sister <hi>Hautefelia</hi> (the authour of these cruell Murthers and Trageedies) thinking her selfe freed of all her enemies, and of all those who stood in the way of her advancement and preferment, shee (neither thinking either of her conscience or soule, of heaven or hell) domineeres farre more then before; yea, builds castles in the ayre, and flatters her selfe with this false ambition, that she must now be a Dutchesse, or at least a Countesse: But she reckons without God.</p>

                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:16653:24"/>
We have seene, nay we have here glutted our eyes with severall Murthers, whereof wee have beheld this wretched Gentlewoman <hi>Hautefelia</hi> to be the horrible and cruell author, and this execrable <hi>La Fresnay</hi> to be the bloody actor: these crimes of theirs, and the smoake of these their impious and displeasing sacrifices, have pierced the clouds, and ascended the presence of God, to sue and draw downe vengeance and confusion on their heads: for although Murther be for a time concealed, yet the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God will in due time detect and discover it; for he will make inquisition for blood, and will severely and sharpely revenge the death of his children.</p>
                     <p>But Gods providence and justice in the discovery thereof, is as different as mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: for sometimes hee protracts and deferres it of purpose, either to mollifie or to harden our hearts, as seemes best to his inscrutable will, and divine pleasure; or as may chiefly serve and tend to his glory: yea, somtimes he makes the Murtherer himselfe as well an instrument to discover, as hee hath beene an actor to commit murther: yea, and many times he punisheth one sinne by and in another, and when the Murtherer sits most secure, and thinks least of it, then he heapes coales of fire on his head, and sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cuts him off with the revenging sword of his fierce wrath and indignation.</p>
                     <p>And now that great and soveraigne Iudge of the World, who rides on the Winds in triumph, and hath Heaven for his Throne, and Earth for his foot stoole, will no longer permit <hi>Hauteselia</hi> and <hi>La Fresnay</hi> to goe unpunished for these their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Murthers: for the innocent and dead bodies of <hi>Mermanda</hi> and her husband <hi>Grand Pre</hi> out of their Graves cry to him for revenge, which, like an impetuous storme, or a terrible Thunder clap, doth in this manner suddenly befall and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them.</p>
                     <p>Some sixe weekes after <hi>Grand Pre's</hi> funeralls were solemnized, whereat his Sister <hi>Hautefelia</hi> (the better to cloke her villany) wept bitterly, and was observed to bee the chiefest Mourner; this hellish Apothecary <hi>La Fresnay,</hi> having gotten his money so easily, thought to spend it as prodigally; and so on a time, being in his cups at a Taverne at <hi>Dijon,</hi> and his braines swilling and swimming with strong Wine (as Drunkennesse is the Bawd and Vsher to other sinnes) he stealing from the rest of his company, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a Rape upon one <hi>Margaret Pivot,</hi> a girle of twelve yeares old, being the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners daughter of the Taverne wherein he sate tippling.</p>
                     <p>This young girle, with millions of teares throwes her selfe to the feet of her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and accuseth <hi>La Fresnay</hi> for the fact, who doe the like to those famous Senators of the Court of Parliament: so hee is apprehended; and being examined, with many vehement and bitter asseverations denyeth it: he is adjudged to the Racke, and at the second torment confesseth it, and so he is condemned to be hanged.</p>
                     <p>Two <hi>Capuchin</hi> Fryers prepare him for his end: they exhort him not to charge &amp; bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his soule with concealing any other crimes, adding, that if he reveale and repent them in earth, God will remit them in heaven: these exhortations of theirs produce good effects; for though he have formerly lived like a devill, he will now dye like a Christian: and so with many teares revealeth, that at the instigation of <hi>Hautefelia,</hi> and for the lucre of five hundred crownes (which at two several times she gave him) he had poysoned <hi>Mermanda</hi> and her husband <hi>Grand Pre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the world is amazed, and the Parliament acquainted herewith, they alter their first Sentence, and so for his triple villanies condemne <hi>La Fresnay</hi> to bee broken alive upon the Wheele, and there to languish and dye without being strangled: which in <hi>Dijon</hi> is accordingly executed to the full satisfaction of Iustice.</p>
                     <p>A Provost likewise is forthwith dispatched from <hi>Dijon</hi> to <hi>Grandmonts</hi> house, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his daughter <hi>Hautefelia,</hi> and God would have it that shee was ignorant of <hi>La Fresnay's</hi> apprehension, and more, of his death. The Provost findes her dancing in her

fathers garden, in company of many Gentlemen and Ladies: he sets hands on her; and so exchangeth her mirth into mourning, and her songs into teares: she is brought to <hi>Dijon,</hi> and examined by a President, and two Counsellors of the Parliament. She impudently and boldly denyes both Murders; saith <hi>La Fresnay</hi> is her mortall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed enemy, and therefore not to bee believed. But the devill, who hath so long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched and deluded her, either will not, or rather now cannot save her with this poore evasion: shee is adjudged to the Racke, and at the first torment confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it.</p>
                     <p>The Criminall Iudges of this great and illustrious Parliament, in detestation of these her execrable and bloudy crimes of Murther, pronounce sentence on her: so, after shee had repented her sinnes, and prepared her selfe to dye, her Paps are seared, and torne off with red hot Pincers, then shee is hanged, her body burnt, and her ashes throwne into the ayre.</p>
                     <p>Now to gather some profit by reading this History, or indeed, rather by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the History it selfe, let us observe, nay let us imprint in our hearts and soules how busy the Devill was by ambition, covetousnesse, malice and revenge, to seduce and perswade <hi>Hautefelia</hi> and <hi>La Fresnay</hi> to commit these Murthers; and also how just God was in the detection and punishment thereof, that the feare of the one may terrifie us from imbracing and attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the other: to the end, that as they lived in sinne, and dyed in shame; so wee may live in righteousnes, and dye in peace, thereby to live in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall felicity and glory.</p>

                     <p>In <hi>Pavia</hi> (the second City of the Dutchy of <hi>Millan)</hi> the very last yeare that <hi>Count Fuentes</hi> (under the King of <hi>Spaine)</hi> was Viceroy of that State, <hi>Signior Thomaso Vituri,</hi> a noble Gentleman of that City, had one onely child, a daughter of the age of fifteene yeares, named <hi>Dona Christeneta,</hi> who was exceeding faire and beautifull, and indued with many excellent qualities &amp; perfections, requisite in a Gentlewoman of her ranke: she was sought in marriage by many Gallants of the City: but a Cavalier of <hi>Cremona</hi> must beare her away, or at least her affection: The History is thus.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16653:25"/>
for his wife: he acquaints none herewith, but an intimate deare friend of his, a young Gentleman of the same City, named <hi>Signior Ludovicus Pisani,</hi> by descent a <hi>Venetian,</hi> whom hee prayes to assist and accompany him to <hi>Pavia,</hi> in seeking and courting the faire <hi>Christeneta</hi> his Mistresse. <hi>Pisani</hi> tearmes himselfe much honoured and obliged to <hi>Gasparino,</hi> and very willingly grants his request; and so they prepare for their journy.</p>
                     <p>They come to <hi>Pavia: Vituri</hi> bids <hi>Gasparino</hi> welcome, and entertaines him respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and courteously, as also <hi>Pisani;</hi> he thankes <hi>Gasparino</hi> for the honour he doth him in seeking his daughter, and like a carefull father takes time to consult hereon: but for <hi>Christeneta,</hi> she looks not so pleasing nor pleasantly on him as he expecteth; he is deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love both with her beauty and other perfections, but he finds her cold in her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and answers, and very melancholly and pensive: he courts her often (and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Italian</hi> fashion, with variety of Musicke, Ditties, and ayres) but still he findes her averse, and contrary to his desires, as if her thoughts were otherwise fixed. <hi>Gaspari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> knowes not how to winne her affection, nor how to beare himselfe herein; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults with <hi>Pisani,</hi> and prayes him to conferre with <hi>Christeneta,</hi> and to sound her affection: But it proves often dangerous, still indiscretion, to trust a friend in this case.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pisani</hi> promiseth to performe the office of a friend, and to conferre effectually with <hi>Christeneta;</hi> he seekes opportunity and place, and findes both; he sets out to her <hi>Gaspa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino's</hi> merits, and paints foorth his praises, and in a word, leaves nothing untouched, which hee thinkes may any way advance his friends content and affection: but hee findes <hi>Christeneta's</hi> minde perplexed and troubled; for shee often changeth colours, now red, then pale, and then pale, now red againe: yet hee observes that her eyes are still stedfastly fixed on him: hee prayes her that she will returne a pleasing answer for him to carry to his friend, and her lover <hi>Gasparino.</hi>

                        <hi>Christeneta</hi> would willingly speake, but cannot, for her heart and paps beat and pant, and her fighes very confusedly interrupt her words; but at last, dying her Lilly cheekes with a Vermillian blush, shee tells him that she is not ignorant of <hi>Gasparino's</hi> merits, who deserves farre her better, but that shee cannot consent to love him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect she hath fixed, but not ingaged her affection on another. <hi>Pisani</hi> still extolleth his friend <hi>Gasparino</hi> to the skie, and for all honourable parts preferres him before any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Lombardy;</hi> and withall, with much industry and insinuation, endeavours to request and draw <hi>Christeneta</hi> to name him her servant, which she once thought to have done, had not Modesty (the sweetest and most precious ornament of a Virgin) for that time with-held her, when after two or three deepe sighes (the outward Heralds of her inward passions) she told him thus,</p>

                        <hi>Pisani</hi> cannot imagine what friend of his it should be that <hi>Christeneta</hi> loveth, but she knowes enough for them both; and it may be, too much for her selfe: she knowes it at least an immodest, if not a bold part for her to court <hi>Pisani,</hi> who ought rather to court her: but she thinkes it both wisedome and duety to give way to that which she cannot avoyd and prevent, and so preferres the zeale of her affection before the respect of her modesty: but that which makes her so resolute in the execution of this her amorous attempt is, to see that <hi>Gasparino</hi> hath found <hi>Pisani</hi> to sollicite for him to her, and shee can finde none but her selfe to sollicite for her selfe to <hi>Pisani:</hi> therfore bold in this her resolution, she beares so deep and so deare an affection to <hi>Pisani,</hi> that she thinkes every moment an houre, and every houre an age, before she see <hi>Pisani,</hi> that one person of the World, whom she loves more deare then all the world. Thus wishing night day, her house the Nunnery, and her chamber the garden: shee with much impatient patiency awayts the houre of eight, which shee knowes will bring her her joy or her torment, her felicity or her misery, her life or her death.</p>
                     <p>The Clocke strikes eight: <hi>Christeneta</hi> takes her Prayer-booke, and her Wayting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayd, and so trips away to the Nunnery; but she doth now dispense with her devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to give content to her eyes, or rather to her heart, in seeing and injoying the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired company of <hi>Pisani,</hi> whom she esteemes the life of her content, and the content of her life, and so forsakes the Church, to goe to the Garden: <hi>Pisani,</hi> who never failed of his houre and promise to men, doth now disdaine to misse thereof to a Lady: for <hi>Christeneta</hi> hath scarce made three paces in the walkes of the Garden, but ere the fourth be finished, shee sees <hi>Pisani</hi> enter, shee blushes at his sight, and hee growes pale at her blushes: he findes her in a bower of Sycamors, Cypresses, and Vines, decked within with Roses, Lillies, and Gilly-flowers, hee gives her the good-morrow and the salute, the which, with a modest and sweet courtesy, she receives and returnes; he tells her he is come to performe his promise, and if it please her, to receive hers: shee would faine answer him, but her cheekes give blushes, where her tongue should words; but at last, darting a sweet looke on him (which was the Embassadour and Herald of her heart) she discovereth her selfe to him thus:</p>
                     <p>The person <hi>(Pisani)</hi> on whom I have fixed and settled my affection, doth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resemble you, is of your owne blood, and of your neerest and dearest acquaintance. <hi>Pisani</hi> presseth her to know his name; when after many glances, sighes, and blushes, shee tells him, his name is <hi>Pisani,</hi> and himselfe the man, prayes him to pardon her bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to give an honourable interpretation and construction to her affection, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Pisani</hi> wonders at this unexpected newes, and knowes not how to beare himselfe in a businesse of this nature; hee sees that her beauty deserves love, and her descent and vertues respect: but withall, he is not so dishonourable to betray his friend; he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at her affection, and is not ignorant that she deserves a more noble husband then himselfe, but seeing her languish for an answer, he returnes her thus: <hi>Although I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my selfe infinitely bound to you for that affection of yours, wherewith you please to honour mee, yet as honour is to be preferred before affection, so</hi> Christeneta <hi>must excuse</hi> Pisani, <hi>sith hee cannot bee a servant to her, but he must bee a traytor to</hi> Gasparino; <hi>and that respect excepted, in requitall of your favour, I will esteeme my selfe happy if I may lose my life for your service.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet hee is not so unkinde, but gives her a kisse or two at farewell which as much

delights <hi>Christeneta,</hi> as his refusall doth afflict her: so they part. The rest, time must bring forth.</p>
                     <p>Now although <hi>Gasparino</hi> have left <hi>Pavia,</hi> yet he cannot forsake his affection to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steneta,</hi> but cherisheth her memory, and in heart adoreth her Idaea; yea he loves her deepely and dearely, and indeed her perfections and beauty deserve love: but such is <hi>Christeneta's</hi> affection to <hi>Pisani,</hi> as she can take no truce of her thoughts: but despight of discretion and modesty (which perswade and counsell her to the contrary) she with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ten dayes after purposely sends a confident Messenger to him, to <hi>Cremona</hi> with this Letter:</p>

If <hi>Pisani</hi> his first Letter overthrew <hi>Christeneta's</hi> despaire, this his second revives and confirmes her hopes; so that whereas heretofore she condemned her presumption in writing to <hi>Pisani,</hi> she now not only applauds her resolution therein, but also blesseth the houre that she attempted it; yea, she buildeth such castles of delight and content in her heart, and her heart in her soule, to thinke that shee should be his Wife, and hee her Husband, that shee anticipateth the houres, and blames the dayes for not presenting her with the sight and presence of her sweet <hi>Pisani,</hi> whom, above all earthly contents, she chiefely desireth.</p>
                     <p>Now if <hi>Christeneta</hi> were thus perplexed with the absence of her <hi>Pisani,</hi> no lesse is hee with that of his <hi>Christeneta:</hi> for remembring the freshnesse of her youth, and the sweetnesse of her beauty, hee in conceipt hateth <hi>Cremona,</hi> which before hee loved, and now loveth <hi>Pavia,</hi> which before hee hated: it is as great a griefe to him to bee with his other affaires without her, as it would rejoyce him to bee with her without them: yea, she runnes so deepely in his thoughts, and they on her beauty, as (if it were not immodesty) hee either wisheth himselfe impaled in her armes, or shee incloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered in his. And now to performe as much as his Letter hath promised, hee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking or respecting of his old friend <hi>Gasparino,</hi> prepares all things ready to goe see his new Mistresse <hi>Christeneta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hee comes to <hi>Pavia,</hi> accompanied with three or foure of his neerest and dearest friends, visiteth <hi>Christeneta,</hi> whom hee saluteth and courteth with all kinde of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and amorous complements: Shee is joyfull, yea, ravished with his arrivall: he doth assure her of his perpetuall affection, and reciprocally himselfe of hers; yea, she so infinitely delights in his presence, and he so extreamely in hers, that shee now free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives her selfe to <hi>Pisani,</hi> and he in exchange, as absolutely takes himselfe from <hi>Gaspa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino,</hi> to give himselfe to <hi>Christeneta:</hi> so as she rejoycing in her purchase, and he trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing in his victory, they attend the time, wherein heaven and earth hath ordayned of two bodies to make them one.</p>
                     <p>But it is not enough for <hi>Pisani</hi> to be possessed of <hi>Christeneta's</hi> favour: for he must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise obtaine that of her parents, before either hee can enjoy his wishes, or she her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and so he goes honourably and secretly to worke with them: but he findes them not so tractable as <hi>Christeneta</hi> hoped, or himselfe desired: for old <hi>Vituri</hi> her father pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring wealth before honour, and riches before vertues, dislikes this motion, alledging that <hi>Pisani's</hi> father dyed exceedingly in debt, that his chiefest Lands were ingaged and morgaged, that hee had many great Legacies to pay to his sisters, but which was worst of all, that <hi>Pisani</hi> himselfe loved the Court better then the Country, and that in his expences and apparell hee was extreamely prodigall, and frugall in neither: which considerations so swayed the judgement and opinion of <hi>Vituri,</hi> that knowing he might every day provide and procure a better match for his daughter, hee gives <hi>Pisani</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that as yet hee hath no intent to marry his daughter, alledging her few yeares, and the like triviall reasons and excuses, whereby <hi>Pisani</hi> might plainely perceive, that hee had no intent to give him his daughter.</p>
                     <p>This refusall of <hi>Vituri</hi> doth wonderfully grieve <hi>Pisani,</hi> and afflict <hi>Christeneta,</hi> so as they see their hopes nipt in their blossomes, and their desires not in the way to reap such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffects as they expected. <hi>Pisani</hi> distrusting his owne power, sets his parents and chiefest friends to draw <hi>Vituri</hi> to hearken unto reason: but his age cannot be deceived in that, which his judgement, and not his passion, suggesteth him: they have diverse confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, but every day, in stead of bringing hopes, produceth more difficulties and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spayre; and now that <hi>Pisani</hi> may see that his sure and research is displeasing to <hi>Vituri,</hi> he lookes not on him with so courteous an eye as accustomed: and which is worse, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steneta</hi> is forbidden his company, and he her fathers house.</p>

This goes to the hearts of our two lovers, but they brook it as patiently as they may, and hope that time will give end to these their discontents and afflictions. In the meane whiles, as fire suppressed doth often flame forth with more violence, so, sith they cannot personally visite one the other, they entertaine their affections by their Letters, who are so many in number, as I hold it fit rather to suppresse then divulge them. Thus whiles <hi>Pisani</hi> comforts himselfe, that there are no roses without prickles, and that hopes long expected are best welcome, but chiefely relying upon the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and constancie of his Mistresse: hee will not staine his valour with this poynt of cowardize, to be put off with the first repulse of <hi>Vituri,</hi> but resolveth to continue as constant in his affection, as he doth in his refusall; and so after he had stayed a month or two in <hi>Cremona,</hi> he bethinkes himselfe of an invention, whereby it is not impossible for him to obtaine his Mistresse of her father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pisani</hi> being inriched with the treasure of <hi>Christeneta's</hi> favour and affection, writes to her, that if shee can obtaine her Mothers consent, she peradventure may easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that of her husband; who hearkening and relishing this advice with much zeale, puts it a foote; and as in few dayes she gained her Mother, so a moneth was not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly past, before shee had likewise drawne her husband to approve and consent to this Match: So now our Lovers are againe revived and comforted; for the rubs being taken away, the difficulties removed, and the parents of both sides fully satisfyed, all things now seeme in so faire a forwardnesse and preparation, as if our two Lovers were shortly to injoy each other in marriage, or to injoy the fruits of mariage, which so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly and infinitely both affected and desired.</p>
                     <p>To which end, that their nuptials might bee solemnized with the greater pompe and glory, they provide themselves of variety of rich and sumptuous Apparell, the day is appoynted, and all the Nobility of <hi>Pavia</hi> and <hi>Cremona</hi> (as well their kinsfolkes as others) are invited to the Wedding: but their Parents shall come short of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, and these our two Lovers of their hopes: for this Mariage being not begunne in heaven, shall never be finished nor consummated in earth.</p>
                     <p>Wee have here so much spoken of <hi>Pisani,</hi> that it seemes wee have quite forgotten <hi>Gasparino,</hi> as if hee had no farther part to act in this History; but hee is not so fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: for this proceeding of <hi>Pisani</hi> to <hi>Christeneta</hi> is not so secretly managed, but hee hath newes thereof, who knowing there can bee no greater treason, after that of a subject to his Soveraigne, then for a friend to betray his friend, hee grieves, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely incensed at <hi>Pisani,</hi> to see he hath betrayed him of his Mistresse; the which he takes so bitterly and passionately, that hee vowes he will make him repent it. Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy and Revenge are alwayes bad Counsellers, and therefore can never prove good Iudges: But such is his love to <hi>Christeneta,</hi> and so deepely is her beauty imprinted and ingraven in his heart, as shutting his Judgement to Charity, and opening it to Revenge he is resolved, at what price soever, to call <hi>Pisani</hi> to a strict account for this affront and disgrace, and is resolved rather to dy, then live to see himself thus abused, by one whom God and nature hath made his inferior. Were we as apt to doe good as evill, we should bee Angels, not men; but resembling our selves (or rather hearkening too much to the Prince of darkenesse) we flye reason to follow rage, and many times procure our owne destruction, in seeking that of others.</p>

                     <p>Had <hi>Gasparino</hi> continued in this peaceable and Christian-like minde, hee had not exposed himselfe to so many dangers and misfortunes, nor given himselfe as a prey tó feede the malice and revenge of his bloody enemies: but now understanding that all <hi>Cremona</hi> and <hi>Pavia</hi> prattled and laughed at his disgrace, in seeing him thus baffled and abused by <hi>Pisani,</hi> hee thinkes that not onely himselfe, but his honour is dispara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and wronged herein, and that he shall be extreamely condemned of cowardize, if in a Duell he call not <hi>Pisani</hi> to right him, and give him satisfaction: yea, the onely consideration of this poynt of honour (which many times is bought and sold at so deare a price, as the perill and losse both of body and soule) did so violently perswade and prevaile with him, that as revenge admits of no opposition, nor hearkens to any advice, so enquiring for <hi>Pisani,</hi> and understanding him to be in <hi>Pavia,</hi> he the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and inflamed hereat, taking with him a resolute and confident Gentleman, and one onely Lackey, sets spurres to his Horse, and so hyes thither, resolving with himselfe to gaine his Honour in the same City, where hee had received his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
                     <p>Being arrived at <hi>Pavia,</hi> he is assured that <hi>Pisani</hi> is in the City, and inquiring more curiously after him, hee understands, that, that very instant hee is with his Mistresse <hi>Christenea,</hi> which so galled his thoughts, and inflamed his heart, as hee was once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved that very instant to send him a Challenge, and the sooner, because <hi>Christeneta</hi> might be an eye-witnesse of the delivery thereof: but to speake truth, Passion could not finde a better oportunity, nor Iudgement a worse, for him to draw his malicious contemplation into bloudy and impious action; and therefore respecting <hi>Christeneta,</hi> although shee had refused to respect him, and fearing if shee had the least notice or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Gasparino</hi> and <hi>Sebastiano</hi> are first in the Field: but <hi>Pisani</hi> and <hi>Sfondrato</hi> are not long after: so they all tye up their Horses to the hedge, pull off their Spurres, and cut away the timber-heeles of their Bootes, that they might not trip, but stand firme in their play: But ere they beginne, the Seconds search the Principalls, and they the Seconds; so they throw off their Dublets, and appeare all in their shirts, not as if they feared death, but rather as if they were resolved to make death feare them.</p>
                     <p>By this time <hi>Gasparino</hi> and <hi>Pisani</hi> draw: they make their approaches, and at the first incounter <hi>Pisani</hi> is hurt in the out-side of the left arme, and <hi>Gasparino</hi> in the right flanke, the bloud whereof appeared not, but fell into his hose: they againe separate themselves, and now trye their fortunes afresh; here <hi>Pisani</hi> receives two wounds, the one glancing on his ribs, the other in the brawne of his right arme, and <hi>Gasparin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Their Seconds withdraw not from their stations, neither can they yet imagine to whose side fortune will incline, they being well-neare as equall in wounds as courage; and now <hi>Pisani</hi> and <hi>Gasparino</hi> dressing their Rapiers, and wiping off the blood from them, beginne againe to make tryall on whom Victory is resolved to smile: but they alter the manner of the fight; for now <hi>Gasparino</hi> fights with judgement, and not with fury, and <hi>Pisani</hi> with fury, and not with judgement, whereas heretofore they both did the contrary. They traverse their grounds; <hi>Pisani</hi> is so violent, as hee hath almost put himselfe out of breath, but <hi>Gasparino</hi> is so wary and cautelous, as hee contents himselfe to breake his thrusts, and resolves not to make any but to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and upon manifest advantage; the issue answereth his hopes and expectation: for at the very next incounter, as <hi>Pisani</hi> runnes <hi>Gasparino</hi> in the necke, hee runnes <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sani</hi>

But <hi>Sfondrato</hi> and his Chirurgion runue to his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but the affection of the one, and the art of the other were in vaine: for <hi>Pisani</hi> his life had forsaken his body, and his soule was already fled from this world to another.</p>
                     <p>Whiles <hi>Sfondrato</hi> and the Chirurgion were stretching out the dead body of <hi>Pisani,</hi> and covering it up with their cloakes; <hi>Sebastiano</hi> runnes to <hi>Gasparino,</hi> and congratulates with him for his victory, extolling his valour to the skie: But <hi>Gasparino</hi> tells him, that these prayses appertaine not to him, but to a higher providence, and withall prayes him to bee carefull, and to mannage his life both with courage and discretion; and for himselfe, finding his wounds, no way desperate nor dangerous, hee is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to suffer his Chirurgion to bind them up, till hee see the issue of the Combate betwixt his faithfull friend <hi>Sebastiano</hi> and <hi>Sfondrato.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this time <hi>Sfondrato</hi> thinkes it high time to beginne: and being no way daunted with the misfortune and death of his friend <hi>Pisani,</hi> but rather encouraged and resolved to sell it dearely on the life of <hi>Sebastiano;</hi> hee drawes, and with his Rapier in his hand comes towards him. <hi>Sebastiano</hi> meetes him halfe way with a very fresh and cheerefull countenance, and so they approach one to the other: at their first incounter, <hi>Sebastia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> gives <hi>Sfrondrato</hi> a large and wide wound on his right side, but receives another from him thorow the left arme, a little above the elbow; but that of <hi>Sfondrato</hi> powred forth more bloud; and to be briefe, they both give and take divers wounds, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the parts of valorous Gentlemen.</p>
                     <p>But in the end, God, who would not give all the victory to one side, but will make both parties losers, to shew that he is displeased with these their bloudy actions, and uncharitable resolutions, which though Honour seeme to excuse, yet religion cannot; after they had three severall times taken breath, <hi>Sebastiano</hi> advancing a faire thrust to <hi>Sfondrato's</hi> brest, which onely pierced his shirt, and ravelled his skinne: <hi>Sfondrato</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited him with a mournefull interest, for hee ranne him thorow at the small of the belly, and so nayled him to the ground, bearing away his life on the point of his Rapier.</p>
                     <p>Thus our foure Combatants, being now reduced to the number of two, <hi>Sfondrato</hi> expected that <hi>Gasparino</hi> would have exchanged a thrust or two with him: the which certainely hee had performed: But <hi>Gasparino</hi> finding that the losse of so much bloud made him then weak, and that it was now more then time for him to have his wounds bound up, they having taken order for the decent transporting of their dead friends, that night to <hi>Pavia:</hi> they, without speaking word one to the other, committ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their Chirurgions, and so their wounds being bound up, they take them with them, and, to save themselves from the danger of the Law, they take horse, and poast away, <hi>Gasparino</hi> to <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Sfondrato</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> from whence they resolve not to stirre, before their friends have procured and sent them their pardons.</p>
                     <p>Leave we them there: and to follow the streame of this History, come we to <hi>Cremona</hi> and <hi>Pavia,</hi> which rings with the newes of the issues of these lamentable and tragicall combates; <hi>Pisani</hi> and <hi>Sebastiano</hi> are infinitely bewailed of their parents, and lamented of their friends, yea of their very enemies themselves, and generally of all the world, who either knew them, or heard of their untimely and unfortunate ends.</p>

                     <p>He is no sooner arrived, but the remembrance of <hi>Christeneta's</hi> beauty doth flourish and revive in his heart; for although she had loved another, yet he could affect none but her selfe: when letting passe some sixe or eight moneths, and hoping that time (which is subject to nothing, and all things to it) might wipe off her teares, and blow away her sighes for the death of <hi>Pisani;</hi> hee resolves to renew his old sute to her, to which end he visits her first by friends, next by letters, and then in person. <hi>Christeneta</hi> (like a counterfeit Fury) dissembles her love to <hi>Pisani,</hi> and her hatred to him, and withall triumpheth and takes a pride to see how discreetly and closely she beares her malice: But our wisedome in sinne proves meere folly in the eyes of God, which though she will not now acknowledge, yet she shall hereafter bee inforced to doe it with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and peradventure when it is too late. So being resolute in her inveterate indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, her malice doth so out-brave her charity, and her revenge her religion, as shee cannot finde any rest in her thoughts, or tranquillity in her minde, before she see the death of <hi>Gasparino</hi> make amends and satisfaction for that of <hi>Pisani.</hi>

                        <hi>Gasparino</hi> having the eyes of his judgement hood-winked, and not foreseeing how dangerous it is to repose and relye on the favour of an incensed enemy (as our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are never clearest when we approach our ruine) is very importunate with <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steneta,</hi> that he may meet and conferre privately with her, which indeed is the onely opportunity that in heart she hath so long desired: and now it is that she conspires his ruine, and plots his destruction, wherein (perchance) seeking his death, she may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her owne.</p>
                     <p>Dissembling Wretch as she is, she seemes to be vanquished with his importunity; and therefore to shew her selfe courteous and kinde to him, she appoynts him to meet her in the Nunnes Garden at sixe of the clocke in the morning.

                        <hi>Christeneta</hi> (who could not sleepe for revenge) is stirring in the morne betimes, and so is <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli.</hi> They all meet in the Nunnes Garden, she walking in the Alleyes, and they hiding themselves out of sight: At last the Clocke strikes sixe, and immediately in comes <hi>Gasparino,</hi> with his Hat in his hand, and his Rapier by his side; he courts and salutes <hi>Christeneta</hi> with many amorous speeches, and sweet Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; shee prepares to receive him: but in stead of curteous entertainment, gives him a bloudy welcome,: Her words (or rather her watch-word) are these: <hi>Gaspa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino</hi> (quoth shee) <hi>this Garden is the place where I had my first conference with</hi> Pisani, <hi>and where I purpose to have my last with you:</hi> At which words, <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli</hi> rush forth of a Bowre, and with many wounds kill him dead at their feet; but hee had first the leisure to draw, and for a while very valiantly defended himselfe, giving each of them severall wounds. <hi>Christeneta</hi> seeing <hi>Gasparino</hi> felld to the ground, fearing that he was not fully dead, and to prevent his crying, she runnes to him, thrusts her Handkercher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mouth, and to shew her selfe more like a Tygre then a Woman, and a Devill then a Christian, she with a small Ponyard, or Stilleto, stabs him many times thorow the body, and spurning him with her feet, utters this revengefull and bloudy speech: <hi>This I sacrifice to the memory of my deare Love Pisani.</hi> And so <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli</hi> take this murdered body of <hi>Gasparino,</hi> and tying a great stone to it, threw it into the Well of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Wee have here seene this horrible and cruell Murther committed and acted, and the Murtherers themselves by this time all fled, and gotten to their homes: Yea, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steneta</hi> gloryeth in her revenge, and <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli</hi> in their money; so as they now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>hinke themselves free, and past all danger: but they shall be deceived in their hopes; for Divine providence hath decreed otherwise. And here we come to the detection and punishment of this Murther; wherein Gods mercy and justice, his providence and his glory, doe most miraculously shine and appeare.</p>
                     <p>The Nunnes being in their Cells at their Oraisons, heare the flynking of swords, and so they advertise their Abbesse or Governesse thereof, who gives the Alarum in the house. They descend to the Garden, to see what this rumour might be: they finde the Posterne open, and the Alleyes very much sprinkled and gored with blood; they suspect Murther, but neither finde nor see any, either living or dead: they send to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Prefect and Provost of the City herewith, who repayre to the Garden, and (as before) finde much bloud, but see nobody: they make strict inquiry and search in the Ditches, hedges, thickets, and vaults of the Garden, but finde nothing, only they forget to search the Well: Then, to finde what those Fighters were, they thinke of a Policie, as worthy of them, as they of their office, they give a secret charge to all the ehirurgions of the city to reveale them, if any having new wounds, came that night, or the next morning to them, to be cured; whereupon <hi>Rhanuti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>,</hi> one of the chiefest Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, informes them, that he, about an houre since, had dressed <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli</hi> (two souldiers of the city) of nine severall wounds, which they newly received. The Prefect and Provost advertised hereof, cause them to bee brought before them, whom they found both together, where (no doubt) they had consulted. They enquire who woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them: They answer, they had a Quarrell betwixt themselves, and so they fought it out. Being demanded againe, where, and when they fought, they looked each on other, and knowing that <hi>Christeneta</hi> was safe at home, and <hi>Gasparino</hi> close in the well, they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16653:31"/>
instantly replyed, It was in the Nunnes Garden at <hi>Saint Clayre,</hi> and at sixe of the clock in the morning, which agreeing to the Nunnes relation, gave end to this businesse, for that time especially. But though they delude and blinde the eyes of men, yet they cannot, nor shall not those of God: And now, although these murtherers have thus escaped, yet they prepare to forfake and leave <hi>Pavia,</hi> for feare to be afterwards disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. But they shall be prevented in their subtleties, for the hand of God will spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily arrest them.</p>
                     <p>Now wee must observe, that <hi>Gasparino</hi> being found wanting two whole nights from his Lodging, and his Lackey gathering no newes of him at <hi>Vituri's</hi> house, where hee usually frequented to visite and court his Mistresse <hi>Christeneta,</hi> he informes the Host of the house hereof; and he like an honest man, doubting the worst (after the custome of <hi>Italy)</hi> acquainted the Prefect and Provost thereof, who, like judicious and wise Magistrates, examined <hi>Gasparino's</hi> Lackey when he last saw his Master, and where. The Lackey answeres, Hee parted from his Chamber yesterday morning betwixt five and sixe, with his Prayer-booke in his hand, as if hee were going to Church, but commanded him not to follow him; and since (hee saith) hee saw him not. And now, by the providence of God, the Lackeyes relation gives a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle glimpse and glimmering light to the discovery of this Murther: for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates see, that the houre of <hi>Gasparino's</hi> departure from his Chamber, and that of <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli's</hi> fighting doe agree, as also his Booke and the Nunnes Church beare some shew of coherence and probability.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon they (guided as it were by the very immediat finger of God) resolve and determine to apprehend, and forthwith to imprison both <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli,</hi> who the very next day had thought to have slipt downe the River to <hi>Ferara,</hi> and so to <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are examined concerning <hi>Gasparino:</hi> they vow he is a Gentleman they have neither knowne nor seene. The Magistrates hold it fit they should be put to the Rack; which is as speedily performed: but these stoute Villaines firmely and constantly maintaine their first speech; and although they make sute to be freed and released, yet the Prefect holds it necessary to continue them in prison; and withall, to make a more narrow and exacter search in the Nunnes Garden.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Christeneta,</hi> being at the first advertised that <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli</hi> were dead, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at astonished and amazed, and so resolves to flye, but being advertised they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready suffered torment, and revealed nothing, she againe resolves to stay, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed she doth: but it is the Iustice and mercy of God that keepes this bloudy bird within her nest.</p>
                     <p>The Prefect and Provost (as being inspired from heaven) continue constant in their resolutions, to make a second search in the Garden for Murther; which they doe, and very curiously, leaving no place unsearched: at last it pleased the Lord to put into the Provosts minde to search the Well, which the day before they had omitted. Hee acquaints the Prefect herewith, who with much alacrity approves hereof, and so causing it to be searched, they at last in their hookes bring up some pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of wrought blacke Taffeta: which by the Lackey was affirmed, and knowne to be the same his Master <hi>Gasparino,</hi> wore the last time he saw him: whereat they were more eagerly encouraged to search againe most exactly: which they doe, and at last bring up the dead body of <hi>Gasparino,</hi> when stripping off his cloths, they find his body pierced with thirteene severall wonuds: at the mournefull sight whereof, the whole assembly, but especially his Lackey, cannot refraine from teares, and yet all glorify God for finding of his body, as also for the discovery of the Murtherers, who now they confidently believe are <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli.</hi>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:16653:31"/>
But see the farther mercies of God: for <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli</hi> are but the hands which executed this Murther, and not the head which plotted it: therefore the Magistrates being sure of them, doe now resolve to hye to Prison, and to give them double tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thereby to discover out of what Quiver the first arrow of this Murther came. But behold the mercy and justice of God! they are eased of this labour, and the name of the malefactour brought them by a most miraculous and unheard of accident: for when the Magistrates and whole company had often visited <hi>Gaspari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no's</hi> naked body, and seene nothing but wounds, a little boy standing by (of some ten yeares of age) espyed a linnen cloth in his mouth, which hee shewed the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which the Prefect causing to be pulled out, found it to be a Cambricke Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and withall, a name in red silke Letters in one corner, which was the very true name of <hi>Christeneta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>See, see the goodnesse, O let us stand amazed and wonder at the mercies of God, to see what meanes and instruments hee ordayneth for the discovery of Murthers.</p>
                     <p>The Prefect and Provost send away speedily to apprehend her: shee is taken in the midst of her pleasures and pastimes, yea, from the arme of her Mother, and feete of her Father, to whom shee fled for safety, but in vaine; for shee is instantly committed close Prisoner, from whence wee shall not see her come foorth, till she come to her condigne punishment, on a shamefull Scaffold, for this her horrible offence of Murther.</p>
                     <p>And now the Prefect and Provost goe themselves to the prison, where <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli</hi> are: they accuse them peremptorily for the Murther of <hi>Gasparino,</hi> whose body, they informe them, they have taken up out of the Well: but they againe denye it. They give them double torment, and conjure them to reveale this their Murther; but they are so strong of courage, or rather the devill is so strong in them, as they denye all, and neither accuse themselves, nor any other.</p>
                     <p>The Prefect and Provost, although they saw all circumstances concurre, that undoubtedly <hi>Christeneta</hi> had a deepe hand in this Murther, yet they examine her faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and promise her much favour, and their best friendship and assistance, if shee will reveale it: but she, as her two confederates, denyes all. They adjudge her to the Racke, whereunto she very patiently permits her selfe to bee fastened; but her dainty body and delicate limbes cannot indure the cruelty of this torment: and so shee confesseth all, that in revenge of <hi>Pisani's</hi> death, shee had caused <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli</hi> to murther him in the Nunnes garden, as we have formerly understood.</p>
                     <p>And now comes Gods sentence from heaven, pronounced against these Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, by the mouth of his Magistrates on earth, who for reparation and expiation of their horrible crimes of Murther, committed on <hi>Gasparino,</hi> adjudge <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli</hi> to have their right handes cut off, then to bee hanged, and their bodies throwne into the River <hi>Po:</hi> And <hi>Christeneta</hi> (notwithstanding all the sollicitation which her father and friends made for her) to be first hanged, then burned, and her ashes throwne into the ayre: Which to the full satisfaction of Iustice, before an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Spectators (who assisted at their mournefull ends) was accordingly executed, who yet could not refraine from teares, but as much approved and applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Christeneta's</hi> affection to <hi>Pisani,</hi> as they detested and abhorred her inhumane and bloody revenge to <hi>Gasparino.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli,</hi> as they lived unrighteously, so they dyed desperately, and could not be drawn to repent themselves of this their bloudy fact: But as I have understood,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16653:32"/>
                        <hi>Christeneta</hi> was extreamely sorrowfull for her sinnes, but especially for this murther, whereof at her last breath shee infinitely and exceedingly repented her selfe: yea, I have beene informed, that shee delivered a godly and religious speech upon the Ladder, but I was not so fortunate to recover it. May all true Christians reade this History with profit, and profit in reading it, that so God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the glory: and their soules the eternall comfort and consolation.</p>

It is an excellent vertue in Maydens, not to listen to the lewd temptations of men; and in men, not to hearken to the sugered charmes of the devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for commonly that folly gives the one shame, and this madnesse brings the other destruction: but if we first forget our selves, and then our God, by adding and heaping sinne upon sinne, as first, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate fornication, and after Murther, then assuredly our estate is so miserably wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and so wretchedly miserable, as we have no hope left for better fortunes, nor place for worse. And because Example is both pleasing to our memory, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our judgement, this mournefull ensuing History shall make good, and confirme it to us: therefore let us shut the doore of our thoughts against the power of sinne, and that of our hearts against the malice of Hell: and wee shall not onely make our fortunes immoveable in this World, but our felicity eternall in that to come.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16653:33"/>
and came to womans estate, to marry her to some of his neighbours sonnes, and at his death, to give her all that litle which either his parents, or his owne labor and industry had left or procured him.</p>
                     <p>Two or three yeares sliding away, in which time <hi>Mollard</hi> increasing in wealth, and his Daughter in yeares, shee was, and was justly reported to bee the fairest Nymph of those parts, and by all the rusticke Swaynes tearmed, the faire <hi>Iosselina,</hi> esteeming themselves happy, if they might see her, much more, if they might injoy her presence.</p>
                     <p>Now within a little League of <hi>Mollards</hi> house, dwelt an ancient and wealthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, named <hi>Mounsieur de Coucie,</hi> who had many children: but among the rest, his eldest sonne, tearmed <hi>Mounsieur de Mortaigne,</hi> was a very hopefull and brave Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was first a Page to that generous Nobleman <hi>Mounsieur de la Guiche,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Governour of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and since his death a chiefe Gentleman to <hi>Mounsieur de Saint Ierrant,</hi> now a Marshall of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Mortaigne</hi> having lived some yeares in <hi>Paris</hi> with his Lord the Marshall, where hee followed all honourable exercises, as Riding, Fencing, Dancing, and the like (whereby hee purchased himselfe the honourable title of a most perfect and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished Gentleman) was at last desirous to see his father, partly, because he understood he was weake and sickely; but especially to bee at the Nuptialls of a sister of his, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Madamoyselle de la Hay,</hi> who was then to be married to a Gentleman of <hi>Avergne,</hi> tearmed <hi>Mounsieur de Cassalis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Marriage being solemnized, <hi>Mortaigne</hi> having conducted his sister into <hi>Avergne,</hi> and now seeing his father strong and lusty, hee beginnes to dislike the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and to wish himsefe againe in <hi>Paris,</hi> where the rattling of Coaches, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of faire Ladies did better delight and please him: hee craves leave of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother to returne, which (because hee is the chiefest stay and comfort of their age) they unwillingly grant him, and so he prepares for his returne to <hi>Paris.</hi> But an unlooked for accident shall stop his journey for the present, and another, but farre more fatall, seconding and succeeding that, shall stop and hinder him from ever see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                     <p>For the night before hee was to depart, the morning <hi>de Coucye</hi> his father is most dangerously taken with a burning Feaver, and so neither he nor his mother will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to depart. Living thus in the Countrey, and few Gentlemen dwelling neere his fathers house, hee gives himselfe to Hunting and Hawking, Pastimes and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, which though before he loved not, yet now he exceedingly delights in: Now amongst other times, hee one day hunting in his fathers Woods (hollowing for his Dog which hee had lost in a Thicket) by chance sprung a Pheasant, who flying to the next Woods, hee sends for his Hawke, with an intent to flye at him; and so being not so happy as againe to set sight of him, hee ranged so farre, and withall so fast, that he was very thirsty, but saw no house neere him, that hee might call for wine; till at last he happened on that of <hi>Andrew Mollard,</hi> of whom we have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made mention. <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> seeing a man walking in the next Vineyard, demanded if he were the man of the house, and prayed him to afford him a draught of Wine, alledging that he was very thirsty; <hi>Mollard</hi> knowing this young Gentleman by the Modell of his face, presumed to demand him if he were not one of <hi>Mounsieur de Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye's</hi> sonnes: Hee answered yes, and that his name was <hi>Mortaigne. Mollard</hi> presently calling to minde that he was his fathers heire, very courteously (in his fashion) prayes him to enter his house, and so beeing set downe, hee sends his daughter <hi>Iosselina</hi> for wine, which she fetched, and they both drinke: where honest <hi>Mollard</hi> thinking his house blessed with so great (and as he thought, so good) a Gentleman, very cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16653:33"/>
proffers him peares, Grapes, Walnuts, and such homely dainties as his poore cottage could affoord. But wee shall see <hi>Mortaigne</hi> requite this courtesie of <hi>Mollard,</hi> with an extreame ingratitude.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> whose eye was seldome on <hi>Mollard,</hi> and never from his daughter, admires to see so sweet a beauty in so obscure a place: he cannot refraine from blushing, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the delicacy of her pure complexion: for though she were poore in cloathes, yet hee saw her rich in beauty, which made not onely his eyes, but his heart conclude, that shee was wonderfull faire; sith it is ever the signe of a true and perfect beauty, where the face graceth the apparrell, and not the apparrell the face. And now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>Iosselina's</hi> taynt to that of the gallant Ladies of <hi>Paris,</hi> he finds that the truth of nature exceeds the falshood of their Art: for thorow the Alablaster of her Front, Necke and Pappes, hee might perceive the azure of her veines, which like the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of <hi>Meanders</hi> streames, swiftly range, and sweetly presents it selfe to his eye. And for her eies, or rather the Diamonds and Stars of her face, their splendor was so cleare, and their influence so piercing, as they not onely captivate his thoughts with love, but wound his heart with affection and admiration. But if <hi>Mortaigne</hi> gaze on the freshnesse and sweetnesse of <hi>Iosselina's</hi> beauty, no lesse doth she on the propernesse and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his youth, onely his eyes tilt at hers with more liberty, and hers on him with modesty, respect and secrecy: which <hi>Mortaigne</hi> well espying, hee vowes to obtaine her favour, or to lose his life in research thereof: but the end of such lascivious resolutions seldome prosper.</p>
                     <p>But see how all things favour <hi>Mortaignes</hi> affection, or rather his lust to <hi>Iosselina!</hi> for <hi>Mollard</hi> tells him, hee holds a small tenement neere adjoyning of his father, who hath now put him in sute of Law for two herriots, and therefore beseecheth him for his good word, and favour to his father in his behalfe. <hi>Mortaigne</hi> glad of this occasion to serve for a pretext and cloake for him, to have accesse to his house and daughter, promiseth him to deale effectually with his father for him, and the next time he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that way, to acquaint him what hee hath done therein: and so stealing a kisse or two from <hi>Iosselina,</hi> as her father went into the Court, and withall swearing to her, that hee loved her dearely, and would come often to see her; hee thanking <hi>Mollard</hi> for his good cheere, for that time departed.</p>
                     <p>But the further hee goes from <hi>Mollards</hi> house, the neerer his heart approcheth his daughter <hi>Iosselina.</hi> So his thoughts being stedfastly and continually fixed on her, hee beginnes to distaste his fathers house, yea, forsakes all company, and many times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to walke in the Parke and Woods, he steales away privately to see his new Mistresse. Hee visits her often, but especially when her father is at market, and gives her Gloves, Lawne, and silke girdles, yea hee never comes to her, but brings her some gift and present, thinking thereby the sooner to obtaine his desire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as yet hee is still deceived: for although shee bee humble and simple, yet she is chast, and will not hearken to his allurements and inticements.

                        <hi>Mortaigne</hi> hath now his desire of <hi>Iosselina;</hi> and for the fruit of this their unchast pleasure, in short time her belly swells: <hi>Mollard</hi> her father discovers the Pad in the straw: hee grieves hereat, teares his white hayres, and vowes, his daughters infamy will shorten his dayes: he torments her with reprochings and threatnings, so as shee can find no rest, or tranquility in his house: shee advertiseth <hi>Mortaigne</hi> hereof, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests his assistance, in this her affliction: <hi>Mortaigne</hi> by night steales her away, and sends her ten leagues off from <hi>Durency,</hi> placing her in a poore Kinsmans house of his, where shee is delivered of a young Sonne: But shee shall shortly see (with repentance) what it is to have a child e're a husband. In the meane time shee feedes her selfe with hope, that <hi>Mortaigne</hi> will shortly marry her, but hee resolves nothing lesse: for the Gallants of these times (who build their triumphs upon the shipwracke and ruines of maidens honour) will promise any thing, ere they enjoy their desire, but performe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when they have obtained it, but rather spurne at those pleasures, as at Nosegaies which they delight in the morne, and throw away ere night.</p>

                        <hi>Calintha, (Mortaigne's</hi> Mother) all this while knowes nothing of these occurrences betwixt her sonne and <hi>Iosselina,</hi> and desires to see him married, that shee might have the felicity to see her selfea Grandmother: to which end, she resolves to seeke a wife for him; and makes a motion to <hi>Monsieur de Vassy,</hi> the <hi>Seneshall</hi> of <hi>la Palisse,</hi> to match her sonne with <hi>Madamoyselle la Varina</hi> his onely daughter. <hi>De Vassy</hi> dislikes not this motion: the young folkes see and love: so as in all humane sence and outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it seemes a short time will finish and conclude this match: But it was otherwise determined in heaven.</p>
                     <p>This newes doth amaze and terrifie <hi>Iosselina:</hi> but as misfortune seldome comes alone, shee likewise that very instant understands that <hi>Mollard</hi> her father (for very griefe of her foule fact) is dead, and hath dis-inherited her, leaving her nothing but the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her shame, for her portion and dowry, and onely repentance to comfort her: And this indeed is the forerunnet of her future misery: Wherefote now if ever, it is for her to looke to her selfe and well fare, to which end shee resolves to write <hi>Mortaigne</hi> a Letter, to put him in minde of his promise, and to take compassion of her poverty, being already reduced to this misery, that shee hath not wherewithall to maintaine her selfe and child: her said Letter (word for word) I thought good to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert here, because the substance and perusall thereof deserves both pitty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.</p>

content; yea hee no more thinks of her, but with disdaine and envy: for the beauty <hi>Varina</hi> hath quite defaced and blotted out that of <hi>Iosselina,</hi> neither doth this cruelty of <hi>Mortaigne</hi> end in her, but it beginnes in the pretty babe his sonne: for he so farre degenerateth from the lawes and principles of Nature, as hee not onely hates the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the childes sake, but the child for his mothers sake: yea, hee is so farre from giving either of them maintenance, or both content, as hee scornes the Mother, and will no way either owne or relieve the child: and so burning his Letter, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the contents thereof, hee very ingratefully and cruelly resolves to answer it with silence, and this is the best comfort which <hi>Iosselina</hi> and the poore young babe her sonne receive from <hi>Mortaigne.</hi> But I feare the worst is to come.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Iosselina</hi> and her babe receive such dis-respect, and inhumanity from <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> it is to bee feared and doubted, that they will meet with little better from his Mother <hi>Calintha,</hi> who no sooner received and read her letter, but full of wrath and indignation, shee in disdaine throwes it away from her: yea, her discontent and malice is so infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med against <hi>Iosselina</hi> and her child, as fearing it may prove a blurre and blocke to <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne's</hi> marriage with <hi>Varina:</hi> shee not onely refuseth to relieve them, but is so cruell and inhumane, as shee wisheth them both in another World, as unworthy to live in this; but her choller is too passionate, and her passions too unaturall and cruell: for if shee would not relieve <hi>Iosselina</hi> whom her sonne <hi>Mortaigne</hi> had abused, yet in pitty, yea in nature, shee should have taken order for the maintenance of the child whom her sonne had begotten: for if the Mother had deserved her hatred, yet this poore babe was innocent thereof, and rather merited her compassion then her envy: or at least, if there had beene any sparke of humanity, grace, or good nature in her, if shee would not have beene seene courteous and harbarous to them her selfe; yet shee might dispence with her sonne, and winke if hee had performed it. But nothing lesse; for her malice is so great, and her rage so outragious and unreasonable, as shee refuseth it her selfe, and commands him to the contrary: so as being once resolute, not to cast away so much time to returne <hi>Iosselina</hi> an answer, shee at last in a humour, wherein disdaine triumphed over pitty, and inhumanity over charity, calls for pen and paper, and returnes her this bitter and cruell answer.</p>

                     <p>Alas, Alas! she hath now no power to speake, but to weepe: yea, if her teares are not words, I am sure her words are sighes; for being abandoned of <hi>Mortaigne;</hi> and hated of his mother, she is so pierced to the heart with the consideration of that cruelty, and the remembrance of this disdaine, as shee teares her hayre, repents her selfe of her former folly, and curseth the houre that <hi>Mortaigne</hi> first saw her fathers house, or shee him: but this is but one part of her sorrowes and afflictions. Lo, here comes another, that is capable to turne her discontent into despaire, her despaire into rage, and her rage into madnesse.</p>
                     <p>For by this time <hi>Calintha</hi> understanding by her sonne, where <hi>Iosselina</hi> resided and sojourned, she so ordered the matter, as when <hi>Iosselina</hi> least thought thereof, shee and her Babe in a darke and cold night is most inhumanely turned out of the house where she was; yea, with so great barbarisme and cruelty, as shee was not suffered to rest, either in the Hay-loft, Barne, or Stable, or any other place within doore; but infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to lye in the open field, where the bare ground was her bed, a Mole-hill her Pillow, the cold ayre her Coverlet, and the Firmament her Curtaines and Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie. And now it is, and never before, that her eyes gush foorth whole Rivers of teares, and her heart and brest sends foorth many volleyes of deepe-fetched sighes; yea, having no other Tapers but the Starres of heaven to light her, shee lookes on her poore Babe for comfort, whose sight, God knowes, doth but redouble her sorrowes and afflictions, because it lyes crying at her brest for want of Milke, which (poore woman) shee had not to give it; when, being in this miserable case, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with none but with the Beasts of the Field, and the Birds of the aire, who yet were farre happyer then her selfe, because they were gone to their rest, and shee could receive none, she after many bitter sighes, groanes, and teares, uttered these spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to her selfe.</p>
                     <p>Alas, alas, poore <hi>Iosselina!</hi> It is thy folly, and not thy fortune, that hath brought thee to this misery: for hadst thou had grace to use, and not to abuse thy beauty, thou mightst have seene thy selfe as happy, as now thou art wretched and miserable: but see what a double losse thou receivest for thy single pleasure, for the losse of thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity to <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> was that of thy father to thee: and now being deprived of both, what wilt thou doe, or whither canst thou flye for comfort? But alas, this is not all the misery; for as thy losse is double, so is thy griefe: for now thou must as well sorrow for thy child, as for thy selfe; yea <hi>Iosselina,</hi> forget to grieve for thy selfe, and remember to doe it for thy Babe, sith thou hast brought it into the world, and hast not wherewith to maintaine it. And then not able to proceed farther, she takes it up and kisses it, and raines teares on it's cheekes, though she cannot streame milk in its mouth, when againe recovering her speech, she continues thus:</p>
                     <p>Ay me, <hi>Iosselina,</hi> thou art both the Author and the cause of thine owne misery, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16653:36"/>
therefore thou must not blame heaven, but thanke thy selfe for it: for thy afflictions are so great, as wheresoever thou turnest thy thoughts or eyes, thou findest nothing but griefe, nothing but sorrow: for if thou think on <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> he lookes on thee with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, if on his mother <hi>Calintha,</hi> she with envie; yea, thou canst not behold the world without shame, thy poore infant without sorrow, nor thy selfe without repentance: nay, consider further with thy selfe, what thou hast gotten by casting (or rather by casting away) thy affection on <hi>Mortaigne:</hi> he found thee a Mayd, and hath left thee a strumpet; thou hast a child, and yet no husband: then thou wert so happy as to have a father, and now thy sonne is so miserable, as he can finde none: yea, then thou wert a friend to many, but now thou findest not one that will bee so to thee: and which is worse, thou hast not wherewithall to be so to thy selfe. Alas, alas, thou hast no house to goe to, no friend to trust to, no meat for thy selfe, nor milke for thy child: therefore poore <hi>Iosselina</hi> (quoth she) how happy should we both be, if thou wert bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he unborne.</p>
                     <p>She would have finished her speech, but that teares interrupted her words, and sighs cut her teares in pieces.</p>
                     <p>By this time her Babe falls asleepe, but her griefes are so great, and her sorrowes so infinite, as shee cannot close her eyes, nor yet bee so much beholding either to <hi>Morpheus</hi> or <hi>Death</hi> to doe it for her; which perceiving, as also that the Moone was inveloped in a cloud, and that the Starres beginne to denye her the comfort and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre of their sight, shee fearing to bee overtaken with raine, and perceiving a thicke Wood a pretty way off from her, she takes her Babe, and as fast as her weake and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed legs could performe (bitterly weeping and sighing) hies thither for shelter; but heaven prooves more kinde to her then earth: for loe, both the Moone and Starres assist and comfort her in this her sorrowfull journey. Being come to the Wood (which indeed was farther off then she thought) she beganne to bee weary, and there making a bed of leaves (which at that season of the yeare fell abundantly from the Trees) shee thereon for awhiles rested her selfe, but sleepe shee could not: and now if any thing in the world afforded her comfort, it was to see that her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant slept prettily, though not soundly: but here if her eyes craved rest, so her sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke craved meat: for it was now mid-night, and she had eaten nothing since noone: so pulling off her upper coate, shee wraps and covers her child as hot as shee could, who being fast asleepe, and laying it on the bed of leaves, shee goes from tree to hedge, and gathers Blacke-berries, Slowes, and wilde Chessnuts, wherewith in stead of better Viands, she satisfyed her hunger, and now she sees her selfe on the top of a Hill, at whose foote shee perceived a River, and a great stony Bridge over it, the which shee knew, as also that there was a little Village neere about a mile beyond it, which indeede in the midst of her miseries afforded her some comfort. So backe she hies to her childe, which she findes out by its crying, it wanting not onely his nipple but his Nurse, and so with many kisses takes it up in her armes, and hyes towards the bridge, and from thence to the Village, which she now remembers is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Villepont,</hi> where shee arrives at five of the clocke in the morning, and lodged her selfe in a very poore Inne, being extremely glad, and infinitely joyfull that she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered so good a harbour.</p>
                     <p>But money she hath none to pay her expences, and to lye in Innes upon credit, is to be ill attended, and worse look'd on: so she is inforced, yea, faine to sell away her Quaives, her bands, and her upper coate, to discharge her present occasions. Poore <hi>Iosselina,</hi> how happy hadst thou beene, if thou hadst had as much wit and chastity, as beauty, or rather more chastity, and lesse beauty! But it is now too late to remedy it, though never to repent it.</p>

                        <hi>Iosselina</hi> knowing <hi>Villepont</hi> to be but seven leagues from <hi>Durency</hi> (the Parish where she was borne) is irresolute whether to stay here, or to goe thither. Want of meanes perswades her to the first: but knowing that <hi>Mortaigne's</hi> love was turned to hatred, and that it was dangerous for her to bee neere his incensed mother, shee resolves to stay in <hi>Villepont,</hi> and to write to her kinsfolkes and friends to assi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>t her in this her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and necessity. In the meane time shee is inforced to content her selfe with a poore little out-chamber, where there is neither chimney nor window, but onely a small loope whereinto the Sunne scarce ever entred, and yet shee is extreamely well contented and glad hereof.</p>
                     <p>But wealth findes many friends, and poverty none: and yet, sith diversity of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes is the true touchstone of friendship, wee may therefore more properly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terme those our friends, who assist us in our necessity, and not who seeme to pleasure us in our prosperity: for those are reall friends, but these verball: those will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme more then they promise, and these promise much, and performe nothing.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Iosselina</hi> is so wretched and unfortunate, as shee findes neither the one nor the other to assist her in this her misery: yea so farre shee is to receive either meanes or promises; as nothing is sent her, nor none will see her; so as miserable necessity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth her to report and divulge the misfortune of her fortune, and to complain to all the world of <hi>Mortaigne's</hi> treachery, and of his Mother <hi>Calintha's</hi> cruelty; yea she threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to send him his sonne, sith he will not afford her wherewith to maintaine it.</p>
                     <p>This is not so secretly carryed in <hi>Villepont,</hi> but <hi>De Vassye</hi> and <hi>Varina</hi> his daughter have newes hereof in <hi>La Palisse,</hi> which occasioneth her to grow cold in her affection, and he in his respect to <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> so as all things decline, and there is little hope or appearance, that this match shall goe forward. <hi>Mortaigne</hi> is two cleere-sighted, to be blind herein, yea he presently knowes, from what point of the Compasse this wind commeth, and is fully possessed, that <hi>Iosselina</hi> is the cause of these alterations and stormes: hee is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly inraged and inflamed hereat, and gives such way to his passion and choller, as these obstacles must be removed, and he vowes to destroy both <hi>Iosselina and her sonne.</hi> A bloudy resolution, not beseeming either a Christian, or a Gentleman: for was it not enough for him to rob <hi>Iosselina</hi> of her honour, and to put a rape on her chastity and vertue, but hee must likewise bereave her of her life, and so adde Murther to his lust? Alas, what a base Gentleman is this? yea, how farre degenerates he from true Gentility, to bee so cruell to her that hath beene so kind to him? But the Devill suggesteth to his thoughts, and they to his heart, that <hi>Varina</hi> is faire, and that there is no way nor hope left to obtaine her, before <hi>Iosselina</hi> and her brat bee dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now if grace could not perswade him from being so cruell to <hi>Iosselina:</hi> (yet mee thinkes) nature should have with-held him from being so inhumane to his owne sonne: but his faith is so weake towards God, and the devill is so strong with him, that he cannot bee removed or withdrawne from his bloudy resolution, onely hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth the manner thereof: for whereas hee resolved first to destroy the Mother, then the child, now he will first dispatch the child, then the Mother. O Heavens, why should earth produce so bloudy and prodigious a monster!</p>
                     <p>Now the better to dissemble his malice, he thinkes to reclaime and pacifie <hi>Iosselina,</hi> and so gives order that shee and her child be lodged in a better Inne in the same village of <hi>Villepont,</hi> and signifies her that he hath gotten a Nurse, and hath provided mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for his sonne, and that shortly he will send his Lackey for him, but withall, that shee must keepe this very secret, because hee will not have his mother <hi>Calintha</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therwith. <hi>Iosselina</hi> rejoyceth, and seemes to be revived at this pleasing newes: yea, shee beginnes to forget her former misery, and flatters her selfe with this hope,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16653:37"/>
that fortune will againe smile on her. So within three dayes, <hi>Mortaigne</hi> sends his Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, <hi>La Verdure</hi> to her for the babe: the which with many kisses and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>eares shee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth him, hoping that <hi>Mortaigne</hi> his father would bee carefull of his maintenance, and not so much as once dreaming, or conceiving that he had any intent to murther it. But she shall find the contrary; for henceforth she shall never see her babe, nor her babe her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>La Verdure</hi> (the Lackey) following his Masters command, is not foure Leagues from <hi>Villepont,</hi> before, like a damnable miscreant, hee strangles it, and wrapping it in a Linnen cloth (which hee had purposely brought with him) throwes it into the River <hi>Lignon;</hi> but hee shall pay deare for Murthering of this sweete and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent babe.</p>
                     <p>But it is not enough: for <hi>Mortaigne's</hi> divellish malice and revenge will not be quenched or satisfied, till he see the Mother follow the fortune of the sonne: to which end he agrees with her Oast <hi>La Palma,</hi> and his aforesaid Lackey <hi>La Verdure,</hi> to stifle her in her bed. The which, for two hundred frankes they performe, and bury her in his garden, shee being soundly sleeping, and poore soule, not so much as once dreaming of this her mournefull and lamentable end. What Tigers or monsters of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are these; to commit so damnable a Murther, as if there were no God in heaven to detect them, nor earth nor hell to punish them?</p>
                     <p>But we shall see the contrary: yea, we shall see both the Murther, and the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers revealed and discovered by an extraordinary meanes; wherin Gods providence and glory will most miraculously resplend and shine.</p>
                     <p>As soone as <hi>La Verdure</hi> and <hi>La Palma</hi> had Murthered our harmelesse <hi>Iosselina,</hi> they both poast away to <hi>Durency,</hi> aswell to acquaint <hi>Mortaigne</hi> herewith, as also to receive their money (whereof the one halfe was payed them, and the other due.) This newes is so pleasing to him, as he cheerefully layes downe his promise: and so they both frol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like it in the village, <hi>La Verdure</hi> making no hast home to his Master <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> not <hi>La Palma</hi> to his old wife <hi>Isabella.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the meane time (a month being past away) <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> hoping the way cleare, and al the rubs removed, that hindred him from obtaining his faire mistres <hi>Varina;</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures his father <hi>De Coucye,</hi> and other of his friends to ride to <hi>La Palisse:</hi> hoping to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the match betwixt <hi>La Varina</hi> and himselfe: But hee and they are inforced to see themselves deceived of their hopes. For <hi>De Vassy</hi> and his daughter having heard that <hi>Iosselina</hi> and her sonne were conveyed away, and could no more be heard of, they (sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting, and fearing that which indeed was falne out) in plaine tearmes, give <hi>Mortaigne</hi> the refusall, who galled to the heart herewith, doth now hang downe his head, and see his former bloudy errours and crimes; but it is two late, for the Lord hath bent his bow, and his Arrow is ready to Revenge them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>La Palma</hi> understanding of <hi>Mortaigne's</hi> arrivall from <hi>La Palisse,</hi> thinkes it high time for him to leave <hi>Durency,</hi> and to returne home to <hi>Villepont</hi> to his wife <hi>Isabella,</hi> who being an old woman, and hee a young man; was not onely impatient, but jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his long stay (which was well neere five weekes) and the rather for that hee departed, as shee thought, in company of <hi>Iosselina:</hi> who because shee was young and faire, shee vehemently suspected, hee had since entertained and stayed with But this jealousie of hers, God makes his instrument to discover this execrable Murther.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>La Palma</hi> comming home, his wife <hi>Isabella</hi> (as we have heard) being incensed with anger, and inflamed with jealousie, gives him this bitter entertainement and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: <hi>La Palma</hi> (quoth shee) <hi>you were very unkind, so soone to forsake your Whore</hi> Iosseli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. <hi>La Palma</hi> being pierced to the quicke with this bitter speech of his wife, like
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16653:37"/>
a lewde fellow, gave her first the lye, and then termed her whore in speaking it. She hath fire in her lookes, and hee thunder in his speeches. So after many bitter and scandalous injuries banded one to the other, shee addes rage to her words, and hee a boxe on the eare to his choller, where with he fell'd her as dead to the ground; yea, the servants, and all that beheld it, crye out amaine, as if her soule had already taken her last farewell of her body. At this tumult the neighbours assemble, and deeming <hi>Isabella</hi> dead, they lay hands on <hi>La Palma</hi> her husband, and carry him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Procurer, <hi>Fiscall</hi> of <hi>La Palisse,</hi> who was then in their Village of <hi>Villepont,</hi> who without further examination commits him to prison, and so goes in person to visit <hi>Isabella,</hi> who by this time is a little recovered, but not freed from the danger of death: She relates him all that had past betwixt her husband and her selfe: as also of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture with <hi>Iosselina,</hi> and of his long stay in <hi>Durency;</hi> adding withall, that he hath heretofore many times beaten her, and now she hopes, that this blow will not goe unpunished: yea, her rage, or rather Gods providence carries her so fatre, as she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly averres to the Magistrate, that if <hi>Iosselina</hi> be not her husbands strumpet, shee constantly beleeves hee is her Murtherer: and to conclude, saith, that her servant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayd <hi>Iaqueta</hi> can say more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iaqueta</hi> examined, saith, that the night before her Masters departure for <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi> hee was at mid-night in <hi>Iosselina's</hi> Chamber, together with one <hi>La Verdure</hi> a Lackey, and that since <hi>Iosselina</hi> was neither seene nor heard of; and being farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded if she knew whose Lackey <hi>La Verdure</hi> was, shee answered, he was <hi>Mounsieur Mortaignes</hi> Lackey, who was sonne to <hi>Mounsieur de Coucy.</hi> The Procurer <hi>Fiscall,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidering their severall depositions, doth shrewdly suspect there is more in the winde then is yet discovered: he leaves <hi>Isabella,</hi> and goes to her husband in prison, and after hee had sharpely checked him for beating his wife, he inquires and chargeth him with these two poynts; First, why hee and <hi>La Verdure</hi> were in <hi>Iosselina's</hi> Chamber at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night? and secondly, what was become of her, sith since that time shee hath neither beene seene nor heard of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>La Palma</hi> is terrifyed and amazed with these demands (and farre the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he least expected them) the which apparently appeared in the alteration of his colour and complexion, which commonly bewrayes an inward perturbation of the mind and heart. He answereth not punctually to those poynts demanded of him: but runnes on with many bitter invectives against the rage and jealousy of his wife: and then being by the Procurer bid answer to those two poynts hee formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him: hee, after many frivolous and extravagant speeches, denyes that either hee or <hi>La Verdure</hi> were in <hi>Iosselina's</hi> Chamber, and that hee neither saw her departure, nor knew what was become of her, and withall prayes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eurer <hi>Fiscall</hi> to free and release him of his imprisonment: but he shall not escape at so cheape a rate.</p>
                     <p>For the Procurer, being very familiar with <hi>Mounsieur de Vassye</hi> his Colleague and fellow-Iudge of <hi>La Palisse,</hi> remembred that hee had formerly heard him speake of this <hi>Mounsieur Mortaigne,</hi> who lately sought his daughter <hi>La Varina</hi> in marriage; as also of his entertaining and rejecting this <hi>Iosselina,</hi> a Farmers daughter of <hi>Durency,</hi> by whom he had a base sonne: and now considering that at such an unseasonable houre his Lackey <hi>La Verdure</hi> should be in her Chamber in <hi>La Palma's</hi> house, and <hi>La Palma</hi> himselfe in his company, and shee never since seene or heard of, hee thinkes there is some fire hid and covered in these embers, and that there is some deeper mystery in this businesse, which as yet was not revealed.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, like a wise Magistrate, he holds it fit, the same night to send <hi>La Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> privately to <hi>La Palisse,</hi> as also his wife <hi>Isabella</hi> and <hi>Iaqueta</hi> for witnesses, and rides
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16653:38"/>
thither himselfe, to sit upon his processe, with whom the Lievtennant of that juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction joyned; but for <hi>Mounsieur de Vassye</hi> the Seneschall, hee (for the regard hee bore to <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> because hee vehemently suspected he had a deepe and chiefe hand in this businesse) would not bee present, but purposely absented himselfe at a house of his in the Countrey: the next morne <hi>La Palma</hi> is examined, as also the two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and <hi>Iaqueta</hi> is confronted with him, who stands firme to her former disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But hee slatly denyes all. The Procurer and the Lievtennant adjudge him to the Racke. Hee indureth the first torment, but at the second confesseth that he and <hi>La Verdure</hi> had stifled, and murthered <hi>Iosselina</hi> in her bed, in his owne house, and had buried her in his Garden, and that they were set a worke and hyred to doe it by <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Mortaigne,</hi> who gave them two hundred Frankes to effect it.</p>
                     <p>Loe here by the mercy and providence of God, <hi>La Palma's</hi> malice to his wife <hi>Isabella,</hi> and her jealousy to him, hath discovered and brought to light this cruell and bloudy Murther, which was so secretly contrived and so cunningly and devillish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acted upon the body of <hi>Iosselina:</hi> But hers being discovered, let us likewise see how that of her harmelesse and innocent Babe is likewise brought to light. The two Iudges themselves ride all night to <hi>Villepont,</hi> they search the Garden, and find the dead body of <hi>Iosselina,</hi> having no other Winding-sheet but her owne smocke. They send away the Provost to apprehend <hi>Mortaigne</hi> and his Lackey for this Murther, who meets <hi>La Verdure</hi> by the way, and seizes <hi>Mortaigne</hi> in his bed.</p>
                     <p>They are severally brought to <hi>La Palisse,</hi> and first <hi>La Verdure</hi> is confronted with <hi>La Palma,</hi> who denyes all: but they present his feet to the fire, and then he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not onely the Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ther of <hi>Iosselina,</hi> but likewise that of her infant sonne, whom hee first strangled, and then threw into the River <hi>Lignon:</hi> and this, said he, he did at the request of his Master <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> of whom for his part and labour, he received one hundred Frankes.</p>
                     <p>Wee have here found two of these Murtherers: and now what resteth there, but that the third, who is the Authour, and as it were the capitall great wheele of these bloody Tragedies, bee produced and brought to this Arraignement? The Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and Lievtennant repaire againe to the Prison, and charge <hi>Mortaigne</hi> with these two bloody Murthers: hee knowes it is in vaine to denye it, sith hee is sure his two exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable agents have already revealed it: therefore he ashamed at the remembrance of his cruell and unnatural crimes, doth with many teares very sorrowfully and penitent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confesse all.</p>
                     <p>It is a happinesse for him to repent these Murthers; but it had beene a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if hee had never contrived and committed them: yea, the Iudges are amazed to heare the cruelty hereof, and the people to know it, and both send their prayses and thankefulnesse to God, that hee hath thus detected and brought them to light on earth.</p>
                     <p>And now comes the Catastrophe of their owne Tragedies, wherein every one of these Malefactors receives condigne punishment for their severall offences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>La Palma</hi> is condemned to bee hanged and burnt: <hi>La Verdure</hi> to bee broken on the Wheele, and his body to bee throwne into the River <hi>Lignon:</hi> and <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> though the last in ranke, yet the first in offence, to be broken on the Wheele, his body burnt, and his ashes throwne into the aire: which Sentence, in the sight of a great multitude of Spectators, was on a Market day accordingly executed and performed in <hi>La Palisse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this was the bloody end of <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> and his two hellish instruments, for murthering innocent <hi>Iosselina,</hi> and her silly and tender infant: May all Maydens learne by her example to preserve their chastities: and men, by <hi>La Verdures</hi> and <hi>La Palma's,</hi>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:16653:38"/>
not to be drawne to shed innocent blood for the lucre of wealth and money; and by <hi>Mortaignes,</hi> to bee lesse lascivious, inhumane, and bloody: thereby to prevent so exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable a life, and so infamous a death.</p>
                     <p>One thing I may not omit: <hi>La Palma</hi> on the Ladder extreamely cursed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his wife <hi>Isabella,</hi> who (he said) was the author of his death: and no lesse did <hi>La Verdure</hi> on the Wheele by his Master <hi>Mortaigne;</hi> but both of them were so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately irreligious, as neither of them considered that it was their former sinnes, and the malice of the Devill, to whom they gave too much eare, that was the cause thereof.</p>
                     <p>And for <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> after he had informed the world, that hee extreamely grieved, that his Iudges had not given him the death of a Gentleman, which was to haue beene beheaded, he with many teares bewayled his infinite ingratitude, cruelty, and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalnesse, both towards <hi>Iosselina,</hi> as also his and her young sonne: yet he prayed the world in generall to pray that God would forgive it him; and likewise requested the Executioner to dispatch him quickely out of this life; because hee confessed hee was unworthy to live longer.</p>
                     <p>Now let us glorifie our Creatour and Redeemer, who continually makes a strict inquisition for blood, and a curious and miraculous inquiry for Murther: yea, let us both feare him with love, and love him with feare, sith hee is as impartiall in his justice, as in distributing his mercies.</p>

In the actions of <hi>Alarache</hi> and <hi>Mamora,</hi> he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many noble proofes and testimonies of his valour and prowesse, the which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and made good by the receit of eleven severall wounds, which as markes and Trophees of Honour made him famous in <hi>Castile.</hi> Boyling thus in the heate of his youthfull bloud, and contemplating often on the death of his father, he resolves to goe to <hi>Validolyd,</hi> and to imply some Grando either to the King or to the Duke of <hi>Ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> his great favorite, to procure him a Captaines place, and a company under the Arch-Duke <hi>Albertus,</hi> who at that time made bloudy warres against the Netherlanders, thereby to draw them to obedience: But as hee beganne this sute, a generall truce of both sides laid aside Armes, which (by the mediation of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France)</hi> was shortly followed by a peace, as a Mother by the daughter: Which was concluded at the <hi>Hage</hi> by his Excellency of <hi>Nassaw</hi> and <hi>Marquis Spinola,</hi> being chiefe Commissioners of either party. <hi>Alsemero</hi> seeing his hopes frustrated, that the keyes of peace had now shut up the Temple of Warre, and that Muskets, Pikes, and corslets, that were wont to grace the fields, where now rusting by the walls, he is irresolute what course to take, resembling those fishes who delight to live in cataracts and troubled waters, but die in those that are still and quiet: For hee spurnes at the pleasures of the Court, and refuseth to haunt and frequent the companies of Ladies: And so not affecting, but rather disdaining the pompe, bravery and vanity of Courtiers, hee withdrawes himselfe from <hi>Validolyd</hi> to <hi>Valentia,</hi> with a noble and generous intent to seeke warres abroad, sith hee could find none at home, where being arived, although hee were often invited into the companies of the most noble and honorable Ladies both of the City and Country: Yet his thoughts ranne still on the warres, in which Heroike and illustrious profession, he conceived his chiefest delight and felicity: and so taking order for his lands and affaires, he resolves to see <hi>Malta</hi> that inexpugnable Rampier of <hi>Mars,</hi> the glory of Christendome, and the terrour of Turky, to see if hee could gaine any place of command and honour either in that Iland, or in their Gallies; or if not, he would from thence into <hi>Transilvania, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> to inrich his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and experience, by remarking the strength of their Castles and Cities, their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and discipline in warre, the Potency of their Princes, the nature of their Lawes and customes, and all other matters worthy the observation both of a Travellour and a Souldier: and so building many castles in the ayre, he comes to <hi>Alicant,</hi> hoping to find passage there for <hi>Naples,</hi> and from thence to ship himselfe upon the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Gallies for <hi>Malta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is nothing so vaine as our thoughts, nor so uncertaine as our hopes: for commonly they deceive us, or rather wee our selves in relying on them, not that God is any way unjust: (for to thinke so, were impiety) but that our hopes take false ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and have no true foundation, and to imagine the contrary, were folly: the which <hi>Alsemero</hi> finds true: for here the winde doth oppose him, his thoughts fight and vanquish themselves, yea the providence of God doth crosse him in his intended purposes, and gives way to that hee least intendeth.</p>
                     <p>For comming one morning to our Ladies Church at <hi>Masse,</hi> and being on his knees in his devotion, he espies a young Gentlewoman likewise on hers next to him who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16653:40"/>
being young, tender and faire, hee thorow her thinne vaile discovered all the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a delicate and sweet beauty, shee espies him feasting on the dainties of her pure and fresh cheekes; and tilting with the invisible lances of his eyes, to hers, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly ravished and vanquished with the pleasing object of this Angelicall counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and now hee can no more resist either the power or passion of love.</p>
                     <p>This Gentlewoman (whose name as yet wee know not) is young and faire, and cannot refraine from blushing, and admiring to see him admire and blush at her. <hi>Alsemero</hi> dies in conceit with impatiency, that hee cannot enjoy the happinesse and meanes to speake with her, but hee sees it in vaine to attempt it, because shee is ingaged in the company of many Ladies, and hee of many Cavaliers: But Masse being ended, hee enquires of a good fellow Priest, who walked by, what shee was and whether she frequented that Church, and at what houre. The Priest informes him, that shee is <hi>Don Diego de Vermandero's</hi> daughter: hee beeing Captaine of the Castle of that Citie, that her name was <hi>Dona Beatrice-Ioana,</hi> and that shee is every morning in that Church and Place, and neere about the same houre.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alsemero</hi> hath the sweetnesse of her beauty so deepely ingraven in his thoughts, and imprinted in his heart, that hee vowes <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> is his Mistresse, and hee her servant: yea, here his warlike resolutions have end, and strike sayle. And now hee leaves <hi>Bellona</hi> to adore <hi>Venus,</hi> and forsakes <hi>Mars,</hi> to follow <hi>Cupid:</hi> yea, so fervent is his flame, and so violent is his passion, as hee can neither give nor take truce of his thoughts, till hee bee againe made happy with her sight, and blessed with her presence.</p>
                     <p>The next morne (as Lovers love not much rest) <hi>Alsemero</hi> is stirring very timely, and hoping to find his Mistresse: no other Church will please him but our Ladies, nor place, but where hee first and last saw her: but shee is more zealous then himselfe; For shee is first in the Church, and on her knees to her devotion, whom <hi>Alsemero</hi> gladly espying, hee kneeles next to her: and having hardly the patience to let passe one poore quarter of an houre (hee resolving as yet to conceale his name) like a fond Lover, whose greatest glory is in complements and Courting his Mistresse, hee boards her thus:</p>
                     <p>Faire Lady, it seemes, that these two mornings my devotions have beene more powerfull and acceptable then heeretofore; sith I have had the felicitie to bee placed next so faire and so sweet a Nymph as your selfe, whose excellent beauty hath so sodainely captivated mine eyes, and so secretly ravished my heart, that hee which heretofore rejected, cannot now resist the power of love; and therefore having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my devotion I beseech you excuse mee, if I begin to pray you to take pittie of mee: sith my flame is so fervent, and my affection is so passionate, as either I must live yours, or not dye mine owne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> could not refraine from blushing under her vaile, to see an unknowne Cavalier board her in these tearmes in the Church: and as shee gave attentive eare to his speech, so shee could not for a while refraine from glancing her eye upon the sprucenesse of his person, and the sumptuousnesse of his apparell: but at last, accusing her owne silence, because shee would give him no cause to condemne it, shee with a modest grace, and a gracefull modesty, returnes him this answer:</p>
                     <p>Sir, as your devotions can neither bee pleasing to God, nor profitable to your soule, if in this place you account it a felicity to enjoy the sight of so meane a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as my selfe, so I cannot repute it to affection but flattery, that this poore beauty of mine (which you unjustly paint forth in rich prayses) should have power either to captivate the eyes, or which is more, to ravish the heart of so noble a Cavalier as your selfe. Such victories are reserved for those Ladies, who are as much your equall, as I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16653:41"/>
your inferiour: and therefore directing your zeale to them, if they find your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction such as you professe to mee, no doubt but regarding your many vertues and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, they will in honour grant you that favour which I in modesty am constrained to deny you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alsemero</hi> (though a novice in the art of Love) was not so ignorant and cowardly to bee put off with her first repulse and refusall, but rather seeing that the perfections of her minde corresponded with those of her beauty, hee resolves now to make triall of his wit and tongue, as heretofore hee had done of his courage and sword: and so joynes with her thus:</p>
                     <p>It is a pretty Ambition in you, sweet Lady, to disparage your beauty, that thereby it may seeme the fairer; as the Sunne, who appeares brighter by reason of the nights obscurity: and all things are best, and more perfectly discerned by their contraries: but I cannot commend, and therefore not excuse your policy, or rather your disrespect, to slight and poast me over from your selfe, whom I love, to those Ladies I neither know nor desire, which in effect is to give mee a cloud for <hi>Iuno.</hi> No, no, it is onely to you and to no other that I present and dedicate my service: and therefore it will be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude as unworthy my receiving, as your giving, that I should be the object of your discourtesie: sith you are that of my affection.</p>
                     <p>To these speeches of <hi>Alsemero, Beatrice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ioana</hi> returnes this reply:</p>
                     <p>It is not for poore Gentlewomen of my ranke and complexion, either to bee am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, or politike, except it bee to keepe themselves from the snares of such Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers as your selfe, who (for the most part) under colour of affection, ayme to erect the trophees of your desires upon the tombs of our dishonours: onely I so much hate ingratitude, as you being to mee a stranger, charity and common courtesie commands me to thanke you for the proffer of your service: the which I can no other way either deserve or requite, except in my devotions and prayers to God, for your glory and prosperity on earth.</p>
                     <p>As shee had ended this her speech, the Priest ends his Masse; when <hi>Alsemero</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, advanced to lift her up from kneeling, and so with his hat in his hand, (sequestring her from the crowd of people, who now began to depart the Church) he speaks to her to this effect:</p>
                     <p>Faire Ladie, as I know you to bee the Ladie <hi>Beatrice-Ioana,</hi> daughter to the noble Knight <hi>Don Diego de Vermanderos,</hi> Captaine of the Castle of this Citie: so I being a stranger to you, I admire that you offer so voluntary an injurie to your judgement and my intents, as to pervert my affection and speeches to a contrary sense: but my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie hath this consolation, that my heart is pledge for my tongue, and my deeds shall make my wordes reall. In the meane time, sith you will give mee no place in your heart, I beseech you lend me one in your Coach, and be at least so courteous, as to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me, in accepting my company to conduct you home to your fathers Castle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beatrice-Ioana,</hi> calling to minde the freenesse of her speeches, and the sharpnesse of his answer, not blushing for joy, but now looking pale for sorrow, repents her selfe of her errour, the which shee salves up the best she could in this Reply:</p>
                     <p>Noble Sir, when I am acquainted as well with your heart as with your speeches, I shall then not onely repent, but recant mine errour, in judging your selfe by others; in the meane time, if I haue any way wronged your merits and vertues, to give you some part of satisfaction, if you please to grace mee with your company to the Castle, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not the custome of <hi>Alicant)</hi> I doe most kindly and thankfully accept ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: when <hi>Alsemero</hi> giving her many thankes, and kissing his hand, hee takes her by the arme, and so conducts her from the Church to her Coach.</p>
                     <p>It is both a griefe and a scandall to any true Christians heart, that the Church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16653:41"/>
for thankes giving and prayer unto God, should bee made a Stewes, or at least, a place for men to meet and court Ladies: but in all parts of the Christian world, where the Romane religion reigneth, this sinfull custome is frequently practised, especially in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> where, for the most part, men love their Curtizans bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then their God: and it were a happinesse for <hi>France,</hi> if her popish Churches were freed of thisabomination, and her people of this impiety. But againe to our History.</p>
                     <p>Wee will purposely omit the conference which <hi>Alsemero</hi> and <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> had in the Coach, and allow them by this time arrived to the Castle: where first her selfe, then the Captaine her father, thanke him for his honour and courtesie: in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall whereof, hee shewed him the rarities and strength of his Castle, and after some speeches and complements betweene them, hee was so happy as to kisse <hi>Beatrice-Ioana,</hi> but had not the felicity to entertaine her: and so he departs, his Lackey attending him with his Gennet to the counter-scarfe. So home hee rides to his lodging, where, whiles the winde holds contrary, wee will a little leave him to his thoughts, and they to resolve in what sort hee might contrive his sute for the obtayning of his new and faire Mistresse <hi>Beatrice Ioana,</hi> and likewise her selfe, to muse upon the speeches and extraordinarie courtesie, which this unknowne Cavallier afforded her, and begin to speake of <hi>Don Alonso P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>racquo,</hi> a rich Cavallier of the Citie, who unknowne to <hi>Alseme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> was his rivall and competitor, in likewise seeking and courting <hi>Boatrice-Ioana</hi> for his Mistresse and wife.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Piracquo</hi> being rich both in lands and money, and descended of one of the chiefest and noblest Families of <hi>Alicant,</hi> by Profession a Courtier, and indeed (to give him his due) a Cavallier indued with many brave qualities and perfections, was so highly beloved, respected and esteemed in that Citie, as the very fayrest and noblest young Ladies were, with much respect and affection, proffered him in marriage by their parents: but there was none either so precious or pleasing to his eye, as was our <hi>Beatrice Ioana,</hi> whom hee observed for beauty to excell others, and for Majestie and grace to surpasse her selfe, and indeed hee could not refraine from loving her, nor bee perswaded or drawne to affect any other: so as hee setled his resolution either to have her to his wife, or not to bee the husband of any. Yea, hee is so earnest in his sute, as scarce any one day passeth, but hee is at the Castle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vermandero</hi> thinkes himselfe much honoured of him, in seeking his daughter, yea, hee receives him lovingly, and entertaines him courteously; as knowing it greatly for her preferment, and advancement: and so gives <hi>Piracquo</hi> many testimonies of his favour, and many hopes that hee shall prevaile and obtaine his Mistresse. But <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice-Ioana</hi> stands not so affected to him, rather shee receives him coldly; and when hee begins his sute to her, shee turnes the deafe eare, and never answereth him, but in generall tearmes: onely not peremptorily to disobey her parents, shee seemes to bee pleased with his company, and yet secretly in her heart wisheth him farther from her.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Piracquo</hi> flattering himselfe in his hope, and as much doating on <hi>Beatrice-Ioana's</hi> beauty, as hee relyes on her fathers constant affection to him, hee is so farre from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving over his sute to her, as hee continueth it with more earnestnesse and importunity, and vowes that hee will forsake his life ere his Mistresse: but sometimes wee speake true, when wee thinke wee jest: yet hee findes her one and the same: for although shee were not yet acquainted with <hi>Alsemero,</hi> yet shee made it the thirteenth Article of her Creed, that the supreame power had ordained her another husband, and not <hi>Pirac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo:</hi> yea, at that very instant the remembrance of <hi>Alsemero</hi> quite defaced that of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racquo,</hi> so that shee wholly refus'd her heart to the last, of purpose to reserve and give it to the first: as the sequell will shew.</p>

                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:16653:42"/>
Now by this time <hi>Vermandero</hi> had notice, and was secretly informed of <hi>Alsemero's</hi> affection to his daughter, and withall, that shee liked him farre better then <hi>Piracquo:</hi> which newes was indeed very distastefull and displeasing to him, because hee perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew that <hi>Piracquo's</hi> meanes farre exceed that of <hi>Alsemero.</hi> Whereupon consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hee had given his consent, and in a manner ingaged his promise to <hi>Piracquo:</hi> hee, to prevent the hopes, and to frustrate the attempts of <hi>Alsemero,</hi> leaves his Castle to the command of <hi>Don Hugo de Valmarino</hi> his son, and taking his daughter <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> with him, hee in his Coach very sodainely and secretly goes to <hi>Briamata:</hi> a faire house of his, tenne leagues from <hi>Alicant:</hi> where hee meanes to sojourne, untill hee had concluded and solemnized the match betwixt them: But hee shall never bee so happy, as to see it effected.</p>
                     <p>At the newes of <hi>Beatrice-Ioana's</hi> departure, <hi>Alsemero</hi> is extreamely perplexed and sorrowfull, knowing not whether it proceed from her selfe, her father, or both; yea, this his griefe is augmented, when hee thinkes on the suddennesse thereof, which hee feares may bee performed for his respect and consideration: the small acquaintance and familiari y hee hath had with her, makes that hee cannot condemne her of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse: yet sith hee was not thought worthy to have notice of her departure, hee againe hath no reason to hope, much lesse to assure himselfe of her affection towards him: hee knowes not how to resolve these doubts, nor what to thinke or doe in a matter of this nature and importance: for thus hee reasoneth with himselfe; if hee ride to <hi>Briamata,</hi> he may perchance offend the father; if he stay at <hi>Alicant,</hi> displease the daughter: and although he be rather willing to run the hazzard of his envy, then of her affection, yet hee holds it safer to bee authorised by her pleasure, and to steere his course by the compasse of her commands: Hee therefore bethinkes himselfe of a meanes to avoyd these extreames, and so findes out a Channell to passe free betwixt that <hi>Sylla</hi> and this <hi>Carybdis;</hi> which is, to visit her by letters: hee sees more reason to embrace, then to reject this invention, and so providing himselfe of a confident mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, his heart commands his pen to signifie her these few lines:</p>

                              <hi>YOu have as much reason to assure your selfe of my affection, as I to doubt of yours: and if Words and Letters, Teares and Vowes, are not capable to make you beleeve the sinceritie of my zeale, and the honour of my affection: what resteth, but that I wish you could dive as deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into my heart, as my heart hath into your beautie, to the end you might bee both Witnesse and Iudge, if under heaven I desire any thing so much on earth, as to bee crowned with the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie to see</hi> Beatrice-Ioana <hi>my wife, and</hi> Alsemero <hi>her husband? But why should I strive to perswade that, which you resolve not to beleeve, or flatter my selfe with any hope, sith I see I must bee so unfortunate to despaire? I will therefore hencefoorth cease to write, but never to love: and sith it is impossible for mee to live, I will prepare my selfe to die, that the World may know, I haue lost a most faire Mistresse in you, and you a most faithfull and constant Servant in mee.</hi>

                        <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> seeing <hi>Alsemero's</hi> constant affection, holds it now rather discretion, then immodestie to accept both his service and selfe, yea, her heart so delights in the greeablenesse of his person, and triumphs in the contemplation of his vertues, that shee either wisheth her selfe in <hi>Alicant</hi> with him, or hee in <hi>Briamata</hi> with her: but considering her affection to <hi>Alsemero</hi> by her Fathers hatred, and her hatred to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racquo,</hi> by his affection; shee thinkes it high time to informe <hi>Alsemero</hi> with what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencie

they both indeavour to obtaine her favour and consent, hoping that his discretion will interpose and finde meanes to stop the progresse of these their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and to withdraw her fathers inclination from <hi>Piracquo,</hi> to bestow it on himselfe: but all this while she thinkes her silence is an injury to <hi>Alsemero,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no longer to bee uncourteous to him, who is so kinde to her, shee very secretly conveyes him this Letter:</p>

                     <p>It is for no others but for Lovers to judge how welcome this Letter was to <hi>Alse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero,</hi> who a thousand times kissed it, and as often blest the hand that wrote it: he had, as wee have formerly understood, beene twice in the Indies; but now, in his conceipt, hee hath found a farre richer treasure in <hi>Spaine,</hi> I meane his <hi>Beatrice-Ioana,</hi> whom hee esteemes the joy of his life, and the life of his joy: but she will not prove so. He is so inamoured of her beauty, and so desirous to have the felicity of her presence, as the Winde comming good, the Ship sets sayle for <hi>Malta,</hi> and hee (to give a colour for his stay) feignes himselfe sicke, fetcheth backe his Trunkes, and remaineth in <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant:</hi> and so burning with desire to see his sweetly deare and dearely sweet Mistresse, he dispatched away his confident Messenger to <hi>Briamata</hi> in the morning, to advertise her that hee will not faile to be with her that night at eleven of the clocke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beatrice Ioana</hi> is ravished with the joy of this newes, and so provides for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. <hi>Alsemero</hi> takes the benefit of the night, and she gives him the advantage of a Posterne doore, which answers to a Garden, where <hi>Diaphanta</hi> her Wayting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlewoman attends his arrivall. He comes: shee conducts him secretly thorow a private Gallery into <hi>Beatrice-Ioana's</hi> Chamber; where (richly apparelled) shee very courteously and respectfully receives him. At the beginning of their meeting they want no kisses; which they second with complements, and many loving conferences, wherein she relates him <hi>Piracquo's</hi> importunate sute to her, and her fathers earnestnesse, yea, in a manner, his constraint, to see the Match concluded betwixt them; hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that purpose there, in her fathers house: Againe, after she hath alleadged and showne him the intirenesse of her affection to himselfe, with whom she is resolved to live and dye, shee lets fall some darke and ambiguous speeches, tending to this effect, that before <hi>Piracquo</hi> be in another world, there is no hope for <hi>Alsemero</hi> to injoy her for his wife in this. Lo here the first plot and designe of a lamentable and execrable mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which we shall shortly see acted and committed.</p>
                     <p>There needes but halfe a word to a sharpe and quicke understanding. <hi>Alsemero</hi> knowes it is the violence of her affection to him, that leades her to this disrespect and hatred to <hi>Piracquo,</hi> and because her content is his, yea, rather it is for his sake,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16653:43"/>
that shee will forsake <hi>Piracquo,</hi> to live and die with him; Passion and affection blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his judgement, and beautie triumphing and giving a law to his Conscience: hee freely proffereth himselfe to his Mistris, vowing, that hee will shortly send him a Challenge, and fight with him; yea, had hee a thousand lives, as hee hath but one, hee is ready, if shee please, to expose and sacrifice them all at her command and service. <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> thankes him kindly for his affection and zeale, the which shee saith shee holds redoubled by the freenesse of his proffer: but being loath that hee should ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his owne life, in seeking that of another, shee conjures him by all the love hee beares her, neither directly nor indirectly to intermeddle with <hi>Piracquo:</hi> but that he repose and build upon her affection and constancie: not doubting, but shee will so prevaile with her father, that hee shall shortly change his opinion, and no more perswade her to affect <hi>Piracquo,</hi> whom shee resolutely affirmes, neither life nor death shall enforce her to marry. And to conclude, although shee affirme, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is dearer to her then her life; yet the better and sooner to compasse their desires, shee prayes him to leave <hi>Alicant,</hi> and for a while to returne to <hi>Valentia,</hi> not doubting but time may worke that, which perchance haste, or importunitie may never. Thus passing over their kisses, and the rest of their amorous conference, hee assured of her love, and shee of his affection, hee returnes for <hi>Alicant,</hi> packes up his baggage, which hee sends before, and within lesse then foure dayes, takes his journey for <hi>Valentia:</hi> where wee will leave him a while, to relate other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and occurrences: which (like Rivers into the Ocean) fall within the compasse of this Historie.</p>
                     <p>This meeting, and part of <hi>Alsemero's</hi> and <hi>Beatrice-Ioana's</hi> conference at her fathers house of <hi>Briamata,</hi> was not so secretly carried and concealed, but some curious or treacherous person neere him, or her, over-heare and reveale it: which makes her father <hi>Vermandero</hi> fume and bite the lip; but hee conceales it from <hi>Piracquo:</hi> and they still continue their intelligence and familiaritie: <hi>Vermandero</hi> telling him plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a little more time shall worke and finish his desire; and that sith his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest cannot prevaile with his daughter, his commands shall. But hee shall misse of his ayme.</p>
                     <p>There is not so great distance from <hi>Briamata</hi> to <hi>Alicant,</hi> but some of the noblest of the citie are advertised thereof: and one among the rest, in great zeale and affection to <hi>Piracquo,</hi> secretly acquaints <hi>Don Thomaso Piracquo</hi> his younger brother therewith, being then in the citie of <hi>Alicant:</hi> who hearing of this newes, whereof he imagined his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ignorant, loath that he should any longer persever in his present errour, and to prevent his future disgrace, he like a faithfull and honest brother, takes occasion from <hi>Alicant</hi> to write him this ensuing letter to <hi>Briamata:</hi>

                        <hi>Piracquo,</hi> notwithstanding this his Brothers Letter of counsell and advice, is so farre from retyring in his sute, as hee rather advanceth with more violence and zeale: and as many mens judgements are dazled and obscured a little before their danger and misfortune, when indeed they have most need to have them sound and cleare: so hee is not capable to bee disswaded from re-searching his Mistresse, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth those Saylors, who are resolute to endure a storme, in hope of faire weather: but he had found more security and lesse danger, if he had imbraced and followed the counsell that his brother gave him. For <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> seeing she could not obtaine her desire in marying <hi>Alsemero,</hi> e're <hi>Piracquo</hi> were removed, doth now confirme that which formerly shee had resolved on, to make him away, in what manner, or at what rate so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And now, after shee had ruminated, and runne over many bloodie designes: the devill, who never flies from those that follow him, proffers her an invention as exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable as damnable. There is a gallant young Gentleman, of the Garison of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, who followes her father, that to her knowledge doth deeply honour, and dearely affect her: yea, shee knowes, that at her request he will not sticke to murther <hi>Piracquo:</hi> his name is <hi>Signiour Antonio de Flores:</hi> shee is resolute in her rage, and approves him to be a fit instrument to execute her will.</p>
                     <p>Now, as soone as <hi>Vermandero</hi> understands of <hi>Alsemero's</hi> departure to <hi>Valentia,</hi> hee with his daughter and <hi>Piracquo</hi> returnes from <hi>Briamata</hi> to <hi>Alicant:</hi> where, within three dayes of their arrivall, <hi>Beatrice-Ioana,</hi> boyling still in her revenge to <hi>Piracquo,</hi> which neither the ayre of the Countrey nor Citie could quench or wipe off, shee sends for <hi>de Flores,</hi> and with many flattering smiles, and sugred speeches, acquaints him with her purpose and desire, making him many promises of kindnesse and courtesies, if he will performe it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>De Flores</hi> having a long time loved <hi>Beatrice-Ioaua,</hi> is exceeding glad of this newes, yea, feeding his hopes with the ayre of her promises, he is so caught and intangled in the snares of her beautie, that hee freely promiseth to dispatch <hi>Piracquo;</hi> and so they first consult, and then agree upon the manner how, which forth-with wee shall see per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: to which end, <hi>de Flores</hi> insinuates himselfe fairely into <hi>Piracquo's</hi> company and familiaritie as hee comes to the castle; where watching his hellish opportunitie, he one day hearing <hi>Piracquo</hi> commend the thicknesse and strength of the Walles, told him that the strength of that Castle consisted not in the Walles, but in the <hi>Casemates</hi> that were stored with good Ordnance to scoure the ditches. <hi>Piracquo</hi> very courteously prayes <hi>de Flores</hi> to be a meanes that he may goe downe and see the <hi>Casemates. De Flores</hi> like a bloudy Faukner, seeing <hi>Piracquo</hi> already come to his lure, tells him it is now din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner time, and the bell upon ringing: but if he please, hee himselfe will after dinner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, and shew him all the strength and rarities of the Castle. Hee thankes <hi>de Flores</hi> for this courtesie, and accepts heereof, with promise to goe. So hee hies in to dinner, and <hi>de Flores</hi> pretending some businesse, walkes in the Court.</p>
                     <p>Whiles <hi>Piracquo</hi> is at dinner with <hi>Vermandero, de Flores</hi> is providing him of a bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy banquet in the East <hi>Casmate,</hi> where, of purpose hee goes, and hides a naked sword and ponyard behinde the doore. Now dinner being ended, <hi>Piracquo</hi> finds out <hi>de Flores,</hi> and summons him of his promise: who tells him he is ready to wayt on him: so away they goe from the Walles to the Ravellins, Sconces and Bulwarkes, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16653:44"/>
from thence by a Posterne to the Ditches: and so in againe to the <hi>Casemates,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have already viewed three, and are now going to the last, which is the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereon wee shall presently see acted a mournefull and bloudy Tragedy. At the descent hereof <hi>De Flores</hi> puts off his Rapier, and leaves it behinde him, treacherously informing <hi>Piracquo</hi> thar the descent is narrow and craggy. See here the policie and villany of this devillish and treacherous miscreant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Piracquo,</hi> not doubting nor dreaming of any treason, followes his example, and so casts off his Rapier: <hi>De Flores</hi> leades the way, and hee followes him; but, alas poore Gentleman, hee shall never returne with his life: they enter the Vault of the <hi>Casemate; De Flores</hi> opens the doore, and throwes it backe, thereby to hide his sword and Poniard. Hee stoopes and lookes thorow a Port-hole, and tells him, that that Peece doth thorowly scowre the Ditch. <hi>Piracquo</hi> stoopes likewise downe to view it, when (O griefe to thinke thereon!) <hi>De Flores</hi> steps for his Weapons, and with his Poniard stabs him thorow the backe, and swiftly redoubling blow upon blow, kills him dead at his feete, and without going farther, buries him there, right under the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of an old wall, whereof that <hi>Casemate</hi> was built. Loe here the first part of this mournefull and bloudy Tragedie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>De Flores</hi> (like a gracelesse villaine) having dispatched this sorrowfull businesse, speedily acquaints <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> herewith, who (miserable wretch) doth hereat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely rejoyce, and thankes him with many kisses; and the better to conceale this their vild and bloudy Murther, as also to cast a mist before peoples conceits and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, she bids him, by some secret meanes, to cause reports to be spread: first, that <hi>Piracquo</hi> was seene gone foorth the Castle gate; then, that in the City he was seene take boate, and went (as it was thought) to take the ayre of the sea. But this wit of theirs shall prove folly: for though men as yet see not this Murther, yet God in his due time will both detect and punish it.</p>
                     <p>By this time <hi>Piracquo</hi> is found wanting, both in the City and Castle; so these afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said reports runne for currant, all tongues prattle hereof; <hi>Vermandero</hi> knowes not what to say, nor <hi>Piracquo's</hi> brother and friends what to doe herein: they every houre and minute expect newes of him, but their hopes bring them no comfort; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest, our devillish <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> seemes exceedingly to grieve and mourne hereat. <hi>Don Thomaso Piracquo</hi> with the rest of his friends, search every corner of the City, and send scouts, both by land and sea, to have newes of him. <hi>Vermandero</hi> the Captaine of the Castle doth the like, and vowes, that next his owne sonne, he loved <hi>Piracquo</hi> before any man of the world: yea, not onely his friends, but generally all those who knew him, exceedingly weepe and bewaile the absence and losse of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier: for they thinke sure he is drowned in the sea.</p>
                     <p>Now in the middest of this sorrow, and of these teares, <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> doth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly advertise her Lover <hi>Alsemero</hi> hereof, but in such palliating tearmes, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by she may delude and carry away his judgement from imagining that shee had the least shaddow or finger herein: and withall prayes him to make no longer stay in <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia,</hi> but to come away to her to <hi>Alicant. Alsemero</hi> wonders at this newes, and to please his faire Mistresse, believes part thereof, but will never believe all; but hee is so inflamed with her beauty, as her remembrance wipes away that of <hi>Piracquo;</hi> when letting passe a little time, hee makes his preparations for <hi>Alicant:</hi> but first hee sends the chiefest of his parents to <hi>Vermandero,</hi> to demand his daughter <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> in marriage for him, and then comes himselfe in person, and in discreete and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable manner courts her Parents privately, and makes shew to seeke her pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely.</p>
                     <p>In fine, after many conferences, meetings, and complements, as <hi>Alsemero</hi> hath
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16653:45"/>
heretofore wonne the affection of <hi>Beatrice-Ioana,</hi> so now at last hee obtaines likewise the favour and consent of <hi>Vermandero</hi> her father. And here our two Lovers, to their exceeding great content, and infinite joy, are united, and by the bond of marriage, of two persons made one, their Nuptialls being solemnized in the Castle of <hi>Alicant</hi> with much Pompe, State, and Bravery.</p>
                     <p>Having heretofore heard the conference that past betwixt <hi>Alsemero</hi> and <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> in the Church; having likewise seene the amorous Letters that past betwixt them, from <hi>Alicant</hi> to <hi>Briamata,</hi> and from <hi>Briamata</hi> to <hi>Alicant;</hi> and now considering the pompe and glory of their Nuptialls, who would imagine that any averse accident could alter the sweetnesse and tranquillity of their affections, or that the Sunne-shine of their joyes should so soone be eclipsed, and overtaken with a storme? But God is as just as secret in his decrees.</p>
                     <p>For this marryed couple had scarce lived three moneths in the pleasures of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke (which if vertuously observed is the sweetest earthly joy) but <hi>Alsemero,</hi> like a fond husband, becomes jealous of his wife; so as hee curbes and restraines her of her liberty, and would hardly permit her to conferre or converse with, yea, farre lesse, to see any man: but this is not the way to teach a woman chastity: for if faire words, good example, and sweete admonitions cannot prevaile, threatnings and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoning in a Chamber will never; yea, the experience thereof is daily seene, both in <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> where generally the Women use (but not abuse) their liberty and freedome, granted them by their husbands, with much civility, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and respect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> bites the lip at this her husbands discourtesy: shee vowes she is as much deceived in his love, as hee in his jealousie, and that shee is as unworthy of his suspicion, as hee of her affection; hee watcheth her every where, and sets Spyes over her in every corner: yea, his jealousy is become so violent, as hee deemes her unchast with many, yet knowes not with whom: but this tree of Iealousie never brings forth good fruite. Shee complaines hereof to her father, and prayes him to be a meanes to appease and calme this tempest, which threatens the Ship-wracke, not onely of her content, but (it may be) of her life. <hi>Vermandero</hi> beares himselfe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly herein; but he may as soone place another Sunne in the Firmament, as roote out this fearefull frenzie out of <hi>Alsemero's</hi> head: for this his paternall admonition is so farre from drawing him to hearken to reason, as it produceth contrary effects; for now <hi>Alsemero,</hi> to prevent his shame, and secure his feare, suddenly provides a Coach, and so carries home his wife from <hi>Alicant</hi> to <hi>Valentia.</hi> This sudden depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grieves <hi>Vermandero,</hi> and galles <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> to the heart, who now lookes no longer on her husband with affection, but with disdaine and envie. Many dayes are not past, but her father resolves to send to <hi>Valentia,</hi> to know how matters stand betwixt his daughter and her husband: hee makes choyce of <hi>De Flores</hi> to ride thither, and sends Letters to them both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>De Flores</hi> is extreamely joyfull of this occasion, to see his old Mistresse <hi>Beatrice-Ioana,</hi> whom hee loves dearer then his life: hee comes to <hi>Valentia,</hi> and finding <hi>Alse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero</hi> abroad, and she at home, delivers her her fathers Letter, and salutes and kisseth her, with many amorous imbracings and dalliances (which modesty holds unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of relation) she acquaints him with her husbands ingratitude; he rather rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then grieves hereat, and now revives his old sute, and redoubleth his new kisses: shee considering what hee hath done for her service, and joyning therewith her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands jealousie, not onely ingageth herselfe to him for the time present, but for the future, and bids him visite her often. But they both shall pay deare for this familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and pleasure.</p>

                        <hi>Alsemero</hi> comes home, receives his fathers Letter, sets a pleasing face on his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented heart, and bids him welcome: And so the next day writes backe to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Vermandero,</hi> and dispatcheth <hi>De Flores;</hi> who for that time takes his leave of them both, and returnes for <hi>Alicant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is no sooner departed, but <hi>Alsemero</hi> is by one of his Spies, a Wayting gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of his Wifes, whom hee had corrupted with money, advertised that there past many amorous kisses, and dalliances betweene her Mistresse and <hi>De Flores:</hi> yea, she reveales all that ever shee saw or heard: for shee past not to bee false to her Lady, so she were true to her Lord and Master. And indeede this Wayting-gentlewoman was that <hi>Diaphanta,</hi> of whom wee have formerly made mention, for conducting of <hi>Alsemero</hi> to her Ladies chamber at <hi>Briamata. Alsemero</hi> is all fire at this newes, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults not with judgement, but with passion; and so rather like a devill then a man, flies to his Wife's chamber, wherein furiously rushing, hee with his sword drawne in his hand, to her great terrour and amazement, delivers her these words.</p>
                     <p>Minion (quoth hee) upon thy life tell me what familiarity there hath now past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>De Flores</hi> and thy selfe: whereat shee, fetching many sighes, and shedding many teares, answers him, that by her part of heaven, her thoughts, speeches, and actions have no way exceeded the bounds of honour and chastity towards him; and that <hi>De Flores</hi> never attempted any courtesy, but such as a brother may shew to his owne naturall sister. Then, quoth hee, whence proceedes this your familiarity? Whereat she growes pale, and withall silent. Which her husband espying, Dispatch, quoth hee, and tell me the truth, or else this sword of mine shall instantly finde a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to thy heart. When loe, the providence of God so ordayned it, that shee is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this exigent and extreamity, as shee must be a witnesse against her selfe, and in seeking to conceale her whoredome, must discover her Murther; the which she doth in these words:</p>
                     <p>Know <hi>Alsemero,</hi> that sith thou wilt inforce mee to shew thee the true cause of my chast familiarity with <hi>De Flores,</hi> that I am much bound to him, and thy selfe more: for he it was, that at my request, dispatched <hi>Piracquo,</hi> without the which (as thou well knowest) I could never have enjoyed thee for my husband, nor thou me for thy wife: And so she reveales him the whole circumstance of that cruell Murther, as wee have formerly understood; the which she conjures and prayes him to conceale, sith no lesse then <hi>De Flores</hi> and her owne life depended thereon, and that shee will dye a thousand deaths, before consent to defile his bed, or to violate her oath and promise given him in marriage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alsemero</hi> both wondering and grieving at this lamentable newes, sayes little, but thinkes the more; and although hee had reason and apparance to believe, that shee who commits Murther, will not sticke to commit Adultery, yet upon his Wife's so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne oathes and protestations, hee forgets what is past; onely hee strictly chargeth her, no more to see, or admit <hi>De Flores</hi> into her company; or if the contrary, hee vowes hee will so sharpely bee revenged of her, as hee will make her an example to all posterity.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Beatrice-Ioana,</hi> notwithstanding her husbands speeches, continueth her intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with <hi>De Flores;</hi> yea, her husband no sooner rides abroad, but he is at <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> with her; and they are become so impudent, as what they did before secretly, they now in a manner doe publikely, or at least, with Chamber-doores open. <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanta</hi> knowing this to be a great scandall, as well to her Masters honour, as house, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine informes him thereof; who vowes to take a most sharpe revenge of this their infamy and indignity, as indeed he doth: for hee bethinkes himselfe (thereby to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it) of an invention, as worthy of his jealousie, as of their first crime of Murther,

Thus by the providence of God, in the second Tragedie of our Historie, wee see our two Murtherers murthered, and <hi>Piracquo's</hi> innocent bloud revenged in the guiltinesse of theirs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alsemero,</hi> having finished this bloudie businesse, leaves his Pistols on the Table, as also his Sword and Ponyard all bloudy as they were; and without covering or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the breathlesse bodies of these two wretched miscreants, he shuts his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doore, and is so farre from flying for the fact, as hee takes his Coach, and goes directly to the Criminall Iudge himselfe, and reveales what he had done; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceales the Murther of <hi>Piracquo.</hi> The Iudge is astonished and amazed at the report of this mournefull and pittifull accident: hee takes <hi>Alsemero</hi> with him, returnes to his house, and findes those two dead bodies fresh smoaking and reeking in their bloud: the newes hereof is spread in all the City. The whole people of <hi>Valentia</hi> flocke thither to bee eye-witnesses of these two murthered persons; where some behold them with pitie, others with joy, but all with astonishment and admiration, and no lesse doe those of <hi>Alicant,</hi> where this newes is speedily poasted; but all their griefes are nothing to those of <hi>Don Diego de Vermandero's (Beatrice-Ioana's</hi> father) who infinitely and extreamely grieves, partly for the death, but specially for the crime of his daughter.</p>
                     <p>The Iudge presently commits <hi>Alsemero</hi> prisoner in another of his owne Chambers, and so examining <hi>Diaphanta</hi> upon her oath, concerning the familiaritie betwixt <hi>De Flores</hi> and <hi>Beatrice-Ioana:</hi> shee affirmes constantly, that now and many times before, shee saw them commit adultery: and that shee it was that first advertised <hi>Alsemero</hi> her Master heereof. Whereupon, after a second examination of <hi>Alsemero,</hi> they, upon mature deliberation, acquite him of this fact: so hee is freed, and the dead bodies ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away and buried.</p>
                     <p>But although this earthly Iudge have acquitted <hi>Alsemero</hi> of this fact, yet the Iudge of Iudges, the great God of Heaven, who seeth not onely our heart, but our thoughts, not onely our actions, but our intents, hath this and something else to lay to his charge: for hee (in his sacred providence, and divine Iustice) doth both remember and observe, first how ready and willing <hi>Alsemero</hi> was to ingage himselfe to <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:16653:46"/>
to kill <hi>Piracquo:</hi> then, though he consented not to his Murther, yet how he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it, and brought it not to publike arraignement and punishment, whereby the dead body of <hi>Piracquo</hi> might receive a more honourable and Christian like Sepulchre: and if these crimes of his be not capable to deserve revenge and chastisement, Loe, hee is entring into a new, wilfull, and premeditated Murther, and doth so dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably and treacheroubly performe it, as we shall shortly see him lose his life upon an infamous Scaffold, where hee shall finde no heart to pitty him, nor eye to bewaile him.</p>
                     <p>If we would be so ignorant, wee cannot be so malicious to forget that loving and courteous Letter, which <hi>Don Thomaso Piracquo</hi> wrote his Brother <hi>Alonso Piracquo</hi> from <hi>Alicant</hi> to <hi>Briamata,</hi> to with-draw himselfe from his suite to <hi>Beatrice-Ioana;</hi> and although his affection and jealousie to prevent his Brothers disgrace, was then the chiefe occasion of that his Letter, yet sith he was since disastrously and misfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bereaved of him, of that deare and sweet Brother of his, whom he ever held and esteemed farre dearer then his life, his thoughts, like so many lines, concurre in this Centre, from whence hee cannot bee otherwise conceited or drawne, but that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrice-Ioana</hi> and <hi>Absemero</hi> had a hand, and were at least accessaries, if not authours of his losse: upon the foundation of which beliefe hee rayseth this resolution, that hee is not worthy to bee a Gentleman, nor of the degree and title of a Brother, if hee crave not satisfaction for that irreparable losse which hee sustayneth in that of his Brother; and the sooner is hee drawne thereunto, because hee believes, that as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semero</hi> was ordayned of old to chastize <hi>Beatrice-Ioana,</hi> so hee was by the same Power reserved to bee revenged of <hi>Alsemero.</hi> Whereupon, although it bee not the custome of <hi>Spaine</hi> to fight Duels (as desiring rather the death of their enemies then of their friends) he resolves to fight with him; and to that end, understanding <hi>Alsemero</hi> to be then in <hi>Alicant,</hi> sends him this Challenge:</p>

He is not recovered halfe way from <hi>Alicant</hi> towards <hi>Valentia,</hi> but his Horse stumbles and breakes his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg, and <hi>Alsemero</hi> his right arme; hee is amazed, perplexed, and inraged hereat, and knowes not what to doe, or whither to flie for safety: for hee sees no bush nor hedge to hide him, nor lane to save him; and now he repents himselfe of his fact, but it is too late: his Horse fayling him, he trusteth to his legs, and so throwing off his cloake, runnes as speedily as hee may: but the foulenesse of his fact doth still so affright him, and terrifie his conscience, as hee is afrayd of his owne shaddow, lookes still backe, imagining that every stone he sees is a Sergeant come to arrest him; yea, his thoughts, like so many Bloud-hounds, pursue and follow him, swearing exceedingly, partly through his labour, but especially through the affliction and perturbation of his mind; yea, every poynt of a minute hee both expecteth and feares his apprehension.</p>
                     <p>Neither is his feare or expectation vaine; for loe, hee at last perceives foure come galloping after him as fast as their Horses can drive. So they finding first his poore Horse, and now espying his miserable selfe, hee sees hee is invironed of all sides, and thinkes the earth hath brought forth <hi>Cadmean</hi> men to apprehend him; yet remembring himselfe a Gentleman, and withall a Souldier, hee resolves rather to sell his life dearely in that place, then to be made a Spectacle upon an infamous Scaffold: but this courage and resolution shall neither prevaile, or rescue him.</p>
                     <p>Hee to this effect drawes his Rapier, the which the foure Sergeants will him to yield, and render up to the Kings lawes and justice: but hee is resolute to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: They threaten him with their Pistols; but their sight doe as little amaze him, as their report and bullets. So they alight from their Horses, and environ him with their Swords, and having hurt two of them, and performed the part of a desperate Gladiator, the third joyning with him, they breake his Rapier within a foote of the Hilt, whereat hee yields himselfe. <hi>Alsemero</hi> thus taken, is the same night brought backe to <hi>Alicant,</hi> in whose Gates and Streets a wonderfull concourse of people

assemble to see him passe, who as much pitty his person, as execrate and condemne his fact.</p>
                     <p>The Senate is assembled, and <hi>Alsemero</hi> brought to appeare, who considering the hainousnesse of his treacherous and bloudy fact; which the Devill had caused him to commit, hee stayes for no witnesses, but accuseth himselfe of this Murther, the which from point to point hee confesseth; and so they adjudge him to lose his head: but this is too honourable a death for a Gentleman who hath so treacherously and basely dishonoured and blemished his Gentility. As hee is on the Scaffold, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himselfe to dye, and seeing no farther hope of life, but the image of death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, knowing it no time now, either to dissemble with God, or to feare the Law, hee, to the amazement of all the world, tells the people, that although he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Don Thomaso Piracquo,</hi> yet hee had no hand in the Murther of his brother <hi>Don A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonso,</hi> whom (hee sayd) <hi>De Flores,</hi> at the instigation of his wicked and wretched wife <hi>Beatrice-Ioana,</hi> had murthered and buryed in the East <hi>Casemate</hi> of the Castle; and withall affirmed, that if hee were guilty in any thing concerning that Murther, it was onely in concealing it, which hee had done till then, and whereof (hee sayd) he now most heartily repented himselfe, as being unwilling any longer to charge his soule with it, sith hee was ready to leave this world, and to goe to another, and so besought them all to pray unto God to forgive him, whose sacred Majesty, hee confessed, hee had highly and infinitely offended; and wished them all to beware, and flie the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Devill, and to become better Christians by his example.</p>
                     <p>The Iudges advertised hereof, cause his head to be strucken off for murthering of <hi>Don Thomaso Piracquo;</hi> and his body to be throwne into the Sea, for concealing that of <hi>Don Alonso;</hi> which was accordingly executed: and from the place of Execution they immediately goe to the Castle, and so to the East <hi>Casemate,</hi> where causing the stones to be removed, they find the mournfull murthered body of <hi>Don Alonso Piracquo,</hi> which they give to his kinsfolkes to receive a more honourable Buriall, according to his ranke and degree: and from thence they returne to the Churches, where the Bodies of <hi>De Flores</hi> and <hi>Beatrice-Ioana</hi> were interred (after they were brought backe from <hi>Valentia)</hi> the which, for their horrible Murther, they at the common place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cause to bee burned, and their ashes to be throwne into the ayre, as unworthy to have any resting place on earth, which they had so cruelly stayned and polluted with innocent bloud.</p>

                     <p>IN the Parish of <hi>Spreare,</hi> some fifteene miles distant from the beautifull and noble City of <hi>Brescia</hi> (in the Territories of the <hi>Venetians)</hi> there dwelt a poore countrey man, termed <hi>Alibius,</hi> who could vaunt of no other wealth left him by his deceased parents, but that hee was a man of a comely stature and proportion, and withall, that they were of an honest fame and reputation: so if his vertues had answered theirs, his poverty had never proved so pernicious and fatall an enemy to him, as to ruine
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16653:49"/>
his fortunes with his life, and his life with his fortunes: or had the vices of his soule not contaminated or stayned the perfections of his body, my pen had slept in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and his History layne raked up in the dust of his grave: but sith his actions have exceeded the bounds both of nature and grace, yea, sith hee hath learned of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill to imbath his hands in poyson, and to imbrue them in innocent bloud, I (incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the connivencie and silence of others) not out of any want of charity to the memory of dead <hi>Alibius,</hi> but in detestation of his bloudy resolution and actions, and chiefely and especially to the comfort and instruction of the living, who may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre his crime by the sight of his punishment: I have adventured and resolved to give this a place among the rest of my tragicall Histories, that <hi>Italie,</hi> as well as <hi>Brescia,</hi> and <hi>Spreare</hi> (and peradventure the whole Christian world with <hi>Italie)</hi> may understand thereof.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Alibius,</hi> as soone as he had attained the age of five and twenty yeares, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed an honest Mayden, termed <hi>Merilla,</hi> being a Farmers daughter of the same Parish of <hi>Spreare,</hi> with whom he had but small meanes, and shee (to speake truth) but little wit, and lesse beauty; yet she was neither so poore, but that she deserved a good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, nor so hard favoured, but shee might content an honest one. And indeede, had <hi>Alibius</hi> his care and industry answered <hi>Merilla's</hi> providence and frugality, or his lustfull eye not strayed either beyond his vow given her in marriage, or her indifferent beauty, this Match might have proved as fortunate, as it hath since succeeded misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ruinous.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Alibius,</hi> whose thoughts flew a pitch above his birth, ranke, and meanes, had not lived many yeares in wedlocke, till his prodigality and vanity had wasted and dissipated the greatest part of that small estate hee had; so as necessity looking now on him, because formerly he disdayned to looke on it, knowing better how to play, then worke, or rather not how to worke, but play; and seeing that his present meanes could not maintayne him, nor his future hopes promise it, he as a true truant, and a perfect prodigall, disdayning to want when hee hath it, and when he hath it not, sets up this lewd and unthrifty resolution with himselfe, to set all at sixe and seven. But this prodigall humour of his doth as much grieve his Wife, as delight him: for now shee sees that her spinning at home could neither serve nor satisfie his expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces abroad, and that all her care and labour was by farre too little to maintayne his vanity; which shee (poore good woman) perceiving, yea, more then so, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her hopes, now feeling, shee with faire wordes, and secret and sweete perswasions endeavoureth to reclaime him from it; but this course of hers workes a contrary effect: for if before hee played the prodigall in her absence, now hee playes the Tyrant in her presence: for hee not onely rejoyceth, and stops his eares against her counsell, but rates and reviles her with vilde and contemptuous spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, such as indeed are infinitely unfit either for a husband to give, or a wife ro re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. And this, as I have beene informed, was the first distast betwixt <hi>Alibius</hi> and <hi>Merilla.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But wee need not goe farre for a Second: There is no pestilent Infection, nor infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Pestilence to that of haunting and frequenting bad company; for it is a rocke, wherein many have suffered Shipwracke; it is a Fountaine that sends foorth many poysoned streames to those that tast or drinke thereof; yea, it is a Tree, whose fruit is by so much the more bitter to the stomacke, as it seemes pleasing to the palate, like Pilles of poyson candy'd in Sugar: and as that which most delights, most confounds the sense; so use breeding an habite, and habite a second nature, vicious company, whom wee take to bee our dearest friends, doe in fine prove our most dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and so much the more dangerous, sith when wee would forsake them, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16653:49"/>
which our <hi>Alibius</hi> will at last finde true in himselfe: yea, wee shall see him inforced to acknowledge it, as having bought and purchased it with a woefull and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable experience: for now hee beginnes to love Swearing, Whoredome, and Drunkennesse, that before hee hated; and to hate the Gospel of Christ, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours thereof, that before hee loved. A most wretched exchange, where we take from our soules, to give to our senses; and a woefull bargaine, where wee sell God, to buy the Devill.</p>
                     <p>Poore <hi>Merilla</hi> grieving to see that she could not unsee these his ungodly courses, as also that it not onely consumed the small remaynder of his meanes, but likewise lost his friends, and darkened and eclipsed his reputation, thinkes it not onely a part of her duety, but of her affection to him, to request some vertuous friend, or godly neighbour of theirs to deale with him herein, thereby to endeavour to perswade him from these his irregular and prophane courses: But as those who are sicke, are so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their tast, as they cannot discerne betweene sweet and bitter; So <hi>Alibius,</hi> sicke of the Lethargie of these his enormous and dissolute Vices, was so farre from rellishing this wholesome counsell, as he not onely rejected it, but scoffed and reviled the partie who gave it him: and it being not so secretly (or peradventure not so wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) mannaged, but hee comming to understand it proceeded from his wife <hi>Merilla,</hi> hee tooke it so passionately and outragiously, to see his follies revealed by her, who was bound to conceale them, as most uncivilly and inhumanely checking her, hee in the heat of his displeasure and revenge, some moneths forsakes her company, and many her bed; whereat, such was her tender affection to him, and his disrespect to her, as I know not whether she more grieved, or he rejoyced.</p>
                     <p>The motives of his third distast to his Wife, were grounded upon her barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sterility; as if it were in her power to give him a Child, when Gods plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and providence was to give none to her, without considering that the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and fruitfulnesse of a woman comes all from the Lord, or without remembring that some Children are borne for a curse, as others for a blessing to their parents: or as if his earthly vanity could teach Gods secret Divinity, what were fittest for him, and yet these reasons cannot prevaile against his unreasonable selfe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, amongst the rest of his distastes, hee, or rather the Devill for him, throwes in against his Wife: <hi>That if hee had a Child, hee should bee a good husband, and not before:</hi> as if hee desired and sought some pretext and colour, though never so unjust and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, to cover his vices and prodigality; or in the eyes of the World to bolster out and apologize his iarring and squaring with his Wife: yea, his impudencie was growne to the height of this impiety, that hee often affirmed, his Wife was the cause of his poverty; for if she would give him no Child, God would give him no prosperity.</p>
                     <p>Now, as all women by nature generally desire Children; so it is a great affliction (I will not say a curse) to them, if they have none. But these unjust speeches of <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> doe justly and infinitely afflict his Wife <hi>Merilla,</hi> who (that no farther discord might trouble the harmony of their wedlocke) sends her teares to earth, and her prayers to heaven, that her Blessed Saviour would bee pleased to blesse her with a Child; when God, seeing his prophane hypocrisy, which he will revenge, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding her religious zeale, which hee will reward, out of the inestimable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his Mercie and providence, grants her her request, and him his desire: so as in short time she sees her selfe the mother, and him the father of a young daughter, termed <hi>Emelia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth reason of his distast of his Wife, was, that seeing time runne on in his swift cariere, and his prodigality still remayning, as also that his maske of his Wife's
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16653:50"/>
sterilitie was taken away; hee that was heeretofore so desirous of a child, now thinks this one to bee one too many, because (saith hee) hee can no way endure the crying and trouble thereof. But is there any thing so unnaturall or ridiculous as this? Now, if hee murmure at this his child, during her infancie, hee will much more storme at her, when shee comes up to riper yeares: and observing that her mother doth subtract from his prodigality, to adde to her maintenance, this doth againe extreamely vexe and afflict him: so that his child, whom hee pretended should bee the cause of his joy and prosperity, is now that of his griefe; and as hee thinks, of his farther pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and misery: the which, poore <hi>Merilla</hi> his wife, to her unspeakeable and ineffable griefe, palpably perceiveth, aswell in his uncharitable and malicious speeches, banded to her for her daughter <hi>Emelia's</hi> sake, as to <hi>Emelia</hi> for her sake: But what know wee, whether God hath purposely sent this daughter, to revenge the injuries and wrongs that her father intendeth to her Mother?</p>
                     <p>His fift, and (as yet) his last distaste against his wife, proceeds from his observing that her beauty is withered and decayed; not that heretofore he knew her faire: but that shee is not so faire now, as when hee first married her: as if time and age had not power to wither the blossomes of our youth, as the Sunne hath to daver the freshest Roses and Lillies. But as all his former distastes towards his wife, bewray his inclination to prodigality and prophanenesse: so this last of his doth manifestly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his addiction to lust, and his affection to Whoredome: for it is impossible for our wives to seeme foule in our eyes, except there bee some other seemes fayrer: as blacknesse seemes blacker when it is compared and paralelled with whitenesse: and this indeed is the Vulture and Viper that stickes so close to his brest, and so neere to his heart, yea, this is his darling and bosome sinne that will strangle him, when it makes greatest shew to kisse and imbrace him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alibius,</hi> powerfully sollicited by these five severall distastes conceived against his wife <hi>Merilla,</hi> who poore woman rides at an Anchor in the tranquillity of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, whiles hee (in the heate and height of his youth) floated in the Ocean of his voluptuousnesse and sensualitie, but especially provoked by his owne poverty and penury; who now beganne to appeare to him in a leane and miserable shape: hee leaves his wife and family, and betakes himselfe to the service of Gentlemen; thinking thereby to stoppe the current of his prodigality, and to finde out the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meanes, futurely to get that which formerly hee had expended: which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of his had beene indeed commendable, if the integrity of his heart had beene answerable to the sweetnesse of his tongue: but wee shall see the contrary, and finde by his example, that Snakes alwaies lurke under the fayrest and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest leaves.</p>
                     <p>During which time, hee serves some Gentlemen of worth and quality, but one of especiall accompt and reputation; not distant above three small miles from the City of <hi>Brescia,</hi> who being an excellent House-keeper, and a good member of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, there <hi>Alibius</hi> (had hee had as much Grace as Vanity, or as much Religion as impiety) might have forgotten his old vices, and have learned new Vertues: but if hee delighted to become excellent in any thing, it was first to bee a perfect Carver and Wayter, then to bee decent in his apparell; and last of all, to bee smooth in his speeches, and affable and pleasing in his complements, without any regard at all, either to reforme the vanity of his thoughts, or to controule his disolute and dangerous actions.</p>
                     <p>Having thus pastaway many yeares abroad in service, and very seldome or never either seene <hi>Spreare,</hi> or visited his <hi>Merilla</hi> and <hi>Emelia:</hi> hee at last seeing of the one side, that age beganne to Snow on his head; and that the greatest wealth of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-man,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16653:50"/>
was, to have onely a new Livery, and a full belly, to have many verball, but no reall friends, resolved to leave his service, as also his wife and daughter in <hi>Spreare:</hi> and so to travell to <hi>Venice,</hi> hoping there in some honest place, and imployment, to serve the Seigniorie, or at least some one of the <hi>Magnifico's</hi> or <hi>Clarissimo's:</hi> but then considering the charge of the journey, the weakenesse of his purse, and the uncertainty of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and preferment, hee resolves for a time to sojourne in <hi>Brescia;</hi> and to watch if any occasion or accident presented, whereby hee might repaire and raise his fortunes.</p>
                     <p>Hee had not long lived in this City (which for antiquity, beauty, situation, wealth and fidelity (after <hi>Venice</hi> it selfe) gives not the hand to any of her sister Cities of that state:) but his eyes (as the lustfull sentynells of his heart) espie so many beauties, as he began to loath his owne wife <hi>Merilla,</hi> and to wish her in another world, that hee might have another wife in this. Loe, here the divell beginnes with him anew to perswade him to hate his wife.</p>
                     <p>Abiding thus in <hi>Brescia,</hi> it fell out that hee, who bore the silver rod in token of honour, and Iustice (or rather of honour to Iustice) before the podestate or chiefe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate of this City dyed: and to this Office <hi>Alibius</hi> (because hee knew himselfe a grave and personall man) aspired: and what through the respect of his gravitie, through his smooth tongue, and fayre speeches: but especially by making many friends to the Podestate and Senators, he at last obtained it: a place indeed, more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable then profitable, and yet worth at least one hundred Zechines, <hi>per annum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his diet. This preferment makes <hi>Alibius</hi> looke aloft, and so hee scornes his poore wife <hi>Merilla,</hi> as if there were no paritie and simpathie betwixt her rags and his robes: yea, hee would not see <hi>Spreare,</hi> nor suffer her to see <hi>Brescia,</hi> and the devill was so busie with him, or hee with the devill, that in hope of a richer and fayrer wife, hee resolves to poyson her according as hee heretofore had many times thought and premeditated: and that which egged and threw him on, with more violence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, was a proud conceit of himselfe, and of his much dignity and preferment. But as povertie many times befalls us for our good, so sometimes, wealth and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity bring us misfortune and misery.</p>
                     <p>Not long after, another accident falls out, which doth likewise much rejoyce him: An honest Cittizen of <hi>Brescia,</hi> of his owne name, though no way his kinsman, dies, (and as since it hath beene shrewdly imagined, not without vehement suspicion of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) leaving a rich widdowe, named <hi>Philatea:</hi> and for the familiarity and good conceit he had of our <hi>Alibius,</hi> as also induced thereunto through his hypocritall shew of honesty and piety, makes him sole overseer of his will: so neatly and smoothly did our <hi>Alibius</hi> worke and insinuate himselfe into his favour: But the maske of this his hypocrisie shall bee soone puld off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alibius</hi> seeing <hi>Philatea</hi> young, rich and faire, hee lookes on her more often then on her husbands testament: and so wishing his wife <hi>Merilla</hi> in his adopted kinsmans grave, and himselfe in <hi>Philatea's</hi> bed, hee bends his purposes and intents that way, as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lines that runne to their Center: yea, so strongly hath the devill possessed him with these hellish designes and bloody resolutions, as his love to <hi>Philatea,</hi> defacing his respect to <hi>Merilla,</hi> hee sees her a blocke in his way, and a stop to his preferment, and so concludes that shee must hee remooved and dispatched: to which effect, to draw his sinfull contemplation into bloudy action, hee rides over to <hi>Spreare</hi> to her; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of tender love and affection, hee in Milke, Wine, and rosted Apples, gives her poyson; when seeing it would not worke his desired effect, hee after takes an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, purposely to quarrell with her, and so very lamentably (in presence of their daughter <hi>Emelia)</hi> reviles and beates her, and returnes to <hi>Brescia,</hi> still hoping that the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16653:51"/>
poyson yet might operate, and disperse it selfe in her veines, and that shortly hee should heare newes of her death. Loe here <hi>Alibius</hi> his first attempt in seeking to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Wife.</p>
                     <p>In this meane time hee layes close siedge to <hi>Philatea's</hi> Chastity, who not so honest as faire, is soone drawne to sinne, and prostitutes her selfe to his beastly pleasure, and having no regard to her reputation, conscience, or soule, consents to this bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweet sinne of Adultery; the which lascivious familiarity is so long continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, till at last <hi>Philatea's</hi> straight Bodies become too small, and her Apron too short for her; when seeing it high time to provide for her fame, shee acquaints <hi>Alibius</hi> herewith, and askes his advice, whether shee shall marry with one of her servants: <hi>Alibius</hi> meaning to keepe the Farme for himselfe, whereof hee had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy taken possession, bids her not to take care for a husband, but to bee of good comfort, and that farre within her time, hee would provide a place for her to lay downe her great belly; yea, so secret, as her owne heart could either wish or desire.</p>
                     <p>But if our miserable <hi>Alibius</hi> were before resolved to murther his poore harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Wife <hi>Merilla,</hi> this newes, and these speeches of <hi>Philatea,</hi> sets him all on fire; and so (having consulted with the Devill) hee vowes she shall not live: to which end, he provides himselfe of stronger poyson, and in a darke night (when as he flatters him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with hope, that the Heavens were so unjust and inhumane to conspire with him in the Murther of his Wife) he takes horse in the East Suburbe of <hi>Brescia,</hi> and so rides toward <hi>Spreare.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But see the justice, and withall the providence and mercie of our indulgent God! who vouchsafed, and yet resolved to restraine and divert him from this his bloudy enterprise, by an accident as strange as true: for a mile out of <hi>Brescia,</hi> as <hi>Alibius</hi> rides by the common place of execution, his Horse stumbles, and falls under him right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, with which fall his shoulder is out of joynt. Oh what a caveat was this for <hi>Alibius,</hi> if hee had had the least sparke of grace to have made good use hereof! But the Devill had bewitched his understanding and judgement: for hee could see by no other eyes, but by those of revenge and bloud.</p>
                     <p>Arriving at his house at <hi>Spreare,</hi> hee, contrary to his hopes, findes his daughter <hi>Emelia</hi> with her mother (who by this time was marryed likewise to a poore Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey man of <hi>Spreare)</hi> whose sight and presence was, for that time, a stop to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of her fathers poysoning designe on her mother; for hee feared that she had formerly discovered and suspected this his purpose and resolution, as indeed shee had: wherefore hee forbore to administer it, onely because hee would not lose all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, hee againe quarrells with his Wife, and after hee had reviled her with many scandalous and contumelious speeches, hee in the presence of his (mournefull) daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doth exceedingly beate her; who (weeping to see her mother weepe) infinitely grieved to be an eye-witnesse of this inhumane and barbarous cruelty of her father: And so for that time <hi>Alibius</hi> againe permitted his Wife to live: But this will prove no pardon, but onely a short reprivall for her.</p>
                     <p>Returning againe to <hi>Brescia,</hi> it is not long before <hi>Philatea</hi> doth againe importune him to provide for the concealing and salving of her shame, alleadging that her time drew on, and that it was more then time to provide her a husband. <hi>Alibius,</hi> at these her second assummons, beginnes to looke about, and resolves at what rate, or in what manner soever, now to send his Wife into another world; yet (as I thinke, or ever understood) conceales his purpose from <hi>Philatea.</hi> Miserable wretch! had he not participated more of the nature of a Tyger, then a man, or of a Devill then a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, hee would never have layd violent hands on his owne Wife, whom earth and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16653:51"/>
heaven had made flesh of his flesh, and of two bodies one; yea, or had hee had so much grace to have considered, that the silver wand he bore before the <hi>Podestate,</hi> was for the scourging and punishing of sinne: Me thinks it should have made him more charitable, and not so bloudy to attempt it. But what will not lust enterprise, and Revenge execute, if wee neither feare God with our heartes, nor love him with our soules?</p>
                     <p>Preseverance in Grace and vertue is excellent, but in sinne lamentable. <hi>Alibius</hi> hath had yeares and time enough to wipe away his cruelty towards his wife: but the longer hee lives, the deeper roote it takes in him, yea, hee will neither give the flower of his youth, nor the branne of his age to God, but that to pleasure, this to Revenge and Murther, and both to the devill: for now hee is resolute to finish this mourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and bloudy Tragedy, that hee hath so long desired, and so often attempted: and now indeed the fatall time approacheth, wherein innocent <hi>Merilla,</hi> by the Murtherous hand of her husband, must be sent out of this World to see a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alibius</hi> having waited on the <hi>Podestate</hi> to supper, takes horse, a little before the gates of the City were shut; and having his former poyson in his pocket, away hee rides to <hi>Spreare:</hi> but to act his villany with the greater secrecy, he masketh and disguiseth himselfe: approaching his house, he in the next Meddow ties up his horse to a tree, and so knockes at doore. Poore <hi>Merilla</hi> his wife was in bed and a sleepe with (a little Girle) her Grandchild, named <hi>Pomerea,</hi> the daughter of her daughter <hi>Emelia,</hi> whom, without a Candle, shee sends downe to open the doore, assuring her selfe (as indeed it proved too true for her) that it was her husband <hi>Alibius.

So <hi>Alibius</hi> mounts to his wives Chamber, and after some words gives her a potion (some say of milke) bitterly sugred with poyson, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it downe her: who poore soule is amazed hereat, and with her weake strength cryes out for helpe, but in vaine.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16653:52"/>
comes to <hi>Brescia. Alibius</hi> (like a counterfet miscreant) is all in teares, yea, hee sheweth such living affection to the memory of his dead wife, as hee sends every where to find out the Murtherer. But God will not have him escape, for in due time wee shall see him brought forth and appeare to the world in his colours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alibius,</hi> notwithstanding his teares in his eyes, having still a hell in his conscience, is afrayd, least <hi>Emelia</hi> his daughter (measuring the subsequent by the antecedent) hold him to bee her mothers Murtherer; and because the <hi>Corrigadors</hi> of <hi>Spreare</hi> (suspecting her) have taken sureties for her apparance: he, the better to insinuate with her, useth her with more then wonted courtesie and affabillity, imagining, that if her mouth were stopped, he needed not feare any others tongue: But this politike sleight of his shall not prevaile.</p>
                     <p>Now by little and little, Time, (the consumer of all things) beginnes to were away the crying rumor of this Murther: and so <hi>Alibius</hi> thinking himselfe secure, e're three moneths be fully expired, forgetting <hi>Merilla,</hi> takes <hi>Philatea</hi> to his second wife: which being knowne in <hi>Brescia,</hi> many curious heads of that City (though not upon any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall ground, but onely out of presumptive circumstances) vehemently suspect that <hi>Alibius</hi> had a deepe hand in the Murther of his late wife <hi>Merilla:</hi> but they dare not speake it alowd, because hee was well beloved both of the <hi>Podestate</hi> himselfe (for that yeere being) and generally of all the Senators.</p>
                     <p>But as Murther pierceth the Cloudes, and cryes for revenge from Heaven, so wee shall see this of <hi>Alibius,</hi> miraculously discovered, and e're long, severely punished: for when hee thought the storme past, and saw the Skies cleere, when, I say, hee imagined that all rumours and tongues were hushed up in silence, and that hee thought on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but to passe his time sweetly and voluptuously with his new and faire wife <hi>Philatea,</hi> then, when all other meanes and instruments wanted, to bring this his obscure and bloudy fact to light: Lo, by the Divine providence of God, we shall see <hi>Alibius</hi> himselfe be the cause, and instrument of his owne discovery.</p>
                     <p>For after hee had married <hi>Philatea</hi> (which I take to bee the first light of suspecting him of his wife <hi>Merilla's</hi> Murther) (if my information bee true, as I confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it is) this is the second: <hi>Alibius</hi> under the pretext of other businesse, sends for one <hi>Bernardo,</hi> of the parish of <hi>Spreare,</hi> to come to him to <hi>Brescia.</hi> Now, for our better light and information herein, as also for the more orderly contriving of this History, we must understand, that this <hi>Bernardo</hi> was an old associate and dissolute companion of <hi>Alibius:</hi> whom (as it is well knowne by those who knew them) hee had many times used and made his stickler and agent in many of his former lewde courses and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises: not that I any way thinke hee had any hand in the present Murther of <hi>Merilla:</hi> for then (I know) such is the Candour and Wisedome of the <hi>Corrigadors</hi> of <hi>Spreare,</hi> and such is the cleere judgement and zeale of the Senators of <hi>Brescia</hi> to justice, that hee had never escaped, but had beene apprehended and brought to his tryall.</p>
                     <p>Wee must farther understand, that this <hi>Bernardo</hi> was likewise a companion of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia's</hi> husband: yea, scarce any one day past, but they were knowne and seene toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in tippling houses, and other such lewd and vicious places, whereas drinke was still a most treacherous and unsecret Secretary.</p>
                     <p>It may bee that what <hi>Merilla</hi> told her husband privately, hee discovered it publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Bernardo:</hi> who comming (as wee have formerly heard) to <hi>Brescia,</hi> after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Alibius,</hi> hee fell to his old vaine of tippling and carowsing, and there without the North gate of <hi>Brescia</hi> (which lookes towards <hi>Bergamo)</hi> having more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney then wit, and more wine then money, in the middest of his cups, told hee was a Contadyne, or Countreyman of <hi>Spreare:</hi> that hee knew <hi>Alibius</hi> as great as now hee bore himselfe, and that hee Murthered his poore wife in the Countrey, to have this
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16653:52"/>
fine one in the City. Which speeches of his hee reiterated and repeated often: yea, so often, as they fell not to the ground, but some of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ewd companions tooke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof; and one amongst the rest, being inwardly acquainted with <hi>Alibius,</hi> went and secretly advertised him hereof: who (under-hand) sends away for <hi>Bernardo</hi> where hee was, and wrought so with him, as since that time he was never seene in <hi>Brescia.</hi> But this report of his remained behind him.</p>
                     <p>A second light which <hi>Alibius</hi> gave to the discovery of this his Murther, was, that thinking the way cleere, and all suspicion vanished, he converted his affection into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and his courtesie to disrespect and unkindnesse towards his daughter <hi>Emelia,</hi> by taking away the greatest part of that small meanes hee gave her towards her mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: which uncharitable and unnaturall part of his, threw this poore woman into so bitter a perplexitie, as knowing in her conscience that her father was her Mothers Murtherer, shee exceedingly apprehended and feared, lest hee would attempt to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch her likewise: the which shee farre the more doubted, because her father had bayled her, but not as yet freed her from her appearance before the <hi>Corrigadors</hi> of <hi>Spreare.</hi> But here, as simple as shee was, shee enters into many considerations with her selfe; that to accuse her father, would be as great a disobedience in her, as it was a cruelty in him to Murther her mother. She is a long time in esolute, either to advance or retire in this her purpose and enterprise: and here shee consults betwixt nature and grace, betwixt the Lawes of Earth and heaven, what shee should doe, or how she should beare her selfe in a matter of so unnaturall a nature. It grieves her to bee the meanes of her fathers death, of whom shee had received her being: and yet shee sorroweth not to reveale the murtherer of her mother, of whom shee enjoyed her life. But though sense and nature cannot, yet Reason and Religion will reconcile, and cleere these doubts: yea, evaporate those mists, and disperse these clouds from our eyes, and makes us see cleere, that Earth may not conceale Murther, sith God receives glory both in the detection and punishment thereof</p>
                     <p>Some will say, this daughter did ill to accuse her father. But who will not affirme that he did farre worse, to Murther her mother? Neither was it a delight, but a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her, to effect it: for shee enters into this resolution with teares, and perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth therein with sighes and lamentations: but if shee were at first resolute herein, this resolution of hers is exceedingly confirmed, when shee sees her father so suddainely married, and her mother in law ready to lay downe her great belly, especially when shee heare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> the reports of his suspicion bruted in <hi>Brescia.</hi> So now shee can no longer containe her selfe, but goes to the next Corrigador, and reveales him, that her father <hi>Alibius</hi> was the Murtherer of her mother <hi>Merilla.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Corrigador being a wise and grave Gentleman, wondering at this lamentable newes, retaines <hi>Emelia</hi> in his house, and writes away to the Podestate of <hi>Brescia</hi> hereof: who receives this news on a Saturday at night. The Sunday morning he acquaints the Prefect and chiefest Senators therof: who repayre to his house. The probabilities and circumstances are strong against <hi>Alibius.</hi> So they all conclude to imprison him: he is at the doore, ruffling in his garded gown and velvet cap, with his silver wand in his hand (as if hee were fitter to checke others then to be controuled himselfe:) wayting to conduct the Podestate to the <hi>Domo. Alibius</hi> little dreames how neere hee is to danger, or danger to him: hee is by an Isbiere or Serjeant called in to speake with the Pode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: and although his conscience inwardly torment him, yet hee puts a good (or at least a brazen) countenance on all, and so very cheerefully comes before him: at his first arrivall, his velvet cap and silver wand (those dignified markes of honour and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice) are taken from him, and consequently his office: (because these are rewards onely proper to vertue, and not to vice) hee is examined by those worthy Magistrates,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16653:53"/>
who beare gravity in their lookes, wisedome in their speeches, and justice in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Alibius</hi> hath many smooth words, for the defence of his crime, which with the ayd and varnish of his gracefull gesture, hee strives to extenuate and palliate, but in vaine: for hee hath to doe with those Magistrates, who cannot bee deluded, or carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, either with the sugar of a lye, or the charme of an evasion. So they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him close prisoner, where hee hath both time and leasure to thinke on the foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his fact, and the unnaturalnesse and barbarisme of his cruelty.</p>
                     <p>The Munday following, the Corrigadors of <hi>Spreare</hi> send <hi>Emelia</hi> to <hi>Brescia,</hi> where, the next day the Podestate, Prefect and Senators examine her: they first exhort her to consider, that shee speakes before God: and although <hi>Alibius</hi> bee her earthly father, yet he is her heavenly: they conjure and sweare her to speake the truth, and no more: and because they see her a simple illiterated woman, they informe her what the vertue and nature of an oath is. When <hi>Emelia</hi> falling on her knees, wringing her hands, and stedfastly looking up towards heaven, she (bitterly weeping &amp; sighing) for a pretty while, had not the power to utter a word: The Prefect with milde exhortations and speeches encourageth her to speake, when with many teares and inrerrupted sighes, she at last proffereth these words, My father hath often beaten my Mother, and even layne her for dead: and at other times, hee hath given her poyson, and hee it is and no other that hath now Murthered her. One of the Senators, (some say it was the Podestate, who as much favoured <hi>Alibius,</hi> as hated his crime:) bade <hi>Emelia</hi> looke to her conscience, and her conscience to God, and withall to consider, that as <hi>Merilla</hi> was her Mother, so <hi>Alibius</hi> was her Father. Whereat shee bitterly weeping, againe said, that what she had already spoken was true, as shee hoped to injoy any part of heaven. So they binding her to give evidence at the great Court of the Province, which some foure moneths after was to be held in the Castle of their Citie, they dismisse her.</p>
                     <p>In which meane time <hi>Alibius</hi> is visited in prison by divers of his acquaintance: yea, some of the chiefest Senators themselves afford him that honour and charity, they deale with him about his crime: but in vaine, for hee takes heaven and earth to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that hee is innocent, yea, hee seemes to bee so religious and conscionable in his speeches, as hee drew many of inferiour ranke and understanding to beleeve, that his accusation was not true, and his imprisonment unjust and false. But God will shortly unmaske his hypocrisie, and to his shame and confusion, lay open and discover to the whole World, his unnaturall and bloudy cruelty.</p>
                     <p>And now the time is come, that the Duke and Seigniory of <hi>Venice</hi> are used to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and send forth Criminall Iudges, to descend and passe thorow the provinces of their territories and dominions: to sit upon all capitall malefactors, and to punish them according to their deserts. A custome indeed held famous, not onely in the Christian, but in the whole universall world: and whereby the <hi>Venetian</hi> Sate doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly receive both glory, vigour, and life, sith it not onely preserveth their peace, and propagateth their tranquillity; but also rooteth out and exterminateth all those that (by their lewd and dissolute actions) seeke to impugne and infringe it.</p>
                     <p>Thus these high and Honourable Iudges (being in number two for every division) having dispatcht their businesse (or rather that of the Seigniories) in <hi>Padua, Vincensa, Virona</hi> and <hi>Bergamo,</hi> are now arrived in <hi>Brescia,</hi> in the Castle whereof, (which is both beautifull and conspicuous to the eye) they keepe their <hi>Forum</hi> and Tribunall. And because this Citie is exempted from the Province, as being particularly indowed with a peculiar jurisdiction, and honoured with many honourable priviledges and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives: therefore <hi>(Merilla</hi> being Murthered in the Province) <hi>Alibius</hi> is fetched out of his first prison, and by one of the chiefest and gravest Senators deputed for that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16653:53"/>
purpose by the Podestate, and Senate, conducted and conveyed to the Castle, there to bee arraigned by those two great Iudges: and although this aforesaid Senator was so wise and religious, as hee seemed to have the art of perswasion in his speeches: yet by the way, using his best oratory and charity to draw <hi>Alibius</hi> from denyall, to confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and from that to contrition and repentance, his heart was still so perverse and obdurate, as hee notwithstanding persevered in his willfull obstinacy, and peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued and stood upon the points of his innocency, and justification. So strong was the Divell yet with him:</p>
                     <p>But whiles an infinite number of spectators gaze on <hi>Alibius</hi> as hee is in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle: and hee cheerefully and carelesly conversed with some of his acquaintance, as if the innocency of his conscience were such, as his heart felt no griefe nor preturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Lo, he is called to his arraignement, whereunto that World of people, who were then in the Castle, flocke and concurre.</p>
                     <p>His thoughts are so vaine, and his vanity so ambitious, as hee comes to the barre in a blacke beaten Satin sute, with a faire Gowne, and a spruce set Ruffe, having both the haire of his head and his long gray beard neately kombed and cut, yea, with so pleasant a look, and so confident a demeanour, as if he were to receive, not the sentence of his guiltinesse and death, but that of his innocency and inlargement. These honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Iudges cause his Inditement to bee read, wherein his poysoning and Murthering of his wife, is branched and depainted out in all its circumstances, whereat his courage and confidence is yet (notwithstanding) so great, as by his lookes hee seemes no way moved, much lesse astonished or afflicted: the witnesses are produced: first, his owne daughter <hi>Emelia,</hi> who with teares in her eyes stands firme to her former disposition, that hee had often beaten her Mother almost to death, and now had killed and poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her; agreeing in every point with her disposition given to the Podestate and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>Brescia:</hi> which to refell, her father <hi>Alibius,</hi> with many plausible and sugred speeches, tells his Iudges, that his daughter is incensed or lunatike; or else that shee purposely seekes his life, to enjoy that small meanes hee hath after his death, and so runnes on in a most extravagant and impertinent apologie for himselfe, with many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective and scandalous speeches against her, and concludes, that hee was never owner of any poyson.</p>
                     <p>His Iudges, out of their honourable inclination, and zeale to sacred justice, permit him to speake without interruption: when having ended, they beginne to shew him the foulenesse of his fact: yea, like heavenly Orators, they paint him out the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villish nature &amp; monstrous crime of Murther: the which they say he redoubleth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it, not withstanding that they have evidence as cleere as the Sun to convince him thereof: and so they call for two Apothecaries boyes, who severally affirme, they sold him Rattes-bane at two severall times.</p>
                     <p>But the divell is still so strong with <hi>Alibius,</hi> as though his conscience doth hereat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and torment him: yet, there is no change nor signe thereof, either seene in his countenance, or discerned in his speeches, but still hee persevers in his obstinacy; and in a bravery pretends to wipe off the Apothecaries boyes evidence with this poore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion, that hee bought and used it onely to poyson Rattes: And so againe with many smooth words, humble crouches, and hypocriticall complements, hee useth the prime of his subtilty and invention to make it appeare to his Iudges, that he had no way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued his hands in the bloud of his wife: But this will not availe him, for hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Lynce-eyed Iudges, whose integrity and wisedome can pierce thorow the fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy mists of excuses, and the obscure Clouds of his far-fetched shifts, and cunningly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compacted evasions.</p>
                     <p>And now to close and winde up this History, after the Iury impannelled had am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16653:54"/>
heard, aswell the witnesses against <hi>Alibius,</hi> as his defence for himselfe: and that all the world could testifie that his Iudges gave him a faire triall, they return and report him guilty of Murthering his wife <hi>Merilla;</hi> whereat hee is put off the barre, and so for that time sent backe to his prison: and yet the heate of his obstinacy being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at no way cooled, the edge of his deny all any way rebated, nor the obduratenesse of his heart, the least thing mollified: hee, by the way as hee passeth, beating his brest, and sometimes out-spreading his armes, saith, it is not his crime, but the malice of his Devillish daughter that hath cast him away: yea, although many of his compassionate and Christian friends doe now now againe in prison worke and perswade him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, by aleadging him, that God is as mercifull to the repentant, as severe to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and obstinate, yet, all this will not prevaile.</p>
                     <p>The second morne after his conviction, hee is brought againe from his prison, to the Castle, and so to the barre, to receive his Iudgement, where one of the two most honourable Iudges shew him:</p>
                     <p>That it is his hearkning to the Devill, and his forsaking of God, that hath brought him to this misery; paints and points him out his dissolute life, his frequenting of bad company, his prodigality and adultery: but above all, his masked hypocrisie, which hee saith, in thinking to deceive God, hath now deceived himselfe: yea, in heavenly and religious speeches, informes him how mercifull and indulgent God is to repentant sinners: that hee must now cast off his thoughts from earth, and ascend and mount them to heaven, and no longer to think of his body, but of his soule; and so after a learned and Christian-like speech, as well for the instruction of the living as the consolation of <hi>Alibius,</hi> who was now to prepare himselfe to dye: hee pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, that for his execrable Murther committed on his owne wife <hi>Merilla,</hi> hee should hang till hee were dead: and so besought the Lord to bee mercifull to his soule.</p>
                     <p>And now is <hi>Alibius</hi> againe returned to his prison, but still remaineth obstinate and perverse, affirming to all the World. that as hee hath lived, so hee will dye innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But God will not suffer him to dye, without confessing and repenting this his bloudy and unnaturall Murther.</p>
                     <p>These his grave and religious Iudges, out of an honourable and Christian charity, send him Divines, to prepare his body to the death of this world, and his soule to the life of that to come: they deale most effectually, powerfully and religiously with him in prison: and although they found, that the devill had strongly insnared and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, yea, and as it were, hardned his heart to his perdition: yet God, out of his infinit and ineffable mercies, addeth both power and grace to their speeches, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, so as his eyes being opened, and his heart pierced and mollified: they at last so prevaile with him, that being terrified with Gods justice, and incouraged and comforted with his mercies: he with teares, sighs and groanes confesseth this murther of his wife, and not onely bitterly repents it, but also doth thank these Godly Divines, for their charity, care, and zeale for the preservation and saving of his soule, and doth upon his knees beseech them to pray unto the Lord to forgive him.</p>
                     <p>Wee have seene <hi>Alibius</hi> Murther his wife <hi>Merilla:</hi> wee have seene his apprehension, imprisonment, triall, conviction, and condemnation, for this his execrable and bloudy fact: wherein wee may observe how the justice of God still triumpheth o're the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and malice of the Devill, and how Murther, though never so secretly acted, and concealed, will at last be detected and punished. What resteth there now, but that after wee have hereby made good use of this example, wee see <hi>Alibius</hi> fetched from his prison, and conveyed to the place of execution: (whereat (as wee have heard) hee formerly stumbled in jest, but must now in earnest) where, although it were timely in the morn, (as having the favour to dye alone, and at least three houres before the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16653:54"/>
other condemned malefactors) an infinite number of the Citizens of <hi>Brescia,</hi> (of all rankes and of both sexes) assembled to see <hi>Alibius</hi> take his last farewell of this World.</p>
                     <p>At his ascending up the ladder, his faire gray beard and comely presence drew pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the hearts, and teares from the eyes of the greatest part of the spectators, to see that the Devill had so strongly inchanted and seduced him to lay violent hands on his wife, and to see so grave and so proper an aged man thus misfortunately and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely cast away.</p>
                     <p>His speech at his end was briefe and short; onely hee freely confest his crime, and with infinite sighes and teares besought the world to pray for his soule: hee lamented the Vanity of his youth, and the dissolutenesse of his age: told them, that his neglect of prayer to God, and his too much confidence in the devill, had brought him to this shamefull end; and therefore besought them againe and againe to beware by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and so having solemnely freed his second wife <hi>Philatea</hi> from being any way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted or accessary with the murther of his first wife <hi>Merilla:</hi> he recommending his soule into the hands of his Redeemer, dyed as penitently as hee had lived dissolutely and prophanely.</p>
                     <p>And thus was the life and death of <hi>Alibius:</hi> the which I was the more willingly induced to publish, partly, because I was an eye-witnesse, both of his arraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and death, (as I returned from my travells,) but more especially, in hope that his example and Historie may prove to bee as great a consolation to the Godly, as a terrour to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vt of a resolution, whether more bold or zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, I know not, I have adventured this second Booke of my <hi>Tragicall Histories</hi> to the World, under your Honours Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and protection: Neither neede I goe farre to yeeld either your Honour, or the World, a reason of this my <hi>Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> sith your Uertues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobling your Bloud, as much as your <hi>Nobility</hi> illustrates your Vertues, was the first motive which drew me hereunto: for whiles many others indeavour to bee great, your Honour (resembling your selfe) not onely indeavours, but strives to bee good; as well knowing that <hi>Goodnesse</hi> is the glory and essence, yea the life, and as I may say, the soule of <hi>Greatnesse;</hi> and that betwixt <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> and <hi>Goodnesse</hi> there is this difference and disparitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that, makes us famous, this, immortall; that, beloved of men, this, of <hi>God;</hi> that, accompanyeth us only to our Graves, and this, to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> My second prevayling Motive in this my <hi>Dedication</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:16653:57"/>
proceeded from the respect of my particular duety, (as my first was solely derived from the consideration of your owne generall and generous Uertues) for having the honour to retaine to your <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Brother, Sir <hi>Edward Sackvile</hi> Knight, to whom, for many singular respects, and (immerited) favours (whiles I am my selfe) Iowe not onely my service, but my selfe; I therein hold me obliged and bound to proffer and impart this part of my Labours to your Honour, as the first publike testimony of my zeale and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, eternally devoted and consecrated to the <hi>Illustrious</hi> Name and Family of the <hi>Sackeviles;</hi> whereof <hi>Gods</hi> Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath made your Honour chiefe Heire and Pillar. The drift and scope of these Histories are to informe the World how <hi>Gods Revenge still fights and triumphs against the crying and execrable sinne of (wilfull and premeditated) Murther,</hi> which in these our (impure and profane) times, is so fatally and frequently coincident to unregenerate <hi>Christians;</hi> which Scarlet and bloody Crime is infallibly met with, and rewarded by <hi>Gods</hi> sharpe and severe punishments; having purposely published and divulged them to my deare Countrey of <hi>England,</hi> that they may serve (though not by the way of comparison, yet of application) as the sight of <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi> bloudy Robe (shewed by <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> to the <hi>Romanes</hi> in <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> when hee there pronounced his funerall <hi>Oration)</hi> thereby to make his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Murtherers in the greater horrour and execration with the people. The <hi>Histories</hi> of themselves are as different, as their effects and accidents: their Scenes being wilfully and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laid in diuers parts of <hi>Christendome</hi> beyond the seas, and the Tragedies vnfortunately perpetrated and personated by those, who more adhering to impiety, then <hi>Grace,</hi> and to Satan, then <hi>God,</hi> made shipwracke, if not of their soules with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I am sure of their liues with their fortunes, and of their fortunes with their lives. They themselves (or rather their sinnes) first brought the Materials, I, onely the collection, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16653:57"/>
and pollishing of these their deplorable <hi>Histories,</hi> which are penned in so low a sphaere of speech, and so inelegant a phrase, as they can no way merit the <hi>Honour</hi> of your perusall, much lesse of your iudgement, and least of all, of your Noble protection and Patronage.</p>
                  <p>Howsoever, my hopes (led and marshalled by the premises) doe as it were flatter mee, that your perfections will winke at my imperfections, and your curiosity at my ignorance and presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in daigning permit this my rude Pamphlet, to salute and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage the World, under the authenticall passe-port of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours favour; who of her selfe is composed of so poore metall (or rather drosse) as without the pure gold of your Honourable Name, it would runne a hazard, not to passe currant with the curious wits, and censures of this our (too curious and too censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious) age; whereof could I rest assured, I should then not onely rejoyce, but triumph in this my happinesse, as so richly exceeding the proportion of my poore Labours and merits, that I could not aspire to a greater honour, nor desire a sweeter felicity: And so recommending this my imperfect Pamphlet to your favour, my unworthy selfe to your pardon, and your <hi>Honour,</hi> your <hi>Noble Countesse,</hi> and the sweet young <hi>Lady</hi> your <hi>Daughter,</hi> to <hi>Gods</hi> best favours and mercies, I will assume the confidence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie to remaine</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here Lust takes up our desires, and Revenge and Murther sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth on our resolutions, it is the true way to make us wretched in this life, and our soules miserable in that to come: for if Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity and Charity (the two precious Vertues and ornaments of a Christian) steere not our actions on Earth, how shall (nay, how can) we hope to arrive to the harbour of Heaven? or if wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band on these celestiall Vertues, to follow and imbrace those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall Vices, what doe wee but take our selves from felicity to misery, and consequently give our selves from God to Satan? But did wee seriously (and not trivially) consider that there is a Heaven to reward the Righteous, and a hell to punish the ungodly, wee would neither defile our hearts, nor pollute our soules with the thought, much lesse with the action of such beastly and inhumane crimes: but in this sinnefull age of ours, the number is but too great of lascivious and impious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who delight in the affection and practice thereof: among whom I here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the History of an execrable Gentlewoman, and her wretched and unfortunate Lover, who were both borne to honour, and not to infamy: had they had as much grace to secure their lives, as vanity and impiety to ruine them. The History is blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and therefore mournefull: but if we detest their crimes, we need not feare their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments: for God is as gracious and propitious to protect the innocent, as just and severe to chastise the guilty.</p>
                     <p>IN <hi>Italy,</hi> the beauty of <hi>Europe,</hi> and in the City of <hi>Venice</hi> (the glory of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Nymph of the Sea, and the pearle and diamond of the world) in the latter yeares of the raigne of noble <hi>Leonardo Donato,</hi> who, as Duke, sate to the helme of that potent and powerfull Estate) so famous for banishing the Iesuits, and for opposing himself against the intrusion and fulminations of Pope <hi>Paulus Quintus,</hi> in the just defence and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the prerogatives and priviledges of the <hi>Seignory)</hi> There was at that time a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16653:60"/>
a younger brother, yet of well neere fifty yeares old, of the noble Fa mily of the <hi>Beraldi,</hi> named <hi>Signior Iacomo Beraldi,</hi> who dwelt above the <hi>Rialto</hi> Bridge (that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Master piece of Architecture) upon the <hi>Canalla Grando,</hi> who in the <hi>Aprill</hi> of his youth tooke to Wife the <hi>Dona Lucia,</hi> daughter to <hi>Seignior Lorenzo Bursso,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Padua,</hi> by whom hee had seven Children, foure Sonnes, and three Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; so as his Wife and he esteeming themselves happy in their Issue, past away their time in much content and felicity: but God (for some secret and sacred reasons to his Divine Majesty best knowne) converting his smiles into frownes, within the space of seven yeares, takes away sixe of their Children, so as their eldest daughter onely remained living, being a young Gentlewoman of some eighteene yeares old; named <hi>Dona Victoryna.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This young Gentlewoman, being noble, rich, and faire (three powerfull and attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Adamants to draw the affections of many Cavaliers) according to her desert, had divers Gallants who sought her in Marriage: but she was of nature proud, chollericke, disdainfull, and malicious; Vices enow to ruine both a beauty and a fortune: but of all her sutors and servants, he whom she best loved and affected, was one <hi>Seignior Sypontus,</hi> a Gentleman of the City, who was more noble then rich, and yet more debosht and vicious then noble; but otherwise a very proper young Gallant: but the perfections of the body are nothing to bee compared to the excellent qualities and indowments of the minde, for those are but the varnishes and shaddowes of a meete men, but these the perfections and excellencies of a wise man, and therein noble; sith indeed wisedome is one of the truest degrees, and most essentiall parts of Nobility. Now if <hi>Victoryna</hi> love <hi>Sypontus,</hi> with no lesse reciprocall flame and zeale doth <hi>Sypontus</hi> affect <hi>Victoryna:</hi> for as his eyes behold the delicacie of her personage, and the sweetnesse of her beauty; so his heart loves either, and adores both: yea, so deep an impression hath she ingraven in his thoughts and contemplations, that he is never merry till he see her, nor pleased till he injoy the felicity of her company; which <hi>Victorina</hi> rejoyceth to see, and observes with infinite content and delectation. <hi>Sypontus</hi> thus intangled in the snares of <hi>Victorina's</hi> beauty, and she likewise in those of his perfections, he resolves to court her, and seeke her in Marriage, which he performes with much affection, zeale, and constancie, leaving no industry, care, curiosity, or cost unattempted, to inrich and crowne his desires with the precious and inestimable treasures of her love. I should make this short discourse swell into an ample History, to particularize, or punctually relate the Letters, Sonnets, Presents, Meetings, Dancings, Musicke, and Banquets, which past twixt these two Lovers, and wherewith <hi>Sypontus</hi> entertained his deare Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse <hi>Victoryna:</hi> I will therfore purposely omit it, and cover my selfe with this excuse, which may satisfy my Reader, to consider that <hi>Sypontus</hi> (as before) was an <hi>Italian,</hi> whose custome and nature rather exceede, then come short, in all amorous ceremonies and complements: And therefore againe to resume my History, I must briefely declare, that after the protraction and recesse of a yeares time <hi>Victorina</hi> consenteth to <hi>Sypontus,</hi> to bee his Wife, so farre forth as hee can obtaine those of her father and mother: a fit and vertuous answer of a daughter, wherein I know not whether she bewray more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and discretion in her selfe, or respect and obedience to her parents.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sypontus</hi> infinitely pleased with this sweet newes and delightfull melody, is as it were ravished and rapt up into heaven wirh joy, when flattering himselfe with this poore hope, that as <hi>Victoryna</hi> was curteous, so he should finde her parents kinde to him; hee, with much respect and honour, repaires to <hi>Beraldi</hi> and <hi>Lucia,</hi> and in faire and discreet termes acquaints them with his long affection to their daughter <hi>Victoryna;</hi> whom (with as much earnestnesse as humility) hee prayes to bestow her on him for his wife: but this old Couple are as much displeased at <hi>Sypontus</hi> his motion, as their Daughter
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16653:60"/>
                        <hi>Victoryna</hi> rejoyceth thereat, and so they returne him their denyall in stead of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; only in generall termes they thanke him for his love and honour, and certifie him that they have otherwise disposed of their daughter. <hi>Sypontus</hi> bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>es the lip, and <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi> hangs her head at this their bitter and distastfull answer: but hee is too generous and amorous to bee put off with this first repulse. Whereupn he imployes his Parents and kinsfolkes (whereof some were of the chiefest ranke of <hi>Senatours</hi> and <hi>Magnifico's)</hi> to draw <hi>Beraldi</hi> and <hi>Lucia</hi> to consent to this Match; but in vaine: for they are deafe to those requests, and resolute in their denyall, grounding their refusall upon <hi>Sypontus</hi> his poverty: for they see he is become poore; because in the last trans-marine Warres, the <hi>Turkes</hi> tooke from his father and himselfe most of his Lands and Possessions neere <hi>Scuttari</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia:</hi> and therefore they resolve to provide a richer husband for their Daughter. The iniquity of our times are as strange as lamentable: for in matters of Marriage, parents, without due regard either to the natures or affections of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, still preferre gold before grace, and many times Riches before Vertue and Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which concurre and meet in one personage: but diverse of these Marriages, in the end, finde either shame, misery, or repentance, and sometimes all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sypontus</hi> stormes as much as <hi>Victoryna</hi> grieves at his refusall: but to frustrate that, and provide for this, <hi>Beraldi</hi> deales with <hi>Seignior Iovan Baptista Souranza</hi> to marry his daughter <hi>Victorina,</hi> who is a Gentleman of a good house, but farre richer then <hi>Sypon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi> but withall farre different in age: for <hi>Sypontus</hi> is but twenty eight yeares old, and <hi>Souranza</hi> neere threescore. So as gold playing the chiefest part in this contract, <hi>Souran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> is sure of <hi>Victoryna</hi> for his wife, ere he know her, or hardly hath seene her. <hi>Beraldi</hi> advertizeth his daughter of his will and pleasure herein: so <hi>Souranza</hi> sees her with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and joy, and she him with disdaine and griefe: and thus this old Lover the first time entertaines his young Mistresse with kisses, and she him with teares. He is no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner departed, but <hi>Victorina</hi> very sorrowfully and pensively throwes her selfe to her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I must crave leave of modesty, to averre that she findes little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence twixt a Mayd and a Wife, so as her lust out-braving her chastity, and sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality trampling her vertues and honour under foote, whereas her affection should looke from <hi>Sypontus</hi> to <hi>Souranza,</hi> both she and it contrariwise looke from <hi>Souranza</hi> to <hi>Sypontus.</hi> Dissembling pleasures, which strangle when they seeme to imbrace and kisse us, bitter Pills candide in Sugar, Cordialls to the sence, but Corrosives to the soule!

                     <p>And is it possible, that I must now lose my life through <hi>Victoryna</hi> her folly and treachery, into whose hands I repos'd both my secrets and it? Have I done what I have done for her her sake, and is this the requitall she gives me? And sith there is no other witnesse, must mine owne Letter bee produced in justice against mee? What will I not doe? what have I not done for her sake? Woe is me, that I should live to be rewarded with this monstrous and inhumane ingratitude; when for sorrow and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not able to containe himselfe, hee takes Pen and Paper, and writes <hi>Victoryna</hi> this ensuing Letter.</p>

No: No. For the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell yet holds his thoughts so fast captivated and intangled in the snares of <hi>Victoryna's</hi> beauty, as hee hath not yet the grace to looke from his crime, to his repentance; nor consequently from Earth to Heaven: but like a prophane <hi>Libertine</hi> and unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate person, being within a small point of time neere his end, hee yet thinkes not of his soule, nor of God, but onely dallies away the remainder of his houres, in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable contemplation of his fond affection and beastly sensuality.</p>
                     <p>By this time <hi>Victoryna</hi> hath receiv'd his Letter; at the newes and reading where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, such is the passion of her frenzy, which shee (though unjustly) tearmes love: that shee is all in teares, sighes, and lamentable exclamations: she knowes it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any other of the world to bee the revealer of <hi>Sypontus</hi> his Letter, but onely her Mayd <hi>Felicia,</hi> whom in her uncharitable Revenge, shee curseth to the pit of hell: but that which addes a greater torment to her torments, and a more sensible degree of affliction to her miserable sorrowes, is, to see that her <hi>Sypontus</hi> (whom by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees she loves far dearer then her life) finisterly snspecteth her fidelity towards him: yea so farre, as hee not onely calls her affection but her treachery in question: and this indeed seemes to drowne her in her teares. But yet notwithstanding so fervent is her love towards him, as the feare of his death drawes her to a resolution of her owne: so if <hi>Sypontus</hi> dye, shee vowes shee will bee her owne accuser, and so not live, but dye with him. Strange effects of love, or rather of folly, sith love being irregular, and taking false objects, (in its true character) is not love, but folly: to which end, calling for inke and paper, she bitterly weeping, indites and sends him these few lines, in answer of his.</p>

                        <hi>Sypontus,</hi> in the middest of his perplexities and sorrowes, receives this Letter from <hi>Victoryna,</hi> the sweetnesse of whose affection and constancy, much revives his joy, and comforteth him. For now her innocency defaceth his suspicion of her ingratitude and treachery: and withall hee plainely sees, and truly beleeves, that it was <hi>Felicia,</hi> not <hi>Victoryna,</hi> who brought this Letter to Light. But when hee descends to the latter part of her Letter, and finds her resolution to dye with him, then hee condemnes his former errour in taxing her, and in requitall, loves her so tenderly and dearely, that he vowes hee will bee so farre from accusing her, as accessary of her husbands Murther, as both the Racke, and his death shall cleare and proclaime her innocency. Had the ground of these servent and reciprocall affections of <hi>Victoryna</hi> and <hi>Sypontus,</hi> beene laid in vertue, as they were in vice; or in chastly, and not in lust and adultery, they would have given cause to the whole world, as justly to prayse, as now to dispraise them, and then to have beene as ambitious of their imitation, as now of their contempt and detestation.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Sypontus</hi> (as before) having fully and definitively resolved not to accuse, but to cleare <hi>Victoryna</hi> of this Murther, as also that hee would dye alone, and leave her youth and beauty to the injoying of many more earthly pleasures: hee expecting hourely to bee sent for before his Iudges, to sit upon his torment or death, thinking himselfe bound both in affection and honour, to signifie <hi>Victoryna</hi> his pleasure herein, he craves his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Iovan Baptista Souranza:</hi> but withall protesteth constantly that <hi>Victoryna</hi> is innocent, and no way accessary hereunto. The Iudges rejoyce at <hi>Sypontus</hi> his confession, as much as they grieve at the foulenesse of his fact: and so, although they were also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to hang him, yet considering hee was a <hi>Venecian</hi> Gentleman, (and consequently had a great voyce in the great Counsell of the <hi>Seigniory)</hi> they adjudge him the next day to lose his head, betwixt the two Columes at Saint <hi>Markes Place,</hi> and so for that night send him backe to his prison, to prepare himselfe to dye. <hi>Sypontus</hi> is no sooner departed from them, but they consult on <hi>Victoryna,</hi> whether shee were guilty, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of her husband <hi>Souranza's</hi> Murther, but they differ in opinion: some would likewise have her Racked: but others of them more advised and modest, reply that <hi>Sypontus</hi> his Letter intimated onely his affection to <hi>Victoryna,</hi> but no way her malice to her dead husband <hi>Souranza,</hi> nor that shee was any way guilty or accessary to his Murther: so they resolve to forbeare her, and not to put her to the torment, except <hi>Sypontus</hi> accuse her at his execution. Now the very night that hee was to die the next morne, hee infinitely desires his Iaylor to permit him to conferre with <hi>Victoryna,</hi> and to take his last leave of her, which is denyed him, as having received command from authority to the contrary; whereat extreamely grieving, hee is called away by some Divines, whom the charity of that grave Senate send him, to prepare and direct his soule, in her passage and transmigration to Heaven. So passing the night in teares and prayers for the foulenesse of his crime, the morne being come, and nine of the clock strucken, hee is brought to the scaffold, where a world of people concurre and flock from all parts of the City, to see this wretched and unfortunate Gentleman act the last Sceane and part of his life upon this infamous <hi>Theater.</hi> Heere <hi>Sypontus</hi> freely confesseth his foule Murther of <hi>Souranza,</hi> but is yet so vaine and wretched, as hee takes it to his death, that <hi>Victoryna</hi> is absolutely innocent hereof: hee seemes to bee very repentant and sorrowfull for all his sinnes in generall, and for this Murther in particular.</p>
                     <p>For expiation and reward hereof, his head is severed from his body: a just recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and punishment for so vicious and bloudy a Gentleman, who adhering to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery more then chastity, to revenge then charity, and to the devill then God, forgot himselfe so farre, as to commit this execrable and lamentable Murther.</p>
                     <p>Now, the order and <hi>Decorum</hi> of our History, leades us from dead <hi>Sypontus,</hi> to living <hi>Victoryna,</hi> who, I know not whether more grieve at his death, or rejoyce, that on the Racke and scaffold hee hath acquitted her of her husbands Murther. In a word, it is remarkeable to behold the vanity and inconstancy of this female Monster: for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her vowes, and repugnant to her Letters and teares, <hi>Sypontus</hi> is no sooner dead, but her affection towards him dyes with him: yea, his bloud is scarce fo soone cold, as her zeale and friendship: for shee now holds it a pure folly to cast away her youth and life, if shee may preserve the one, and save the other; and therefore resolves to try her best art and wit, to make her innocencie passe currant with her Iudges: yea, so desirous and ambitious is shee to live, as her female heart hath drawne on this mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line fortitude and generosity, that if occasion present, shee will constantly both out-dare and out-brave the torments of the Racke, thereby to prevent her death.</p>
                     <p>Some three daies after <hi>Sypontus</hi> was executed, the Iudges againe sit and consult on <hi>Victoryna,</hi> but finding no evidence nor witnesse to accuse her, they at first are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to discharge and free her: onely they deeme it requisite to terrifie, but not to torment her with the Racke, before they give her her liberty: whereunto they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. So they send for her, and threaten her with the Racke: but shee vowes, that all the torments of the world shall never inforce her to confesse an untruth, and that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16653:65"/>
shee never had the least suspicion that <hi>Sypontus</hi> was guilty of this execrable Murther of her husband: her Iudges will not yet beleeve her; so they cause her to be carryed to the Racke: whereunto shee very cheerefully and patiently permits her selfe to bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened, bidding the Executioner doe his worst: which constancie of hers, her Iudges seeing and hearing, they, in pitty and commiseration, as well of her youth and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to her descent, and the teares and prayers of venerable old <hi>Beraldi</hi> her father, cause her to bee loosed, and so in open Court acquit and discharge her.</p>
                     <p>Here wee see this wretched <hi>Courtizans Victoryna</hi> acquitted of her Iudges for her husbands Murther, so as triumphing more in her good fortune, then her innocencie, shee now thinkes the storme of her punishment past and ore-blowne, and that no fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

In the meane time wee shall see this Monster, and disgrace of her sexe, make such bad use of her former danger, as shee will againe adde bloud to bloud, and Murther to Murther; but God will reserve not onely the rod of his wrath for her correction, but the full viols of his indignation for her confusion; as the sequell will shew thee.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16653:66"/>
that he shall die, ere shee will live to bee thus contemned and abused of him: yea, her hot love to him is so soone growne cold, and her servent affection already so frozen, that now shee thinkes on nothing else but how to be revenged, and to be rid of him; and is so impious and gracelesse, as she cares not how, nor in what manner soever shee send him from this world to another: for the devill hath drawne a resolution from her, or rather she from the devill, that here he shall not much longer live. Good God! what an impious and wretched fury of hell will <hi>Victoryna</hi> proove her selfe here on Earth? for the blood and life of one husband cannot quench the thirst of her lust and revenge, but shee must and will imbrue her hands in that of two: as if it were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for her to trot, but that shee will needs gallop and ride post to hell. O what pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is it to see a Lady so wretched and execrable! O what an execrable wretchednesse is it, to see a Lady so inhumane, and so devoyd of pitie! But the devill is strong with her, because her faith is weake with God: therefore she will advance, shee will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in this her bloody designe and resolution. Wherefore wee shall shortly see <hi>Fassino</hi> his adulterie punished with death, by his wife <hi>Victoryna's</hi> revenge; and this murther of hers justy rewarded and revenged with the punishment of her owne: the bloodyer our actions are, the severer Gods judgements, and the sharper his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge will bee.</p>
                     <p>Of all sorts and degrees of inhumane and violent deaths, this wretched Lady <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryna</hi> thinks poyson the surest, and yet the most secret to dispatch her husband. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention came immediately from the devill, and is onely practised by his members: of which number shee will desperately and damnably make herselfe one: her lust and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, like miserable Advocates, and fatall Orators, perswade her to this execrable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, wherein by cutting off her husbands life, she shall find that shee likewise casts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her owne. So neither Grace nor Nature prevailing, shee sends for an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> named <hi>Augustino;</hi> and when she hath conjured, and he promised his secrecie, shee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints him, that her new husband <hi>Fassino</hi> keeps Courtisans to her nose, and daily and hourely offereth her many other insupportable abuses and disgraces; in requitall and revenge whereof she is resolved to poyson him, and prayes him to undertake and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, and that she will reward him with three hundred <hi>Zekynes</hi> for his labour.</p>
                     <p>Of all professions and faculties, there are good and bad: <hi>Augustino</hi> loves God too wel, herein to obey the devil: he hath too much grace, to be so impious and gracelesse, and vowes, that he will not buy gold at so deare a rate, as the price of blood; so as a good Christian, and true child of God, he not onely refuseth <hi>Victoryna's</hi> motion and proffer, but in religious termes seeks to divert and perswade her from this her bloody attempt. But she is resolute in her malice, and wilfull in her revenge, and therfore will performe it her selfe, sith this <hi>Augustino</hi> will not: so (by a second hand) she procures poyson from a strange <hi>Empericke,</hi> whereof the Citie of <hi>Venice,</hi> more then other of <hi>Italy,</hi> aboundeth: so she onely waits for an opportunitie, which very shortly, though, alas, too too soone, presents it selfe; the manner thus:</p>
                     <p>It is impossible that <hi>Fassino</hi> his dissolute life, and extreme deboshing can keepe him long from sicknesse; for this punishment is alwayes incident and hereditary to that sinne. Hee complaines thereof to his wife <hi>Victoryna,</hi> who receives this newes rather with gladnesse, then commiseration and pitie: and so taking his bed, hee prayes her to make him some comfortable hot broath for his stomack: which newes she heares, and imbraceth inwardly with joy, outwardly with disdaine. For albeit shee layes hold of this opportunitie to poyson him, yet she dissembles her malice; and the better to colour her villany, because she knowes it the smoother and shorter way to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in poysoning him, shee will not make the broath herselfe, but commands her maid <hi>Felicia</hi> to doe it, (of whom wee have formerly spoken, in the discovery of <hi>Sypontus</hi> his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16653:66"/>
Letter to her Vnkle <hi>Hieronymo Souranza:)</hi> which treacherous office of hers, our malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and devillish <hi>Victoryna</hi> her Lady and Mistresse, hath now a plot in her head, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite with an execrable and hellish recompence: for whiles <hi>Felicia</hi> is boyling of the broath, her Lady <hi>Victoryna</hi> trips to her chamber and closet, and fetcheth out the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, inveloped in a paper, whereof shee takes two parts and brings downe with her, and whiles she had purposely sent <hi>Felicia</hi> from the fire, shee runnes and throwes it into the broath, which for the present no whit altered the colour thereof: so <hi>Fassino</hi> calling for it, this poore innocent Gentlewoman <hi>Felicia,</hi> (not suspecting or dreaming of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) gives it him, which (as ignorant thereof) hee sups up; and this was about nine or ten of the clocke in the morning.</p>
                     <p>Now whiles <hi>Felicia</hi> is acting this mournfull Tragedie in <hi>Fassino</hi> his chamber, her Lady <hi>Victoryna</hi> is acting another in hers; for shee takes the other third part of the poyson, and secretly opening <hi>Felicia's</hi> trunke, puts it into a painted boxe which shee found therein, and so lockes it againe, hoping (though indeed with a wretched and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish hope) that her hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

See, see, the devillish double malice of this wretched Ladie <hi>Victoryna,</hi> as well to her husband <hi>Fassino,</hi> as her mayd <hi>Felicia!</hi> But as finely as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill hath taught her to spinne the thread of this her malice and revenge, yet though her plot have taken effect and hold of her husband, neverthelesse shee shall in the end fayle of hers to innocent <hi>Felicia:</hi> in the <hi>interim,</hi> though to the eyes of the world it seeme at first to succeed according to her desires by the bye, yet it shall not in the maine: but that murther, and this treason of <hi>Victoryna</hi> shall not goe long either unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, or unpunished.</p>
                     <p>This poyson working in <hi>Fassino</hi> his stomacke and body, begins by degrees to cut off his vitall spirits, so as his strength failes him, his red cheekes already looke pale and earthly, and his body infinitely swels: he cals for his wife <hi>Victoryna,</hi> who with all haste and expedition tells her secretly, that hee feares, <hi>Felicia</hi> hath poysoned him with the broath she gave him in the morning; and so requesteth her to send for his Parents and friends to bee present at his death, for live hee could not. <hi>Victoryna,</hi> like a dissembling shee-devill, teares her hayre for anger, and for meere sorrow seemes to drowne her selfe in her teares at this newes, kisseth and fawnes on her husband, and in all possible haste sends away of all sides for his kinsefolkes and friends, who hastily repayre thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and finde <hi>Fassino</hi> almost dead: so they, with teares, inquire his sicknesse; when with open voyce his wife <hi>Victoryna</hi> cries out, that her wretched mayd <hi>Felicia</hi> had with broath, that morne, poysoned him; which <hi>Fassino</hi> his memory and tongue yet serve him to confesse and averre, word for word, as his wife <hi>Victoryna</hi> had related them: whereat they are all sorrowfull, and weepe, and then, and there cause <hi>Felicia</hi> to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and shut fast in a chamber; who (poore harmelesse yong Gentlewoman) is amazed at the terrour and strangenesse of this newes, and cries out and weepes so bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, as she seemes to melt her selfe into teares, only she knowes herselfe innocent, and yet feares that this malice and revenge proceeds to her from her Lady <hi>Victoryna.</hi> Whiles <hi>Felicia</hi> is thus under sure keeping, her Master <hi>Fassino</hi> dyes: which newes is soone dispersed and divulged abroad, to the griefe and admiration of the whole Citie.

                     <p>THere dwelt in the Citie of <hi>Avero</hi> in <hi>Portugall,</hi> an ancient Nobleman, termed <hi>Don Gasper de Vilarezo,</hi> rich in either qualitie of earthly greatnesse, as well of blood as revenewes, who was neerely allied to the Marquesse of <hi>Denia</hi> (in <hi>Spaine)</hi> as marrying a Neece of his named <hi>Dona Alphanta,</hi> a Lady exquisitely endued with the ornaments of Nature, and the perfections of Grace: for she was both faire and vertuous, that adding lustre to these, and these returning and reflecting embellishment to that, which made her infinitely beloved of her husband <hi>Vilarezo,</hi> and exceedingly honoured of all those who had the honour to know her; and to crowne the felicitie of their affections and marriage, they had three hopefull children, one sonne, and two daughters: he termed <hi>Don Sebastiano,</hi> and they the <hi>Donas, Catalina,</hi> and <hi>Berinthia:</hi> Hee having attained his fifteenth yeare, was by his Father made Page to Count <hi>Manriques de Lopez,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually followed him at Court, and they from their tenth to their thirteenth yeares, lived sometimes at <hi>Coimbra,</hi> otherwhiles at <hi>Lisbone,</hi> but commonly at <hi>Avero</hi> with their Parents, who so carefully trained them up in those qualities and perfections, requisite for Ladies of their ranke, as they were no sooner seene, but admired of all who saw them.</p>
                     <p>But before wee make a farther progression in this Historie, (thereby the better to unfold and anatomize it) I hold it rather necessarie then impertinent, that wee take a cursory, though not a curious survey of both these young Ladies perfections and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, of their vices and vertues, their beautie and deformitie: that as objects are best knowne by the opposition of their contraries: so by the way of comparison wee may distinguish how to know, and know how to distinguish of the disparitie of these two sisters, in their inclinations, affections, and delineations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Catalina</hi> was somewhat short of stature, but corpulent of body: <hi>Berinthia</hi> tall, but slender: <hi>Catalina</hi> was of taint and complexion, more browne then faire: <hi>Berinthia</hi> not browne, but sweetly faire, or fairely sweet: <hi>Catalina</hi> had a disdainefull, <hi>Berinthia</hi> a gracious eye: <hi>Catalina</hi> was proud, <hi>Berinthia</hi> humble.

                     <p>But as <hi>Catalina</hi> is the pretext, so <hi>Berinthia</hi> is both the sole object and cause of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio's</hi> stay, whom hee courts and layeth close siege to, as often as opportunitie makes him happie in the desired happinesse and felicitie of her company: Shee gives him blushes for his sighes, and sometimes (although a man) the fervencie of his affection was such, as hee cannot refraine from returning her teares for her blushes: when albeit love perswades him to stay longer in <hi>Avero,</hi> yet discretion calls and commaunds him away to <hi>Lisbone:</hi> and all the fruit of his journey that he shall carry thither with him, is this, that for injoying of faire <hi>Berinthia</hi> to his wife, hee conceives farre more reason to hope, then to despaire. Next death, there is no second affliction so grievous or bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Lovers, as seperation and parting: this <hi>Berinthia</hi> feeles, but will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and this <hi>Antonio</hi> acknowledgeth, because feeles. After Supper, taking her to a window, hee secretly prayes her to honour him with the acceptance of a poore Scarfe, and plaine paire of Gloves (which notwithstanding were infinitely rich, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully faire) in token of his affection; and she, the morne of his departure, by <hi>Diego</hi> his Page, sends him a Handkerchiefe, curiously wrought with hearts and flames of silke and gold, in signe of her thankfulnesse: he promiseth <hi>Berinthia</hi> to write, and see her shortly; and <hi>Catalina</hi> intreats him to be no stranger to <hi>Avero.</hi> To <hi>Catalina</hi> hee gives many words, but few kisses; to <hi>Berinthia</hi> many kisses, but more teares: His depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes <hi>Berinthia</hi> sad, as grieving at his absence; and <hi>Catalina</hi> joyfull, as hoping of his returne: <hi>Catalina</hi> triumphs for joy, hoping that <hi>Antonio</hi> shall be her husband; and <hi>Berinthia</hi> now begins to looke pale with sorrow, fearing shee shall not bee so happy to bee his wife. By this time breakfast is served in, when <hi>Sebastiano</hi> comes, takes <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> and his two sisters, and carries them to the Parlour, where <hi>Vilarezo</hi> and his wife <hi>Alphanta</hi> attend <hi>Antonio's</hi> comming. They all sit downe; and although their fare bee curious, yet <hi>Antonio's</hi> eyes feed and feast upon more curious dainties; as the sparkling eyes, flaxen haire, and vermillion cheekes of <hi>Berinthia's</hi> incomparable beautie, which is observed of all parts, except of <hi>Berinthia,</hi> who is so secret and cautious in her carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, as although her affection, yet her discretion will not permit her modestie either to observe or see it. Breakfast ended, <hi>Antonio</hi> taking <hi>Vilarezo,</hi> and his wife <hi>Alphanta</hi> apart, first gives them infinite thankes for his honourable and courteous entertainment, and then very earnestly againe prayes them not to reject his suit for their daughter <hi>Berinthia. Vilarezo</hi> and his wife pray <hi>Antonio</hi> to excuse his bad reception, which they know comes many wayes short of his deserts and merits, and also request him to imbrace their motion for their daughter <hi>Catalina.</hi> Thus after many other comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he takes his conge of <hi>Vilarezo,</hi> kisseth his wife and two daughters, first <hi>Catali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> then <hi>Berinthia,</hi> who though last in yeares, yet is the first Lady in his desires and thoughts, and the onely Queene of his affections. So they are as it were inforced to make a vertue of necessitie, and to take a short farewell, in stead of a more solemne, which either of them wished, and both desired; but their eyes dictate to their hearts, what their tongues cannot expresse: and so <hi>Antonio</hi> and <hi>Sebastiano</hi> take Coach, and away for <hi>Lisbone, Antonio</hi> as much triumphing in the beautie of his faire <hi>Berinthia,</hi> as his friend <hi>Sebastiano</hi> grieves, that of his two Sisters, <hi>Antonio</hi> would not accept of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talina,</hi> nor his father consent to give him <hi>Berinthia</hi> for his wife: notwithstanding, they confirme their familiaritie and friendship with many interchangeable and reciprocall protestations; that sith they cannot be brothers, they will live and die deare and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friends: but I feare the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Being arrived at <hi>Lisbone, Antonio</hi> feeles strange alterations in his thoughts and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.

To attempt the one, hee holds it as great a folly, as a vanitie to wish the other: But hee bethinkes himselfe of a remedie for this his perplexitie, and reputes himselfe obliged in the bonds, as well of respect, as love, to write to his faire <hi>Berinthia:</hi> and then againe hee feares that it will find a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult passage and accesse to her, because of her Fathers distaste, and Sisters jealousie: but the Sunne of his affection doth soone dispell and dissipate these doubts, or rather disperse them as clouds before the winde: and now to prevent those who might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to intercept his Letters, hee bethinkes himselfe of an invention, as worthy, as commendable in a Lover: hee writes <hi>Berinthia</hi> a letter, and accompanying it with a rich Diamond, sends it her by <hi>Diego</hi> his owne Page to <hi>Avero,</hi> whom purposely and feignedly hee causeth to arme himselfe with this pretext and colour, that he is in love with <hi>Ansilva</hi> the Lady <hi>Catalina's</hi> wayting Gentlewoman, and hath now gotten leave of his Master to come to <hi>Avero</hi> to seeke her in marriage: where after some fifteene dayes he arrives, and very secretly delivers his Masters Ring and Letter to <hi>Berinthia,</hi> who (sweet Lady) was then tost with the winde of feare, and the waves of sorrow, that in all this time shee heard not from <hi>Antonio,</hi> doubting indeed lest the change of ayre, places, and objects might have power to change his affection, when now blushing for joy, as much as before shee looked pale for sorrow, she takes the Ring and Letter, and kissing both, secretly flies to her Chamber, when bolting the doore, shee with as much affection as impatience breaking up the seales, therein finds these lines:</p>

the obstinacie of <hi>Vilarezo,</hi> and the jealousie of <hi>Catalina,</hi> make him end that journey ere hee began it.

                        <hi>Berinthia</hi> having read this Letter, shee approoves of <hi>Antonio's</hi> feare, and attributes it to the fervencie and sinceritie of his affection: shee esteemes her selfe infinitely happy in her good fortune, and choyce of so brave a Cavalier for her servant, whom shee hopes a little time will make her husband; to which end shee will no longer feed him with delayes, but now resolves, by his Page <hi>Diego</hi> at his returne to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him so much: and in a word, to send him her heart, as shee hath already received his. But shee knowes not what the <hi>Interim</hi> of this time will bring forth.</p>
                     <p>Passe wee from <hi>Berinthia</hi> to her Sister <hi>Catalina,</hi> whose affection is likewise such to <hi>Antonio,</hi> as by this time shee hath perswaded and induced her Father <hi>Vilarezo</hi> to write him a Letter in her behalfe by <hi>Diego,</hi> thereby to draw his resolution, whether hee intend to seeke her for his wife or no; or at least to invite him to <hi>Avero.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his affection to her sister <hi>Berinthia</hi> be kept from her, yet she not onely suspects, but feares it.

Fathers Letter to his Master: and yet that joy of hers is soone dissolved into griefe, because all this time he never vouchsafed to write to her: her affection to him flattreth her still with hope, and yet her judgement in her selfe still suggesteth her despaire; for shee hath alwayes the image of this conceit in her imagination, that <hi>Antonio</hi> loves her Sister <hi>Berinthia,</hi> and not her selfe: her suspicion makes her subtill, and so shee deales with <hi>Ansilva,</hi> to draw the truth heere of from <hi>Diego,</hi> who having learned his lesson, acteth his part well, and I know not, whether with more fidelitie or discretion, flatly denies it: but loe, here betides an accident, which bewrayes the whole mysterie and History of their affections. On a Sunday morning, when <hi>Berinthia</hi> was descended to the garden to gather flowers, against her going to Church with her Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, her Sister <hi>Catalina</hi> rusheth into her Chamber, to seeke the Historie of <hi>Cervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tez,</hi> which the day before shee had lent her; and not finding it either on the Table, or the Window, seekes in the pocket of her gowne, that shee wore the day before; and there unwittingly, and unexpectedly finds the last Letter that <hi>Antonio</hi> had sent her; whereby shee perceived, it was in vaine for her to hope to enjoy <hi>Antonio,</hi> sith shee now apparantly saw that hee was her sister <hi>Berinthia's,</hi> and shee his. <hi>Catalina</hi> is hereat both sorrowfull and glad; sorrowfull, that shee should lose <hi>Antonio,</hi> and glad that shee had found his Letter. And now to shew her affection to him, and her malice to her sister, shee will trie her wits, to see whether shee can frustrate <hi>Berinthia,</hi> and so obtaine <hi>Antonio</hi> for her selfe. The passions of men may easily be found out and detected, but the secrets and malice of women difficultly. To which end <hi>Catalina</hi> shewes this letter to her Father, who exceedingly stormes hereat, and with many checkes and frownes curbes <hi>Berinthia</hi> of her libertie, and resolves in his first letter to <hi>Antonio,</hi> to forbid hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whereat <hi>Diego</hi> grew amazed, but farre more <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silva,</hi> who blushing with shame, &amp; then growing pale for feare, could not invent either what to say or doe, at the strangenesse and suddennesse of this accident. <hi>Diego</hi> presseth her to know for whom this poyson was provided, and of whom shee had it, Her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres are variable, and are so farre from agreeing, as they contradict each other, which breeds in her the more feare, and in him astonishment. Hee conjures her by all the bonds of their affection, to discover it, with many millions of protestations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth it shall dye with him; hee addes vowes to his requests, oathes to his vowes, and kisses to his oathes, so as mayds can difficultly conceale any thing from their Lovers; but especially fearing that hee might peradventure suspect that this poyson was meant and intended him: shee at last vanquished with his importunacy, and this consideration, discovereth (as we have formerly understood) that her Lady <hi>Catalina</hi> had wonne her, therewith to poyson her sister <hi>Berinthia,</hi> because shee suspected shee was better beloved of his Master <hi>Don Antonio</hi> then her selfe. <hi>Diego</hi> is infinitely astonished at the strangenesse of this newes, and like a true and faithfull Page to his Master, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drawne this worme from <hi>Ansilva's</hi> nose, and this newes from her tongue, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour to seeke a remedy to stop his blood, giving her many kisses, and promising her his speedy returne, hee leaves her in the garden, and so very speedily finds out <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthia,</hi> to whom (with as much truth as curiositie) hee from poynt to poynt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales it, praying her to bee carefull not to receive any thing, either from <hi>Catalina,</hi> or <hi>Ansilva,</hi> and withall to write, for the next morne hee will hye to <hi>Elvas,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale it to his Master. <hi>Berinthia</hi> trembles at the report of this strange and unexpected newes: so having first thanked God for the discovery of this poyson, and her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters malice, shee promiseth him a Letter to his Master, and heartily thankes him for his fidelitie and affection towards her, the which shee voweth to requite; and for a pledge and earnest thereof, drawes off a Diamond from her finger, and gives it him for this good office.</p>
                     <p>No sooner hath <hi>Aurora</hi> leapt from the watry bed of <hi>Thetis,</hi> and <hi>Phoebus</hi> discovered his golden beames in the azured Firmament of Heaven, but <hi>Diego</hi> causeth his Horse to bee made ready, and tells <hi>Ansilva,</hi> that his father hath sent for him to meet him at <hi>la Secco,</hi> and that hee will not fayle to bee backe with her within three dayes, being ready to depart.</p>
                     <p>Hee, under colour of giving order for his horse, leaves her, and steales into <hi>Berin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia's</hi> Chamber, whom (poore Lady) feare would not permit to take any rest or sleepe that night, the which shee had partly worne out and imployed in writing her minde to her deare <hi>Antonio,</hi> and knowing her selfe not safe in <hi>Avero</hi> with her father and sister, shee resolved to commit her honour and her life into his protection: yea, she had no sooner finished and sealed her Letter to that effect, but <hi>Diego</hi> comes and knockes softly at her chamber doore. <hi>Berinthia</hi> in her night gowne and attire is ready for him: shee admits him, commends his care, gives him her Letter to his Master, and prayes him to use all possible diligence in his returne: and so having received all her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, hee secretly descends the stayres; and taking leave of <hi>Vilarezo,</hi> and lastly, kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his Mistresse <hi>Ansilva,</hi> hee leapes to horse, rides the first Stage, there leaves his Gennet, and takes Poast.</p>

into her chamber, demands whether shee be prepared to performe her owne promise, and her hopes? She answereth her Lady, that lesse then three dayes shall effect it, and give a period to all her sister <hi>Berinthia's.</hi> Whereat shee is exceedingly glad, but all this while ignorant what <hi>Diego</hi> hath seene, and <hi>Berinthia</hi> knowes to this effect. <hi>Ansil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> presuming on <hi>Diego</hi> his sidelity, and building on his secresie; and therefore lesse suspecting his journey to <hi>Eluas,</hi> remaines still so gracelesse and impious in her bloudy resolution, as shee now not onely presumes, but assures her selfe that <hi>Berinthia</hi> is neere the ebbe of her dayes, and the setting of her life: and therefore like an execrable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the Devill, she hath now made ready and provided her selfe of a second poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned potion, which shee no way doubts but shall send her to her last sleepe.

He delivers her his Masters Letter, and prayes her to prepare her selfe against the prefixed houre. Shee reades her <hi>Antonio's</hi> Letter with much joy and comfort, which her lookes testifie, and her heart proclaimeth to her thoughts: shee will not be slacke or backwards in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which so deeply imports her well-fare and content; and so with all possible secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie packes up the chiefest of her apparell and jewels in a small trunke, or casket, and wisheth the houre come, that shee were either in <hi>Antonio's</hi> armes, or he in hers: and for <hi>Diego,</hi> he casteth so subtill a mist &amp; vaile before <hi>Ansilva's</hi> eyes, as it is impossible either for her, or her Lady <hi>Catalina</hi> to perceive any thing. But loe, a second treachery is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, to effect that which the first could not: and indeed, which went neere to have performed it, had not God miraculously and indulgently reached forth his hand to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it: for <hi>Catalina</hi> still persevers in her inveterate and deadly malice towards her sister <hi>Berinthia,</hi> as if <hi>God</hi> had not yet taught her, or rather, that she would not learne the way from Satan; or Grace instructed and directed her from the impietie of so foule a sinne, as the murthering of her owne and onely sister. For the very night that <hi>Antonio</hi> had promised and assigned to fetch <hi>Berinthia,</hi> as shee had by times retired her selfe to her chamber, under colour to go to bed, and ready to put on her night abiliments, in comes <hi>Ansilva,</hi> sent by her good and kinde (or rather wicked and cruell) sister, with a sweet Posset, (or rather a deadly poyson in her hand, in a silver covered cup) telling her, that her Lady had drunk the one halfe, and sent her the other, it being (as she affirmed) very cold and refreshing for the liver, against the hotnesse of the weather. But <hi>Berinthia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forewarned, is armed by her former danger; yet shee seemes joyfull thereof, and so accepts it, returning her sister <hi>Catalina</hi> thanks, saying, shee will drinke it ere shee goe to bed; onely she prayes <hi>Ansilva</hi> first to fetch her prayer booke and gloves, which in the morne shee had left in her sisters chamber. So whiles shee is wanting, shee privately powres it into a silver bason in her Studie, and washing the cup three or foure seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times, shee fills some Almond milke therein; and <hi>Ansilva</hi> being returned, takes the said cup, and prayes her to tell her Sister, that shee drinkes it to her health, and withall, gives her the good night: and so likewise doth <hi>Ansilva</hi> to her. But what a good night thought shee in her heart and conscience, when shee knew <hi>Berinthia</hi> should never see day more? So away shee trips to her Lady <hi>Catalina,</hi> who demaunds her if the businesse bee dispatched, and her sister gone to her rest? Who replies, shee hath drunke her last, and is gone to her eternall rest. But they are both deceived in their malicious Arithmaticke: For although <hi>Catalina</hi> extremely rejoyce in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and assured death of her sister, yet God ordaineth, that their bloody hopes shall deceive them: as marke the sequell, and you shall see how.</p>

in wonderfull secret sort in comes <hi>Diego</hi> to her Chamber, to awayt the houre of his Masters arrivall, and to assist her in her escape and departure. <hi>Berinthia</hi> acquaints him with the potion her Sister <hi>Catalina</hi> had right now sent her by <hi>Ansilva:</hi> hee is asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at this newes, as being assured it was poyson, and humbly prayes her to make proofe hereof on <hi>Catalina's</hi> Parrot, which that afternoone shee had brought with her into her Chamber: and so by her consent <hi>Diego</hi> takes the Parrot, and with a spoone forceth some downe its throat: who poore harmelesse bird, immediately swells and dyes before them. They both wonder hereat, and <hi>Berinthia</hi> at one instant both grieves and rejoyceth, grieves at her Sister <hi>Catalina's</hi> malice and crueltie, and rejoyceth for her happie deliverance: first praysing God as the Author, then thanking <hi>Diego</hi> as the instrument thereof: and so they throw the remainder of the poyson out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and lay the dead Parrot on the table. And now <hi>Berinthia</hi> attending and away<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the houre of her happinesse, which is that of her <hi>Antonio's</hi> arrivall, and of her owne departure, with as much desire as impatiencie; <hi>Diego</hi> often looking on the houre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasse, and <hi>Berinthia</hi> a thousand times on her Watch. So at last with a longing, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging desire, the joyfull houre of twelve is come, wherein <hi>Antonio</hi> arrives: hee sees the happy light of her candle, and shee heares the sweet musicke of his Pistoll, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viveth and ravisheth these two Lovers, in the heaven of unexpressable joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, when all things being hush'd up in silence, and every person of the house soundly sleeping, <hi>Diego</hi> softly takes up the small trunke, and <hi>Berinthia</hi> as secretly followes him: and so they wonderfull privately slip into the first Court, and from thence to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne doore of the garden, where <hi>Antonio</hi> with a thousand kisses receives her in his armes, having no other light but the lustre of her eyes to light them: for the Moone, that bright <hi>Cynthia,</hi> had conspired and consented to <hi>Berinthia</hi>'s escape, and therfore pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely withdrawne her brightnesse by hiding and invelloping her selfe in the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of an obscure cloud. <hi>Antonio</hi> locking this sweet prize, this his deare and swee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Berinthia</hi> in his armes, hee with the three Gentlemen his friends, conduct her to the end of the street; and <hi>Diego</hi> following them with the Casket, where they all privatly and silently take Coach, and having opened the Citie gate with a silver key, away they speed for <hi>Eluas</hi> with all possible celerity; but I write with griefe, that as these affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Antonio</hi> and <hi>Berinthia</hi> begin in joy, so (I feare) they will end in as much sorrow and misery.</p>
                     <p>Leave we them now in their journey for <hi>Eluas:</hi> and returne we to <hi>Avero</hi> to bloudy <hi>Catalina,</hi> and wretched <hi>Ansilva,</hi> who lying remote from <hi>Berinthia's</hi> Chamber, could not possibly heare so much as the least step of her descent and departure: although their malice were so extreame as to write the truth, they all that night could not sleepe for joy that <hi>Berinthia</hi> was dispatched: so they prepare themselves against the morne, to heare some pittifull out-cries in the house for <hi>Berinthia's</hi> death: but seeing it neere ten of the clocke, and no rumour nor stirre heard, they both (as they were accustomed) went into her Chamber, thinking to feast their eies upon the lamentable object of this breathlesse Gentlewoman: but contrary to their bloudy hopes, they finde the nest, I meane the bed, emptie, and <hi>Berinthia</hi> not dead, but escaped and flowne away: Onely <hi>Catalina,</hi> in stead of her Sister, findes her owne Parrot dead on the table: they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished at this newes, and looke fearefully and desperately each on other. <hi>Ansilva</hi> for her part protests and vowes, that shee saw <hi>Berinthia</hi> drinke the poyson. But finding <hi>Berinthia's</hi> small trunke wanting, and hearing <hi>Diego</hi> gone, then <hi>Catalina</hi> knowes for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that shee was escaped, and her poysoning plot detected and prevented. So they give the alarum in the house, and shee goes directly and acquaints her Father, Mother, and Brother of her Sister <hi>Berinthia's</hi> flight, but speakes not a word of the poyson, or of the Parrots death. <hi>Vilarezo</hi> grieves to see himselfe robbed of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16653:74"/>
and <hi>Sebastiano</hi> of his Sister: but when they understand that <hi>Diego</hi> was gone with her, then they are confidently assured, that <hi>Antonio</hi> hath carried her away, which is confirmed them by the Porter of the Citie, who told them, that 'twixt twelve and one, a Coach with a Lady, and foure Cavaliers, and a Page (drawne by sixe horses) past the gate very speedily. <hi>Vilarezo</hi> and his sonne <hi>Sebastiano</hi> storme at this affront and disgrace: they consult what to doe herein: so first they resolve to send one to <hi>Elvas,</hi> to know yea or no, whether <hi>Berinthia</hi> bee there with <hi>Antonio?</hi> The messenger sent, returnes, and assures them thereof, as also, that <hi>Antonio</hi> is retyred from <hi>Elvas,</hi> to a Castle of his without the walls of the Citie, where it is reported hee keepes the Lady <hi>Berinthia</hi> with much honour and respect. Had old <hi>Vilarezo</hi> had his health and strength, he would himselfe in person haue undertaken this journey, but being sicke of the Gowt, he sends his sonne <hi>Sebastiano</hi> to <hi>Elvas,</hi> accompanied with six resolute Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, his neere allies and friends, to draw reason of <hi>Antonio</hi> for this affront and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and so either by Law, Force, Policie, or perswasion, to bring backe <hi>Berinthia. Sebastiano</hi> knowing <hi>Berinthia</hi> to bee his Sister, and <hi>Antonio</hi> his former ancient and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate friend, with a kind of unwilling willingnesse accepts of this journey: he comes to <hi>Elvas,</hi> and findes his former intelligence true, hee repayres to <hi>Antonio's</hi> Castle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with his sixe associates. <hi>Antonio</hi> admits them all into the first Court, and onely two more of them into the second; where hee salutes them kindly, and bids them all welcome to his Castle. <hi>Sebastiano</hi> layes before him the foulenesse of his fact, in stealing away his Sister in that clandestine and base manner, the scandall which hee hath layd upon her, and consequently on all their family and blood, tells him that his father and himselfe are resolued to have her againe at what price soever; and therefore conjures him, by the respect of his owne honour, and by the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and remembrance of all their former friendship, to deliver him his Sister <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthia. Antonio</hi> answereth <hi>Sebastiano,</hi> that it was an honourable affection, and no base respect which led him to assist his Sister <hi>Berinthia</hi> in her flight and escape: that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was nor would bee a just scandall either to her, her family, or blood; that his malicious Sister <hi>Catalina</hi> was the authour and cause thereof, who by her wayting Gentlewoman <hi>Ansilva</hi> had twice sought to poyson her: and therefore, sith he could not deliver her with her owne safetie, and his honour and conscience, hee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to protect her in his Castle, against any whosoever, that should seeke either to enforce or offend her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sebastiano</hi> is perplexed at this strange newes, and wondereth at <hi>Antonio's</hi> resolution: so doe the two Gentlemen with him: hee desires <hi>Antonio</hi> that hee may see and speake with his Sister <hi>Berinthia;</hi> the which hee freely and honourably grants: and so taking him by the hand, they enter the Hall: where <hi>Berinthia</hi> having notice hereof (accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with two of <hi>Antonio</hi> his Sisters) assoone comes, and with a cheerefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance advanceth towards her Brother: hee salutes her, and shee first him, then the other two Gentlemen her Cousins. <hi>Sebastiano</hi> prayes <hi>Antonio,</hi> that hee may conferre apart with his Sister. <hi>Antonio</hi> replies, that his Sister <hi>Berinthia's</hi> pleasure shall ever bee his. Shee willingly consents hereeunto, when hee taking her by the hand, conducts her to the farthest window, and there shewes her her disobedience to her Father, her dishonour to her selfe, and griefe to her friends, for this her unadvised and rash flight, and so perswades her to returne: and that if shee intend to marry <hi>Antonio,</hi> this is not the way, but rather a course as irregular as shamefull. His Sister <hi>Berithia</hi> delivers him at full the cause of her departure, and very constantly confirmes what <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16653:75"/>
same. <hi>Sebastiano</hi> checkes her of folly and crueltie, shewes her, that in seeking to wrong others, shee onely wrongs her selfe; that in inventing and casting a feigned crime on her Sister <hi>Catalina,</hi> shee makes her owne conspicuous and true; that she hath no safetie but in her returne: whereunto with many reasons hee seekes to perswade and induce her.</p>
                     <p>His Sister <hi>Berinthia</hi> againe answereth him, that there is no safetie for her in <hi>Avero,</hi> and that she cannot expect greater then shee finds in <hi>Elvas:</hi> shee prayes him to thinke charitably and honourably of her departure: and if ever her Father will love her, shee requests him not to hate, but to love <hi>Antonio,</hi> whose Castle shee finds a Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, both for her honour and life; taking God and his Angels, her conscience and soule to witnesse, that her Sister <hi>Catalina's</hi> crime is true and not feigned. <hi>Sebastiano</hi> seeing <hi>Antonio</hi> resolute, and his Sister wilfull and obstinate, begins to take leave, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her, that hee will leave her to her folly, that to her shame, and her shame to her repentance, and so concludes to goe into the Citie, to resolve on what hee hath to doe, for her good and his owne honour. <hi>Antonio</hi> prayes him to dine in his Castle with his Sister: but hee refuseth it, saith hee hath given the first breach to their friendship, and his owne honour, which hee shall repent, if not repaire, and so departs. Being come into the Citie, hee consults this businesse with the Gentlemen his associats, and both himselfe and they are of opinion to send one poast to acquaint his Father here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and so to crave his pleasure and resolution, how hee shall beare himselfe heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. It is ever an excellent poynt both of wisedome and discretion, for a sonne to steere his actions by the compasse of his Fathers commands. His cousin <hi>Villandras</hi> undertakes this journey to <hi>Avero.</hi> Old <hi>Vilarezo</hi> is perplexed and grieved at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and in stead of comfort, receives more affliction, his care, curiositie, passion and griefe: severally examineth first <hi>Catalina,</hi> then <hi>Ansilva,</hi> who (like theeves in a faire, or murtherers in a Forrest) hee findes equally constant in their deniall, being so devoyd of grace, and repleat of impietie, as they confirme and maintaine their innocencies with many bitter oathes and asseverations: so hee returnes <hi>Villandras</hi> to <hi>Elvas,</hi> with this Letter to his sonne <hi>Sebastiano.</hi>

that night (with as much friendship as secresie) meet in the Citie, and resolve on the Rapiers; and other ceremonies requisite in <hi>Duels.</hi> The morne appeares, when our Combatants leape from their beds to the field; where, a little before sixe (being the appointed houre) all parties appeare: the Seconds performe their office in visiting the Principals, who cast off their doublers and draw, and so traversing their ground, they, with judgement and generositie, fall to their businesse; at the first cloze, <hi>Antonio</hi> is wounded in the right arme, and <hi>Sebastiano</hi> in the left side, which glaunced on a rib: at the second, <hi>Sebastiano</hi> wounds <hi>Antonio</hi> 'twixt the breast and shoulder, a little aboue his right pap, and hee him cleane thorow the body, of a large and dangerous wound, whence issued foorth abundance of blood: so they divide themselves and take breath: They againe fall to it, and at this third close, <hi>Sebastiano</hi> repayes <hi>Antonio</hi> with a mournfull and fatall interest: for hee runnes him thorow the body on the left side, a little below the heart; whereof staggering, he falls, and so <hi>Sebastiano</hi> dispatcheth him, and nailes him to the ground starke dead. <hi>Villandras</hi> congratulates with him for his victory, which <hi>Sebastiano</hi> with much modestie, ascribes to the power and providence of God, and not to the weaknesse of his owne arme. <hi>Bellasco</hi> is no way daunted with the misfortune and death of his Principall, but rather like a generous Gentleman and valiant Second, resolves to sell it dearely to <hi>Villandras.</hi> They are not long unsheathing of their Rapiers: for as soone as <hi>Bellasco</hi> hath covered up <hi>Antonio</hi> with his cloake, they approach at their very first meeting. <hi>Bellasco</hi> slightly hurts <hi>Villandras</hi> in the right shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and <hi>Villandras</hi> him thorow the bodie and reynes with a fatall wound, wherewith his sword fell from him, and hee to the ground; when fearing and presaging his death, he with a faint language begs his life of <hi>Villandras,</hi> who at the sight and hearing hereof, throwes away his owne Rapier, and stoupes to assist him. But in vaine; for it is not in his power to give him his life: for by this time hee is dead, and his soule departed to another world. This tragicall newes is soone knowne and bruited in <hi>Elvas,</hi> whereof the Criminall Iudges of that Citie remit <hi>Sebastiano</hi> with as much ease, as <hi>Villandras</hi> with difficultie (in favour of money and friends) and obtaine their pardons. And now the newes hereof likewise flies to <hi>Antonio's</hi> Castle, where his dead body, and that of <hi>Bellasco,</hi> are speedily conveyed and brought, to the griefe and sorrow of all those of the Castle, who bitterly weepe for the disaster of their Lord and Master. But all these teares are nothing to those of <hi>Antonio's</hi> two sisters; nor theirs any thing, in comparison of these of our sweet <hi>Berinthia,</hi> who is no sooner advertised hereof, but shee falls to the ground with sorrow, and there wrings her hands, beats her breast, and teares off her haire, in such mournfull and pitifull sort, that Crueltie her selfe could not refraine from teares, to see the numberlesse infinitie of hers: Counsell, advice, perswasion cannot perswade her to give a moderation to her mourning, or limits to her sorrowes: for they are so violent, as their extremitie exceeds all excesse. Shee will see the dead body of her deare <hi>Antonio;</hi> all those of the Castle are not capable to divert her eyes from this wofull and pitifull object; at the sight whereof shee falles to the ground on her knees, and gives his breathlesse body a thousand kisses: yea, shee washeth his sweet cheekes with a whole deluge and inundation of her salt teares: shee cannot speake for sighing, nor utter a word for weeping; onely wringing her hands, shee at last breathed foorth these mournfull and passionate speeches: O my deare <hi>Antonio,</hi> my sweet and deare <hi>Antonio, Antonio,</hi> would God my death had ransomed and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thine, O my <hi>Antonio,</hi> my <hi>Antonio.</hi>

                     <p>Leave we <hi>Berinthia</hi> to her passionate sorrowes, and sorrowfull passions, from which her brother <hi>Sebastiano</hi> will soone awake her; who by this time, as Victor and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, is come to the Castle gate, and demaunds her, where he sees himselfe refused, and the draw-bridges and approaches drawne up, and rampired with Barricadoes: he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16653:76"/>
craves ayd of the Criminall Iudges, who send the <hi>Provost</hi> with an armed company of Souldiers: so they force the Castle gate with a <hi>Petard,</hi> where sorrowfull <hi>Berinthia</hi> is delivered into the handes of her joyfull and rejoycing brother <hi>Sebastiano,</hi> who with sweet perswasions and advice seeks to exhale and dry up her teares: but her affection is so great, as she is not capable of consolation. In a word, shee cannot looke on her Brother with the eye of affection, but of revenge and indignation; yea, shee wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her selfe metamorphosed from a Virgine to a man, that shee might bee revenged of her Brother for the death of her deare Lover <hi>Antonio. Sebastiano</hi> leaving the dead bodies of <hi>Antonio</hi> and <hi>Belasco</hi> to their Graves, takes Coach with his incensed and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull Sister <hi>Berinthia;</hi> and so leaves <hi>Elvs</hi> and returnes towards <hi>Avero:</hi> where his Father <hi>Vilarezo</hi> and his Mother <hi>Alphanta</hi> welcome him home with prayse, and their Daughter <hi>Berinthia</hi> with checkes and frownes, who (the best she may) smothers her discontents; but yet vowes to be revenged of her Brother, for killing the life of her joy, and joy of her life, <hi>Antonio.</hi> But all vowes of this bloudy nature and quality are better broken then kept, which if <hi>Berinthia</hi> had had the grace to have considered, and made good use of, doubtlesse her hand had proved more joyfull, and not so fatall and miserable.</p>
                     <p>Come we now to <hi>Catalina,</hi> who seeing the object of her affection, <hi>Antonio,</hi> dead, and her Sister <hi>Berinthia</hi> returned, who, for his sake, was that of her living malice, she secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confesseth her fault to her sister, in seeking formerly twice to have poysoned her by <hi>Ansilva,</hi> craves pardon of her, vowing henceforth to convert her malice to affection, and so reconciles her selfe to her; whereunto her Sister <hi>Berinthia</hi> willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendeth. <hi>Catalina</hi> hath made her peace with her Sister, but shee hath not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and concluded it with God for <hi>Ansilva's</hi> death. Earth may forget this Murther, but Heaven will not. Gods judgements are as just as secret, and as true as wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; for hee hath a thousand meanes to punish us, when wee thinke our selves safe and furthest from punishment: which our wretched <hi>Catalina,</hi> and her execrable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericke <hi>Sarmiata</hi> shall see verifyed in themselves. For the smoke of this their blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Crime of Murther hath pierced the Vaultes and Windowes of Heaven, and is ascended to the Nostrells of the Lord, who hath now bent his Bowe, and made ready his Arrowes to revenge and punish them.

The Divines prepare her soule for Heaven, and now shee will no longer dissemble with man or God; shee will not charge her conscience with so foule a Crime as Murther, the which shee knowes will prove a stop to the fruition of her felicity.

So they acquaint the Criminall Iudges hereof, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree order and power for his apprehension. <hi>Sarmiata</hi> is revelling and feasting at <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella's</hi> wedding; to which hee is appoynted and requested to furnish the Sweet-meats for the Banquets: but hee little thinkes what sowre sawce there is providing for him. Wee are never neerest danger, then when wee thinke our selves furthest from it: and although his sinnefull security was such, as the Devill had made him forget his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Ansilva,</hi> yet God will, and doth remember it; and lo, here comes his storme, here his apprehension, and presently his punishment. By this time the newes of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talina's</hi> suddaine death (but not of her secret confession) is published in <hi>Avero,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Bride-house, which gives both astonishment and griefe to all the world; but especially to <hi>Sarmiata,</hi> whose heart and conscience now rings him many thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring peales of feare, terrour, and despaire: his bloudy thoughts pursue him like so many bloudhounds, and because he hath forsaken God, therfore the devill will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake him; he counselleth him to flie, and to provide for his safety; but what safety so unsecure, dangerous, or miserable for a Christian, as to throw himselfe into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills protection? <hi>Sarmiata</hi> hereon fearing that <hi>Catalina</hi> had revealed his poysoning of <hi>Ansilva,</hi> very secretly steales away his Cloake, and so slips downe to a Posterne doore of the little Court, hoping to escape; but hee is deceived of his hopes: for the eye of Gods providence findes him out. The House is beleaguerd for him by Officers, who apprehend him as hee is issuing forth, and so commit him close priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. In the afternoone the Iudges examine him upon the poysoning of <hi>Ansilva,</hi> and the receipt of one hundred Duckets, to effect it, from <hi>Catalina,</hi> which shee at her death confessed. Hee addes sinne to sinne, and denyes it with many impious oathes and fearefull imprecations; but they availe him nothing: his Iudges censure him to the Racke, where, upon the first torment hee confesseth it, but with so gracelesse an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, as he rather rejoyceth then grieves hereat: where we may observe how strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Devill stickes to him, and how closely hee is bewitched to the Devill: so for reparation of this foule crime of his, hee is condemned to be hanged, which the next morne is performed right against <hi>Vilarezo</hi> his house, at a Gallowes purposely erected; and which is worse then all the rest, as this lewd villaine <hi>Sarmiata</hi> liv'd prophanely, so hee dy'd as desperately, without repenting his bloudy fact, or imploring pardon or mercy of God for the same. O miserable example! O fearefull end! O bloudy and damnable miscreant! Wee have seene the Theater of this History gored with great variety of bloud, the mournefull and lamentable spectacle whereof is capable to make any Christian heart relent into pitty, compassion, and teares. But this is not all, wee shall yet see more, not that it any way increaseth our terrour, but rather our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, sith thereby wee may observe that Murther comes from Sathan, and its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment from God.</p>

malice and revenge to her brother <hi>Sebastiano,</hi> for killing of her deare and sweet Love <hi>Antonio.</hi> Other Tragedies are past, but this as yet not acted, but to come: Lo now at last (though indeed too too soone) it comes on the Stage. The remembrance of <hi>Antonio</hi> and his affection is still fresh in her youthfull thoughts and contemplations, yea, his dead <hi>Idea</hi> is alwayes present and living in her heart and brest: 'tis true, <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiano</hi> is her brother; 'tis as true she saith, that if hee had not kill'd <hi>Antonio, Antonio</hi> had beene her husband. Againe shee considereth, that as <hi>Antonio's</hi> life preserved hers from death; so her life hath beene the cause of his: and as hee lost his life for her sake, why should not she likewise leave hers for his? or rather, why should shee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to live, who hath bereaved her of him? But her living affection to her dead friend is so violent, and withall so prejudicate and revengefull, as shee neither can, nor will see her Brother, who kill'd him, but with malice and indignation. In stead of consulting with nature and grace, shee onely converseth with choller and passion; yea, she is so miserably transported in her rage, and so outragiously wilfull in her resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as she shuts the doore of her heart to the two former vertues, to whom she should open it, and openeth it to the two latter vices, 'gainst whom shee should shut it. A mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery equally ominous and fatall, where Reason is not the Mistresse of our Passions, and Religion the Queene of our Reason. Shee sees this bloudy attempt of hers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into shee is entring, is sinfull and impious; and yet her faith is so weake towards God, and the Devill so strong with her, as shee is constant to advance, and resolute not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire therein. Oh that <hi>Berinthia's</hi> former Vertues should bee disgraced with so foule a Vice! and oh that a face so sweetly faire should bee accompanyed and linked with a heart so cruelly barbarous, so bloudily inhumane! for what can shee hope from this a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to the Racke. This advice and request is heard and followed with approbation. Hee, and two other Officers, accompanyed with some of her friends, repaire to <hi>Vilarezo</hi> his house, and <hi>Berinthia</hi> her Chamber; they leave no place, Trunke, Chest, or Boxe unsearched: yea, their curiositie, or to say truer, their zeale and fidelity to Iustice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends so low, as to visite her Close-stoole, which, for want of the key, they breake open; and behold the providence and Iustice of God! here they finde <hi>Berinthia's</hi> bloudy Gowne, and therein very closely wrapt up that hellish Knife, wherewith shee perpetrated this inhumane murther on her onely brother. They praise and glorifie God for the discovery hereof, and so returne to their Tribunall of Iustice, bringing these bloudy evidences with them, which <hi>Berinthia</hi> mought all this while have remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if God, to his glory, and her shame, had not all this time purposely blinded the eyes of her judgement to the contrary. At the sight hereof shee, without any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, confesseth the Murther, and with many teares repents herselfe of it; adding withall, that her affection to <hi>Antonio</hi> led her to this revenge on her brother: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beseecheth her Iudges to have compassion on her youth. But the foulenesse of her fact, in those grave and just personages, wipes off the fairenesse of her request: So they consult, and pronounce Sentence against her, That for expiation of this her cruel mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the person of her brother, she the next morne shall bee hanged in the publike Market place. So all praise God for the detection of this lamentable Murther, and for the condemnation of this execrable Murtheresse: and those, who before looked on her youth and beauty with pitty, now behold her foule crime with hatred and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station; and as they applaud the sincerity of her former affection to <hi>Antonio,</hi> so they farre more detest and condemne this her inhumane cruelty to her owne brother <hi>Sebastiano.</hi> But what griefe is there comparable to that of her Father and Mother? whose age, content, and patience is not onely battered, but razed downe with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall assaults of affliction; so as they wish themselves buryed, or that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had beene unborne: for it is rather a torment then a griefe to them, that they, whom they hoped would have beene props and comforts to their age, should now prove instruments and subjects to shorten their dayes, and consequently to draw their age to the miseries of an untimely and sorrowfull grave. But although they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted a world of griefe and anxiety, first for the death of their Daughter <hi>Catalina,</hi> and then of their onely Sonne <hi>Sebastiano;</hi> yet it pierceth them to the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So although the Gallowes bee erected, <hi>Berinthia</hi> prepared to dye, and a world of people, yea, in a manner, the whole people of <hi>Avero</hi> concurr'd and seated to see her now take her last farewell of the world; yet the importunacie and misery of her parents, her owne descent, youth, and beauty, as also her end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and change their former decree, and sweeten the rigour thereof with one more honourable and milde, and lesse sharpe, bitter, and shamefull, and definitively adjudge her to be immured up betwixt two walls, and there with a slender dyet to end the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of her dayes. And this Sentence is speedily put in execution; whereat her parents, friends, and acquaintance, yea, all that knew her, very bitterly grieve and lament; and farre the more, in respect they cannot be permitted to see or visit her, or shee them; onely the Physicians and Divines have admittance and accesse to her,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16653:80"/>
those, to provide earthly physicke for her body; and these, spirituall for her soule. And in this lamentable estate she is very penitent and repentant for all her sinnes in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and for this her vile murther of her Brother in particular: yea, a little imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or rather the spirit of God hath opened the eyes of her faith, who now defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Devill who had seduced and drawne her hereunto, shee makes her peace with God, and assures her selfe, that her true repentance hath made hers with him. So, unaccustomed to bee pent up in so strait and darke a Mew, the yellow Iaundies, and a burning Feaver surprise her: and so she ends her miserable dayes.</p>
                     <p>Lo, these are the bitter fruits of Revenge and Murther, which the undertakers (by the just judgement of God) are inforced to tast and swallow downe, when in the heat of their youth, and height of their impiety they least dreame or thinke thereof: by the sight of which great effusion of bloud, yea, by all these varieties of mourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and fatall accidents, if wee will divorce our thoughts from Hell to Earth, and wed our contemplations and affections from Earth to Heaven, wee shall then, as true Christians, and sonnes of the eternall God, runne the race of our mortality in peace in this world, and consequently bee rewarded with a glorious Crowne of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall felicity in that to come.</p>

It is true, the best of Gods children are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to sinne; but to delight and persevere therein, is the true way as well to hell as death.

                     <p>IN the beautifull Citie of <hi>Avignion,</hi> (seated in the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> and in the Province of <hi>Provence)</hi> being the Capitall of the Dutchie of <hi>Venissa,</hi> belonging to the Pope, and wherein for the terme of welneere eightie yeeres, they held their Pontificall See, there dwelt a young Gentlewoman of some twentie yeeres of age, tearmed <hi>Madamoyselle Laurieta,</hi> whose father and mother being dead, was left alone to her selfe, their onely childe and heire, being richer in beautie then lands, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with many excellent qualities and perfections, which gave grace and lustre to her beautie, as her beautie did to them: For shee spake the Latine and Italian tongue perfect, was very expert and excellent in singing, dancing, musicke, painting, and the like, which made her famous in that Citie. But as there needs but one vice to eclipse and drowne many vertues; so this faire <hi>Laurieta</hi> was more beautifull then chaste, and not halfe so modest as lascivious. It is as great a happinesse for children to enjoy their Parents, as a miserie to want them: For <hi>Laurieta's</hi> Father and Mother had been infinitely carefull and curious to traine her up in the Schoole of Vertue and Pietie, and wherein her youth had (during the terme of their lives) made a happie entrance, and as I may say, a fortunate and glorious progression: But when God, the great Moderator, and soveraigne Iudge of the world, had in his eternall Decree and sacred Providence taken them out of this world, then <hi>Laurieta</hi> was left to the wide world, and to the vanitie thereof, without guide or governour, exposed to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the fortunes, or rather the misfortunes of the times, as a Ship without Pilot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>cation, wherein (it grieves mee to relate) shee tooke a great delight and felicitie. But shee shall pay deare for this bitter-sweet vice of hers: yea, and though it seeme to begin in content and pleasure, yet wee shall assuredly see it end in shame, repentance and misery: for this sinne of Whoredome betrayes, when it seemes to delight us, and strangleth, when it makes greatest shew to imbrace us: so sweet and pure vertues, are modestie and chastitie; so foule and fatall vices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence and lust. But hee with whom shee was most familiar, and to whom shee imparted the greatest part of her favours, was to one <hi>Monsieur de Belluile,</hi> a proper yong Gentleman, dwelling neere the Citie of <hi>Arles,</hi> by birth and extraction, noble, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise more rich then wise: who comming to <hi>Avignion,</hi> no sooner saw <hi>Laurieta,</hi> but hee both gloried in the sight of her singular, and triumphed in the contemplation of her exquisite and incomparable beautie, making that his best content, and this his sweetest felicitie; that, his soveraigne good; and this, his heaven upon earth: so as losing himselfe in the labyrinth of her beautie, and as it were drowning his thoughts in the sea of his concupiscence and sensualitie, hee spends not onely his whole time, but a great part of his wealth, in wantonizing and entertaining her: a vicious and foule fault, not onely peculiar to <hi>Belluile,</hi> but incident and fatall to too many Gallants, as well of most parts of Christendome in generall, as of <hi>France</hi> in particular; it being indeed a disasterous and dangerous rocke, whereon many inconsiderate and wretched Gentlemen have suffered shipwrack, not only of their reputations, healths and estates, but many times of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>In the meane time, <hi>Laurieta</hi> (more jealous of her same, then carefull to preserve her chastitie) is advertised, that <hi>Belluile</hi> is not content to cull the dainties of her beautie
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:16653:81"/>
and youth, but hee forgets himselfe and his discretion so farre, as to vaunt thereof, by letting fall some speeches, tending to the blemish and disparagement of her honour: so as vaine and lascivious as shee is, yet the touching of this string, affords her harsh and distastfull melodie: For shee will seeke to cover her shame by her hypocrisie and so resolves to make him know the foulenesse of his offence, in that of his basenesse and ingratitude. To which end, at her first interview and meeting of him, shee not onely checks him for it, but forbids and banisheth him her company: which indeed had been a just cause and opportunitie for him to have converted his lust into chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and his folly into repentance. But hee is too dissolute and vicious, to bee so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily reclaimed from <hi>Laurieta;</hi> and therefore hee is resolved, not onely to justifie his innocencie, but thereby also to persevere in his sinne: Hee is acquainted with many Gentlemen, who forgetting themselves, conceive a felicitie and glory, to erect the trophees of their vanities upon the disparagement of Ladies honours: yea, he seemes to be so farre from being guiltie of this errour, as hee taxeth and condemnes others, in being guiltie or accessary thereunto. So, although his Mistresse <hi>Laurieta</hi> remaine still coy, strange and haggard to him, yet hee persevereth in his affection to her; who at last judging of his innocencie by his constancie; and of that, by his many letters and presents which hee still sent her; as also observing that she had no firme grounds, nor could produce any pregnant or valable witnesses of this report; shee againe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeth her frownes into smiles, and so receives and intertaines him into her favour, onely with this premonition and caution, That if ever heereafter shee heard of his folly or ingratitude in this kinde, shee would never looke him in the face, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with contempt and detestation. So these their dis-joynted affections, as well by oathes as protestations, are againe confirmed and cimented: but such lustfull contracts, and lascivious familiarities and sympathies, seldome or never make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous ends.</p>
                     <p>Now to give forme and life to this Historie: Not long after, a brave young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Mompillier,</hi> named <hi>Monsieur de Poligny,</hi> having some occasion, comes to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignion,</hi> who frequenting their publike Balles or Dancings, no sooner saw our faire and beautifull <hi>Laurieta,</hi> but hee falls in love with her, and salutes and courts her: and from thencefoorth deemes her so fayre, as hee useth all meanes to become her servant, but not in the way of honour and Marriage, rather with a purpose to make her his Courtezan then his Wife. But hee sees himselfe deceived in the irregular passion of his affection: for <hi>Laurieta</hi> is averse, and will not bee either tractable or flexible to his desires: so as his suite is vaine, and shee so deafe to his requests, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his prayers, sighs, Letters, nor Presents are capable to purchase her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. <hi>Poligny</hi> infinitely grieves heereat, which notwithstanding makes the flame of his lust rather increase then diminish: so as after much pensivenesse, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to beat his witts, and to awaken his invention, how hee may crowne his desires by enjoying <hi>Laurieta,</hi> when loe, an occasion presenteth it selfe to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>La Palaisiere,</hi> having her heart pierced thorow with the love of <hi>Poligny,</hi> knowing him to bee <hi>Laurieta's</hi> servant, and shee the Mistresse of <hi>Belluile,</hi> either out of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or jealousie, or both, resolves at next meeting to acquaint <hi>Poligny</hi> with it, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by purposely to withdraw his affection from her to her selfe: The occasion is proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and opportunitie seemes to favour and second her desires. Some three dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the <hi>Iesuites</hi> (who as the Mountebanks and Panders of Kingdomes and Estates, leave no invention, nor Ceremony unattempted, to seduce and bewitch the affections of the world) cause their Schollers to act a Comedie in their Colledge in this Citie, whereat all the Nobilitie and Gentrie of the Citie and adjacent Countrey assemble and meet. Thither comes <hi>Poligny,</hi> hoping to see <hi>Laurieta,</hi> and <hi>la Palaisiere</hi> to see <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny:</hi> but <hi>Laurieta</hi> that day is sicke, and <hi>Belluile</hi> stayes with her to comfort her. So first comes <hi>Poligny,</hi> and seeing hee could not see his <hi>Laurieta,</hi> sits downe pensively: then comes <hi>la Palaisiere,</hi> and seeing <hi>Poligny</hi> a farre off, prayes her brother, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her, to place her neere him. <hi>Poligny</hi> can doe no lesse then salute her, and shee triumphing in her good fortune, takes the advantage of this occasion, and in sweet and sugered termes (after many pauses, sighs and blushes) gives him to understand, that shee knew his affection to <hi>Laurieta,</hi> and withall, that <hi>Belluile</hi> and no other was her servant and favourite.

This <hi>Lucilla, Poligny</hi> winns with gold, in consideration whereof, shee reveales him all, how <hi>Belluile</hi> was her chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Minion and Favourite: and yet, for some words hee the other day in ignorance or Wine, let fall to the prejudice of her honour, shee was like to casheere and discard him. <hi>Lucilla</hi> having thus forgotten her owne fidelitie, in bewraying the dishonour of her Mistresse; <hi>Poligny</hi> understanding <hi>Belluile</hi> to bee a coward of his hands, though not of his tongue; and in a word, not to bee so compleate a Gallant as hee supposed him, hee of a subtill and malicious invention resolves to worke on him; and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a plot, which wee shall see presently put in execution and acted: hee very poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikely puts a good face on all his discontents and passions: and although <hi>Laurieta</hi> would not see him, yet hee fairely intrudes himselfe into <hi>Belluile's</hi> company, and of purpose becomes familiar with him. So they very often meet: for they sence, dance, ride, vault and hunt together: so as at last none are so great Consorts and Camme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades as they. But <hi>Poligny</hi> thinking every houre a yeere, before hee had played his prize, makes a partie at Tennis with <hi>Belluile</hi> for a collation, and beats him; and so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king two Gentlemen, <hi>La Fontaine,</hi> and <hi>Borelles,</hi> his friends with them, away they go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So the next morne they all take horse for <hi>Orenge:</hi> but first <hi>Belluile</hi> gives his Mistresse <hi>Laurieta</hi> the good morrow, and acquaints her with his journey. They view this old Citie, the ancient patrimony and Principalitie of the <hi>Illustrious Princes of Orenge,</hi> from whence they derive their name: where <hi>Poligny</hi> having given order for the dinner, away they goe, visite the Castle, and salute the deputed Governour thereof <hi>Monsieur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Surely no, replies <hi>Belluile,</hi> for I am confident, that for Iewes and Courtizans, for the greatnesse of it, it may compare with the best Citie of <hi>Italy:</hi> for from the Lady to the Kitchin-mayd I dare say they'l all proove tractable.

Indeed, replies <hi>Poligny,</hi> if I knew you had a Mistresse of that complexion, I would adventure a glasse of Claret to her health. When <hi>Belluile</hi> (out of a phantastick French humour) affirmed he had a Mistris, whose beauty was so excellent, as he knew hee could not receive shame to name her; and if you please to honour her selfe and mee with her health, I proclaime that <hi>Madamoyselle Laurieta</hi> is my Mistresse, and my selfe her servant.</p>
                     <p>Of wise and Christian Gentlemen, what prophane speeches and debosht table-talke are these they use heere, as if their glory consisted in their shame, or their best ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were to bee discovered in the worst of vices? For howsoever the Viands they did eate, may preserve the health of their bodies, yet this dissolute communication of theirs must needs poyson and destroy that of their soules: for as they should praise God in the receit of the one; so contrariwise they incense and displease his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majestie in giving him the other: yea, this is so farre from Christianitie and heaven, as it is the high and true way to Atheisme and hell: for whores and healths, instead of prayer and thankesgiving, are the prodigious and certaine forerunners of a seared conscience, and the dangerous and execrable symptoms of a leprous soule.</p>
                     <p>Birds are taken by their feet, and men by their tongues. <hi>Belluile</hi> having so base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sottishly abused himselfe in the disparaging of his Mistresse <hi>Laurieta, Poligny</hi> hath his errand, for which hee purposely came to <hi>Orenge.</hi> So dinner ended, they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleasantly returne for <hi>Avignion.</hi> That night <hi>Poligny</hi> cannot sleepe for joy, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for revenge: For now hee presumes to know how to worke himselfe into <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieta's</hi> favour, by unhorsing <hi>Belluile.</hi> It is a dishonest and base part to betray our friend, and under the cloake of friendship and familiarity, to harbour and retaine malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: but this irregular and violent passion of love in young and unstayed judgements, many times beares downe all other respects and considerations.

So they divulge it in the City, whereof <hi>Laurieta</hi> being advertised, she sends a confident Gentleman, a cousin germane of hers, to finde out <hi>Belluile</hi> and to know the truth and issue of his combate; but indeed his cowardise hath purchased him so much shame, as hee will not bee seene, much lesse spoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: which <hi>Lauricta</hi> understanding, beginnes conceive that the two Souldiers report was true, and that undoubtedly hee and <hi>Poligny</hi> had met and fought in her behalfe: whereupon ghessing at the truth, that <hi>Poligny</hi> had given <hi>Belluile</hi> the foyle, she was once of opinion to have written to <hi>Poligny,</hi> to bee informed of the particulars and successe of their combat, which so much imported as well her honour as her content. But <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny's</hi> affection prevents her curiosity: for as she was calling for pen and paper, hee in person ascends the stayres to her Chamber, where, after a complementall and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous salute, he informes her (as we have formerly understood) that hee hath given <hi>Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile</hi> two wounds for her sake, and now his life for his owne. She demands if he himself were not hurt; hee answers, No. At both which good newes shee infinitely rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, and in token of her thankfulnesse permits him to gather many kisses, as well from the roses of her cheekes, as the cherries of her lips: and so from thenceforth he vowes to be her professed servant; and she promiseth him to bee, though not his Mistresse, yet at least his friend. And here they unite and combine their affections: but that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and this familiarity, written onely in vice, and sealed in lust, we shall shortly see cancelled and annihilated, with as much pitty, as infamy and misery, as the sequell of this History will shew and demonstrate.</p>
                     <p>Whiles thus <hi>Laurieta</hi> and <hi>Poligny</hi> are triumphing in <hi>Belluiles</hi> foyle, and their owne familiarity and affection, how is it possible but he must infinitely grieve for his losse of <hi>Laurieta,</hi> and <hi>la Palaisiere</hi> as much sorrow to see her selfe deprived and out of hope of her <hi>Poligny?</hi> But they brooke their afflictions and passions with variable resolutions; for whiles <hi>la Palaisiere</hi> is imbathing her selfe in her teares and discontents, <hi>Belluile</hi> is resolute to quench his revenge in <hi>Poligny's</hi> blood. For forgetting as well his God as his soule, his honor as himself, he intends to doe it by the bye, and not by the maine, by execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treachery, not by magnanimous generosity; yea, the devil is so strong with his faith because that is so weake with his Saviour and Redeemer, as shutting the doores of his humanity and charity, hee opens them to Choller, Revenge, and Murther; yea, and henceforth he is so inraged, and his lookes are so gastly and distracted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if his thoughts were conducting and incouraging his hands to perpetrate some bloody stratagem and designe: which is observed and doubted by his chiefest familiars and intimate friends, as also by <hi>la Palaisiere,</hi> whose company hee sometimes frequents, not so much out of affection to her, as for consolation from her to himselfe, sith wee are subject both to hope and believe that our afflictions are partly eased and diminished by the sight and relation of that of others, as sympathizing and participating with them; first in their flames of love, then of griefe and sorrow, in being disdayned of those wee love.

                     <p>Now to put the better colour on his villany, hee retires himselfe from <hi>Avignion,</hi> and lives privately some sixe dayes in <hi>Orenge,</hi> giving it out, that hee was gone to the City of <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> where, at that famous court of Parliament he had a Processe for a title of Land, shortly to bee adjudged; and so in a darke night, taking none but his Lacky with him, he being disguised, in favour of money, passeth the gate of <hi>Avigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and giving his horse to his Lackey, being secretly informed that <hi>Poligny</hi> was with <hi>Laurieta,</hi> he goes directly to her doore, and there at the corner of a little street stands with his Rapier drawne under his cloake, with a revenging and greedy desire of blood to awayt <hi>Poligny's</hi> comming forth.

But they shall be deceived herein: for there are Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call stormes arising, to trouble the serenity of this Marriage, and the felicity and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of these affections.</p>
                     <p>For it is both with griefe and shame, that I must bee so immodest, and therefore unfortunate to relate, that the old Baron <hi>Iacomo de Castelnovo,</hi> aged of some three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and eight yeares, hath so farre forgotten his God and himselfe, his conscience and his soule, grace and nature, religion and humanity, as gazing on the fresh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious beauty of our sweete Lady <hi>Perina,</hi> his owne sonnes wife, hee gives the reignes both of his obscene desires, and inordinate affections, to lust after her. O how my heart trembles, to thinke how he that is white with the snow of a venerable age, should now lasciviously idolatrize to beauty! how he that hath (as it were) one foot in his grave, should lustfully desire to have the other in his Sonnes bed! how hee that hath his veines dryed up and withered, and nothing living in him but desire, should yet of all the beauties of the world, desire onely to enjoy that of his Sonnes wife! how hee, that hath scarce any time left him to bee repentant and sorrowfull for his old sinnes, will now anew make himselfe guiltie of these foule sinnes of Adultery, and I may in a manner say of Incest! how hee that hath not given the flower of his youth, will yet still lasciviously and wilfully refuse to bestow the branne of his age on his God! Alas miserable <hi>Castelnovo,</hi> wrerched old man, or rather lubritious and beastly Lecher, thus to drowne thy thoughts in the hell of concupiscence and adultery, when it were farre fitter thou shouldest lift them up to heaven, in the sacrifice of prayer, and other pious and religious contemplations! But all this will not prevaile to stop the current of his voluptuousnesse, and the progression of his sensuality: for without respect of his God, or regard of his soule, hee is resolute in his desires to make a strumpet of his Daughter in Law, and to make his Sonnes wife his whore: but God will deceive his hopes, and prevent his villany.</p>
                     <p>Now the better, and sooner to drawe her to his lascivious desires, hee is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull courteous and affable to her, still walking and talking with her, yea, and many times kissing her, whereof both her Husband and selfe are infinitely joyfull, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Perina,</hi> because shee findes a great alteration in her fortune, in that her Father in Law <hi>Castelnovo</hi> proves as courteous to her, as her owne Father <hi>Arconeto</hi> is cruell.

His sonne <hi>Castelnovo</hi> not at all suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, or dreaming what a dangerous Snake lay lurking under the greene leaves of his fathers sugered speeches and perswasions, like a noble and generous Knight as he was, needes no other advocate but his owne honour and Martiall disposition to imba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>But as it is the nature of sinne so to betray and inveagle our judgements, that wee flatter our selves with a false conceit, none can perceive it in us; so this old lecher her Husband, thinking that hee had danced in a net, from the jealousie and suspicion of all the world, in thus affecting his Sonnes wife, hee like a lewd and wretched old varlet, is so farre from rellishing these his old wifes speeches and exhortations, or from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reclaymed thereby, as hee disdayneth both them and her, and from henceforth is so imperious, and withall bitter to her, as hee never lookes on her with affection, but envie: which neverthelesse she (as a modest wife, and grave Matrone) holds it a part not onely of her love, but of her duety, by sweete speeches, and soft meanes of perswasion, to divert him from this fond and lascivious humour of his. But observe the vanity of his lasciviousnesse, and the impiety of his thoughts and resolutions: for all her prayers and perswasions serve only rather to set, then rebate the edge of his lust, and rather bring oyle to increase, then water to quench the flame of his immodest and irregular affection, so as seeing that she stood in the way of obtayning his beastly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, he, like a prophane and barbarous Husband, termes her no more his wife, but his <hi>Medea;</hi> and which is worse, hee, out of the heat both of his lust and choller, vowes he will soone remove her from this world to another.</p>
                     <p>And here the devill, ambitious and desirous of nothing so much, as to fill up the emyty roomes of his vast and infernall kingdome, by miserable and execrable degrees takes possession first of his thoughts, then of his heart, and lastly of his soule; so as being constant in his indignation and choller, and resolute in this his impious and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy revenge, hee meanes to dispatch and murther her, who for the terme of forty two yeares had beene his most loving wife, and faithfull bed-fellow: but withall hee will act it so privately, as not having as yet discovered his affection to his daughter <hi>Perina,</hi> hee will therefore conceale both from her and all the world the Murther of this his wife <hi>Fidelia,</hi> except only to those gracelesse and execrable Agents he meant imploy in this mournefull and bloudy businesse.</p>
                     <p>To which end (with a hellish ratiocination) ruminating and revolving on the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof, hee having runne over the circumstances of many violent and tragicall deaths, at last resolves to poyson her; and deemes none so fit to undertake it, as her
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16653:94"/>
owne Wayting-gentlewoman <hi>Ierantha:</hi> the which authorized by his former lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dalliance with her, as also in favour of five hundred Ducats, that he will give her, hee is confident shee will undertake and finish; neither doth hee faile in his bloudy hopes. For what with the honey of his flattering speches, and the sugar of his Gold, she, like an infernall Fury, and a very Monster of her sexe, most ingratefully and inhumanely consents thereunto; so as putting poyson into Whitebroth, which some mornings she was accustomed to make and give her Lady, it spreading into her veines, and exhaling the radicall humour of her life and strength, within eight dayes carries this aged and vertuous Matrone to her Grave, and her soule to Heaven. But her Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers shall pay deare for this her untimely end.</p>
                     <p>The Lady <hi>Perina,</hi> and all the Lady <hi>Fidelia's</hi> kinsfolkes and friends infinitely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bewayle her death; and indeed so doth the whole City of <hi>Nice,</hi> where for her descent and vertues shee is infinitely beloved and affected: but all these teares of theirs are nothing in comparison of those of her wicked and execrable Husband <hi>Castel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novo,</hi> who, although he inwardly rejoyce, yet he outwardly seemes to bee exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted and dejected. But as hee hath heretofore acted the part of a Murtherer, and now of an hypocrite; yet, have we but a little patience, and we shall see that detected, this unmasked, and both panished.</p>
                     <p>Whiles this mournefull Tragedy is acted in <hi>Nice,</hi> the mediation of the <hi>French King</hi> and <hi>Pope</hi> reconcile the differences, give end to the Warres, and conclude peace betwixt <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Savoy.</hi> So home returnes the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Feria,</hi> to <hi>Millan;</hi> the noble <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the generous <hi>Princes</hi> his Sonnes, to <hi>Turin;</hi> the <hi>Marshall de Desdiguieres,</hi> and the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Termes</hi> into <hi>France;</hi> and consequently home comes our Knight <hi>Castelnovo</hi> to <hi>Nice:</hi> where thinking to rejoyce with his young wife, hee is so unfortunate to mourne for the death of his old mother; but God knowes, that neither of them know the least sparke or shadow of her cruell and untimely Murther, and lesse, the cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Now for his lascivious and bloudy father, albeit, to cast a vaile before his thoughts, and his intents and actions, hee publikely mournes for his wifes death, and rejoyceth for his Sonnes returne; yet contrariwise hee privately mournes for this, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth for that. But to leave the remembrance of <hi>Fidelia,</hi> to assume that of our <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> I know not whether shee grieved more at her Husbands absence, or rejoyce at his presence, sith her affection to him was so tender and fervent, as in her heart and soule shee esteemed that as much her hell, as this her heaven upon earth: but these joyes of hers are but fires of straw, or flattering Sun-shines, which are suddenly either washed away with a showre, or eclipsed and banished by a Tempest: for whiles her hopes flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her beliefe of her Husbands continuall stay and residence with her, her Father in lawes lust to her, foreseeing and considering that it was impossible to thinke to obtaine her at home, e're her Husband, his Sonne, were againe imployed and sent abroad, makes all his thoughts aime, and care and industry tend that way, as if time had no power to make him repent the former murther of his wife, or Grace influence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the future defiling and dishonouring of his Daughter in law.</p>
                     <p>But hee is as constant in his lust to her, as resolute in his dispatching and sending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of him; onely hee must finde out some pregnant, vertuous, and honourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text and colour for the effecting of his designe and resolution, because he well knowes his Sonne <hi>Castelnovo</hi> is as wise and generous in himselfe, as amorous of his beautifull young Lady <hi>Perina:</hi> but his lust, which is the cause of his resolution, or rather his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which is the authour of his lust, at one time suggests him these two severall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments for his Sonne: either to send him into <hi>France</hi> with the <hi>Prince Major,</hi> who was larely contracted, and shortly to espouse <hi>MadameChristiene</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> second Sister; or else under the insinuation of some great Pensions and Offices that were shortly to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16653:94"/>
bee disposed of in <hi>Malta,</hi> againe to send him backe thither: and his harping on these two strings, was the onely musicke and melody which hee now gave his Sonne; who after hee had a moneth or two at most, recreated himselfe in the sweet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his deare and sweet wife <hi>Perina,</hi> hee least of all aiming whereat his father ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by his absence againe gives way, and consents to his desires of his departure: onely the choyce of these two different imployments is yet questionable and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved of 'twixt the father and the sonne. For as the sonnes curiosity desireth to see the Court of <hi>France,</hi> which as yet he hath not seen; so his fathers lust and malice is to have his returne honourably to <hi>Malta,</hi> from whence hee hath formerly received his honour of Knighthood, and there to obtaine a Pension during the terme of his life. The sonne imbrace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So all things prepared and ready for his Voyage, <hi>Perina</hi> importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately begging, and her husband <hi>Castelnovo</hi> confidently promising his speedy returne, shee conducting him over the Hill to <hi>Villafranca</hi> in her Coach, they there, with many re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus leaving the sonne floating and wasting on the seas, let us againe returne to his unnaturall and beastly father, who seeing his wife gone to Heaven, and his sonne to <hi>Malta,</hi> and all things hitherto to succeed according to his lascivious desires, doth now assure himselfe, that either by faire or soule meanes hee will reape his pleasure of his beautifull daughter in law <hi>Perina.</hi> To which end hee gives her the sole governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and superintendance of his house, with intent and hope the sooner to governe, and surer to command her: and so forgetting modesty, and his lust giving a law to his conscience, fifteene dayes are scarce past, till finding her in her chamber playing on her Lute, hee, after some pauses, coughes, and kisses, bewrayes and vomitteth her forth his fervent affection and desire.</p>

and so very hastily and chollerickly abandoneth his presence, and her owne chamber. At which hee bites his lip for rage, and hangs downe his head for indignation. But at last, sinne and the devill raigning in him, makes that hee will not take this her first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse for his last answer and denyall: but resolute to persevere in his lubricitie, hee in every walke, garden and roome, frequents and haunts her as her ghost, as thinking to obtaine that from her through his importunity, which hee could not by his perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but this his impudencie shall not prevaile.</p>
                     <p>Now as his sinfull motion infinitely grieved her, so his perseverance and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie therein doth doubly afflict and torment her: how to appease this storme, to quench the fire of his lust, and deface the remembrance and feeling of her griefe, she knowes not. For alas, alas, shee is so unhappy, as her owne father <hi>Arconeto,</hi> and her Aunt <hi>Dominica</hi> are at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn de Mauriene,</hi> her sweet and deare husband in <hi>Malta,</hi> and her mother in law, the Lady <hi>Fidelia</hi> in heaven; so as shee hath no intimate nor secret familiars, nor any bosome friend to reveale these her sorrowes and afflictions.

And so for her part, hating the father as much as shee loved the sonne her husband, hee could not bee more prodigall of his lewde speeches and tentations to her, then shee was of her sighes and teares to understand and repell them.

Whiles <hi>Sabia</hi> is againe speeding toward <hi>Malta</hi> with <hi>Perina's</hi> second Letter to her husband <hi>Castelnovo,</hi> wee will a little speake of old <hi>Castelnovo</hi> the father, who seeing his daughter in law <hi>Perina</hi> fled, and consequently his hopes with her, hee is extremely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and afflicted hereat: All the house and City is sought for her, and hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe breakes off the lockes of her Chamber doore, where hee findes the nest, but the bird flowne away, her bed, but not her selfe: so as his thoughts doubly torment and astonish him, first to be frustrated of his hopes and desires to injoy her, then, because shee will bewray his lascivious suite and affection to her Husband his sonne, which of all sides will procure him not onely shame, but infamy; yea, now it is, although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would not, that he sees his errour, and vanity, in attempting to make shipwrack of her honour and chastity, which is the Glory, and should be the <hi>Palladium</hi> of Ladies: but it is too late to recover her againe: And therefore although hee know how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, yet he is ignorant how to remedy or redeeme it, sith his attempt and enterprise was not onely odious to God, but infamous to men, opposite to Grace, and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and contradictory to Nature.

Wherefore, admiring who in <hi>Nice,</hi> yea, in his fathers house should bee so impudently laseivious, to seeke to blemish his honour, in that of his Ladies, hee, making her sighes and teares his, with all expedition and haste provides for his departure from <hi>Malta;</hi> and yet his love, his feare, or both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and concurring in one, makes him instantly resolve to dispatch and returne <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> as the harbinger to proclaime his comming: the which he doth, and chargeth him with this Letter to his faire wife, and deare Lady <hi>Perina:</hi>

This vertuous and religious Letter of the Father prevailes with the Sonne, and his faire and chast Lady; so as their secrecies and discretions hush up this businesse in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and within eight dayes they both returne from <hi>Saint Iohn de Mauriene</hi> to <hi>Nice:</hi> where they are conrteously welcomed, and respectively received and entertayned of their father, whose contrition for his former folly is outwardly so great, as hee hath teares in his eyes at the remembrance thereof: so as making good the promise of his Letter, he very penitently and sorrowfully implores their pardon and remission; which they instantly graunt him with as much willingnesse as alacrity. So the report and thought hereof is obscured and vanished, as if it had never been; and all things and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties so reconciled, as to common sense nothing in the world is capable to trouble the tranquillity of this reconciliation and atonement. But alas, alas, we shall very briefly see the contrary: For old <hi>Castelnovo</hi> the Father, notwithstanding all these religious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and sincere shewes of repentance and teares, is so far from being the man he seemes to be, as although hee have made his peace with his sonne and Daughter, yet, ay mee, I write it with griefe, he hath not with his conscience, nor his conscience with God: for although he have a chast and religious tongue, yet he still retaineth a lascivious and adulterate heart; yea, hee is so farre from conversion and reformation, as the new sight and review of the Lady <hi>Perina's</hi> fresh and delicate beauty doth revive those sparkes, and refresh those flames of his lust, which seemed to be raked up in the embers of her absence. And what is this, but to be a Christian in shew, and a miscreant in effect? to hide a foule soule under a faire face? and to make Religion and Hypocrisie, a fatall and miserable cloke for his villany? But though he dissemble with God, yet wee shall see, and hee finde, that God will not dissemble with him; and in thinking to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>tray God, Satan in the end will betray him. The manner is thus:</p>
                     <p>As he resumes his old suit, and newly burnes in love and lustfull desire, to erect the Trophees of his lascivious and incestuous pleasures upon the ruines of his Daughter in lawes chastity and honour; so he likewise sees it impossible to thinke to performe, or hope to accomplish it, as long as his sonne her husband lives: and therefore, losing his judgement either in the Labyrinth of her beauty, or in the turbulent Ocean of his owne concupiscence and lust, hee, contrary to the rules of Grace, and the lawes and principles of nature, swaps a bargaine with the Devill to poyson him. To which end, to shew himselfe the monster of men, and the bloudiest president of a most degenerate Father, which this, or many precedentages ever produced or afforded, he hath againe recourse to his Hellish Agent <hi>Ierantha,</hi> in favour of five hundred Ducats, to send the Sonne into Heaven after the Mother, and to make him equall with her, as in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so in (the dissolution thereof) death: A bloudy designe, and mournefull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which wee shall presently bee inforced to see acted upon the Theater of this History.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Ierantha</hi> is at first so repentant for the death of the Mother, as shee will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to that of the Sonne. And had shee continued in this religious resolution, shee had lived more fortunately, and not dyed so miserably and shamefully, as wee shall briefely see. For our old Lecher <hi>Castelnovo,</hi> her Master, seeing his Gold could not this second time prevaile with <hi>Ierantha,</hi> being equally inflamed as well with lust to <hi>Perina,</hi> as with malice and revenge to his Sonne <hi>Castelnovo</hi> her husband, hee is so implacable therein, as hee promiseth to marry her, if shee will attempt and performe it. So although his first battery fayled, yet his second doeth not: For the Devill had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ade her so ambitious of Greatnesse and Honour, that of a simple wayting Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman to become a great Lady, she consents heereunto; and, which is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pitties to report, within lesse then sixe dayes performes it; when (God knowes)
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16653:98"/>
the innocencie of this harmelesse young Gentleman his sonne never dreamt or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it.</p>
                     <p>At the sight of this his sudden death, his Lady <hi>Perina</hi> is ready to dye for griefe; yea to drowne her selfe in the <hi>Ocean</hi> and deluge of her teares; tearing her haire, and striving to deface the excellencie of her beautie, with a kinde of carelesse neglect, as if shee were resolute not to survive him. And if the Lady <hi>Perina</hi> bewrayed many deplorable demonstrations of sorrow for the death of her husband, no lesse, doth his father <hi>Castelnovo</hi> for that of his sonne; onely their griefes (comformable to their passions) are diametrically different and opposite: for hers were fervent and true, as proceeding from the sinceritie of her affection; and his hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and faigned, as derived from the profundity of his malice and revenge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. And not to transgresse from the <hi>Decorum</hi> and truth of our History, old <hi>Castelnovo</hi> could not so artificially beare and over-vaile his sorrowes for his Sonnes death, but (the premises considered) our young afflicted widdow and Lady vehemently suspecteth hee hath a hand therein; and likewise partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves that <hi>Ierantha</hi> is likewise accessary and ingaged therein, in respect she lookes more aloft, and is growne more familiar with her Lord and Master then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And indeed as her sorrows increase her jealousie, so her jealousie throws her into a passionate and violent resolution of Revenge, both against him and her, if shee can bee futurely assured that they had Murthered and poysoned the Knight her husband.</p>
                     <p>Now to bee assured heereof, shee thus reasoneth with her selfe; that if her Father in law were the Murtherer of his Sonne her husband, his malice and hatred to him proceeded from his beastly lust to her selfe; and that hee now dispatched, hee would againe shortly revive and renew his old lascivious suit to her: which if hee did, shee vowes to take a sharpe and cruell Revenge of him, which shee will limit with no lesse then his death. And indeed wee shall not goe farre to see the event and truth answer her suspicion. For within a moneth or two after her husband was laid in his untimely grave, his old lustfull and las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious father doth againe burst and vomit forth his beastly sollicitations against her chastity and honour: which observing, shee somewhat disdainefully and coyly puts him off, but yet not so passionately nor chollerickely as before, onely of purpose to make him the more eager in his pursuit, thereby the better to draw him to her lure, that shee might perpetrate her malice, and act her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on him, and so make his death the object of her rage and indignation, as his lust and malice were the cause of the sorrowes of her life. But unfortunate and miserable Lady, what a bloudy and hellish enterprize dost thou ingage thy selfe in, and why hath thy affection so blinded thy conscience and soule, to make thy selfe the authour and actour of so mournefull and bloudy a Tragedy? For alas alas, sweet <hi>Perina,</hi> I know not whether more to commend thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thy husband, or condemne thy cruell malice intended to his father. For O griefe! O pitty! where are thy vertues, where is thy Religion, where thy conscience, thy soule, thy God, thus to give thy selfe over to the hellish ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Satan? Thou which heretofore fled'st from adultery, wilt thou now follow Murther? or because thy heart would not bee accessary to that, shall thy soule bee now so irreligious and impious, to bee guilty of this? But as her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law is resolute in his lust towards her, so is shee likewise in her revenge towards him, and farre the more, in that shee perceives <hi>Ierantha's</hi> great belly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proclaimes that shee hath plaid the strumpet; and which is worse, shee
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16653:98"/>
feares, with her execrable and wretched Father in Law: so as now no longer able to stop the furious and impetuous current of her revenge, shee is so gracelesse and bloudy, as shee vowes first to dispatch the Lord and Master, then the Wayting-Gentlewoman, as her thoughts and soule suggest her they had done first the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then the Sonne: so impious are her thoughts, so inhumane and bloudy her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions.</p>
                     <p>Now in the <hi>interim</hi> of this time the old Lecher her father is againe become impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and importunate in his suit. so our wretched Lady <hi>Perina</hi> degenerating from her former vertues, and indeed from her selfe, she, after many requests and sollicitations, very feignedly seemes to yeild, and strike sayle to his desire; but indeed with a bloody intent to dispach him out of this world. So having concluded this sinfull fatall Match, there wants nothing but the finishing and accomplishing thereof: onely they differ in the manner and circumstances: the Father is desirous to goe to the Daughter in lawes bed, the Daughter to the Father in lawes; but both conclude that the night, and not the day shall give end to this lascivious and beastly businesse; his reason is, to avoyd the jealousie and rage of <hi>Ierantha,</hi> whom now, although she bee neere her time of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; hee refuseth to marry her; but the Lady <hi>Perina's</hi> if, that she may pollute and staine his owne bed with his bloud, and not hers; but especially, because shee may have the fitter meanes to stab and murther him: and hereon they conclude. To which end, not only the night, but the houre is appoynted betwixt them: which being come, and <hi>Castelnovo</hi> in bed, burning with impatience and desire for her arrivall, hee thinking on nothing but his beastly pleasures, nor she, but on her cruell malice and revenge: she softly enters his chamber, but not in her night, but her day attire, having a <hi>Pisa</hi> Ponyard close in her fleeve; when having bolted his Chamber doore, because none should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert her from this her bloudy designe; she approaching his bed, and hee lifting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe up purposely to welcome and kisse her, shee seeing his brest open and naked, like an incensed fury, drawes out her Ponyard, and uttering these words: <hi>Thou wretched Whore-master and Murtherer, this life of mine owne honour, and the death of my deare Knight and husband, thy some.</hi> And so stabbing him at the heart with many blowes shee kills him starke dead, and leaves him reeking in his hot bloud, without giving him time to speake a word; onely hee fetcht a screeke and groane or two, as his soule tooke her last farewell of his body. Which being over-heard of the servants of the house, they ascend his chamber, and finde our inhumane <hi>Perina</hi> issuing foorth, all gored with the effusion of his bloud, having the bloudy Ponyard, which was the fatall Instrument of this cruell Murther in her hand. They are amazed at this bloody and mournefull spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle: so they seize on her, and the report hereof flying thorow the City, the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Iudges that night cause her to bee imprisoned for the fact, which she is resolved no way to denye, but to acknowledge, as rather glorying then grieving thereat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ierantha,</hi> at the very first understanding hereof, vehemently suspects that her two poysoning Murthers will now come to light; and so, as great as her belly is, she, to provide for her safety, very secretly steales away to a deare friends house of hers in the City, which now from all parts rattleth and resoundeth of this cruell and unnaturall Murther; yea, it likewise passeth the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and is speedily bruited and knowne in <hi>Saint Iohn de Mauriene,</hi> where although her father <hi>Arconeto</hi> would never heretofore affect her, yet he now exceedingly grieves at this her bloudy attempt and imminent danger: but her irregular affection, and inhumane revenge, will not as yet permit her conscience to informe and shew her the haynousnesse of her cruell and bloody fact. But God will be more mercifull to her and her soule.</p>
                     <p>Some two dayes after shee is arraigned for the same, where she freely confesseth-it,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16653:99"/>
having nothing to alledge for her excuse, but that shee perfectly knew, that her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law <hi>Castenovo</hi> and his Strumpet <hi>Ierantha</hi> had at least poysoned the Knight her husband, if not likewise the Lady <hi>Fidelia</hi> his mother; the which although they had some reason and ground to suspect, because of <hi>Ierantha's</hi> sudden slight, yet sith this could no way diminish, or extenuate her Murther of her Father in law, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our unfortunate Lady <hi>Perina</hi> to bee hanged, and so re-send her to prison, to prepare her selfe to dye. But the advice of some, and the friendship and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of others, as pittying her youth and beauty, and commending her chastity and affection to her Knight and Husband, counsell and perswade her to appeale from the Sentence of the Court of <hi>Nice,</hi> to the Senate of <hi>Chambery</hi> (which is the Soveraigne and Capitall of <hi>Savoy)</hi> whither wee shall shortly see her conducted and brought.</p>
                     <p>In which meane time let us observe the wonderfull justice and providence of God shewed likewise upon this execrable Wayting-gentlewoman <hi>Ierantha,</hi> for so cruelly poysoning the Lady <hi>Fidelia,</hi> and the Knight <hi>Castelnovo</hi> her Sonne; who, although search were every where made for her, yet she having husht her selfe up privately, albeit her bloudy thoughts and guilty conscience for the same continually torture and torment her, yet shee is so impious and gracelesse, as shee no way feares the danger of the law, and much lesse the severe tempest of Gods indignation and revenge, which now not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding in the middest of her security will, according to her bloudy deserts and crimes, suddenly surprise and overtake her: for now this accident of her Lord <hi>Castel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novo</hi>'s Murther, and of the Lady <hi>Perina's</hi> imprisonment, or to speake more properly and truly, of Gods sacred decree and divine Iudgement, throwes her into the sharp and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paines of travell for child; with whose heart-killing gripes and convulsions, she is so miserably tortured and tormented, as shee her selfe, her Mid. wife, and all the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men neere her, judge and thinke it impossible for her to escape death: when seeing no hope of life, and that already her pangs and torments had made her but as it were the very image and anatomy of death, shee beginnes to looke from Sinne to repentance from Earth to Heaven, and from Satan to God; and so taking on and assuming Christian resolution, shee will not charge her soule with the concealing of this single Adultery, much lesse of her double Murthers; but very penitently confesseth all, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> well it, as them; and so commits her selfe to the unparalleld and mercilesse mercies of her paynes and torments, hoping they will speedily send her from this world to a better. But her Adultery and Murthers are such odious and execrable crimes in God sight, as he will free her from these dangers of child-birth, and because worthy, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve her for a shamefull and infamous death. So she is fafely delivered of a young son, who is more faire then happy, as being the off-spring of lascivious parents, and the issue of an adulterous bed; and by Gods providence and her owne confession, shee, for these her beastly and bloudy crimes, is the second day committed to prison, and the third hang'd and burnt in <hi>Nice,</hi> and her ashes throwne into the aire. A just reward and punishment for so hellish and inhumane a Gentlewoman; who, though otherwise shee shewed many testimonies and signes of Repentance at her end, yet her crime were so foule and odious to the World, as at her death shee was so miserable as shee found not one spectatour, either to weepe for her, or to lament, or condol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Bertolini</hi> sees that <hi>Brellati</hi> hath a faire and delicate sister, named <hi>Dona Paulina,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what younger then himselfe, and yet not so young, but that the clocke of her age hath strucken eighteene, and therefore proclaimed her at least capeable, if not desirous of marriage, and although hee bee a novice in the Art of love, yet Nature hath made him so good a Scholler in the principles and rudiments thereof, as hee sees her faire, and therefore must love her; rich in the excellencie and delicacie of beautie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is resolute to love her, and onely her: for gazing on the influence and splendour of her piercing eyes, hee cannot behold them without wonder, and then prying and contemplating on the roseat and lillie tincture of her cheekes, he cannot see these with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out admiration, nor refraine from admiring them without affection: but againe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking the slendernes of her bodie, and the sweetnesse of her vertues, and seeing her as gracious as faire, and that her inward perfections added as much lustre to her exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour beautie, as this reflected ornament and decoration to these, hee, as young as he was, vowes himselfe her servant, and withall swore, that either shee, or his grave, must bee his wife and Mistresse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bertolini</hi> thus surprized and netled with the beautie of his dearely sweet, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faire, <hi>Paulina,</hi> hee is inforced to neglect a great part of his accompanying the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:16653:101"/>
thereby to court the sister: so hee many times purposely forsakes <hi>Brellati</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Paulina,</hi> and delights in nothing so much as in her presence, and (in that regard) in his absence, not that it was possible, in his conceit and imagination, for him any way to hate him, in loving her; rather, that in generall tearmes hee must love <hi>Brellati</hi> for <hi>Paulina's</hi> sake; and in particular, onely affect her for his owne. And as his wealth and ambition made him confident hee should obtaine her for his wife: so hee in faire, amorous, and honourable tearmes, as well by his owne sollicitations, Letters, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and presents, as by those of his parents, seekes her in marriage: yea, and when these could not suffice, hee, to shew himselfe as true as fervent a lover, addes sighes, teares, prayers, and oathes. But all these sollicitours serve only to betray and deceive his hopes: for if <hi>Bertolini</hi> were extreamely desirous to marry <hi>Paulina,</hi> shee is as reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute not to match him: which discords in affection, seldome or never make any true harmony in mindes.</p>
                     <p>His wealth deceiving him, hee hath recourse to her onely brother, and his best and dearest friend <hi>Brellati,</hi> to whom he relates the profundity and fervencie of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his sister <hi>Paulina,</hi> acquaints him with his suite, and her denyall; his attempt, and her repulse therein; and by the power and bonds of all their former friendship and familiarity, intreates and conjures him to become his oratour and advocate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, in his behalfe; whose smiles, hee alledgeth, are his life, and frownes, his death. <hi>Brellati</hi> having his generosity and judgement blinded with the respect of <hi>Berto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini</hi> his wealth, as also of the affection hee bore him; all other considerations laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, like a better friend to him, then a brother to his sister <hi>Paulina,</hi> promiseth him his best furtherance and assistance in the processe of this his affection: and so with his truest Oratory, best Eloquence, and sweetest Perswasion, begins to deale effectually with her herein. But as our hopes are subject and incident to deceive us, so <hi>Bertolini</hi> and <hi>Brellati</hi> come farre too short of theirs: for <hi>Paulina</hi> in absolute and down-right termes, prays her brother to informe and resolve <hi>Bertolini,</hi> that she hath otherways setled and ingaged her affection: and therefore prayes him to seeke another Mistresse, sith shee hath found another Lover and Servant, with whom she means to live and die. Her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>er (for his friends sake) is extremely sorrowfull hereat, and prayes his sister to name him her servant: shee bindes him by oath to secresie. So hee swearing, shee informes him it is <hi>Seignior Paulus Sturio,</hi> a very ancient Noble man of the Citie. Hee tels her, hee is a Gentleman more Noble then rich: and shee replies, that <hi>Bertolini</hi> is more rich then Noble; and therefore shee will refuse him, and marry <hi>Sturio.</hi> Hee is obstinate in his requests, as shee resolute in her denyall. So having performed the part of a friend for his friend, and commending the nobility and vertues of <hi>Sturio,</hi> as much as hee pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed the weakenesse of his estate and wealth, hee leaves his sister to her affection and designes: and so with an unwilling willingnes (without any extenuation) delivers his friend <hi>Bertolini</hi> her definitive answer; yet performes his promise to his sister, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing <hi>Sturio</hi> his name.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bertolini</hi> is all in fire and choller at this newes, and begins no longer to looke on his friend <hi>Brellati</hi> with the eyes of affection, but of contempt and indignation: and so consulting with his passion, not with his Iudgement; with rage, and not with reason; as immoderate anger seldome lookes right, commonly squint-eyed; hee in the heat of his wrath, and height of his revenge, very much neglects and slights him, yea and most uncivilly and abruptly departs from him, as if hee were no longer worthy of the bare complement of farewell. Which <hi>Brellati</hi> well observes, and in observing, remembers, and in remembring, grieves at, sith <hi>Bertolini</hi> was his most intimate and dearest friend; and in whose behalfe, did occasion present, hee was ready, not onely to sacrifice his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16653:102"/>
best service, but his best life. Lo here the first breach and violation, which <hi>Bertolini</hi> gives to their friendship: but the second is not farre behinde: For in the next company hee meets, which was some two dayes after, walking in <hi>Cardinall Farnesi</hi> his Galleries in presence of some foure or five other Gentlemen, both of his and of <hi>Brellati's</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, hee forgot himselfe so much, as some demanding for his consort <hi>Brellati,</hi> hee chollerickly replyed, that he was a base and beggerly Gentleman; and therfore hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth disdained his company, and that his sister <hi>Paulina</hi> was a lascivious and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling strumpet. But although the fire of his choller had foolishly banded forth these speeches in the ayre, yet they fell not to the ground; but some of the company then present, that very night report them to <hi>Brellati.</hi> It is impossible for my pen to relate how passionately and tenderly hee takes it: yea his affliction and griefe herein is far the more redoubled, in that (contrary to his desires and wishes) hee is assured his sister <hi>Paulina</hi> is likwise acquainted with the vanity and injustice of these speeches: the conceit and remembrance wherof, make her inraged and sorrowfull eyes powre forth many ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volets and rivers of teares, upon the Roses and Lillies of her beauty. But as she is two impatient to rellish this scandalous affront and disparagement: so her brother <hi>Brellati</hi> is too generous and noble to digest it; whereof burning to know the truth, and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, if hee found it true, sharpely to revenge it on <hi>Bertolini,</hi> hee passeth away the night in restlesse and distracted slumbers: And so the very next morne taking his Sword and Lackey with him, hee goes to <hi>Bertolini</hi> his fathers house, and meeting first with him, demands of him for his sonne <hi>Seignior Iohn Battista Bertolini.</hi> His father informes him, hee is in the Garden very solitarily walking, and prays <hi>Brellati</hi> to goe to him; who needing not many requests, entreth, and with his hat in his hand approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth him. <hi>Bertolini</hi> doth the like, and meetes him halfe way: when hee beeing pale for anger, and <hi>Bertolini</hi> blushing for shame, he prays him to exempt the Garden of his servants, because he hath something to reveale and impart him in secret, which needeth no witnesses: when <hi>Bertolini</hi> commanding his servants to depart, <hi>Brellati</hi> chargeth him with these disgracefull speeches, vomited forth two dayes since, against his honour; as also that of his onely deare sister <hi>Paulina,</hi> in <hi>Cardinall Farnesi</hi> his <hi>Palace,</hi> in presence of <hi>Seignior Alessandro Fontani, Seignior Rhanutio Pluvinio,</hi> and <hi>Seignior Antonio Voltomari</hi> (which words we have formerly understood.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bertolini</hi> is no way dismayed or daunted hereat, either in courage or complexion: and so losing his honour in his indiscretion, or rather burying his discretion in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour; hee with fire in his lookes; and thunder in his speeches, tells <hi>Brellati</hi> that hee confesseth these speeches his; adding withall, that what his tongue hath affirmed, his sword shall bee ready to make good and justifie; whereon they cover: When <hi>Brellati</hi> demanding of him if this were his last resolution, hee told him yea. Then (quoth he) I pray expect mine shortly: and so without giving each other the good morrow, they part; <hi>Brellati</hi> still leaving <hi>Bertolini</hi> in his fathers Garden. His sister <hi>Paulina</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of her brothers speaking with <hi>Bertolini,</hi> very curiously and carefully awaits his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne; when rushing into his Chamber, shee, with teares, and sighes, demands him of the issue of his conference with <hi>Bertolini,</hi> and whether hee were so impudent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver these dishonourable and base speeches both of her selfe and him. But her brother, like a true noble <hi>Romane,</hi> is too generous and brave to acquaint her with his designe and resolution: and so in generall tearmes prayes her, not to afflict her selfe at these speeches, and that this difference will bee very shortly decided and ended, to her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and his owne content. Brother (quoth shee) if you will not right mine honour, and vindicate the unspotted purity of my reputation, I am sure that my true Lover <hi>Seignior Paulus Sturio</hi> will, though with the hazzard and losse of his owne life, had hee
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:16653:102"/>
but the least notice thereof. Hee shall not need, sister, quoth hee: for a day or two will reconcile and finish this businesse: and so for that time hee leaves his sister <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and shuts himselfe up in his chamber; where, not long able to containe himselfe against the insolencie and basenesse of <hi>Bertolini,</hi> he cals for pen and paper, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting his honor then his life, writes him this challeng; the which immediately after dinner he sends him, by <hi>Seignior Valerio,</hi> a confident Gentleman his follower.</p>

And so <hi>Valerio</hi> takes his leave, and departs: when finding out his Master, he reports him <hi>Bertolini's</hi> answer: whereat hee is so farre from being any way appald or daunted, as hee infinitely rejoyceth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. In the meane time, hee is curious in preparing two singular good Rapiers and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards of equall length, hilts, and temper. And thus with much impatient patience (as Revenge is an enemy to sleepe) they not out-sleepe, but out-watch the night. So the morne and day stealing and breaking into their windowes, they are no sooner out of their beds, but into the field; their Chirurgions awayting their arrivals by the Pyramides, in the place of <hi>Populi,</hi> by which of necessity they were to passe: when, tying up their horses to the hedges, like resolute Gentlemen, they throw off their dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blets, commanding their Chirurgions not to stir from their stations; when, disdaining words, they both draw, and fall to deeds thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brellati</hi> presenteth the first thrust, and <hi>Bertolini</hi> gives him the first wound in his left shoulder; whereat hee is inflamed; and so returnes <hi>Bertolini</hi> the interest of a most dangerous one, on his right side; but it toucht neither his bowels nor quayse. They cry againe: so <hi>Brellati</hi> againe wounds <hi>Bertolini</hi> in his left hand, when his Rapier run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thorow his sinewes and Arteries, he is no longer able to hold his Ponyard; but despight his resolution and courage, it fals out of his hand; which unlookt for disaster doth much perplexe and afflict him. But <hi>Brellati</hi> is two generous and noble, to blemish or taint his honour, by taking any advantage of this his adversaries misfortune: and so,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16653:103"/>
to cleere his doubts and scruples, very valiantly and bravely throwes away his owne Ponyard to the hedge, that they might bee as equall in weapons, as courage. But <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolini</hi> will basely requite this courtesie. They retire and take breath; and so traversing their grounds, thereby to take the benefit of the Sunne, they againe joyne: at the first close of this second meeting <hi>Brellati</hi> runnes <hi>Bertolini</hi> into the right flanke, when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his Rapier, and leaping backe to put himselfe upon his defensive guard and posture, his foot slipping, hee could not prevent falling to the ground; when <hi>Bertolini</hi> following him close, and being eager in his pursuit, and bloud-thirsty in his revenge, hee forgetting <hi>Brellati's</hi> former courtesie, and working upon the fortune of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, right then and there nayled him to the ground, and so redoubling his thrust, acted a perpetuall divorce betwixt his body and soule: when <hi>Brellati's</hi> Chirurgian shedding teares on his dead Master, and beginning to take order for his decent conveyance into the City, <hi>Bertolini</hi> takes up his Chirurgian behinde him, and so with all possible speed and celerity (the better to avoyd the danger of the law) poasts o're the fields, and comes into <hi>Mount Cavallo</hi> Gate, and so husheth himselfe up privately in a friends house of his, neere his fathers.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>Rome</hi> beginnes to eccho forth and resound this Murther, and farre the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Bertolini</hi> and <hi>Brellati</hi> were so deare and intimate friends: but as good newes comes alwayes lame, and bad rides poast, so within one houre of <hi>Brellati's</hi> Murther, the newes thereof is brought first to his Father, then to his Sister <hi>Paulina;</hi> whereat hee grieves, and shee stormes, hee sorroweth, and shee weepes and laments, and in a word, the Father would, but cannot, and the Daughter can, but will not bee comforted, at this sad and mournefull Tragedy. Neither must wee forget, but remember <hi>Seignior Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Sturio,</hi> who loving <hi>Paulina</hi> a thousand times dearer then his owne life, is no sooner acquainted, but afflicted with this newes of <hi>Brellati</hi> his death, as being his deare friend, and which is more, the onely brother of his dearest and onely Mistris <hi>Paulina;</hi> so as Lovers and friends being best knowne and discerned in calamities and afflictions, hee repaires to her, condoles with her, and useth his chiefest art and zeale, not onely to participate, but wholly to deprive her of her sorrowes; yea, to proove himselfe a constant friend and a faithfull lover to her, hee proffereth her, not onely his service, but his life, as well to right her honour, as to revenge her brothers death on <hi>Bertoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni:</hi> but this affection and perswasion of <hi>Sturio</hi> is not capable to wipe off, or exhale his Lady <hi>Paulina's</hi> teares.</p>
                     <p>But againe to <hi>Bertolini,</hi> who is so farre from contrition and repentance of this his bloudy fact, as like a prophane miscreant, and debausht and dissolute Gentleman, hee triumphs and glories therein; yea, his impudencie is become so ignorant, and his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance so sottish, as hee beganne to enter into a resolution againe to court and seeke <hi>Paulina</hi> for his wife, without respecting or regarding either the publike danger of the Law, or that of <hi>Paulina's</hi> private revenge; for sure her brothers death had throwne her into such violent passions of griefe, and extremities of sorrow, as if his folly had made her so happy, doubtlesse her revenge would have made him more miserable: but God had taught her rage more reason, and her malice and cruelty not so much impiety; yea, it pleased his Divine Majesty not so soone to call him to an accompt, and punish him for this his bloudy fact; but reserving him for a future shame and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, being affrighted with a tumultuous rumour and alarum of a generall search to bee made that night for his apprehension, hee very subtilly, in a <hi>Capuchins</hi> habit, passeth <hi>Saint Iohn de Laterans</hi> Gate, and there having Poast-horses layd for him, hee as swift as the winde gallops away for <hi>Naples,</hi> and imbarking himselfe for <hi>Sicilie,</hi> passeth the <hi>Pharre</hi> of <hi>Messina,</hi> lands at that City, and so rides up for <hi>Palermo,</hi> where he thinkes himselfe safe.

Whether or no <hi>Caprea</hi> be thy Purgatory, I know not, but sure I am, <hi>Rome</hi> is my Hell, sith I cannot bee there with thee, nor thou here with me; and as I lamented with sighs, I could not dye with my Brother so I grieve with teares, that I cannot live with thee: but why write I of living, when his mournefull Tragedy, and thy disastrous exile hath made mee more ready to dye then live, or rather not fit to live, but dye? for despayring of thy returne, how can I hope for comfort, sith it onely lived in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as my heart and joy did in thee? As for <hi>Bertolini's</hi> folly to mee, and crime to my Brother, if thy Sword punish him not, Gods just revenge will, and wishing this as a woman, as a Christian, I pardon and forgive him; and so I pray doe thou for my sake, if thou wilt not that of my dead Brothers. Could prayers or wishes have effected thy returne to mee, my teares had long since been thy <hi>Hellespont</hi> and <hi>Mediterranean Sea,</hi> and my sighes had fill'd the Sayles of thy desires and resolutions, to have past <hi>Ostia,</hi> floated up <hi>Tiber,</hi> and landed at <hi>Rippa</hi> to mee: But alas, alas! here in remembring <hi>Hero's</hi> felicity and joy, I cannot forget my sorrowes and afflictions: for as <hi>Leander</hi> liv'd in her armes, so I cannot bee so fortunate, either to live or dye in my <hi>Sturio's;</hi> and if now, as a skilfull <hi>Mercury,</hi> thou couldst inveagle the eyes both of thy Fathers malice, and Guardians jealousie, yet that happinesse would come too late, and out of season for mee: for before thou shalt have plotted thy flight and escape from <hi>Caprea</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> I shall have acted and finished mine from <hi>Rome</hi> to Heaven.

For scarce twenty dayes are past, after the writing of her Letter to <hi>Sturio,</hi> but <hi>Paulina,</hi> languishing with Griefe, Despaire, Sorrow and Sicknesse, as a female Love-Martyr, takes her last leave and farewell of this world in <hi>Rome;</hi> it being not in the power or affection of her parents, any longer to divert her from paying this her last due and tribute unto Nature, sith wee all have our Lives lent, not given us; and therefore as we receive, so must we repay them to our Creatour and Redeemer, of whom we have first received them.</p>
                     <p>Old <hi>Sturio</hi> is as glad in <hi>Rome</hi> for the death of <hi>Paulina,</hi> as her Parents grieve thereat; and now it is that he intends to be as happy and joyfull in his Sonnes presence, as hee hath formerly made himselfe sorrowfull in occasioning his absence: whereupon, with all expedition, hee dispatcheth a Servant of his to <hi>Caprea,</hi> with a Letter, to signifie his Son thereof, and consequently, to recall him. This newes of <hi>Paulina's</hi> Death-infinitely afflicts and torments our <hi>Sturio;</hi> for shee being the Queene of his affections, and the soveraigne Goddesse of his delights and desires, he resembleth himselfe, and so like a true Lover, as hee is, acteth a wonderfull mournefull part of sorrow for her unwished and unexpected Death: he is no longer himselfe; nay, such was his living affection to <hi>Paulina,</hi> and such is his immoderate sorrow for her death, as hee will not bee himselfe, because she is gone, who was the greatest and chiefest part of himselfe. But as wounds cannot be cured, ere searched; so passion transporting his thoughts beyond reason, and revenge beyond passion, he, for the time present, forsakes the effect, to follow the cause, and so hath no other object before his eyes and thoughts, but that of <hi>Bertolini's</hi> killing of her Brother <hi>Brellati,</hi> and this of his Fathers unkinde banishing of him from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Caprea:</hi> wherefore, that he may out-live his sorrowes, and apply a Lenitive to his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosive, he vowes to revenge both. The manner is thus: That, as his Father deceived his hopes in carrying him from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Caprea;</hi> so hee will deceive those of his sayd Father, in carrying himself from <hi>Caprea</hi> to <hi>Cicily,</hi> there to find out <hi>Bertolini,</hi> and to fight with him. It is not the poynt of Honour, much lesse, Iudgement, and least of all, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that precipitates and throwes him on this bloudy, and therefore uncharitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution: but it is the vanity of his thoughts, and his living affection to his dead Mistris <hi>Paulina,</hi> which gives life and birth to it: for he (trampling on all disswasion and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition) finding a Galley of <hi>Naples,</hi> bound from <hi>Caprea</hi> to <hi>Cicily,</hi> very secretly imbarkes himselfe in her, and contemning the impetuosity of the Windes, and the mercilesse mercie of the Seas, lands at <hi>Palermo,</hi> where hushing himselfe up the first night privately in his Inne, and informing himselfe that <hi>Bertolini</hi> was in that City, he, the next morne, by his Lackey, sends him this Challenge:</p>

fighting it out with <hi>Sturio;</hi> and, which is worse, for disgracefully begging and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his life of him. <hi>Bertolini</hi> findes this scandall throwne and retorted on him, to bee very distastefull and dishonourable; in so much as hee cannot rellish it, but with discontent, nor digest it, but with extreme indignation and choller: which throwes him so violently on the execrable humour of revenge, as hee vowes to make <hi>Sturio</hi> pay deare for giving two much liberty to his tongue, to the prejudice of his honour and reputation. Puft up thus with these three execrable humours and vices, disdaine, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and revenge, whereof the least is great and capable enough to ruine both a fortune and a life, hee, out of a wretched resolution, (unworthy the generosity of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) not onely forgets <hi>Sturio</hi> his singular courtesie in giving him his life, when it lay in his power and pleasure to take it from him, but also remembreth, and in that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance resolveth to repay him with the ungratefull requitall, and mournefull interest of depriving him of his. O extreme ingratitude! O uncharitable and base resolution! Yea, hee is so devoyd of reason, and the purity of his soule and conscience so conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and vilified with the contemplation and object of bloud, as hee gives way thereto, and resolves thereon; yea, permits it to forsake God, of purpose wilfully to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Devill: yea, his thoughts are so surprised and taken up with this execrable and hellish resolution of Murther, as hee thinkes of nothing else but of the meanes and manner how to dispatch <hi>Sturio;</hi> and so to send him in a bloudy winding-sheet, from this life to another. To fight with him againe in the field, hee dares not, to assassinate and murther him in his bed, he cannot, sith he must passe five or sixe severall chambers, ere hee can come at his; and to pistoll him in the open street, though it be lesse diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, yet hee findes it most dangerous, sith hee sees <hi>Sturio</hi> still went better followed and accompanyed then himselfe, as indeed being more eminent of birth, and noble of extraction then himselfe. But hee shall want no invention to accomplish and bring this his bloudy resolution to passe: for if hee faile thereof, the Devill is still at his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow to prompt and instruct him therein; yea, his impiety is growne so strong with the Devill, and his faith so weake with God, as now having turned over the records of his revenge, hee at last resolves to shoot <hi>Sturio</hi> from a Window, with a Petronell, as he passeth the street: and upon the attempt and finishing of this hellish stratagem and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Tragedy, the Devill and he strike hands, and conclude it; the contriving and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating where of shal in the end strangle him, because he was so prophane and gracelesse, as he would not strangle the first conceit thereof in their births and conceptions.</p>
                     <p>But leave wee here <hi>Bertolini</hi> ruminating on his intended bloudy crime of Murther, and come wee a little to speake of poore unfortunate <hi>Sturio,</hi> who not dreaming of his malice, much lesse of his ungratefull and bloudy revenge intended against him, like a mournful and disconsolate constant Lover, is thinking on nothing so much, as on the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beauty and <hi>Idea</hi> of his dead <hi>Paulina:</hi> and although he knew it as palpable folly to bewray his immoderate sorrowes, as discretion to conceale them; yet their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosity and fervencie give such a predominating law to his resolutions, as hee cannot refraine from often stealing into <hi>Sancta Maria de Rotunda's</hi> Church, where shee was buryed, and there secretly bedewes her Tombe, and washes her Sepulcher with his teares: an act and ceremony of Lovers, which though affection authorize, yet Religion doth neither justifie, nor can approve. All the care of his father and friends is to seek how to purge his pensivenesse, and to wipe off his melancholy sorrowes and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full melancholinesse: to which end they proffer him great variety of noble and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Ladies in Marriage, hoping that the sight and presence of a new beauty would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the memory and absence of an old: but their policie proves vaine; for <hi>Sturio</hi> will bee as constant in his sorrowes for his sweet <hi>Paulina's</hi> death, as hee was in his affection to her whiles shee lived; and therefore, although their power inforce him to see di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16653:106"/>
yet his will can never bee drawne, or inforced to love any, as having inviolably contracted himselfe to this definitive resolution, that sith he could not be <hi>Paulina's</hi> hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he will never wed himselfe to any other wife then his Grave.</p>
                     <p>And here I beginne to write rather with teares, then Inke, when I apprehend and consider how soone our poore and innocent <hi>Sturio</hi> shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ee by the bloudy hand of <hi>Bertolini</hi> layd in his unfortunate and untimely Grave. Ah <hi>Sturio, Sturio,</hi> hadst thou been more vindictive, and lesse generous and compassionate, thou hadst prevented thy death by killing <hi>Bertolini,</hi> when thy valour in <hi>Caprea</hi> formerly reduced and exposed him to the mercie of thy Sword; or if thou hadst believed this Maxime, that dead men can never offend or hurt, thou needst not have relyed and trusted upon the false promises of an incensed and irreconciliable enemy: but what shall I say? It was not thy honour, but <hi>Bertolini's</hi> infamy, which hasteneth and procureth thy death. O that thou shouldest bee so true a friend to thine enemy, and hee proove so deadly an enemy to thee his true friend! <hi>Sturio</hi> gave <hi>Bertolini</hi> his life, and <hi>Bertolini</hi> in requitall will give <hi>Sturio</hi> his death: but such monstrous and bloudy ingratitude will never goe unpunished of God; for as it is odious to Earth, so it is execrable to Heaven: But I must bee so unfortunate to bring this deplorable Tragedy upon the Theater of this History. A misery of miseries, that wee are many times neerest our ends, when wee thinke our selves farthest from them; and (not to rush into the sacred and secret clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set of Gods inscrutable providence) I can finde no other pregnant reason thereof, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Divinity or Nature, but that at all times, and in all places, wee should bee still prepared and ready for death, e're death for us, and not protracting or procrastinating the houre thereof; but that whensoever it shall please God to call us to him, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to us, that (like good Christians) death may still finde us alwayes arm'd to meet, never unprovided to incounter it.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Bertolini</hi> is so obstinate in his malice, and so wretchedly implacable in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, as understanding that <hi>Sturio</hi> is accustomed to goe to his mornings Masse at the <hi>English Colledge,</hi> hee provides both himselfe and his Petronell charged with a brace of Bullets; or rather the Devill provides both the Bullets, the Petronell, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: and so, watching the advantage of his houre and time, on a Monday morning, a little after the Cardinalls, <hi>Farnesi</hi> and <hi>Caponius,</hi> were ridden with their traines to the Consistory, putting himselfe into an unknowne house betwixt the sayd <hi>English Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and the Palace of <hi>Farnesi,</hi> hee having his Cocke bent, and seeing <hi>Sturio</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the streete, upon his prauncing <hi>Barbary</hi> Horse and Foot-cloth, like a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and bloudy villaine (having neither the feare of God, nor the salvation or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his soule before his eyes, nor once imagining that hee shootes at the Majesty of God the Creatour, in killing and defacing Man, his Image and Creature) lets flye at him, and the Devill had made him so curious and expert a Marke-man, as both the Bullets pierce the trunke of his brest; with which mortall wounds our innocent <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> no longer able to sit his Horse, tumbles downe dead to the ground, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the power to utter a word, but onely to breathe foorth two or three lamentable and deadly groanes. And this was the unfortunate and mournefull end of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gentleman <hi>Sturio,</hi> which I cannot relate without sighes, nor remember without teares.</p>
                     <p>This bloudy Tragedy acted on so brave a Gallant, in the very bowels and heart of <hi>Rome,</hi> doth extreamely amaze, and draw all the Spectatours to lamentation and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and his two servants, who walked by his Horse side, are so busie in lifting him up, and rubbing the temples of their dead Master; as they forget the research and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry for his murtherer: but the Assistants, and standers by, hearing the report of the Peece, and not onely seeing the smoke in the window and ayre, but this noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman

                     <p>So the second morne of <hi>Bertolini</hi> his imprisonment, hee is fetcht before his Iudges, where at first the Devill is so strong with him, as hee once thought to have denyed this Murther of <hi>Sturio:</hi> but God proving more mercifull to his soule, hee upon his Iudges grave and religious remonstrances, with many sighes and teares freely confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it, humbly beseeching them to take pittie of his young yeeres, and that it was onely the heate of youth, and the vanity of his ambitious honour, which had thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed and seduced his soule to perpetrate this cruell and impious Murther, and for the which he extremely and bitterly repented himselfe.</p>
                     <p>But the arrow of Gods wrath and Revenge is now fully bent against <hi>Bertolini,</hi> as his bullets were against <hi>Sturio:</hi> so as his sacred Majesty, causing his Iudges to resemble themselves, they are deafe to his requests, and tell him, it is not his youth or his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Devill that hath seduced and drawne him to performe this bloudy Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and so for expiation thereof, they, in consideration hee is a <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman, nobly descended, will not hang him, but adjudge his two hands to bee cut off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the house where hee shot at <hi>Sturio,</hi> and then to bee beheaded at the common place of execution, at the foote of <hi>Saint Angelos</hi> bridge, his head to bee set upon a pole, over <hi>Saint Iohn de Laterans</hi> gate, and his body to bee throwne into <hi>Tiber:</hi> which the next day was accordingly executed in presence of many thousand people of both sexes, and of all ranks, notwithstanding the importunate sollicitations which his father made to <hi>Cardinall Borghese</hi> (the <hi>Pope Paulus Quintus</hi> Nephew) to the contray, who was too noble and generous to assist him in so base and ignoble a Murther.</p>
                     <p>And these were the lives and deaths of these three unfortunate <hi>Roman</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>Brellati, Sturio,</hi> and <hi>Bertolini,</hi> and of that beautifull, chaste, and sorrowfull Lady <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> And here to conclude and shut up this their mournefull History; I have beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the curious wits of <hi>Rome</hi> made many exquisite Epitaphs upon the deaths of <hi>Sturio</hi> and <hi>Paulina,</hi> as also that <hi>Bertolini</hi> made a religious and most Christian speech at his end, of which I must confesse I was not so happy to recover the sight, or copies of either: for if I had, I would not have failed to have inserted, and placed them at the end of this their History, to have served as a grace and ornament thereunto, in interla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing my prose with others verses, for the better delight and recreation of my Reader. But I must (justly) crave excuse herein: for my curiositie sought them, though my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunacie found them not. And because I wholy ayme rather to profit then please my Reader, let us forget the shadowes, to remember the substance, and so looke from the Mappe, to the Morall of this History: that the foule example of <hi>Bertolini's</hi> crime of Murther, and the justnesse of his punishment, may make us lesse bloudy, and more compassionate and charitable to our Christian brethren, and consequently more pious towards God, of whom we all beare the living Image, and true and lively character.</p>

taking time at advantage, breakes with him about this match: whereunto <hi>De Clugny</hi> hearkens rather with delight than distast: for if there were any disparitie in the dignitie of their Offices, he well knowes, that <hi>Argentiers</hi> blood and wealth did at least equalize, if not exceed his; or if hee conceited any scruple in his thoughts, which impugned or imposed it, it was onely because <hi>De Salez</hi> was a <hi>Souldier,</hi> and not a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> and consequently delighted to use his Sword before his Pen, and to weare and preferre a Scarlet cloke before a Blacke. But then againe, these repugnant and averse reasons were as soone buried, as borne, and defaced, as conceived and ingraven in him; when hee considered that hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his adolescency was of the same humor and inclination, and therefore that <hi>Experience</hi> had made him a <hi>President</hi> to himselfe, that <hi>Time</hi> was both the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and refiner of manners, and that (in all well borne and well bred spirits) the <hi>Precepts</hi> of a father, and the sweet conversation and counsell of a wife, had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to metamorphose the conditions of a young husband; whereupon the old fathers often meet and consult hereon, and so being fully agreed on all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they likewise appoint a solemne meeting for their children, but the effect and issue of this their enterview, will not corespond and answer their desires.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>La Frange</hi> (as we have formerly said) being deformed and crook-backt, was no way agreeable but displeasing to <hi>De Salez,</hi> but he being a tall, and neat timbred <hi>Gentleman,</hi> of a faire and feminine complexion, she instantly most tenderly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and dearely loved him. In a word, I must request the curiositie of the Reader briefly to be informed and advertised, that as shee beheld him with the eyes of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Desire,</hi> so did he her with those of <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>disdaine,</hi> she buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding castles of content in the aire of her thoughts and hopes, that <hi>Heaven</hi> would make him her husband; and hee rasing both her and her memory out of that of his contemplations, vowing that Earth should never make her his wife. Thus though the Parents have already shut up the Contract, yet their children shall never live to celebrate the <hi>Nuptials,</hi> for we shall see diversity of <hi>tragicall accidents</hi> which are providing, and almost ready to oppose and impugne it. <hi>Parents</hi> thinke to be the causes, but <hi>God</hi> will still bee the <hi>Authour</hi> of Marriages: for if his sacred and divine <hi>Majesty</hi> make them not first in <hi>Heaven,</hi> they shall never see them so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized nor consummated on <hi>Earth.</hi>

Now by this time <hi>Vaumartin</hi> hath full notice and advertisement of her affection devoted to none but to <hi>de Salez,</hi> as also his sleighting and disdaining her: Whereupon encouraged by this, and dishartened by that, he leaves no cost, care, or curiosity (either in gifts, dancing, musicke, or bankets) unattempted, to crowne his wants, rather than his desires and pleasures, with this though deformed, yet rich heire <hi>La Frange:</hi> so lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him to his vaine sute in courting her, speake wee a little of <hi>de Salez,</hi> that sith he will not affect <hi>La Frange,</hi> we may yet observe and discover which way hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to shape the course of his affections and resolutions.</p>

taking pen and paper, she writes him a faire promise, and firme assurance of her selfe unto him (in the maner of a Contract) and to make it the more powerfull and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, subscribes her name and signe to it, and betwixt sighs and blushing, she delivers it him; no way doubting, but rather assuring her selfe, that he would requite her with the like curtesie and obligation, as indeed the event answereth her desires and wishes: For <hi>De Salez</hi> having now no power left him to see by his owne eyes, I meane, by those of his judgement, but only by these of his intemperate passion, and passionat affection, he is so far from discrying (much lesse from suspecting) her policy, as very simply and sottishly he attributes it to the fervency of her affection, the which he interprets and entertaines, I know not whether with more joy, or delectaion; and so vowing not to dye her debtor for <hi>Courtesie,</hi> he very rashly, and inconsideratly writes another to the same effect, and flyes so farre from wit or discretion, as to shew himselfe her superiour in affection, as well as in sex, he purposely cuts his finger, and so firmes his name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto with his owne bloud, and then with a million of kisses delivers it her, vowing that her pleasure shall be his law in the accomplishing thereof: onely he prayes her for a time to be secret and silent herein, for that he feares he shall hardly draw his Father to consent hereunto, the which she very courteously graunts him: and so he triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her beauty, and she in his wealth, he in her youth, and she in his simplicity, they for that time part, not doubting but they shall shortly reape the fruits of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall desires and wishes; for till then, she sweares (though with an equivocating reservation to forsweare her selfe) she will live a most pure and unspotted Virgine, and that as the least of her affection and courtesie towards him, shall be smiles, so the most shall be kisses.</p>
                     <p>But this (affection or rather folly) of <hi>De Salez,</hi> in contracting himselfe to <hi>La Hay,</hi> is not so secretly borne, but as her former unchastitie was a generall argument of talke to the whole citie of <hi>Tholouse:</hi> so now this of her subtilty and good fortune, is that of its uniuersall pratling and admiration, occasioned and redoubled by the opposite consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of <hi>Argentiers</hi> knowne wealth, and <hi>de Soulanges</hi> supposed poverty? and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of <hi>de Salez</hi> supposed chastity, and of <hi>de la Hayes</hi> notoriously knowne whore domes. And as <hi>Fame</hi> is still so tatling a goddesse, that events and accidents of this nature can hardly be concealed, and difficultie suppressed and smaothered: so by this time contrary to the expectations and hopes of our two young Lovers, the old Councellor <hi>Argentier</hi> hath notice of this unlooked-for newes, and of this unwished for familiaritie betwext his sonne, and that strumpet <hi>La Hay,</hi> when considering the great opposition betewixt <hi>de Clugny's</hi> Nobilitie and wealth and <hi>de Soulanges</hi> meane extraction and povertie; as also by a true and uncontroleable <hi>Antithises,</hi> comparing the foule and enormious vices of <hi>La Hay</hi> with the sweet and resplendant vertues of <hi>La Frange;</hi> he (as much disdayning that match, as desiring this for his sonne, very hastily sends for him into the Arbor, where purposely attending him, he with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his lookes, and thunder in his speeches, layes before him the simplicity, and the sottishne sse of his resolution, in preferring <hi>La Hay</hi> before <hi>La Frange,</hi> a strumpet before a virgin, and a Pedlers brat, before a rich gentlemans onely daughter and heyre, shewes him the infamy of the first, and the glory of the last match; there his unavoydable misery, here his assured happinesse; in the first his utter ruine and ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, and in the last, his infallible prosperity and felicity: and so intermixing threats with teares, with a passionate paternall affection, he endeavoreth to perswade him to leave <hi>La Hay,</hi> and to marry <hi>La Frange;</hi> or if not, hee vowes and sweres wholly to disinherit him, and from thence-forth never repute or esteeme him for his sonne.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>de Salez</hi> his foolish vanity, and vaine affection in himselfe towards his new contracted Love <hi>La Hay,</hi> is so great, and consequently his filiall obedience to his

father so small, as not withstanding this his wholesome advise and counsell, he is still resolute and constant to preferre <hi>La Hay</hi> before <hi>La Frange,</hi> the beauty of the one, before the deformity of the other, his owne content before his fathers, and <hi>Soulanges</hi> estate and byrth before the great wealth and noble extraction of <hi>De Clugny:</hi> but this rashnes, indiscretion, and ingratitude of his will cost him deare.</p>
                     <p>Now if <hi>Argentier</hi> have perfect intelligence and curious notice of his sonnes fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with that faire yet lewd Courtezan <hi>La Hay,</hi> no lesse hath <hi>la Frange,</hi> who poore soule is so deeply enamored of <hi>de Salez,</hi> as the very first newes and conceyt, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should enjoy him, and not her selfe, for very grife and sorrow, shee seemes to drowne her selfe in the deluge of her teares. His father is chollerick thereat, she mournfull, he incensed, she afflicted, he inraged, &amp; she perplexed and tormented, his passions and anger proceeds from suspition, that he shall so soone find a daughter in law in <hi>la Hay;</hi> her sighes and teares from feare, that she shall so soone loose her Love though not her Lover, his sonne <hi>de Salez.</hi> Againe, the argument of his choller, is <hi>la Hayes</hi> unchastitie and povertie, and the cause of her disconsolation, <hi>de Salez</hi> his wealth and vertues: likewise she sees that <hi>Argentier</hi> hath no reason to hope, that his sonne will marry her selfe, such is her deformitie, and againe, that he hath all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the world, as well to doubt, as feare, that hee will wed <hi>la Hay,</hi> such is her beauty: But sith <hi>de Salez</hi> will beare no more respect to his father, nor affection to <hi>la Frange,</hi> leave we therefore his father <hi>Argentiers</hi> passions, and <hi>la Franges</hi> perplexities, to be appeased and qualified by <hi>Time,</hi> or rather by <hi>God,</hi> the Authour and giver of <hi>Time,</hi> who out of his all-seeing providence and sacred pleasure, onely knowes in Heaven, how best to dispose and manage the actions of earth; and so come wee to other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected occurrents and events, which like so many enterjecting, and intervening poynts, are contained within the circumference of this <hi>History.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have so long insisted on the affections of <hi>de Salez</hi> and <hi>la Hay,</hi> as but to the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and temperate Reader it would seeme to appeare, that the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Vaumartin,</hi> hath wholly forgotten to remember his to his Lady <hi>La Frange:</hi> But to put that doubt out of question, and this question out of doubt, we shall see him returne too too soone, to act a part not so religious and honourable, as bloody, upon the <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi> of this <hi>History:</hi> For by this time both his creditors and his debts are growne so clamorous, and his reputation and lands so neere forfeited, for want of disingaging, as to secure the one, and provide for the other, hee knowes no other invention not meanes but to gaine <hi>La Frange</hi> to his wife: when as it were, provoked and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated on by the necessity of this exigent, his thoughts leave heaven to fly to hell, and consequently fly from <hi>God</hi> to Sathan, to consult how either by the bye, or the maine hee may obtaine her; yea, though with the perill and hazard of his owne life, to cut off theirs, who seeke therein to prevent his desires and designes. In which hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish ratiocynation, he as devoyd of <hi>Reason,</hi> as that is exempt either of <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Piety,</hi> thus reasoneth with himselfe: <hi>De Clugny</hi> hates me, for seeking to marry his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that time may remedy for me; but which is worst of all, she loves <hi>De Salez,</hi> and seekes and desires to marry him, and this I must remedy in time, if I ever expect to obtaine or enjoy her; and so resolves to make him away: but is as yet irresolute how to perpetrate, and in what manner to finish so execrable a businesse. But this is not onely the voice of his malice, but the sentence of his revenge, that <hi>De Salez</hi> must die: wretched <hi>Vaumartin,</hi> unworthy to beare the name of a man, much lesse of a <hi>Baron,</hi> but least of all of a <hi>Christian,</hi> in that because <hi>De Salez</hi> hates <hi>La Frange,</hi> and she loves him, that therefore thou wilt not love but hate him; or because she loves him, and not thy selfe, that therefore thou wilt kill him, that she may love thee. See, see, rash and inconsiderate <hi>Nobleman,</hi> how treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously

the Devill hath hood wink'd, yea inveigled thy judgement, and besotted thy senses, to kill one that loves thee, to kill I say, a <hi>Gentleman</hi> who hath not offended thee, but is every way thy friend, no way thine enemy: or if thou thinke it wisdome, that covetousnesse must redeeme thy former prodigality, <hi>alas, alas,</hi> canst thou yet be so cruell to thinke it either lawfull or religious, that future murther should either oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion or authorize it: But the Devill hath so farre prevailed with his impious resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that againe he resolves, <hi>De Salez</hi> must die: and yet thou thinkest poyson as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of him, as he is worthy of thy sword; so had thy last resolution been answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thy first, assure thy selfe thou hadst made thy selfe more happy, and not so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable: for as poysoning was the invention of the devill, and is practised by none but his agents; so this dishonourable point of honour to fight Duels, was never insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by <hi>God,</hi> nor professed by those who really professe his <hi>Gospell:</hi> yea, it is not only truely to dishonour <hi>God,</hi> in seeking falsly to preserve our own <hi>Honour</hi> and reputation, but we assuredly stab at the <hi>Majesty</hi> of the <hi>Creator,</hi> in seeking to deface man his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and to use but a word, as it is repugnant both to <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> so though it begin in the heat of passion and pleasure, it many times terminates in Repentance, but still in true Infamy and misery.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Vaumartins</hi> faith being so strong with <hi>Sathan,</hi> and so weake with his <hi>Saviour,</hi> he will not take a law from <hi>Religion</hi> to give to his <hi>Envy,</hi> but rather takes one from his <hi>Envy</hi> to give to his <hi>Religion;</hi> and so very prophanely and rashly by his Lackey <hi>La Rose,</hi> sends <hi>De Salez</hi> this Challenge:</p>

But these his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and griefs, bring him onely vexation and misery insteed of comfort; for now he utterly dispaires, and sees no hope of his wives reformation: Whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to divorce himselfe from her, and to that end takes counsell thereon: but it is not so secretly managed by him, but the strumpet his wife hath present notice and inckling thereof, whereupon seeing her husband exceeding rich, both in lands, coyne, plate, and other rich houshold-stuff, she vowes not to quite her great joynter share and interest hereof thus. But before he had inrolled his suite in the Spirituall Court, or any way vented his owne shame, and his wives infamy in publike, she like a true Courtisan, and debaushed strumpet as she was, vowes to prevent him that would prevent her, and to send him to his death, that would seeke to divorce her; and in respect of his jelousie and malice, that as shee had formerly poisoned <hi>La Frange</hi> for her husbands sake, so shee would now murther him for her owne.</p>

To which end, watching the time when most of her servants were gone abroad to gather in the Vintage, she softly opening her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands chamber doore, steales in, and finding him soundly sleeping approcheth his bed, when drawing forth a rasor from her sleeve, which she had purposely provided, she with an implacable and damnable malice steps to him, and cuts his throat, speaking onely these words to her selfe: <hi>Loe heere the reward of thy Ielousie;</hi> when throwing the knife, and her outward Taffata Gowne into the house of office, she leaving him weltring in his blood, very secretly conveyes her selfe through the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery to the Garden, where her wayting-<hi>Gentlewoman</hi> attends her, and so hyes away to the Church, thinking with a wretched impiety to cloake this her second murther, as her former, under the vaile of religion and piety: but her hopes, and the Devill that gave them her, will now deceive her.</p>

                        <hi>De Salez,</hi> her husband striving and strugling for life against the pangs of death: feare and hast (contrary to her intent and minde) had so made his murtherous wifes hand shake and tremble, as she did not so fully cut his throat-boale, but he could yet both cry and groane, which he did very mournfully, and which indeed was soone over-heard by a man and a maid-servant of his, who only remained in the house, who hearing their masters voyce, and hastily running up, at these his pittifull and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table out cryes; steping to his assistance, they heare him (with his best power) utter these fearefull speeches, <hi>That Strumpet my wife hath kill'd me: O that shee-Devill my wife hath murthered mee.</hi> Whereat they cry out at the windowes to the neighbours for helpe, alledging that their master is murthered. The neighbours assemble, and heare him report so much: so they send away for his Confessor, and the <hi>Lieutenant Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> to both whom he againe confesseth, <hi>That it is the Strumpet his wife who hath mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him:</hi> And then raising himselfe up in his bed (with as much strength as his dying wound would permit him) he taking them both by the hands, with infinite signes and teares reveales to them, that he it was, who at the seducing of the Devill, had stifled his father <hi>Argentier</hi> to death in <hi>Paris,</hi> that he did it onely to marry this whoore his murtherous wife <hi>La Hay;</hi> that the killing of his father, yea the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof infinitely grieves his heart and soule, and for the which he infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely repenteth himselfe, and beseecheth the Lord of mercy, in mercy to forgive it him; and likewise prayed all that were present to pray unto God for him: and these were his last words, for now his fleeting and fading breath would permit him to say no more.</p>

All that were present, are amazed at this lamentable confession of his, to see that hee should murther his father, and his execrable wife, well neere himselfe; so they all glorified God for the detection and discovery hereof: But the <hi>Lievtenant Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,</hi> and the <hi>Counsellors</hi> his Associates step to the window, and consult to have him hanged, whiles he is yet living, for the murthering of his father. But <hi>De Salez</hi> saves them that labour: for there and then he sinkes into his bed, and dyes away before them: so they instantly search the house and City for this wretched Murtheresse <hi>La Hay,</hi> whom impious and bloody strumpet they at last find in the <hi>Dominican Friers Church</hi> at a Sermon, from whence with much obloquy and indignity they dragge her to prison, where they charge her with the murther of her husband <hi>De Salez,</hi> which the Devill as yet will not permit her to confesse; but being adjudged by them to the Racke, she at the very first torment confesseth it.</p>
                     <p>Upon which severall murthers, the <hi>Criminell Iudges</hi> of the <hi>Tournells</hi> proceed to sentence: so first they adjudge the dead body of <hi>De Salez</hi> for so inhumanly murdring his father <hi>Argentier,</hi> to be halfe a day hang'd by the heeles to the common gallows, and then to bee burnt to ashes, which is accordingly executed: then they adjudge his wife <hi>La Hay,</hi> for murthering him, the next day to bee strangled, then burnt: so that night some Divines deale with her in prison about the state of her soule, whom they finde infinitely obdurated through the vanity of her youth, and the temptations of the Devill; but they worke effectually with her, and so at last (by the mercies of God) draw her to contrition and repentance, when willing her not to charge her soule with the concealing of any other crime; and shewing her the dangers thereof, she very freely, yet sorrowfully, confesseth; how she it was, that for three hundred crownes had caused the <hi>Empericke Michaele</hi> to poyson <hi>La Frange,</hi> for the which she told them she was now exceedinglie repentant and sorrowfull: Whereof the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines (sith it was not delivered them under the seale of Confession) advertising the Judges, they all wonder at Gods providence, to see how all these murthers are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and burst forth, one in the necke of the other; so they alter her sentence and for these her double murthers, they condemne her to have her right hand cut off, and then to be burnt alive: and so they make curious inquiry and research to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend this old bloody varlet <hi>Michaele.</hi>

FRuitfull, and faire <hi>Lombardy</hi> is the <hi>Countrey,</hi> and the great, populous, and rich <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Millan</hi> (the Capitall of that Dutchie) the place where the Scene of this mournefull and <hi>Tragicall History</hi> is layen where perpetrated: The which to refetch from its first spring and <hi>Originall,</hi> thereby the more truely to informe our curiosity, and instruct our knowledge: We must then understand, that long since the <hi>Duke of Feria</hi> succeeded the <hi>Count De Fuentes,</hi> as <hi>Vice-roy</hi> of that potent and flourishing Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, for <hi>King Philip the third</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> his master: There was native and resident in that <hi>City</hi> an ancient <hi>Nobleman,</hi> tearmed <hi>Seignior Leonardo Capello,</hi> who in his younger yeares had married a <hi>Spanish</hi> Lady, and brought her from <hi>Spaine</hi> to <hi>Millan;</hi> tearmed <hi>Dona Maria de Castiana:</hi> He exceeding rich and noble, and shee as noble and faire; he by his fathers side allied to <hi>Cardinall Charles Barromeo</hi> (since Sainted by Pope <hi>Paul V.)</hi> she by her mother to the present <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Albucurque,</hi> hee infinitly honoured for his extraction and wealth: shee no lesse beloved and respected for her beautie and vertues: and although there are but few marriages contracted between the <hi>Millaneses</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and those very seldome prove successefull and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, in respect of the antipathy, which (for the most part) is hereditary betwixt the commands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the subjection of the <hi>Millaneses:</hi> yet it seemed that this of <hi>Capello</hi> and <hi>Castiana</hi> was first instituted in heaven, ere consummated on earth; for so sweetly did their yeeres, humours, and affections conjoyne and sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize, as although thy were two persons, yet I may truely affirme and say, they had but one heart, affection and desire, which was mutually to please, and reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to affect and love each other. And as Marriages cannot bee reputed truly happy and fortunate, if they be not blessed and crowned with the blessings of children, (which indeed is not onely the sweetest life of humane content, but also the best and sweetest content of our humane life) so they had not beene long married, ere God honoured them and their nuptiall bed, with a beautifull and delicate and young daughter, tearmed <hi>Dona Clara,</hi> the onely childe of their loynes, and heire of their lands and vertues; being indeed the true picture of themselves, and the joyfull pledge and seale of their intire and involuable affections; who having overpast her infancy, and obtained the eighteenth yeare of her age; she was so exquisitely adorned with beauty, and so excellently endued and enriched with <hi>vertues;</hi> as distinctly for either or joyntly for both, she was, and was truely reputed, the <hi>Paragon</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> the pride of <hi>Beauty,</hi> the wonder of <hi>Millan,</hi> the glory of her <hi>Sex,</hi> and the <hi>Phenix</hi> of her <hi>Time.</hi> And because the purity and perfection of her beauty deserves to be seene through this dimme Perspective, and the dignity of her vertues knowne of the Reader in this my impollished relation. For the first, she was of stature indifferently tall, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding streight and slender: her haire either of a deepe Chesnut colour, or rather of a light blacke, But to which most adhearing and inclyning fancy mought, but curiosity could difficultly distinguish; her complexion and tincture, rather of an amorous and lovely browne, than of a Roseat and Lilly die; but yet so sweetly pure, and purely sweet: (and withall rather fat than leane) that no earthly object could more delight and please the eye, or ravish the sense. And for her cies, those two relucent lamps and startes of love, they were so blacke and piercing, that they had a secret and imperious influence, to draw all other eyes to gaze and doe homage to hers; as if all were bound to love her, and shee so modest, as if purposely framed to love none but her selfe: Neither did her Front, Lippes, Necke or Paps any way detract, but every way to adde to the perfection of her other excellencies of <hi>Nature:</hi> For the first seemed to be the <hi>Prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>Valley</hi> of love. But leave we the dainties of her body, now to speake of the rarities and excellencies of her mind, which I cannot rightly define, whether the curiositie and care of her parents in her education, or her owne ingenious and apt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> were more predominant in her: for in either, or rather in both, she was so exquisite and excellent, that in <hi>Languages, Singing, Musicke, Dancing, Wisdome, Temperance,</hi> and <hi>Modestie,</hi> she was so fully compleat and rare, that to give her her due, and no more, she could not be paraleld by any young Lady of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> nor equalliz'd but by her selfe.</p>
                     <p>Thus if her noble extraction, and fathers wealth made her surmount others, and her delicious sweet beauty and vertues excell her selfe, no marvell if those <hi>Adamants,</hi> and these excellencies draw divers of the best <hi>Cavaliers</hi> and chiefest <hi>Gallants</hi> both of <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Lombardy,</hi> to effect and seeke her in marriage; and indeed although shee be sought by divers of them with much respect and honour, answerable in all regard to her ranke and quality; yet nether her parents, or selfe are so much importuned by any, as by <hi>Signior Giouani Albemare,</hi> a young noble <hi>Gentleman</hi> of the citie, who was adorned and fortified whith these humane priviledges, to be well descended, rich, and of some twenty five yeeres old; a match in the eye and censure of the world, yea, and in all outward appearance correspondent and equivalent; if his generous perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and vertues had paralleld hers, or if the candure and sinceritie of her affection had not justly transported her thoughts and heart from him, because she had formerly fixed and setled them on another <hi>Gentleman,</hi> younger of yeeres than <hi>Albemare,</hi> but in all other respects, as well of <hi>Nature,</hi> as <hi>Fortune,</hi> every way his superiour, named <hi>Signior Alphonsus Baretano,</hi> a young Gentleman of one of the noblest families of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> of some eighteene yeeres old, whose father was lately deceased, and had left him sole heire to many rich lands and possessions; but (withall) exceedingly intangled in Law, and ingaged in many debts and morgages, where into the vanity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality of his youth had deepely precipitated and ingulphed him: which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reflecting and falling on his sonne, we shall see will prove a hinderance to his marriage, and an obstacle to his content and preferment. But to observe some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and decorum in the conduction and delation of this History, wee must briefly be informed, that as of all the Beauties of <hi>Lombardy, Albemare</hi> onely chiefly affected and loved <hi>Clara;</hi> so of all the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> of the world, <hi>Clara</hi> affected and loved no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but <hi>Baretano;</hi> for as conformity of yeeres, manners, and inclinations, breed a <hi>sympathy</hi> in affections; so they in their tender youth often frequented one the others company, sometimes at the Dancing, and Musicke Masters, but many times at Weddings, Feastes, and noble assemblies: being well neere as equall in age as in complection and stature. Againe the vicinity of their residence added much to the combining and inflaming of their affections: for they were opposite in nothing but in their mansion houses, from whose galleries &amp; windowes many times publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but more often by stealth, their eyes could not refrain to tilt at each other, with the invisible launces of love &amp; affection, which bred such a habit, and that habit so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a second <hi>Nature</hi> that it was now becom impossible for them not to gaze each on other: so as if the innocency of their purilitie, made them delight in each others sight and company with desire; so now their more riper yeres inforce them to desire it with delectation: for when as yet they were so yong, as they knew not the instinct and influence of <hi>Nature</hi> (which cannot be taught by amore powerful or ingenious Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

youth (with as much right as fame in <hi>Milan,)</hi> generally intituled them: They felt some pleasure wanting, which as yet they couldnot finde; and therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, if they desired to find that which they wanted: So as burning in affection each to other, <hi>Clara</hi> hearing spoken of a husband, infinitly wished that <hi>Baretano</hi> were hers; and when hee heard of a wife, hee ardently longed, and fervently desired that <hi>Clara</hi> were his. Neither can I rightly say, whether he were more affectionate in his constancy to her; or shee constant and resolute in her affection to him: so that as heretofore they hardly knew the way to kisse, now time (running on in her swift ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reere) had taught them to desire to marry: and that whereas formerly <hi>Baretano</hi> only tearmed <hi>Clara</hi> his sweet Maid, and she him her deare <hi>Friend:</hi> Now love had sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and given them new desires, and therefore new <hi>Epithites:</hi> for sometimes as well in earnest as in jest, he could not refraine to tearme her his sweet wife, nor she him her deare husband; and herein there tongues were onely but the outward He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds of their inward hearts, as their hearts were of their more secret and retired de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. And as fervent love, and true discretion, very seldome concurre and meet; so although affection made them rich in inventing new inventions to meet and kisse: yet they were so poore, or rather so blind in discretion, as they could not beare their affections in secrisie and silence: but by this time they are bewrayed to their Parents, and divulged to their acquaintance: but if any grieve and storme at this unexpected newes, it is first <hi>Albemare,</hi> then <hi>Capello</hi> and <hi>Castiana,</hi> betwixt whom there was a secret promise, and verball contract, that hee and no other should marry their daughter.</p>
                     <p>Thus we see that <hi>Albemare</hi> and <hi>Baretano</hi> are become Competitors and Rivalls in their affections, for either of them affect <hi>Clara</hi> as the mistris of their thoughts, and both adore her as the Queene Regent of their desires. But as they simpathize in their hopes to purchase her to their wife: So they differ in the meanes and progresse of their resolutions, how to obtaine her. For whiles <hi>Baretano</hi> sues the daughter before her Parents, so doth <hi>Albemare</hi> the Parents before their daughter: but what effects and ends, these beginnings will produce, ye shall shortly see, and they themselves very soone both feele and find.</p>

                        <hi>Capello</hi> and <hi>Castiana</hi> (as wee have formerly said) with much affliction and griefe, understanding of their daughters affection to <hi>Baretano,</hi> and reciprocally of his to her, they (with much impatience and passion) relate it to <hi>Albemare,</hi> whose affection to <hi>Clara</hi> hath made him so subtill towards them, as although his heart knowes this newes, yet he makes his tongue deny the knowledge thereof; when protesting of his intire and fervent affection to her: and that he must either wed her or his grave: they consult on their important businesse, how they may Dethronize <hi>Baretano,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronize <hi>Albemare</hi> in the chaire and choice of <hi>Clara's</hi> affection: As for <hi>Capello</hi> and <hi>Castiana,</hi> they so highly affect <hi>Albemares</hi> great and free estate, and so disdainefully hate the intricate incombrances of <hi>Baretano's,</hi> as they vow, there resolutions shall Sayle by thecompasse of his desires; and he in exchange, that his affections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, shall still steere their course by that of their resolutions: So from the matter of their agreement, they proceed to the manner how to effect it; To which end her father and mother single their daughter apart, and in milde and faire tearmes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand her, what hath past betwixt her and <hi>Baretano,</hi> and whether she be so simple and inconsiderate to take so poore a Gentleman for her husband, whose estate is so weake and small, as it cannot well maintaine himselfe, much lesse her; <hi>Clara</hi> already prepared and armed by her affection to receive these, or the like speeches from her Parents, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving twice or thrice metamorphosed the Lillies of her cheekes into Roses, very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately and modestly returnes them this discreet and respective answer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="217" facs="tcp:16653:126"/>
That as she must needs affirme she is confident of <hi>Baretano's</hi> affection to her, so she must as truly denie, that asyet he had ever motioned her for marriage; which if he had, considering that his birth, meanes, and vertues were such as every way deserved not onely her equall but her superiour, she is enforced to reveale them, that she loves him so tenderly and deerely, as if her will and pleasure be not contradicted by theirs, it will be not onely her joy but her felicity, to accept and take him for her husband, before all others of the world.</p>
                     <p>But this modest answer of hers, they hold too peremptory for a child to give, and Parents to receive; as if it savoured more of irregular zeale to <hi>Baretano,</hi> than of due respect and obedience to themselves, yet the sooner to devert her from her owne desires and resolutions to make her flexible to theirs, they as yet hold it fit, rather to continue mild than imperious towards her, and so by depraving the deserts and debasing the merits of <hi>Baretano,</hi> to seeke to extoll and magnifie those of <hi>Albemare,</hi> as if the first were only a foyle, and the second a rich <hi>Diamond,</hi> worthy of her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and wearing: and indeed so exquisite and excellent a <hi>Cavalier,</hi> they depaint him to her in the richest frame and pomp of all his praises, aswell of the endowments of mind, as of those of <hi>Fortune,</hi> that they leave no insinuating <hi>Oratory</hi> unessayed, nor perswasive attempt unattempted, to make her shake hands with <hi>Baretano,</hi> and consequently to extend her armes and heart to receive and retaine <hi>Albemare:</hi> But although she were yong in yeeres and experience; yet love in this fragrant and flourishing spring of her youth, had so refined her judgement, and indoctrinated and prompted her tongue, that her thoughts commanded and marshalled by her heart, and both by her desires and affection to <hi>Baretano,</hi> she confusedly intermixing, and interrupting her words with many far fetched broken sighes, againe returnes her Parents this reply.</p>
                     <p>If your age will not, yet my youth or rather my heart informes me, that <hi>Baretano</hi> as far exceeds <hi>Albemare</hi> in the priviledges of the mind and body, as <hi>Albemare</hi> doth him in those of <hi>Fortune,</hi> but that my resolutions and answers, may answer and correspond with my obedience, although I love <hi>Baretano,</hi> yet I will never hate, rather honour <hi>Albemare;</hi> but to make him my husband, or myselfe his wife, if Earth have, I hope Heaven hath not decreed it: And I humbly beseech yee, that this may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Capello</hi> and <hi>Castiana</hi> (like discreet parents) seeing their daughter <hi>Clara</hi> wholly wedded (in a maner) to the singularitie of her owne will; they yet conceive it to bee farre more requisite to revert her reasons by fairre meanes, than refute and refell them by force, sith love and discretion hath still reference to that, and this relation still to choller, many times to repentance: whereupon minding her of the blessings which infallibly attend filiall obedience; and the miseries and curses which indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually wayt on contempt and disobedience, hoping that time will effect that which Importunitie cannot, they as then leave her to her thoughts, and she them to their care; careing for nothing so much, nay, I may wel say, for nothing else, than to see her affection divorced from <hi>Baretano,</hi> and contracted and wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Albemare,</hi> who having curious correspondence and intelligence with them, he is ever and anon acertained, not onely what hath, but what doth passe betwixt them and their daughter; and withall, is advised by them, to delay no time, but to frequent and haunt her as her <hi>Ghost</hi> and shaddow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betwixt <hi>Capello</hi> and <hi>Castiana, Albemare</hi> is so farre from rejecting this
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16653:127"/>
advise and counsell, as hee embraceth it with much joy and delectation, and vowes (though with the perill of his life) to persevere and pursue her in marriage: To which end, authorized as well by his owne affection, as their authority, <hi>Clara</hi> is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abroad nor at home, but he meets her, gives away all time from himselfe, to give himselfe to her: so as it seemes to the eye of the world, that <hi>Capello's</hi> house is now become his, and that his daughter <hi>Clara</hi> likewise shortly shall be: yea, he addes such curiosity to his care, and such care to his affection in courting her, as shee cannot bee either at <hi>Masse,</hi> or <hi>Vespres,</hi> but he is either with her, or neere her, and when in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne pompe or zeale shee visits the <hi>Domo</hi> (or <hi>Cathedrall</hi> Church) of that Citie, and in it the Shrine of the new <hi>Saint Charles,</hi> then hee waits and attends on her at the Porch staires, sometimes with his Coach, but many times (as the custome of <hi>Millan</hi> is) on his Foot-cloth, and prancing <hi>Barbarie</hi> horse, to conduct her home: yea, and not to faile in any Complement of an accomplished Lover, besides the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his owne insinuation and solicitation, he greets her with rich presents, and salutes her with all variety of mellodious Musicke, and mellistuous voyces: but all this notwithstanding, although hee every way use his best art and industry, and her father and mother their best skill to make her flexible to his desires, and their pleasure; yet shee, as having her thoughts fully bent and fixed on her deare and sweet <hi>Baretano,</hi> lookes haggard and averse on <hi>Albemare,</hi> giving him such generall answers, and cold entertainment, as hee seeth hee hath farre more reason to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire than hope to obtaine her. Whereupon doubting of her affection, hee hath againe recourse to her parents love, who to confirme and seale it him, seeing faire meanes will not prevaile with their daughter, they resolve to vse force, and so to adde threats to their requests, and choller to their perswasions, to make her abandon <hi>Baretano,</hi> and embrace <hi>Albemare.</hi> But if the first prevaile not with her, the second cannot; for she now tels them plainly, that she neither can not will affect any man for her husband but <hi>Baretano;</hi> and yet she is so farre from any determinate resolution to marry him, as shee affirmes, that their will shall bee her law, and their pleasure her resolution.</p>
                     <p>Whiles thus <hi>Albemare</hi> in the way of marriage seekes our faire and sweet <hi>Clara</hi> publikely, no lesse doth <hi>Baretano</hi> privately; and although with lesse vanity and ostentation, yet hee hopes with farre more fortunacie and successe; as grounding his hopes upon these reasons: That in heart and soule <hi>Clara</hi> is onely his, as both in soule and heart he is hers: so hee entertaines her many times with his Letters, and yet not to shew himselfe a novice in discretion, or a coward in affection, hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingher content his commands, as shee did his desires her felicity; hee in remote Churches and Chappels, (for whose number <hi>Millan</hi> exceeds <hi>Rome)</hi> hath both the happinesse and honour privately to meet her, where if they violate the sanctity of the place, in conferring and cherishing their affections, yet they sanctifie thir affections, in desiring that some Church or Chappell might invest and crowne them with the religions honour, and holy dignitie of marriage. For having jested of Love here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, now like true Lovers, they henceforth resolve to love, not in jest, but in earnest; and as of their two hearts they have already made one, so now they meane and intend to dispose of their bodies, thereby to make one of two: And this is their sole desire, and this, and onely this is their chiefe delight, and most pleasing'st de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and wishes.</p>
                     <p>But as it is the nature of Love, for Lovers to desire to see none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and yet are seene of many: so this their familiarity and frequent meeting is againe reported to her father and mother, whereat they murmure with griefe, and grieve with discontent and affliction: and now not to substract, but to adde to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:16653:127"/>
their vexation, it is resolved betweene our two yong amorous Turtle Doves, <hi>Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tano,</hi> and his faire <hi>Clara,</hi> that he should publikely motion them for her in marriage; which he in wonderfull faire tearmes, and orderly <hi>Decorum,</hi> (as well by his friends as himselfe) performeth. When contrary to his wishes, but not his expectation, they give him so cold entertainment, and his suite such poore and sharpe acceptance, as they (in affection and zeale to <hi>Albemare)</hi> not onely deny him their daughter, but their house: an answer so incivill, and therfore so injust, as might give a testimony of some way of their care, yet no way of their discretion to themselves, or affection to their daughter. And here I must confesse, that I can difficultly define, whether this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and answer of <hi>Capello</hi> and <hi>Castiana,</hi> more delighted <hi>Albemare,</hi> disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Baretano,</hi> or afflicted <hi>Clara:</hi> who although in the entrance of their Loves, their hopes seem'd to be nipt, and their desires crost by the frownes of their parents; yet they love each other so tenderly and dearly; as these discontents notwithstanding, they will not retire, but are resolute to advance in the progresse of this their chast and servent affections, and although their commands endevour to give a law to her obedience, in not permitting her to be frequented of <hi>Baretano;</hi> yet her obedience is so inforced to take a more stronger of her affection, as dispight her parents malice and jelosie towards them, when they are sweetly sleeping in their beds, then is their daughter <hi>Clara</hi> waking with <hi>Baretano,</hi> and he with her; oftentimes walking and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Arboures, and many times kissing and billing in the close galleries of the garden; which they cannot conceale or beare so closely, but her father and mother have exact notice and intelligence thereof by some of their trusty servants, whom they had purposely appointed as <hi>Sentinels</hi> to espie and discover their meetings. Whereupon (as much in hatred to <hi>Baretano</hi> as in affection to <hi>Albemare)</hi> knowing that if the cause be once removed, the effect is subject soone to follow and ensue; they very suddenly and privately send away their daughter from <hi>Millan</hi> to <hi>Modena</hi> by Coach, there to be mewed and pent up with the Lady <hi>Emelia</hi> her Aunt, and besides her waiting Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman <hi>Adriana,</hi> none to accompany and conduct her but only <hi>Albemare,</hi> hoping that a small time, his presence and importunate solitations, would deface the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>Baretano,</hi> to engrave his owne in the heart and thoughts of his sweet <hi>Clara.</hi> Who poore soule, seing her selfe exiled and banished from the society of her <hi>Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tano's</hi> sight and company, wherein under heaven shee chiefly and onely delighted; she hereat, doth as it were drowne her selfe in the Ocean of her teares; storming as well at the cruelty of her parents, as at her owne affliction and misfortune; and no lesse doth her <hi>Baretano</hi> for the absence of his sweet Saint and deare Lady <hi>Clara:</hi> for as their affection, so their afflictions is equall; now mourning as much at each others absence, as formerly they rejoyced and triumphed in their presence. But although the jealousie of <hi>Capello</hi> and <hi>Castiana</hi> were very carefull to watch and observe <hi>Baretano</hi> in <hi>Millan;</hi> and the zeale and affection of <hi>Albemares</hi> safety to guard, and sweetly to attend on <hi>Clara</hi> and <hi>Modena:</hi> Yet as fire surpressed flames forth with more violence, and rivers stopped, overflow with more impetuosity; so despight of the ones vigilancie, and the others jealousie, though <hi>Baretano</hi> cannot be so happy and blessed to ride over to <hi>Modena,</hi> to see and salute his <hi>Clara:</hi> yet love, which is the refiner of inventions and wit, and the polisher of judgement, cannot yet deraine him from visiting her with his letters, the which in respect of the hard accesse and difficult passage to her, hee is enforced to send her by subtill meanes, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret messengers; and the better to overshadow the curiosity of his Arts, and the Art of his affection herein, hee among many others, makesuse of a Frier and a Hermite, for the conveyance of two letters to <hi>Modena;</hi> to his Lady: which (as fit agents for such amorous employments) they (with more cunning and fidelity, than

zeale, and <hi>Religion)</hi> safely delivered her, and likewise returned him her answers thereof. And because the servency of their affections and constancies, each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are more lively depainted and represented in these two, than in any other of their letters; therefore I thought my selfe in a manner bound, here to insert them, to the end to give the better spirit and <hi>Grace</hi> to their <hi>History,</hi> and the fuller satisfaction and content to the curiosity of the Reader: That which <hi>Baretano</hi> sent <hi>Clara</hi> upon her departure from <hi>Millan</hi> to <hi>Modena</hi> by the Frier, spake thus:</p>

But as calmes ensue tempests, and sun-shine showres, so I beseech thee to brook it with as much patience, as I doe with griefe; and not onely hope, but resolve, that violence is never permanent, and all extreames subject to revolution and change.

                     <p>By these loving Letters of these our Lovers, the <hi>Reader</hi> may observe and remark, what a firme league, and strict and constant friendship there was contracted and setled betwixt them, and what a hell their abscence was each to others thoughts and contemplations: In the meane time, whiles <hi>Baretano</hi> entertaines <hi>Clara</hi> with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Albemare</hi> doth with words, wherein he useth his best Rhetoricke and Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to draw her to his desires; and withall, to listen and espie out, if there passe any passages of Letters, or other correspondency betwixt them. Which although <hi>Clara</hi> her affection to <hi>Baretano</hi> vow, and her discretion to her selfe resolve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale and obscure from <hi>Albemare,</hi> yet loe here falls out a sinister and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected accident, which will discover and bewray it; yea, and of all sides, and to all parties produce griefe, sorrow, choller, and repentance, which in effect (briefely) is thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Clara</hi> had reason in her former Letter sent by the <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> to tearme this her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration in <hi>Modena</hi> a captivity, sith the bounds of her aunt <hi>Emelias</hi> two small Gardens, and the walles of her little Parke, were the limits wherein her liberty was confined, and her selfe as it were, immured: for farther she was not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to goe, except to the Church with her aunt in her Coach, but still accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by <hi>Albemare,</hi> who left no minutes nor occasions, as well to see her, as to bee seene of her. Now to give some truce (though not peace) to her discontents, and thereby somewhat to calme the impetuosity of those tempests, which love had stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in her heart and thoughts for the abscence of her <hi>Baretano,</hi> she never better accompanied then when alone, sometime past away, the irkesomenesse of her time in walking in the Gardens, but many times in the Parke close shut, followed only by her wayting Gentlewoman <hi>Adriana:</hi> for in respect of her aunts unkindnesse, and <hi>Albemares</hi> jelousie, she would neither accept of her familiaritie, nor of his company. Now to the neerest end of the Parke, not farre distant from the second Garden, was a curious walke, ranked about with many rowes of <hi>Sycamore</hi> trees, and at the farther end thereof a close ore-shadowed Bower; yea, so closely vailed, that the raies of the Sunne could neither peepe in, to scortch the purenesse of her beauty, or to contend with the piercing lustre and resplendancy of her eyes: and to this Bower, in a faire and cleare day, <hi>Clara</hi> (about three of the clocke after dinner) repaires, having in her hand to delude the time, the old amourous <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Hero</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> which was very lately illustrated, and newly reprinted in <hi>Millan</hi> and wherein indeed for the conformity of their loves with her owne, shee tooke a singular delight to reade: but that which gave sweeter musicke to her thoughts, and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to her heart, and mind, were her <hi>Baretano's</hi> two Letters, (which we have formerly seene) and which as then she had purposely brought with her to survey and peruse; yea, she reades them ore againe and againe; and to write the truth, more oftner than there are words, or I thinke sillables therein contained: but
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16653:129"/>
when she descends to his name, she cannot refraine from kissing it; yea, and such is her tender love to <hi>Baretano,</hi> as she bedewes it with her teares; a thousand times she wished her selfe with him, or he with her, and bitterly blames the crueltie of her parents, for separating their bodies, sith she not onely hoped, but assured her selfe, that God had conjoyned, and united their hearts. But whiles she in the middest of these passionate extasies seemes to be rapt up into the heaven of joy, at the perusall of these Letters of <hi>Brretano;</hi> and then againe to be plunged into the hell of sorrow, at the consideration and remembrance of his absence, she heares a voyce, which she thinkes is not farre off from her, when looking foorth the Bower, and deeming it to be that of her wayting-Gentlewoman, whom she saw somewhat neere her gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Strawberries, and wilde Lillies, she within a flight shot from her, perceives it to be her <hi>Lover,</hi> (but not her love,) <hi>Albemare,</hi> who knowing her there in the Bower, and for want of other talke, speaking to the Eccho, she guessed by his course, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she was not deceived) that he had an intent to salute and speake with her; which to prevent, because it wholly displeased her, to be cumbred with the company of so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcomed a guest as himselfe; shehastily folds up her letters in her handkercher, and clapping them (at least as she thought) into the pocket of her gowne, takes her booke in her hand, and calling <hi>Adriana,</hi> trips away backe towards the garden, by the other side of the Parke, purposely to eschew and avoide him, as indeed she did.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Albemare</hi> grieves to see <hi>Clara's</hi> coynesse and cruelty toward him, although she were departed foorth the Parke from him, yet his affection is so fervent to her, as he will needs ascend the Bower, esteeming it not onely a kind of content, but ables<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to his thoughts; sith he cannot be where she is, yet to be where she hath beene: when thinking to mount the stayers of the bower, he unexpected at the foot thereof, finds the two letters whereof we have formerly spoken, which it seemes slipt foorth of <hi>Clara's</hi> handkerceh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>, as she was putting it into her pocket: <hi>Albemare</hi> taking up the letters, and seeing them directed to his sweet <hi>Clara,</hi> he betwixt the extreames of love and joy, kisseth them againe and againe for her sake: when sitting downe in the Bower, he betakes himselfe to reade and peruse them, verily expecting and hoping to gather and draw something from them which might tend to advance the processe of his affection towards her: But when he had read the first, he was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ly perplexed and afflicted, as he had hardly the patience to peruse the second, and yet at length hastily &amp; passionately running it over, and seeing by all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances thereof, that it was in vaine for him any longer to hope for <hi>Clara,</hi> sith she was <hi>Baretano's,</hi> and <hi>Baretano</hi> hers, he like one Lunaticke, stampes with his foot, throwes away his hat, teares his haire for very griefe and choller, now thinking to teare the letters, and then to offer violence to himselfe: But when the fumes and flames of this his folly were over blowne, and that he had againe recalled his wits to take place in theproper seat of his judgement and discretion; then taking up his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherein he saith, hee will take advise of his pillow; when fasting out his supper, he betakes himselfe to his bed, to see whether he can sleepe away those his passions and vexations. And by this time <hi>Clara</hi> going to locke up these two aforesaid letters in her trunke, shee finds her handkercher, but misseth her letters; whereat blushing for shame, and then againe looking pale for sorrow, griefe and anger,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:16653:130"/>
she speedily sends away <hi>Adriana</hi> to the Bower, to looke them; who returnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, and then she knowes for certaine that <hi>Albemare</hi> hath found them: whereupon for meere griefe and anger, feigning herselfe sick, she withdrawes her selfe to her chamber, and there presently betakes her selfe to her bed.</p>
                     <p>I may well say that <hi>Clara</hi> and <hi>Albemare</hi> betake themselves to their beds; but I am sure not to their rest: For griefe and love so violently acte their severall parts in their hearts and thoughts, as sigh they doe, but sleepe they cannot: Yea their passionsand sorrowes are as different as their desires; for as <hi>Albemare</hi> now grives that he hath found these letters, so doth <hi>Clara</hi> that she hath lost them; and as he vowes not to restore her them, so shee neither dares, and yet disdayneth to demand them of him: Yea againe, which is more, as their sorrowes are different, so are their pretended consolations; at least if I may properly and truely rearme them consolations: For as <hi>Clara,</hi> although she have lost her <hi>Baretano's</hi> letters, doth yet rejoyce that she still retaines the writer and Authour thereof ingraven and caracte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in her heart: so doth <hi>Albemare,</hi> that now fully knowing <hi>Baretano</hi> to be his rivall, and who by all probability is like to beare his mistris from him, he hath (as he injustly conceives, a just reason to be revenged, and a true occasion to fight with him: but as <hi>Clara's</hi> comfort and consolation herein proceeds from true affection, so doth the vanitie and impiety of this resolution of <hi>Albemares</hi> from hellish malice, and devillish indignation: yea, although the night doth or should bring counsell, yet as <hi>Clara</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sseth it over onely with sighes, so doth <hi>Albemare</hi> with fumes of reveng against <hi>Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tano,</hi> vowing that he will in the morne towards <hi>Millan,</hi> and there trie his fortune, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to kill him, or to bee killed of him, in a <hi>Duell;</hi> to which end he is no sooner ready, but he acquaints the Lady <hi>Emelia</hi> with his intended journey, but not with his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to fight with <hi>Baretano,</hi> and the same he doth to the Empresse of his thoughts, and Queene of his desires) <hi>Clara,</hi> demaunding her if she please to command him any service for <hi>Millan;</hi> who both blushing and paling hereat, her affection to <hi>Baretano,</hi> having now made her expert in the subtilties of love, she well knowes what wind drives <hi>Albemare</hi> to <hi>Millan:</hi> and therefore guided by discretion, and not by passion, she returnes him this answer: That having neither reason nor desire to command him, she onely prayes him to remember her humble duty to her Father and mother, and so wisheth his journey prosperous: which answer of hers (being indeed no other than <hi>Albemare</hi> expected) he yet advanceth to kisse her at parting; which her civility though not her affection granted him; not so much as once dreaming or suspecting that he conceived the least thought or intent to fight with her sweet <hi>Baretano,</hi> and so he takes horse, having onely one servant with him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Albemare</hi> being arrived at Saint <hi>Remie,</hi> a small Towne within fifteene miles of <hi>Millan,</hi> he resolves to dine there, which he doth; and to avoid the heate of the day, then betakes himselfe to sleepe an houre or two; being awaked, he commands his man to make ready his horse, and seeing the host of the house in his chamber, inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of him if there were any Gentelmenin the house riding for <hi>Millan,</hi> who as soone turnes him this unlooke for and unexspected answer; that there was a brave Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in the house named <hi>Signior Baretano,</hi> who was to ride thither some two houers hence. <hi>Albemare</hi> no sooner heares the name of <hi>Baretano,</hi> but his very heart blood flasheth up in his face, when demanding him again what manner of ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleman was, he told him he was a tall slender young Gentleman, with never a haire on his face, and out of this window quoth he, you may now see him walking in the garden; when <hi>Albemare</hi> looking forth, sees indeed that it was his very rival <hi>Baretano;</hi> when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring further of the Host what followers he had with him, he told him that then he had none, but sometimes when he came thither, either to take the ayre, or breath his

But foure daies after are not fully expired, but her father and mother advertise their daughter <hi>Clara,</hi> their sister <hi>Emelia,</hi> and <hi>Albemare</hi> thereof, by a Gentleman, a servant of theirs, whom they purposely send to <hi>Modena,</hi> to bring backe <hi>Clara,</hi> and <hi>Albemare</hi> to <hi>Millan.</hi> But it is for none but Lovers, to conceive or judge, with what extreame excesse of griefe and immoderate sorrow our poore <hi>Clara</hi> understands this heart-piercing newes of her <hi>Baretano's</hi> mournefull and sorrowfull death: for she is no sooner advertised thereof, but she throws off her attyre, teares her haire, and twice following falls to the ground, in a swound, so as <hi>Emelia, Albemare, Adriana,</hi> and her fathers Gentleman can hardly referch and keepe life in her: but being come againe to her senses, and selfe; and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opening her cloudy eyes to the beames of the Sunne, who enamoured of her beauty (as well in pitty as love) came to comfort and revive her: shee wringing her hands, then crossing her armes, and lastly, looking up towards <hi>Heaven,</hi> betwixt sighing and speaking, breaths forth these mournefull, passionate, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate speeches:</p>
                     <p>O my <hi>Baretano,</hi> my sweet and deare <hi>Barenano,</hi> and shall thy wretched <hi>Clara</hi> live thou being dead? when the violence of her affection and sorrow making her forget her selfe, and her God, she secretly unsheathes her knife, and then and there would have stabbed her selfe to death, had not <hi>Albemare</hi> and her Aunt <hi>Emelia</hi> speedily stept to her assistance, and prevented her, by wresting it from her; when conducting her to the Garden; to take the aire, she praies <hi>Albemare</hi> to leave her, and in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence often againe repeating the name of her deare <hi>Baretano,</hi> shee a thousand times wisheth that her life had ransomed his, vowing that although she were a woman, yet if she knew his murtherers, shee would flie to their eyes, and teare out their hearts, in meere revenge of this inhumane and cruell death: when her sorrowes are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and her griefe so unsupportable, as she cannot long remaine in one place, but withdrawes herselfe from the garden to her chamber, whither her Aunt <hi>Emelia</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accompanies her, lies with her that night to comfort her, who poore afflicted young Lady, neither can nor will be comforted: so as the next morning, had not her Aunt powerfully prevented and stopped her, she had then undoubtedly entred the <hi>Nunnery</hi> of her owne name, Saint <hi>Clara,</hi> and in that retyred and obscure life there ended her daies in <hi>Modena;</hi> resolving in true affection and zeale to her dead <hi>Bareta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> never thenceforth either to see her parents, or <hi>Millan:</hi> but being diverted and comforted by some Divines, and many Ladies of that Citty, she brooking her sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes as patiently as she may, (with much solicitation) after ten dayes, permits herself to be conveyed home to <hi>Millan,</hi> where although she were very cheerefully received, and joyfully entertained of her father and mother, yet shee likewise went neere to have their mewed her selfe up a spirituall sister in the <hi>Nunnery</hi> of the <hi>Annunciation;</hi> but that againe she was prevented; whereat grieving, she yet takes on mourning attire, and vowes to weare it a whole yeare for his sake: when to make her selfe (as she was) both a true Lover, and a true mourner to the memory of her dead <hi>Bareta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> shee oftentimes steals into Saint <hi>Euphemias</hi> Church, where he was buried, and there bedewes his tombe with teares, living so pensively, and disconsolately, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though shee live in the world, yet it seemes shee neither is, nor long will be of the world.</p>
                     <p>But as women are but women, and as a Time is a soveraigne remedy for all disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and sorrowes; so about some ten moneths after, the incessant importunity of her father and mother, and the continuall tender respect and observant courtesie of <hi>Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare</hi> towards her, make her somewhat neglect and forget the memory of <hi>Baretano,</hi> and now to looke on him with a more pleasing and favourable eye than before.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:16653:132"/>
But here (againe) a consideration makes her afection die towards <hi>Albemare,</hi> almost as soone as it begins to live: For why (quoth she) should she affect or love him, who at Saint <hi>Remy</hi> gave her <hi>Baretano</hi> three severall wounds? But then Love againe steps in, and thus pleads with her for <hi>Albemare:</hi> That hee received five wounds, and gave <hi>Baretano</hi> but three, which made him lose farre more bloud than <hi>Baretano:</hi> and yet that this attempt of his was onely occasioned through his affection to her, and onely for her sake, as loving her dearer than his owne life; which againe gave her thoughts such satisfaction, as weighed downe and vanquished, as well by the power and prayers of her parents, as also by the endlesse sighs, letters, and presents of <hi>Albemare:</hi> the yeare is no sooner expired, and her mourning weeds and attire done away, but to their owne hearts content, and the unspeakable joy of their parents, they in <hi>Millan</hi> (with great pompe and bravery) are very solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly married. But this marriage of theirs shall not prove so prosperous as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and hope: For <hi>God</hi> in his all-seeing <hi>Providence,</hi> hath decreed to disturbe the tranquility and serenity thereof, and to make them feele the sharpe and bitter showres of affliction and misery, which briefly doth thus surprise and befall them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Albemare</hi> and <hi>Clara</hi> have hardly beene married together a yeare and quarter, but his hot love begins to wax cold and frozen to her; yea, albeit she affected him truly and tenderly, yet hee continually neglecting her, and no longer delighting in the sweetnesse of her youth, and the freshnesse of her beauty, his lustfull eyes and thoughts carry his lascivious selfe abroad among Curtezans, when they should be fixed on her, and resident at home with his chaste and faire Lady: so as his infidelity proving her griefe and torments, and his vanity and ingratitude her unspeakable affliction and vexation; she with infinite sighs and teares repents her matching him, and a thousand times wisheth shee had beene so happy and blessed to have died <hi>Baretano's</hi> Martyr, and not so unfortunate and accursed to live to see her selfe <hi>Albemares</hi> wife: and yet were there any hope of his reformation, she could then prefixbounds to her calamities and sorrowes: But seeing that his vices grew with his age, and that every day he became more vicious and unkinde to her than other, her hopes are now wholly turned into despaire, her mirth into mourning; yea, her inward discontents so apparantly bewray themselves, in her outward sorrowfull complexion and countenance, that the Roses of her cheekes are metamorphosed into Lillies, and her heart so wholly taken up with anguish, and surprised with sorrow, as shee wisheth that her bed were her grave, and her selfe in Heaven with God; because shee could finde no comfort here on Earth with her husband: But beyond her expectation, God is providing to redresse her griefe, and to remedy her afflictions by a very strange and unlooked for accident.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> of <hi>God</hi> doth now againe refetch bloudy <hi>Pedro,</hi> to act another part upon the <hi>Stage</hi> and <hi>Theater</hi> of this <hi>History:</hi> For having spent that money lewdly, which he before got damnably of <hi>Albemare,</hi> his wants are so great, and his necessity so urgent, as having played the murtherer before, hee makes no conscience nor scruple now to play the theefe, and so by night breaks into a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellers shops, named <hi>Seignior Fiamata,</hi> dwelling in the great place before the <hi>Domo,</hi> and there carries away from him a small Trunke or Casket, wherein were some uncut <hi>Saphyrs</hi> &amp; <hi>Emralds,</hi> with some <hi>Venice</hi> Chrystall pendants for Ladies to weare in their eares, and other rich commodities: but <hi>Fiamata</hi> lying over his shop, and hearing it, and locking his doore to him for feare of having his throat cut, gives the out-cry and alarum forth the window, which ringing in the streets, makes some of the neighbours, and also the watch approach and assemble; where fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Pedro</hi> running with a Casket under his arme, he is presently hemb'd in, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:16653:133"/>
and imprisoned, and the Casket tooke from him, and againe resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Fiamata;</hi> when knowing that he shall die for this robbery, as a just punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and judgement of God, now sent him for formerly murthering of <hi>Baretano,</hi> he having no other hope to escape death, but by the meanes of <hi>Albemare,</hi> he sends early the next morning for his man <hi>Valerio,</hi> to come to the prison to him, whom he bids to tell his Master <hi>Albemare</hi> from him, that being sure to be condemned for this robbery of his, if he procure him not his pardon, he will not charge his soule any longer with the murther of <hi>Baretano,</hi> but will on the ladder reveale, how it was he who hired himselfe &amp; <hi>Leonardo</hi> to performe it; <hi>Valerio</hi> reporting this to his Master, it affrights his thoughts, and terrifies his conscience and courage, to see himselfe reduced to this misery, that no lesse than his life must now stand to the mercy of this wretched Varlet <hi>Pedro's</hi> tongue. But knowing it impossible to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a pardon for him, and therfore high time to provide for his owne safety, by stopping of <hi>Pedro's</hi> mouth; he resolves to heave <hi>Ossa</hi> upon <hi>Pelon,</hi> or to adde mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to murther, and now to poyson him in prison, whom he had formerly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to murther <hi>Baretano</hi> in the street, to the end he might tell no tales on the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thinking it no ingratitude or sinne, but rather a just reward and recompence for his former bloudy service; so to feed <hi>Pedro</hi> with false hopes, thereby to charme his tongue to silence, and to lull his malice asleepe, he speedily returnes <hi>Valerio</hi> to prison to him, who bids him feare nothing, for that his master had vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get him his pardon, as he shall more effectually heare from him that night; whereat <hi>Pedro</hi> rejoyceth and triumpheth, telling <hi>Valerio</hi> that his Master <hi>Albemare</hi> is the most generous and bravest Cavalier of <hi>Lombardy.</hi> But to nip his joyes in their untimely blossomes, and to disturbe the harmony of his false content, that very day as soone as hee hath dined, he is tryed and arraigned before his Judges; and being apparantly convicted and found guilty of this robbery, hee is by them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be hanged the next morne, at a Gibbet purposely to be erected before <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amata's</hi> house, where he committed his delict and crime: which just sentence not only makes his joy strike saile to sorrow, but also his pride and hopes let fall their Peacocks plumes to humility and feare: But his onely trust and comfort, yea, his last hopes and refuge is in <hi>Albemare,</hi> who hearing him to be condemned to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the next morning; he is enforced to play his bloudy prize that night, and so in the evening sends <hi>Valerio</hi> to prison to him, with a Capon, and two Fiascoes (or bottles) of Wine, for him to make merry, informing him that he hath obtained his pardon, and that it is written, and wants nothing but the Viceroyes signe to it, which he shall have to morrow at breake of day. But the wine of the one of the bottles was intermixed with strong and deadly poyson, which was so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly tempered, as it carried no distastefull, but a pleasing relish to the pallate; <hi>Valerio</hi> like an execrable villaine, proving as true a servant to his Master, as a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and false one to his God, he punctially performes this fearefull and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full businesse; and having made <hi>Pedro</hi> twice drunke, first with his good newes, and then with his poysoned wine, he takes leave of him that night, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to his rest, promiseth to be with him very early in the morning with his pardon. When this miserable and beastly prophane wretch, never thinking of his danger, or death; of God or his soule; of Heaven or Hell, betakes himselfe to his bed, where the poyson spreading ore his vitals parts, soone bereave him of his breath, sending his soule from this life and world to another.</p>
                     <p>Now the next morning very early as the Gaoler came to his chamber, to bid him prepare to his execution, hee finds him dead and cold in his bed; and thus was the miserable end of this bloudy and inhumane murtherer (and theefe) <hi>Pedro:</hi>
                        <pb n="231" facs="tcp:16653:133"/>
who yet for example sake was one whole day hanged by the heeles in his shirt, at his appointed place of execution, because his Judges deemed that he had cruelly poysoned and made away himselfe. And now doth <hi>Albemare</hi> againe rejoyce and triumph to see he hath avoided that dangerous shelfe and rocke whereon hee was very likely to have suffered shipwracke, yea, and now hee thinks himselfe so absolutely safe and secure, as he holds it impossible, that either his murthering of <hi>Baretano,</hi> or his poysoning of <hi>Pedro</hi> can any way reflect on him, or henceforth produce him any further stormes or tempests: but his hopes and joyes will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, for God, who is the infallible revenger of innocent bloud, will not so leave him, but ere long, when he least thinks or dreames thereof, not onely in his providence detect these his foule crimes, but in his justice severely punish them, and the Readers curiosity shall not goe farre to see it; for as to a guilty consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is the pleasure of the Lord, that one misery befall him in the necke and nicke of the other, so <hi>Albemare</hi> is no sooner freed of <hi>Pedro</hi> in <hi>Millan,</hi> but behold he is afresh intangled and assaulted with <hi>Leonardo</hi> (his other hired murtherer) in <hi>Pavia,</hi> who having there prodigally rioted away his hundred Duckatons, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so runne himselfe farre in debt; his Creditors joyne together, and so clap him prisoner, where having no other hope for his freedome and liberty, but to relie on <hi>Albemare,</hi> he writes him a Letter to <hi>Millan,</hi> wherein hee acquaints him with his poverty and misery, and prayes him (for the obtaining of his liberty) either to lend or give him fifty Duckatons: <hi>Albemare</hi> receives this Letter, but forgetting his former service; as also thinking it onely a fetch of <hi>Leonardo,</hi> to fetch him over for so many Duckatons, as God would have it, hee very inconsiderately burnes this his Letter, and answereth it with silence: but hee shall repent it when it will be too late, and out of his power to remedy this his ingratitude and indiscretion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leonardo</hi> having at least fifteene dayes expected an answer from <hi>Albemare,</hi> and receiving none, he is extreamly incensed and inraged to see himselfe thus sleighted and forgotten of him, when exasperated by his misery, and animated by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame poverty and indigence, in that hee is now inforced to sell away his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and so to uncloth his backe, thereby to feed his belly, he intends no more to request and pray him, but now resolves to touch him to the quicke, the which he doth in these few lines which he sends him to <hi>Millan</hi> by a messenger of purpose.</p>

Now although <hi>Leonardo</hi> meane not as hee write, yet this his messenger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Millan,</hi> and not finding <hi>Albemare</hi> at his house, he knowes not (and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute) what to doe, either to stay his comming in, or to deliver his Letter to some of his servants: But waiting at his doore till late in the evening, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no newes of him, he gives it to <hi>Valerio,</hi> and (without telling him from whom, or whence it came) prayes him safely to deliver it to his Master, and that hee will repaire thither the next morning for an answer. <hi>Valerio</hi> claps the Letter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his pocket, awayting his Masters comming: but hee is so bad a husband to himselfe, and so disloyall, and unkinde a one to his chaste and faire wife, as hee was out all night with his Curtizans, which good and vertuous Lady, even pierceth her heart with griefe and sorrow. Now <hi>Valerio</hi> seeing his Master ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, his comming uncertaine, and himselfe inforced to goe forth about his affaires, he placeth the Letter upon a Cupboard neare his Masters study, that it might bee apparant to his eye when he came in, and so departs.</p>
                     <p>But here the mercy and providence of God invites the Christian Reader, to admire and wonder at the strange discovery and detection of this Letter: for as <hi>Albemare</hi> (more for sport than charity) kept a man-foole of some forty yeares old in his house, who indeed was so naturally peevish, as not <hi>Millan,</hi> hardly <hi>Italy</hi> could match him for simplicity. It so chanced, that this harmlesse foole gate into the roome after <hi>Valerio,</hi> and saw him put up this Letter on the Cupboard: Now, as Children and Fooles may in some sort bee tearmed Cousin Germaine to Apes, so as soone as <hi>Valerio</hi> was departed, this foole (no doubt led wholly by the direction and finger of God, rather than by his owne proper ignorance and simplicity) gets into the chamber, and taking a stoole to ascend the Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, hee brings away the Letter, which both in the Hall and yard he tosses and dandles in his hand, as if this new found play gave delight and content to his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and simple thoughts: when, behold our sweet and vertuous <hi>Clara</hi> comming from Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> Church, where shee had beene to here <hi>Vespres,</hi> and seeing a faire Letter fast sealed in the fooles hand, shee enquires of him from whence hee had it? who singing and hopping, and still playing with the Letter, shee could get no other answer from him, but <hi>That it was his Letter, and that God had sent it him, that God had sent it him:</hi> which speeches of his hee often redoubled. When <hi>Clara</hi> weighing his words, and considering out of whose mouth they came, her heart instantly beganne to grow, and her colour to rise, as if God and her soule prompted her, that shee had some interest in that Letter: whereupon snatching it from the foole, whom shee left crying in the Hall for the losse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: she seeing it directed to her Husband, goes to the Parlor, attended by <hi>Adriana,</hi> and there sitting downe in a chaire, and breaking up the seales thereof, shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to reade it; but when shee drawes towards the conclusion thereof, and finds that it was her husband <hi>Albemare's</hi> who had caused her deare Lover and Friend <hi>Baretano</hi> to bee murthered: then not able to containe her selfe for sorrow, shee throwes her selfe on the floore, and weepes and sighs so mournfully, as the most obduratest and flintiest heart could not chuse but relent into pitie to see her: for sometimes shee lookt up to heaven, and then againe dejecting her eyes to earth, now wringing her hands, and then crossing her armes, in such disconsolate and afflicted manner, as <hi>Adriana</hi> could not likewise refraine from teares to behold her: when after a deepe and profound silence, she bandying and evaporating ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny volleyes of farre fetched sighs into the ayre, shee commanding <hi>Adriana</hi> forth, the doore shut, with the two extremities of passion and sorrow, shee alone ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters these mournfull speeches to her selfe.</p>

And shall <hi>Clara</hi> live to understand, that her <hi>Baretano</hi> was murthered for her sake, and by her unfortunate husband <hi>Albemare?</hi> and shall she any more lie in bed with him, who so inhumanely hath layen him in his untimely and bloudy grave?

and bloudy fact of his, he the same afternoone is condemned to be hanged the next morning, at the common place of Execution, which administreth matter of talke, and admiration throwout all <hi>Millan;</hi> when Serjeants are likewise sent away to <hi>Pavia,</hi> to bring <hi>Leonardo</hi> to <hi>Millan,</hi> who not so much as once dreamt or thought that ever this his letter would have produced him this danger and misery.</p>
                     <p>And now <hi>Albemare</hi> advertised of the manner how this letter of <hi>Leonardo</hi> was brought to light, (without looking up to Heaven from whence this vengeance justly befell him for his sinnes) hee curseth the cruelty of his wife, the simplicity of the foole, but most bitterly exclaimeth against the remisnesse and carelesnesse of his servant <hi>Valerio,</hi> in not retaining and keeping that letter, which is the onely cause of his death: yea, he is so farre transported with choller against him, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he have but a few houres to live, yet hee vowes he will assuredly cry quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him ere he die.</p>
                     <p>Now the charity of his Judges send him Divines that night in prison, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and cleare his conscience, and to confirme and fortifie his soule against the morne, in his last conflict with the world, and her flight and transmigration to heaven; who powerfully and religiously admonishing him, that if he have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any other notorious offence or crime, hee should now doe well to reveale it: He likewise there and then confesseth, how hee had caused his man <hi>Valerio</hi> to poyson <hi>Pedro</hi> with wine in prison, the verynight before he was executed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this bloudy and execrable wretch (according to his hellish deserts) is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise apprehended and imprisoned.</p>
                     <p>And now Gods mercy and justice brings this unfortunate (because irreligious) Gentleman <hi>Albemare,</hi> to receive condigne punishment for those his two horrible murthers, which he had caused to bee committed on the persons of <hi>Baretano</hi> and <hi>Pedro,</hi> who ascending the ladder in presence of a world of spectators, who flocked from all parts of the City to see him take his last farewell of the world: The sight and remembrance of his foule crimes, having now made him not onely sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but repentant, he briefly delivered these few words.</p>
                     <p>He confessed that hee had hired <hi>Pedro</hi> and <hi>Leonardo</hi> to kill <hi>Baretano</hi> in the street, and seduced his servant <hi>Valerio</hi> to poyson <hi>Pedro</hi> in prison; whereof with much griefe and contrition he heartily repented himselfe, and besought the Lord to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it him: he likewise besought <hi>Leonardo</hi> and <hi>Valerio</hi> to forgive him, in respect he knew he was the cause of their deaths; because he was sure they should not long survive him. He likewise forgave his foole, as being assured, that it was not hee in the Letter, but God in him that had revealed the Letter for his just punishment and confusion. And lastly, he with many teares forgave his wife and Lady <hi>Clara,</hi> whom hee affirmed from his heart, was by farre too vertuous for so dissolute and vilde a husband as himselfe. He blamed himselfe for neglecting to love her, and cursed his Queans and Curtizans, as being the chiefe cause of all his miseries, when requesting all that were present to pray for his soule, he was turned off.</p>
                     <p>But his Judges seeing that hee had added murther to murther, they held it Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to adde punishment to his punishment; and so he is no sooner cut downe, but they cause his body to be burnt, and his ashes to be throwne into the aire, which is accordingly performed.</p>
                     <p>Now because the Lord in his Justice will punish as well the Agents, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of murther: whiles <hi>Albemare</hi> is acting the last <hi>Scene</hi> and <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of his <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</hi> His wretched hireling <hi>Leonardo,</hi> and his execrable servant <hi>Valerio</hi> are likewise a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Executioners, where <hi>Leonardo</hi> his former life and profession having made him know better how to sinne than repent; he out of a souldier-like bravery, (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanity) thinks rather to terrifie death, than that death should terrifie him; he begging pardon for his sinnes in generall of God and the world, and then bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hang-man doe his office, he takes his last adiew of the world.</p>
                     <p>When immediately <hi>Valerio</hi> ascends the ladder, who having repentance in his heart, and griefe and sorrow in his looks; as neare as could be observed and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, spake these words:</p>
                     <p>That being poore both in friends and means, the only hope of preferment under his master, made him at his request to poyson <hi>Pedro</hi> in prison; That many times since he hath heartily grieved for it, and now from his very soule repents himselfe of it, and beseeching the Lord to forgive it him, That hee was as guilty of this murther, as innocent of <hi>Baretano's;</hi> yea, or of the knowledge thereof, before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster was imprisoned for the same, and that as this was his first Capitall crime, so sith he must nowdie, he rejoyced it was his last, and so praying all servants to beware by his miserable example, not to be seduced to commit murther, either by their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters or the devill; and beseeching all that were present to pray for his soule, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing and commending it into the hands of his Redeemer, was likewise tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned off.</p>
                     <p>And these were the miserable (yet deserved ends) of these bloudy murtherers; and thus did Gods justice and revenge triumph over their crimes, and themselves, by heaping and raigning downe confusion on their heads from heaven, when the devill (falsely) made them beleeve they sate secure; yea, when they least dreamt thereof on earth: Oh that the sight and remembrance of their punishments may restraine and deterre us from conspiring and committing the like crimes! so shall we live fortunate, and die happy; whereas they died miserably, because they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved impiously and prophanely.</p>

                     <p>IN the faire and pleasant City of <hi>Mans,</hi> (being the chiefe and Capitall of the Province of <hi>Maine</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in the very latter yeares that the <hi>Marshall</hi> of <hi>Boys-Daulphin</hi> was Governour thereof, under the present King <hi>Lewes XIII.</hi> his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) there dwelt a <hi>Gentlewoman,</hi> (aged of threescore and three yeares) termed <hi>La Vasselay,</hi> being well descended, and left very rich, (as well in lands as moveables) by her late deceased husband <hi>Monsier Froyset,</hi> who was slaine in the behalfe of the <hi>Queene</hi> Mother, in the defence of <hi>Pont de Sey,</hi> assaulted and taken by the <hi>King</hi> her sonne. Now although this old widdow <hi>La Vasselay</hi> (in respect of her <hi>Age)</hi> was farre more fit to seeke <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> than a new <hi>Husband</hi> in her bed; yet shee is weary of a single life, although it be not fully six moneths since shee hath buried her second husband; (for the Reader must understand, she had formerly buried her first at least five and twenty yeares before, and is now againe resolved to take a third) and albeit she knew that the civility of the widdowes in <hi>France</hi> was such, that they seldome marrie, but almost never within the tearme of a whole yeare; yet her conceit and fancie thinks it not onely lawfull, but fit to breake this too austere custome; and therefore she peremptorily resolves to live a wife, and not to die a widdow. But this resolution of hers, were shee either in the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> or the <hi>Autumne</hi> of her yeares, had beene as excusable and praise-worthy, as now it savoured of undecencie and inconstancie, sith she was in the Winter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: For <hi>Age</hi> despight of her <hi>Youth,</hi> and youthfull desires, had throwne snow on her head, and new dyed the colour of her haire from blacke to white; yea, shee was so farre from retaining any signes or reliques of an indifferent beauty, as the furrowes of her face could not justly shew any ruines or demolitions thereof; and yet (forsooth) she will marry againe. Now her Birth and wealth, rather than her <hi>Vertues</hi> and personage, invite many old Widdowers, and some rich <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and Counsellours of the famous <hi>Presidiall</hi> Court of that City to seeke her in marriage; and indeed both for lands and money, none her inferiours, but all at least her equals, and some her betters: But in vaine, for the vanity of her thought suggest her, that either shee is too young for them, or they too old for her, and therfore she will have none of them: yea, her lust seemes so youthfully to give a law to her age, and the lye to her yeares, as she casts off her mourning attire, decks her selfe up in gay apparell, powders her haire, paints her face, with a resolution (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) to have no old <hi>Dotard,</hi> but a young Gallant to her husband, as if therein she wholly placed, not onely her content, but her felicity: But wee many times see such irregular desires, and such incontinent designes, met with unexpected misery, and unthought of repentance.</p>
                     <p>Now during the time that the vaine carriage and deportment of this old <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman</hi> and widdow <hi>La Vasselay,</hi> made her selfe the laughter and by-word of all <hi>Mans;</hi> home comes a young <hi>Gentleman</hi> of this Countrey of <hi>Maine,</hi> termed <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier De Merson,</hi> from his travell in <hi>Italy,</hi> whose father dwelt betwixt <hi>La Vall,</hi> and <hi>Gravelle,</hi> tearmed <hi>Monsier De Manfrelle,</hi> being a Gentleman well descended, and rich, and to whom <hi>De Merson</hi> was second sonne, who in a yeares absence in <hi>Italy,</hi> being purposely sent thither by his father, to enrich his experience and

capacity, (which is the true essence and glory of a traveller, thereby to bee the more capable to serve his Prince and Countrey, as also to be a comfort to his age, and a second prop to his house and linage) he had made such poore and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table use of his travels, as forgetting the obtaining of the language, and all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous exercises, perfections, and qualities, (so requisite and gracefull in Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) he delighted in nothing so much, nay, in nothing else, but to passe his time with Curtisans and strumpets, especially in <hi>Venice, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> where for their sakes, and his lascivious pleasures, hee built up the greatest part of his Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; where he so prodigally spent and exceeded his fathers exhibition, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes into <hi>France,</hi> not loaden with <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> but with <hi>Vices</hi> and <hi>Debts;</hi> being otherwise ignorant in all things which he should know, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but that wherein he should be ignorant.

And although that in a small time, the wiser sort of the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Ladies</hi> of the Citie found his wit and experience to come infinitely short of his brave apparell; yet the more illiterate &amp; ignorant of them, (who esteeme all men by their lustre, not by their brave worth) as prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring gay apparell, and the comelinesse of the body, before the exquisite endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and perfections of the mind; they hold him in so high a repute &amp; esteeme, as they thinke him to be the most absolute Gallant, not onely of <hi>Mans,</hi> but of all the Country of <hi>Maine;</hi> so easie it is to captivate the conceits and judgements of those who onely build their judgements in their conceits, and not their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits in judgement.</p>

Didst thou resolve to wed a husband neere of thine owne age, and so to end the remainder of thy dayes with him in chaste and holy wedlocke, that resolution of thine were as excusable, as this in desiring so young a one, is worthy, not onely of blame, but of reprehension, and I may say of pitie. Consider, consider with thy selfe, what a preposterous attempt and enterprise is this of thine, that when thou shouldest finish thy dayes in devotion and prayer, thou then delightest to begin them in concupiscence and lust. O <hi>La Vasselay,</hi> mocke at those rebellious and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous pleasures of the flesh, which seeme to mocke at thee, yea, to betray thee: and if there be yet any sparke of thy youth, which lies burning under the embers of thy age, why if thy chaste thoughts cannot, yet let modesty, or at least piety extinguish them. <hi>God</hi> hath already given thee two husbands, is it not now therfore time, yea, more than time, for thee to prepare to give thy selfe to <hi>God?</hi> Hitherto the chastity of thy youth hath made thee happy, and wilt thou now permit that the lust of thine age make thee unfortunate, or peradventure miserable? and that the purity and candeur of that be distained and polluted by the foulnesse and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenity of this? <hi>Alas, alas,</hi> incontinent &amp; inconsiderate <hi>Gentlewoman,</hi> of a grave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, become not a youthfull Gigglet; or if thou wilt not suffer the eyes of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, at least permit those of thy soule to look from thy painted cheeks, to thy snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>white haire, who can informe and tell thee, that thou art far fitter for Heaven than earth, sith those pleasures are transitory, and these eternall, for <hi>God</hi> than a husband, sith he onely can make thee blessed, whereas (in reward of thy lascivious lust) this peradventure may be reserved to make thee both unfortunate and wretched.</p>
                     <p>But the vanity of this old <hi>Gentlewomans</hi> thoughts and desires, doe so violently fix and terminate, on the youth &amp; beauty of young, and (as she immodestly tearms him) faire <hi>De Merson,</hi> as the only consideration of her delight and pleasure, weighes downe all other respects; so that neither reason nor modesty, advice nor perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, can prevaile with her resolution, to divert her affection from him; but love him she doth, and (which is repugnant, as well to the instinct of Nature, as to the influence of modesty, and rules of civility) seeke him for her husband shee will: yea, she is already become so sottish in her affection, and so lasciviously fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in her desires towards him, that her heart thinks of him by day, her soule by night; that admires him as the very life of her felicity, and thus adores him as the onely content and glory of her life: shee will not see the greatnesse of her owne estate and wealth, nor consider the smallnesse of his meanes and hopes, in that he is not an heire, but a second brother; she will not enquire after his debts and vices, to know what those may be, what these are; she will not thinke what a preposterous disparity there is betwixt the fire of his youth, and the ice of her age; nor what a world of discontents and afflictions are incident to proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: shee will not consider, that in endowing him with all her wealth, that shee thereby impoverisheth many, as well of her owne kindred, as of those of her two former husbands, to whom in the right of <hi>Nature</hi> it more justly and properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; and to conclude and shut up this point, she will not imagine or dreame, to how many laughters and scandals of the world she exposeth her selfe, who will not onely call her discretion, but her modesty in question, for matching with so young a <hi>Gentleman</hi> as <hi>De Merson,</hi> to whom for age, she may not only well be mother, but (which is more) grandmother: But contrariwise, this foolish old <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> having sent her wits a wooll-gathering on his sweet and comely personage; his youth and her affection, like two impetuous torrents, and furious inundations, beare downe all other respects and considerations before them: yea, they so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge her reason, and quite drown her discretion, as she hath no eies unshut to see
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16653:139"/>
the one, nor eares unstopped to heare the other, so that if she desire any thing in the world, it is (as formerly is observed) that shee live to see <hi>De Merson</hi> her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and her selfe his wife: which to effect and accomplish, she knowes no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor fitter <hi>Agent</hi> to employ herein, than one <hi>Mounseir de Pruneau,</hi> an ancient <hi>Councellor,</hi> of the <hi>Presidiall Court</hi> of that City, who was the onely <hi>Councellor</hi> both to her last husband and her selfe, and of whose discretion, integrity and fidelity, she had all the reasons of the world to rest confident and assured.</p>
                     <p>Now although the <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> of <hi>De Pruneau</hi> suggested him what an extreame inequality there was betwixt <hi>De Mersons</hi> youth, and <hi>La Vasselayes</hi> age, which he could not more pertinently parallel and compare, than to Winter and Summer, the Spring and the Harvest: and therefore how many afflictions and miseries were subject to attend and wait on such preposterous marriages, whereof he had formerly seene divers lamentable examples, and wofull instances, as well of men as women, who had suffered shipwracke upon that <hi>Sylla,</hi> and this <hi>Charibdis,</hi> he like an honest man, and indeed a truer friend to her than she was to her selfe, produceth some of the former alleaged reasons to her consideration, thereby to divert the streame of her ill grounded affection from <hi>De Merson,</hi> and (in generall tearmes) to convey and conduct it to some elder personage, whose yeares (and therefore their dispositions and affections) might the better agree and sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize. But when he sees that her love to <hi>De Merson</hi> was so firmly and immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly setled, as that it not only appeared to him to be her griefe, but her torment to be any way crossed or contradicted therin: then he changeth his language, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she will not hearken to his advice, he therefore gives way to her resolution, promising her his utmost power, and best endevours speedily to effect &amp; compasse her desires, when taking leave each of other, at last <hi>La Vasselay</hi> remembring she had forgotten something, cals him againe, and prayes him that if <hi>De Merson</hi> be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive to know her direct age, that he substract away at least ten yeares thereof: so that whereas she is sixty three, to affirme that she is very little above fifty: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto she her selfe blushing, <hi>De Pruneau</hi> not able likewise to refraine from smiling, promiseth her to be very mindfull thereof. To which end, he (with the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie) finds out <hi>De Merson,</hi> acquaints him how much he is obliged to <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyselle La Vasselay,</hi> for her affection to him, layes before him the Nobility of her descent and bloud, the greatnesse of her <hi>Estate</hi> and meanes, as also the excellency of her vertues; that fifty yeares is the most of her age, and that she is not by farre so old, as pleasing and lovely; that she affects him above all the men in the world, yea, and desires no man of the world for her husband but himselfe; and that when he pleaseth, she desires the honour of his company to her house, with many other intimations and insinuations conducing that way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>De Merson</hi> having formerly understood of <hi>La Vasselayes</hi> rich <hi>Estate</hi> and <hi>Dowrie,</hi> as also of the truth of her age, he likes the first well, and although he distaste, yet he will dissemble the second: he thanks <hi>De Pruneau</hi> for his paines, and <hi>La Vasselay</hi> for her love toward him; promiseth to requite the first, and if her wealth and vertues correspond with his relation to deserve the second; alleaging further, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be a great inequality in their age, yet sith he is no heire but a second brother, that it is rather likely than impossible for it to be a match betwixt them; and in the meane time to requite part of her affection, hee promiseth to Sup with her the night following at her house, where hee onely desires his company and assistance, that they may the more effectually and secretly consult of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, which he hopes will so much import, as well her good and his content, as her content and his good; and so for that time they part.</p>

                        <hi>De Pruneau</hi> having received this pleasing and discreet answer from <hi>De Merson,</hi> hee returnes with the relation, and repetition thereof to <hi>La Vasselay,</hi> vowes that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour feature is no way answerable, but comes farre short of his interiour Vertues and discretion; and that by all which, hee either can collect from his speeches, or gather from his deportment and behaviour, hee is in his conceit the most accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <hi>Gentleman,</hi> not only of <hi>Maine,</hi> but of <hi>France;</hi> and so bids her prepare her Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and her selfe to entertaine him the next night. Which answer of <hi>De Mersons,</hi> and relation of <hi>De Pruneau,</hi> is so pleasing to her heart and thoughts, as her age seemes to be already ravished with joy at the conceit of his Youth: when thinking every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute a moneth, and every houre a yeare, before shee bee made happy, and her house blessed with his presence, shee leaves no cost unspared, or unspent, to make his Entertainement answerable to his welcome: whereof whiles shee is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carefull, but curious in providing, let us cursorily speake a word or two how <hi>De Merson</hi> entertaines and digesteth this unexpected motion and affection of <hi>La Vasselay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He laughes in his sleeue to see her youthfull affections so flourishing in this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne,</hi> nay, in this <hi>Winter</hi> of her age, as to desire and seeke so young a <hi>Gentleman</hi> as himselfe for her husband, but hee understands she is exceeding rich, and therefore resolves that this vertue is capable to overvalue and ransome that defect and error of hers. He sees that his father will not pay his debts, and that hee of himselfe cannot; that they growing more clamorous, will shortly become scandalous: which will not onely directly prevent, but infallibly ruine his fortunes. He considereth how displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing her age will bee to his youth, as also that there is no hell comparable to that of a discontented bed, and then againe, his debosht and lustfull thoughts, suggest him this remedy: That <hi>Mans</hi> hath beauties enough for him to recreate himselfe, and to passe his time with; and that although she have him sometimes in her bed, yet hee may have younger lasses and Ladies in his armes, both when, and where he pleaseth: He considereth that rich widowes are not so soone found, as sought, not so soone ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as found; and that if he refuse <hi>La Vasselay</hi> this day, hee may not onely repent it to morrow, but perchance all the daies of his life; and although his will may, his power shall not bee able to repaire or redresse this error of his, all his life after: Hee is not ignorant that <hi>Gentlewomen</hi> of her age and wealth, are subject to be as soone lost as won in a humour: and therefore then lost, because not then won. Againe that the elder she is, the sooner she will die, and he then is at liberty to marry as young a <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> as hee pleaseth, and that her wealth would then prove a true proppe; and sweet comfort to his age. And to conclude and finish this consultation of his, she is without children to molest and trouble him, and therefore to be desired, shee is vertuous, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, and of an excellent fame and reputation, and therefore deserves to be accepted and not refused.</p>
                     <p>Vpon the grounds of which reasons and considerations, hee makes good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to <hi>De Pruneau,</hi> and comes the next night both to visite, and suppe with <hi>La Vasselay;</hi> who having purposely deckt her selfe up in her youthfull and gayest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell; receives him, withall demonstrations of affection and joy. At his first arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall he affords her two or three kisses, whereat she infinitely both rejoyceth and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth: and in a word, hee findes that his welcome not only exceeds his deserts, but his expectation; and beleeve me it was worth the observation, to see how super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially his youth looked on her age, and how artificially and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

enterview will produce effects answerable to both their contents and desires; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>De Merson</hi> cannot refraine from blushing, nor <hi>La Vasselay</hi> from smiling: They are all very pleasant and jocond at table, and she to give the better edge and relish to his affection, strives to seeme farre yonger then indeed she is, and then he knowes her to be; yea, she doth so cunningly entermixe and dispierce youthfull speeches amidst her aged gravity, as if she were not old, or at least, newly made yong. Now whiles she feasted her eyes on his fresh countenance and faire complexion, he sends his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread to looke on her plate, rich hangings, and houshold-stuffe, wherewith he saw her house was richly and plentifully furnished: Supper ended, and the cloath taken away, they are no sooner fallen from their Viands, but they fall to their talke. <hi>De Merson</hi> kindly and familiarly taking his new old <hi>Mistris</hi> in his <hi>Armes,</hi> as if hee had already given her a place in his heart and affections; which makes her beyond her self, both merry and joyfull. I will not trouble the Reader with the repetition of what speeches and complements here past betwixt them; because in this, and my future Histories I will follow the same Methode of brevity which I have proposed and observed in my former. Let then his inquisitive curiositie vnderstand, that they parted very lovingly and affectionately this first time: and <hi>De Merson</hi> although hee were a deboshed <hi>Gentleman,</hi> yet he is not so simple to omit, but rather so well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to prie into the true depth, and naked truth of her estate; and the rather, for that he hath knowne many <hi>Gentlemen</hi> who have beene fetch'd over, and gul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And others againe beleeving and presaging, that this their great inequality and disparity of yeares, would either of the one side or other, or both, produce many discontents, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, instead of hoped-for joyes and prosperities. Thus every one speakes diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of this preposterous match, according as their passions and fancies dictate them: but which of all these opinions and judgements speakes truest, we shall not goe farre to understand and know.</p>
                     <p>We have seene the consummation of this marriage, <hi>Youth</hi> wedded to <hi>Age; May</hi> to <hi>December,</hi> and yong <hi>De Merson</hi> to old <hi>La Vasselay;</hi> in which contract and nuptials, either of them are so vaine, and both so irreligious, as caring wholly for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of their bodies, they have not therein so much as once thought of their soules, or of heaven: Yea, <hi>God</hi> is not so much as once nominated or remembered
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:16653:140"/>
of them. All the ends of marriages are onely two; <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and the propagation of children; and because they cannot hope for the second, must they therefore needs be so impious, as to forget the first. <hi>Aye me,</hi> if his youth had attained no more Grace, could her age retaine no more goodnesse; or how can they flatter themselves with any hope, that this marriage of theirs can possible prosper, when only her ayme and end therein is lust, and his wealth. If a building can subsist and flourish, which hath a rotten and reeling foundation, then this match of theirs may prosper, otherwise cannot: for what more rotten than the beastly pleasures of her lustfull, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed age, and what more reeling and fickle, than the constant inconstancy of his lacivious youth, which make my thoughts justly feare, and my heart truly presage and apprehend: that repentance, not pleasure; affliction, not joy; misery, not pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, is at the heeles to attend and follow these their Nuptials: As marke we the sequell and it will briefly informe us how.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>De Merson</hi> hath not been married two whole moneths to <hi>La Vassellay,</hi> but he begins to repent himselfe that ever he matched her, for he now sees, though before he would not, that it is imposible for youth to fedge and sympathise with her age, he sees that she hath a discrepit, sickely and decayed body, and that she is never free of the Cough and Rheume, as also of an Issue in her left arme, which is not only displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, but loathsome to him. Yea, when she hath taken off her ruffe and head attier, and dighted her selfe in her night habilements, then he vowes he is afraid of her Lambe-skin furred cap and wast-coate; and takes her withered face for a <hi>Vizard,</hi> or a <hi>Commet,</hi> which yeelds no delight but terror to his eyes: swearing that he serves onely for a bed-pan to heat her frozen body, which of it selfe is farre colder than a <hi>Marble Statue:</hi> Yea, he is so farre out of love with her, because, to write the truth, he never truely loved her, that her sight is a plague to him, her presence by day a Purgatory, and her company by neight a very Hell.</p>
                     <p>But deboshed and dissolute <hi>Gentleman,</hi> these vitious and impious conceits of thine, come immediatly from <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Sathan,</hi> and are no way infused in thy thoughts by <hi>Heaven,</hi> much lesse inspired in thy heart by <hi>God:</hi> Consider, consider with thy selfe; that if <hi>La Vasselay</hi> be old, yet she is now thy wife, and that whatsoever <hi>De Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neau</hi> or her selfe informed thee of fiftie yeers, yet thou knowest she could not be lesse than sixtie three, and more she is not. In which regard marriage (the holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of <hi>Heaven)</hi> having now made you of two, one; if thou wilt not love her age, at least thou shouldest reverence it; or if thou canst not affect her, thou shouldest not hate her. Hath she imperfections, what woman in the world lives without them? or is shee Pestered with diseases, who can be either exempted from them, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them? Thou hast vowed in the Temple of the Lord, and in the presence of him and his people, not onely to love, but to honour her: and is thy inconstancy and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety already such, as forgetting that promise and vowe of thine, thou dost now not onely dishonour, but despise and contemne her; and that thou onely madest that vow purposely to breake it: O <hi>De Merson,</hi> if thou art not capable of Counsel, yet do but beleeve the truth, and thou wilt find, that if thou wilt not love her, because she is too old to be thy wife; yet thou shouldest respect and regard her, because she is old enough to be thy Grandmother: for as it is incivility not to reverence <hi>Age;</hi> so it is impietie to disdaine and maligne it: and if in any man towards a meere stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, how much more a husband to his owne wife? And because it is easier to espy our wives imperfections, than to finde out, or reforme our owne; if thy wife <hi>La Vasselay</hi> bee guiltie of any fault towards thee, it is because shee loves thee too well, and affects thee too dearely.</p>
                     <p>We have scene <hi>De Mersons</hi> distaste of his wife, <hi>La Vasselay:</hi> Let us now see how
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16653:141"/>
she likes, or rather why she so soone dislikes him: for he beares himselfe so strangely, and withall, so unkindly towards her, as her desires of his youth comes farre short both of her expectation and hopes: for if he lye with her one night, hee wanteth six from her; is still abroad, and seldome or never at home with her; yea, hee is of such a gadding humour, and ranging disposition, as his thoughts and delights are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported elsewhere, not at home; with other young Dames of <hi>Mans,</hi> not with herselfe: and the vanity of his pleasures doe so farre surprize and captivate him, that hee is already become so vitious, as he makes day his night, and night his day, living ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like a volutupous <hi>Epicure,</hi> than a temperate or <hi>Civill Christian:</hi> Neither, quoth she, is it Iealousie, but truth which makes her prie so narrowly into so lewd and laci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious actions, wherein the further she wades, the more cause she finds both of griefe and vexation, which makes her wish, that shee had beene blind when she first saw him; and either he or her selfe in <hi>Heaven,</hi> when they so unfortunately marryed each other here upon <hi>Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How now fond and foolish olde <hi>Gentlewoman,</hi> are thy joyes so soone converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sorrowes, and thy triumphs into teares? why, thou hast just cause to thanke none but thy selfe, for these thy crosses and afflictions; sith thy lustfull and lacivious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires were not onely the author, but the procurer of them: for hadst thou beene more modest, and lesse wanton, thou mightest have apparantly seene, and provident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fore-seene, that <hi>De Mersons</hi> youth was too young for thy age, because thy age was too old for his youth; so that hadst thou beene then but halfe so stayed and wise, as now thou art sorrowfull: thou needest not now grieve for that which thou canst not redresse, nor repent for that which is out of thy power to remedy. But rash and inconsiderate woman, how comes this to passe, that thou art ready to entertaine je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, when death stands ready to entertaine thee? Could all the course of thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer youth be so happy, not to be acquainted with this vice, and doth now thy fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen age thinke it a vertue to admit and imbrace it? Ay me, I grieve to see thy folly, and lament to understand thy madnesse in this kinde: for what is Ielousie, but the rage of our thoughts, and braines, the disturber of our peace and tranquility, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of our peace and happinesse, the traitour of our judgement and undestanding, the plague of our life, the poyson of our hearts, and the very bane and Canker of our soules? Ielousie, why, it is the daughter of frenzie, and the mother of madnesse; it is a vice purposely sent from hell, to make those wretched on earth, who may live fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and happy, and yet will not; yea, it is a vice which I know not whether it bee more easie to admit, or difficult to expell, being admitted. But <hi>La Vasselay,</hi> expell it thou must, at least, if thou thinke to live fortunate, and not to die miserable. Wert thou as young as aged, thy Ielousie might have some colour and excuse in meeting with the censures of the world; whereas now not deserving the one, it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the other. And as those women are both wise and happy, who winke at the youthfull escapes of their husbands: so thy Ielousie makes thee both meritorious, and guilty of thy afflictions, because thou wilt be so foolish to espy, and so malicious to remember these of thine. Is <hi>De Merson</hi> given and addicted to other women? why pardon him, because hee is a young man: and as hee is thy husband, and thou his wife, beleeve that hee is every way more worthy of thy praiers, than of thine envie.</p>
                     <p>Thus wee see upon what fatall and ominus tearmes these late married couple now stand; <hi>De Mersons</hi> youth scorning and spurning at his wife <hi>La Vasselaye's</hi> age, and wholly addicting himselfe to others; and her age growing infinitly jealous of his youth: so that for any thing I see or know to the contrary, these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vices have already taken such deepe and dangerous roote in them, as they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16653:141"/>
threaten not onely the shipwracke of their content, but of their fortunes, if not of their lives.</p>
                     <p>Now for us to find out the particular object of <hi>La Vasselayes</hi> jealousie, as her foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish curiosity hath already the generall cause: we must know, that she hath a very proper young <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> who atends her, of some eighteene yeares of age, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Gratiana,</hi> of a middle stature, somewhat inclining to fatnesse, having a fresh sanguine complexion, and bright flaxen haire, she being indeed every way excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding lovely and faire; and with this <hi>Gratiana,</hi> she feares her <hi>Husband</hi> is more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar than either modesty or chastity can permit; and yet she hath onely two poore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for this, her credulity and jealousie, and <hi>God</hi> knowes they are poore and weake ones indeed: The first is, that she thinkes her owne withered face serves onely but as a foyle, to make <hi>Gratiana's</hi> fresh beauty seeme the more precious and amiable in his eyes. The second is, that shee once saw him kisse her in her presence in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when she brought him a handkercher, which his Page had forgotten to give him. Ridiculous grounds, and triviall reasons, for her to build her feare, or erect her jealousie on, or to invent and raise so foule a scandall and calumny: and yet not to suppresse, but to report the whole truth, <hi>De Merson</hi> was laciviously in love with <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiana,</hi> had often tempted her deflouration, but could never obtaine her consent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: for shee was as chaste as faire, and impregnable, either to bee seduced by his gifts and presents, or to bee vanquished and wonne by his treacherous promises, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, and oathes: for she told him plainely and peremptorily, when she saw him begin to grow importunate, and impudent in this his folly, That although she were but a poore <hi>Gentlemans</hi> daughter, yet she thanked <hi>God,</hi> that her parents had so vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously train'd her up in the Schoole of <hi>Honour,</hi> that she would rather dye, than live to be a strumpet to any Gentleman or Prince of the world: which chaste answer, and generous resolution of hers, did then so quench the flames of his lacivious and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affection to her, as thenceforth he exchanged his lust into love towards her, and vowed, that he would both respect and honour her as his sister. Now although they both kept the passage of this businesse secret from his wife her Mistris, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, as it is the nature of Iealousie, not to hearken to any reason, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of any beliefe but of her owne: therefore shee is confident, that he lyes with <hi>Gratiana</hi> more oftner than with her selfe; which shee vowes shee cannot digest, and will no longer tolerate. To which end, (with a most malicious, and strange kind of treachery) shee makes faire weather with <hi>Gratiana;</hi> and (thinking to coole her hot courage, and to allay the heat of her luxurious blood) looking one day stedfastly in her face, she tels her that she hath need to be let blood, to prevent a Fever: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, although chaste and innocent <hi>Gratiana</hi> was never formerly let blood, she not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding willingly consents thereunto; which to effect, <hi>La Vasselay</hi> (like a base mistris and a treacherous stepdame) sends for an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> named <hi>Rennee,</hi> gives him a watch-word in his eare, to draw at least sixteene ounces of blood from <hi>Gratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> for that she was strongly entred into a burning Fever: But he being as honest as shee was treacherous and cruell, told her, that the drawing of so great a quantity of blood from her, might not only impaire her health, but indanger her life. But she replies, it was so ordered by a <hi>Doctor:</hi> whereupon he opens her right arme veyne; and as he had neere drawen so much from this poore harmelesse young <hi>Gentlewoman,</hi> shee faints twice in a chaire betwixt their armes, and all the cold water they threw in her face, could very hardly refetch her, and keepe life in her: this old hard-harted hag still notwithstanding crying out, that it was not blood enough: having no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for this her treachery and cruelty, but that indeed she thought it not enough, or sufficient to quench the unquenchable thirst and flame of her jealousie: of which
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16653:142"/>
this is the first effect towards this innocent young Gentlewoman, but wee shall not goe farre to see a second.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gratiana</hi> is so farre from dreaming of her mistris jealousie towards her master, and herselfe; or from once thinking of this her treacherous letting her blood, as shee thankes her, for her affection and care of her health: and now the very next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>De Merson</hi> dyning at home with his old wife, (which he had not done in many dayes before) and seeing <hi>Gratiana</hi> looke so white and pale, demaunds her if she bee not well, and then questioneth his wife what ayles her Gentlewoman to looke so ill, which she seemes to put off with a feigned excuse: but withall (as if this care of her husband towards <hi>Gratiana,</hi> were a true confirmation of their dishonesty, and her jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie) she retaynes the memory thereof deepely in her heart and thoughts: yea, it is so frequent, and fixed in her Imaginations, as she cannot, she will not any longer suffer or indure this affection of her husband to <hi>Gratiana;</hi> nor that <hi>Gratiana's</hi> youth shall wrong <hi>La Vasselay's</hi> age in the rites and duties of marriage. Wherefore casting sad aspects on him, and malignant lookes on her, she to please and give satisfaction to her jealousie (which cannot bee pleased or satisfied with any thing but revenge) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to make her know what it is, for a waiting maid to offend and wrong her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris in this kinde: when not to deminish, but rather to augment and redouble her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cruelty towards her. Her husband riding one day abroad in company of divers other <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the City, to hunt Wolves which abound in those vast and spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous woods of <hi>Maine:</hi> shee under pretence of some other businesse; calls <hi>Gratiana</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone into her inner chamber, when bolting the doore after her, she with meager and pale envy in her lookes, and implacable fury and choller in her speeches, chargeth her of dishonesty with her husband; calling her whore, strumpet, and baggage: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that the time and houre is now come for her to be revenged of her. Poore <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiana</hi> both amazed and affrighted at this sudden and furious (both unexpected and undefiled alarum of her <hi>Mistris,</hi> seing her honour, and (as she thinkes and feares) her life called in question; she after a world of sighes and teares, tearmes her accusers devils and witches, vowes by her part in heaven, and upon the perill of her owne soule, that she is innocent of that crime whereof she accused her, and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed or thought, she was ever dishonest, or unchast with any man of the world, much lesse with her Master: But this will not satisfie incensed <hi>La Vasselay,</hi> neither are these speeches or teares of <hi>Gratiana</hi> of power to passe current with her jealousie; but reputing them false and counterfeit, shee cals in her chamber-maid, and cooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, when shee had purposely led there, and bids them unstrip <hi>Gratiana</hi> naked to her wast, and to bind her hand and foot to the bed post, which with much repyning and pitty, they are at last inforced to do. When commanding them forth the chamber and bolting the doore after them, she not like a woman, but rather as a fury of hell, flies to poore innocent <hi>Gratiana,</hi> and with a great burchen rod, doth not onely raze but scarifie her armes, backe and shoulders: when harmelesse soule, she (though in vaine) having no other defensive weapons but her tongue, and her innocency, cries aloud to heaven and earth for succour. But this old hag as full of malice as jealousie, hath no compassion of her cries, nor pitty of her sighes: yea, neither the sight of her teares, or blood, (which trickling downe her cheekes and shoulders, doth both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew, and ingraine her smocke) are of power to appease her fury and envy, untill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spent three rods, and tyred and wearied both her armes, shee in the heat of her choller, and the height of her revenge; delivers her these bitter and scoffing words. <hi>Minion, this, this is the way, yea the onely way to coole the heate of thy courage, and to quench the fire of thy lust;</hi> When calling in her two maids, she commands them to unbinde <hi>Gratiana,</hi> and to helpe on her clothes. When triumphing in her cruelty,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16653:142"/>
she furiously departs and leaves them; who cannot refraine from teares, to see how severely and cruelly their <hi>Mistris</hi> hath handled this her poore <hi>Gentlewoman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gratiana</hi> the better to remedy these her insupportable and cruell wrongs, holds it discretion to desemble them, and so providing herselfe secretly of a horse and man, she the next night steales away; rides to <hi>La Ferte,</hi> and from thence to her father at <hi>Nogent le Retrou,</hi> where he was superintendant of the <hi>Prince of Condes</hi> house and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in that Towne; and where the <hi>Princesse Dowager</hi> his mother built vp the greatest part of her sorrowfull residence, whence, whiles he was detained prisoner in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Boys de Vincennes</hi> neere <hi>Paris: La Vasselay</hi> grieves at this her sudden, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted departure, the which she feares her husband <hi>De Merson,</hi> and her father <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur De Bremay</hi> will take in ill part; wherein shee is no way deceived, for the one grieves, and the other stormes thereat: yea, when <hi>De Merson</hi> (through flattery and threats) had drawne from the Chamber-maid and Cooke-maid, the truth of his wives cruell whipping of <hi>Gratiana,</hi> as also the cause thereof, her jealousie: He justly incensed and inraged, flies to this his sottish and cruell wife, tells her, that jealousie comes from the devill, whose part he affirmes she hath acted, in acting this upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>Gratiana,</hi> then whom there lives not a chaster maid in the world, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she were poore, yet, that she was aswell descended as her selfe. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, if she did not speedily right and redeeme her wrongs, and seeke meanes to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie and recall her, that he would forth-with leave her, yea, and utterly forsake her. which cooling card of his to his wife, makes her looke on her former erronious cruelty towards <hi>Gratiana,</hi> rather with outward griefe, than inward repentance. But seeing that her jealousie must now stoope and strike saile, to her husbands <hi>Choller,</hi> and that to enjoy his company, she must not be exempted and deprived of hers: she contrary to her desires and will, (which still retaines the fumes and flames of jealousie as that doth of revenge) is inforced to make a vertue of necessity, and so to beare up with the time, feigning her selfe repentant and sorrowful for what she had formerly done to <hi>Gratiana:</hi> she to reclaime her, buyes her so much wrought black Taffety for a Gowne, and so much Crimson Damaske for a Petticoate, and with a bracelet of Pearle which she accustomed to weare upon her right arme; she sends it to <hi>Nogent</hi> to her by <hi>La Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette,</hi> a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of her husbands, and accompanieth it with a letter to her father, <hi>Mounsieur de Bremay,</hi> which contained these words.</p>

When forgetting herselfe, her soule, and her God, thereby purposely to please her senses, her Ielousie, and her Tutor the Devill, shee vowes, that no respect of reason nor Religion, no consideration of Heaven or Hell, shall bee capable to divert her from dispatching her: yea, and as if shee not onely rejoyced, but glorified in this her pernitious and bloody designe, shee thinkes

Againe, when he considereth <hi>Gratiana's</hi> beauty and chastity, and that she was sent to her untimely grave for his sake, this doth not only redouble his sorrowes, but infinitely augment and increase his afflictions: so that beginning to feare his wives envy, as much as he hated her jealousie, in that it was not onely possible, but likely, that it might also futurely extend, and reflect on him, as well as it already had on harmelesse and innocent <hi>Gratiana,</hi> he assumes a resolution to leave and forsake her, the which we shall shortly see him put in execution; when the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to curbe and vex her, hee secretly packes up all her Bills, Bonds, Leafes, and Conveyances, as also, all her Money, Plate, Iewels, and richest Housholdstuffe; and so giving out a prohibition to all the Tenants, not to dare to pay her any rent, he allowing her only a bare maintenance, very suddenly (when she least expected or dreamt thereof) takes horse, and rides home to his fathers, where he resolves, to make the greatest part of his residence; and all the reares and prayers of his wife, are not of power to reclaime or retaine him.</p>

                     <p>And such were the deplorable, yet deserved ends of this bloody, and wretched couple, <hi>La Vasselay</hi> and <hi>La Villette,</hi> for so cruelly murthering harmelesse <hi>Gratiana,</hi> and innocent <hi>De Merson:</hi> And thus did <hi>Gods</hi> all-seeing, and sacred Justice, justly triumph ore these their crying and execrable crimes.

It is as great a blessing in children to have loving Parents, as for them to have obedient children; and had their obedience answered his affection, and their duty his providence: wee had not seene the Theatre of this their History so be sprinckled, and gored with such great effusion of blood.</p>
                     <p>This Captaine <hi>Benevente</hi> their father, (for his blood, wealth, and generosity) was beloved and honoured of all the Nobility of <hi>Apulia,</hi> and for his many services, both by sea and land, was held in so great esteeme in <hi>Otranto,</hi> that his house was an <hi>Academie,</hi> where all the Gallants both of City and Country resorted to backe great Horses, to run at the Ring, and to practise other such Courtly and Martiall Exercises, whereunto this old <hi>Captaine,</hi> as well in his age, as youth, was exceedingly addicted: so as the beauty of his two daughters, <hi>Fidelia,</hi> and <hi>Caelestina</hi> could not be long, either unseene, or unadmired,: for they grew so perfectly faire, of so sweet complexions, and proper statures, that they were justly reputed and held to be the <hi>Paragons</hi> of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> not only of <hi>Apulia,</hi> but of <hi>Italy:</hi> so as beauty being the Gold and Diamonds of <hi>Nature;</hi> this of theirs (so sweet in its influence, and so excellent and delicious in that sweetnesse) drew all mens eyes to love them, many mens hearts to adore them: so had they beene as rich in Vertue, as in Beauty, they had lived more fortunate, and neither their friends nor enemies should have lived to have seene them die so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably; for now that proves their ruine, which might have beene their glory. They are both of them sought in marriage, by many <hi>Barons</hi> and <hi>Caviliers,</hi> as well at home as abroad, but the <hi>Captaine</hi> their father will not give care, nor hearken to any, nor once permit that such motion be moved him: They are so immodest, as they grieve hereat, and are so extreamly sorrowfull, to see that a few yeares past away, makes their Beauties rather fade than flourish: where <hi>Vertue</hi> graceth not <hi>Beauty,</hi> as well as <hi>Beauty, Vertue,</hi> it is often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But as their thoughts were too impatient and immodest, to give way to such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent and irrigular conceits; so on the other side, the <hi>Captaine</hi> their father, was too severe, and withall too unkind, I may say, cruell, to hinder them from <hi>Marriage,</hi> sith their beauty and age had long since made them both meritorious and capable of it: It was in them immodesty; in him, unkindenesse, to propose such ends, to their desires and resolutions: for as hee hath authority to exact obedience from them, so have they likewise reason to expect fatherly affection, and care from him. But hee is more affected and addicted to his wealth and covetousnesse, then inclined to regard his daughters content; and therefore is fully resolved, not as yet to marry them, which is a resolution better left then imbraced, and infringed then kept of him; sith it may bring foorth effects contrary both to his hopes and desires. It is commonly dangerous for <hi>Parents,</hi> to content themselves with their childrens discontents: for where <hi>Nature</hi> is crossed, it many times degenerates, and prooves unnaturall, as the <hi>Cataracts</hi> of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Ladies valew their beauty at too high a rate, to bestow it on such deformed husbands; and although <hi>Venus</hi> accepteth of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> yet they will have none of these; because they deeme no hell to that of a discontented bed: heretofore they wished for Sutors, and now they wish they were well ridde of these; and so sacrificing to their owne contents, they set up this resolution in their hearts and soules, that they will rather dye maidens, then live to see themselves wives to such husbands. Their father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives <hi>Carpi</hi> and <hi>Monte-leone</hi> curteously, and entertaines them nobly, according to their ranke and merits: he tells his daughters plainely, that they shall marry these, and none others. Thus the Barke of these their resolutions, are surprisd and beaten with two cantrary winds: he will bee obeyed of his daughters, and they will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of their father in all things, but not in this of their Marriage.</p>
                     <p>It is never good for parents, to force the affections of their children in their marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, sith it is a businesse which not only lives, but dies with them; but withall, their owne wills must neither be their law, nor their guide: for their Parents have, (or at least should have) more experience and judgement then they, to see who are, and who are not fit matches for them: But where authority opposeth affection, or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, reason, there such marriages are still ushered on with discontent, and wayted and attended on with misery. Likewise, there is a great respect and consideration to be observed by Parents, in the inclinations and natures of their children: for some will be perswaded, or reproved with a word, whereas others will become more head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong and rebellious with menaces and threats. Had this Captaine attempted and practised the first, and not the second towards these two Ladies his daughters, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure they had never leapt from reason to rage, from obedience to contempt, nor from hope to despaire; yea, I dare presume to averre with truth and safety, that wee should have seene them all as happy, as I now feare wee shall see them miserable.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed with their History, they are pressed by the Captaine their father, and importuned by the two noble men their Sutors, to finish and confirme these contracts. But <hi>Fidelia</hi> and <hi>Caelestina</hi> with a true semblance of distaste, and yet a false shew of curtesie, give the deniall to their father in particular tearmes, and to them in generall: He stormes at their disobedience, and they impute this excuse of theirs, to modesty, rather than unkindnesse: They flatter themselves with this hope, that sith they are faire, they must be courteous, and cannot be cruell: or if the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the Captaine their father will so manage his daughters affections, as all things shall sort to their desires and expectations; but they shall come too short of their hopes: for they are neither reserved for the Ladies, nor the Ladies for them: but whiles thus they are busie in advancing the processe of their affections, <hi>Fidelia</hi> and <hi>Caelestina</hi> attempt a contrary enterprise: for they with teares and prayers, request their brother <hi>Alcasero,</hi> importunately to solicite their Father in their behalfe: that he will not enforce them to marry those whom they cannot affect, much lesse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey: which like a noble and deare brother hee performes with much zeale and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion: but he cannot prevaile with him, nor bring them any other answer, then that they must and shall marry them, and onely them.</p>
                     <p>Had this resolution of their father beene more courteous and lesse rigorous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his daughters, this History of theirs had not deserved so much pitty, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, nor would have drawen so many sighes from the hearers, or teares from the Readers: for now seeing their father cruelly resolved to offer violence to their affections, they begin to hate him, because he will not better love them. And here (O here) they enter into devillish machinations, and hellish conspiracies against him: for as hee plots their discontents, so doe they his destruction. <hi>Fidelia</hi> and <hi>Caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stina</hi>

see their blood, and cause one, and therefore so they pretend shall be their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: they would reveale their intents and designes each to other; but the fact is so foule and unnaturall, as for a whiles they cannot but they need no other O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory then their owne sullen and discontented lookes, for either of them may read a whole Lecture of griefe and choller in each others eyes, till at length tyred with the importunity of their father, and the impatiency of <hi>Carpi,</hi> and <hi>Monteleone: Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> as the more audacious of the two, first breakes it to her sister <hi>Caelestina,</hi> in this manner. That shee had rather die, then bee compelled to marry one whom shee cannot affect: that the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Carpi</hi> is not for her, nor shee for him; and that sith her father is resolute in this match, (although shee bee his daughter) shee had rather see him laid in his grave, then her selfe in <hi>Carpies</hi> bedde. There needs not many reasons, to perswade that which we desire, For <hi>Caelestina</hi> tells her sister plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that shee (in all points) joynes and concurres in opinion with her, adding withall, that the sooner their father is dispatched, the better; because shee knowes they shall never receive any content on <hi>Earth,</hi> till he be in <hi>Heaven:</hi> and so they conclude he shall dye.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>alas,</hi> what hellish and devillish daughters are these, to seeke the death of their father, of whom they have received their lives? who ever read of a <hi>Parracide</hi> more inhumanely cruell, or impiously bloody? so if ever murther went unrevenged, this will not; for wee shall see the Authors and Actors thereof most severely puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for the same. Men and women may be secret in their sinnes, but <hi>God</hi> will be just in his decrees, and sacred in his judgements: what a religious resolution had it beene in them, to have retyred, and not advanced in this their damnable attempt; but they are too prophane, to have so much pitty, and too outragious to hearken to this religious reason: yea, they are too impious to hearken to <hi>Grace,</hi> and too revengefull and Bloody minded, to give eare either to <hi>Reason, Dutie,</hi> or <hi>Religion.</hi> So now like two incensed and implacable furies, they consult how and in what manner they may free themselves of their father: <hi>Fidelia</hi> proposeth divers degrees and severall sorts of murthers; but <hi>Caelestina</hi> likes none of them; in some she finds too much danger, in others too little assurance; and therefore as young as she is, she invents, a plot as strange as subtil, and as malicious &amp; diabolicall as strange: she informes her, that to be rid of her father, there cannot be a securer course then to engage the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> and the Knight of <hi>Monteleone</hi> to murther him: <hi>Fidelia</hi> wonders hereat, saying, it will be impossible for them to be drawn to performe it, sith they both know and see, that the <hi>Captaine</hi> their father loves them so well, as will or nill, they must be their husbands. But <hi>Caelestina's</hi> revengefull plot is further fetcht, and more cunningly spunne: for she hath not begun it, to leave it raw and unfinished; but is so confident in her devillish industry, as shee affirmes she will perfect and make it good. <hi>Fidelia</hi> demands how. <hi>Caelestina</hi> answereth, That they both must make a feigned and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring shew, to change their distaste, and now to affect <hi>Carpi,</hi> and <hi>Monteleone,</hi> whom before they could not: that having in this manner drawne them to their lure, when they attempt to urge marriage, they shall both agree to enforme them, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for them to obtaine it, whiles the Captaine their father lives, sith albeit in outward appearance hee make a faire shew to make them their husbands; yet that he meanes and intends nothing lesse; for that he hath given them expresse charge and command (at any hand) not to love or affect them; which is the maine and sole cause, that hath so long withheld them from making sooner demonstrations of their affections towards them: and this (quoth shee) will occasion and provoke them to attempt it; adding, that by this meanes, they may give two strokes with one stone, and so not onely be rid of our father, but likewise of <hi>Carpi</hi> and <hi>Montele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,</hi>
                        <pb n="262" facs="tcp:16653:150"/>
who peradventure may bee apprehended, and executed for the fact; and for our safegard and security, wee will powerfully conjure and sweare them to secresie.</p>
                     <p>There is no web finer then that of the Spider, nor treachery subtiller than that of a woman, especially if she contemne Charity for Revenge, her Soule for her Body, <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Sathan,</hi> and consequently <hi>Heaven</hi> for <hi>Hell:</hi> how else could this young Lady lodge so revengefull a heart in so sweet a Body, or shroud such bloody conceits and inventions under so faire and so beautifull complexion.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Panther,</hi> though his skinne bee faire, yet his breath is infectious: and we many times see, that the foulest Snake lurkes under the greenest and beautifullest leaves. <hi>Fidelia</hi> gives an attentive eare to this her sisters bloody <hi>Stratagem</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe: shee findes it sure, and the probabilities thereof apparant and easie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore approves of it. So these two beautifull, yet bloody sisters vow, without delay, to set it on foot, and in practise. It is the Nature of <hi>Revenge,</hi> to looke forwards, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome backewards: but did wee measure the beginning by the end, as well as the end by the beginning, our affections would savour of farre more Religion, and of farre lesse impiety, and we should then rejoyce in that which we must now repent, but cannot remedy. They take time at advantage, and pertinently acquaint <hi>Carpi,</hi> and <hi>Monteleone</hi> with it. The passions of affection proove often more powerfull then those of Reason, they suffer themselves to be vanquished and led away by the pure beauty and sweet <hi>Oratory</hi> of these two discontented and treacherous Ladies, without considering what poyson lurkes under their speeches, and danger under their tongues: They commit a grosse and maine error, in relying more on the daughters youth, then the fathers gravity; on their verball, then his reall affection; and so they ingage themselves to the daughters, in a veryshort time to free them of the <hi>Captaine</hi> their father. It was a base vice in Gentlemen of their ranke, to violate the Lawes of Hospitality, in so high a degree, as to kill him, who loved them so dearely, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them so curteously; and it is strange, that both their humours were so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vitious, as to concurre and sympathize in the attempt of this execrable murther: But what cannot vice performe, or Ladies procure of their Lovers, at least if they love Beauty better then Vertue, and Pleasure, then Piety.</p>
                     <p>Captaine <hi>Benevente</hi> is many times accustomed after dinner to ride to his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and now and then to <hi>Alpiata,</hi> a neighbour village, where hee is familiarly (if not too familiarly) acquainted with a Tennants wife of his, whom he loved in her youth, and cannot forsake in her middle age: perseverance in vice never makes a good end: a single sinne is distastefull; but the redoubling thereof, is both hatefull and odious to God. <hi>Carpi</hi> and <hi>Monteleone</hi> take their two Lacquaies, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo</hi> with rhem, assoone as they know the <hi>Captaine</hi> to be abroad, onely accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his confident Gentleman <hi>Fiamento;</hi> and disguising themselves, they watch him at the corner of the wood; where of necessity he must passe. The event answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their bloody expectations and desires: they see <hi>Benevente</hi> and <hi>Fiamento</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, riding a soft trot; when like so many Fiends and Devils, they all foure rush forth the thickets, and (without any other forme) with their Swords and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols, (after some resistance) kill them dead to the ground: but this is not the end of their hellish malice and envie; neither is the unsatiable thirst of their revenge yet quenched: for they take these two murthered bodies (who are a fresh reeking and weltring in their blood) and carry them to a neighbour hill, and so throw them down into a deep quarry full of thicke bushes &amp; brambles, wheras they thought no mortall eye should ever have seene them more, and then and there they consult upon their

It is impossible for a guilty conscience to be secured from feare: he rides narrow lanes, and by-wayes, but at last neare the Village <hi>Blanquettelle</hi> he meets with a swift Ford, which is passable for horse, but not for foot: Here <hi>Monte-leone</hi> is constrained to take up his Laquay <hi>Anselmo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, which he doth; but being in the midst thereof, the horse stumbles, and fals with both of them under him; which is done so suddenly, that <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Gods</hi> judgements are secret and inscrutable: had they had time to repent, they had onely lost their lives, whereas now it is rather to bee feared; than wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, they likewise runne the hazard of their soules. But as it is a vertue to thinke and censure charitably of the dead, so it must needs bee a vice to doe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Heretofore they thirsted for bloud, and (loe) now they have their fill of water.

                     <p>The Laquay comes to <hi>Otranto,</hi> and findes out <hi>Fidelia,</hi> to whom (with much care and secrecie) hee delivers his Masters Letter, and commends, and requesteth an answer. <hi>Fidelia</hi> receives the one, and promiseth the other: but shee is perplexed and troubled in minde. Here her thoughts make a stand, and consult whether shee shall open this Letter or no. Her Conscience hath heretofore yeelded to the death of her Father; and now Religion beginnes to worke upon the life of her Conscience, which indeed is that of her Soule. Had shee persevered in this course of pietie, her repentance might have pleaded for her disobedience, and her contrition redeemed her crime; but shee forsakes the Helme that might have steered her to the Port of happinesse and safety; and so fills the sayles of her resolutions with the wind of despaire, which threaten no lesse than to split the Barke of her life on the rockes of her destruction and death. Shee now beginnes to hate company which before shee loved, and to love solitarinesse, which before shee hated; yea, the living picture of her dead Father doth so haunt her thoughts, and frequent her imaginations, that wheresoever shee is, it is present with her. Remorse, as a <hi>Vulture</hi> gnawes at her heart and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yea, though nothing doe feare her, yet shee feares all things. Shee sees no man running behinde her, but she thinks he purposely followes her to dragge her to prison: shee is afraid of her owne shadow, and thinks, that not onely every tower, but every house will fall upon her: she will not come into any Boat, nor passe any River, Brooke, or Well, for feare of drowning. This despaire of hers causeth her to be cold in her Religion, and frozen in her Prayers, which should be both the preservative and <hi>Antidote</hi> of the soule: her speeches for the most part are confused and distracted, and her looks; sullen, fearefull, and ghastly (the proper signes &amp; symptomes of despaire.) <hi>Carpi's</hi> Laquay having stayed two daies in <hi>Otran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> for his answer, holds it his duty to importune <hi>Fidelia</hi> to be dispatched, the which that night she promiseth him; and now in a sad &amp; melancholly humour she breaks

                     <p>What a fearefull Letter is this, either for <hi>Fidelia</hi> to send, or <hi>Carpi</hi> to receive: but her distempered and distracted spirits can afford no other; and therefore shee dispatcheth away the Laquay with this. And now (as if her thoughts transported her to hell) shee cannot bee alone, for the Deuill is still with her: hee appeares to her in the shape of an <hi>Angell</hi> of Light, and profers her mountaines of <hi>Wealth,</hi> and Worlds of <hi>Honour,</hi> if shee will fall downe and adore him. To rebell against God is a sinne; but to perseuere in our rebellion, is not onely a contempt, but a treason in the highest degree against God. The best of Gods people are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly tempted; but those are, and prove the worst, who are overcome with temptation. <hi>Fortitude</hi> is a principall and <hi>soueraigne vertue</hi> in <hi>Christians;</hi> and if wee vanquish the Deuill, it is good for vs that he assaulted us, sith those Victories (as well spirituall as temporall) are ever most glorious and honourable, which are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved with greatest danger. Had <hi>Fidelia</hi> followed the current of this counsell, and the streame of this advise, shee had never beene so weake with <hi>God,</hi> nor so unfaithfull to her selfe, as to destroy her selfe: but forsaking <hi>God,</hi> and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prayer, which is the true way to the truest felicity, what can shee hope for but despaire, or expect but destruction? Her brother <hi>Alcasero,</hi> and many of her kinsfolks, neighbours, and friends (with their best zeale, and possible power) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to perswade and comfort her; they exhort her to read religious bookes, and continually to pray: Shee hearkneth to both these counsels, but neither can, or will not follow either: Her sleepes are but broken slumbers, and her slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers but distracted dreames; and ever and anon it seemes (to the eyes of her minde and body) that the <hi>Captaine</hi> her father doth both speake to her and follow her. In a word, she is weary both of this world, and of her life; yea, despaire, or rather the Devill hath reduced her to this extreme misery, and miserable extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that she is ready to kisse that hand that would kill her, or that <hi>Death</hi> which would giue her death: Shee never sees a knife in the hands of another, but shee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth it in her owne heart: her Conscience doth so terribly accuse her, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>This poore, or rather this miserable <hi>Gentlewoman,</hi> having alwayes her murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red father before her eyes, (which incessantly haunts her as a ghost, and yet shee enforced to follow it as her shaddow) is powerfully allured and provoked by the instigation of the Devill, in what manner, or at what rate soever, to dispatch her selfe, being so wretchedly instructed in faith and piety, and shee addes and beleeves, that the end of her life will prove not onely the end of her afflictions, but the beginning of her joyes. But O poore <hi>Fidelia,</hi> with a thousand pities and teares, I both pitie and grieve to see thee beleeve so infernall an Advocate: for what joyes either will he, or can he give thee? Why, nothing but bondage for liberty, torments for pleasures, and tortures for delights: or if thou wilt have me shew thee whereat his flattering oratory, or sugred insinuation tendeth, it is onely to have thee destroy thy body in earth, that (as a triumph and <hi>Trophee</hi> to the enlargement of his obscure kingdome) he may dragge thy body and soule to hell fire. But <hi>Fidelia</hi> is as constant in her sinne, as impious in her resolution; and so (all delayes set apart) shee seekes the meanes to destroy her selfe: shee procures poyson, and takes it, but the effect and operation thereof answers not her desires. I know not whether shee be more impatient to live, than willing to die. We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want invention, seldome meanes to doe evill: a little pen-knife of hers, shall in her conceit performe that which poyson could not: shee seeks it, and now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members it is with her paire of knives in the pocket of her best gowne: she flies to her Ward-robe, and so to her pocket, but finds not her knives, onely she finds her <hi>Naples</hi> silke girdle in stead thereof. The Devils instruments are never farre to seeke; she thinks it as good to strangle her throat, as to cut it: And here comes her mournfull and deplorable <hi>Tragedy,</hi> she returnes swiftly to her chamber, bolts the doore, and so (which I grieve and tremble to relate) fastens it to the reaster of her bed, and there hangs her selfe; and as it is faithfully reported, at that very instant, and for the space of an houre, it thundred and lightned so cruelly, as if <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> were drawing to an end, that not onely the chamber where she hung, but the whole house shaked thereat. The thunder being past, and the skies cleared, dinner is served on the Table, and <hi>Alcasero</hi> and <hi>Caelestina</hi> ready to sit, they call for their sister <hi>Fidelia,</hi> but she is not to be found. One goes to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and returnes, that her key is without side, and the doore bolted within, and yet shee answers not. They both flie from the Table to her chamber, and call and knocke, but no answer. <hi>Alcasero</hi> commands his men to breake open the doore, which they doe, and there sees his sister <hi>Fidelia</hi> hanging to the bed-steed starke dead. They cry out as affrighted and amazed at this mournfull and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full spectacle, and with all speed take her downe; but she is breathlesse, though not cold; and they see all her face and body, which were wont to be as white as snow, now to be coale blacke, and to stinke infinitely. These are the wofull effects,

and lamentable fruits both of <hi>Despaire</hi> and <hi>Murther;</hi> O, may <hi>Christians</hi> of all ranks, and of hoth sexes, take heed by <hi>Fidelia's</hi> mournfull &amp; miserable example, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all remember that murther will still be revenged and punished, especially that which is perpetrated by <hi>Children</hi> towards their <hi>Parents;</hi> a sinne odious both to God and man, sith it not onely opposeth Nature, but Grace; Earth, but heaven.</p>

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16653:153"/>
whose Lacquay it was, and what was his businesse. <hi>Plantinus</hi> descends and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth him, but he is close, and will reveale nothing. Hee entreats him to enter and taste the Wine, the which he doth; when ingaging, and leaving him in the Celler, he trips up to his Master, and acquaints him with his answer, adding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that some fifteene dayes since hee saw him here before. <hi>Alcasero</hi> commands this Lacquay to be brought before him, he examines him, but he will not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himselfe; he threatens him with the whip, and imprisonment, but he cannot prevaile. It is a vertue in a servant to conceale his masters secrets. <hi>Alcasero</hi> is angry at his silence and fidelitie, yet commends him: he bethinks himselfe of another course and subtilty, as well knowing that faire words may obtaine that which threats cannot; he prayes him to dine with his servants, and enjoyneth <hi>Plantinu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </hi> to bring him to him in the Garden after dinner, the which he doth: <hi>Alcasero</hi> takes him apart, and tels him, that some fifteene dayes past he saw him here: <hi>Fiesco</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth him with silence. <hi>Alcasero</hi> finds much perturbation in his heart, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction in his looks and speech; he thinks this boy can reveale something which he ought to know, and therefore thinks to surprise him with a silver hooke; he profers him twenty <hi>Duckets,</hi> and layes it downe before him, to discover himselfe and his businesse.</p>
                     <p>Gold is, but ought not to be a powerfull bait to indiscretion and poverty. It is a small point of small wisdome in <hi>Noblemen</hi> to commit secrets of importance to those who have too much folly, and too little judgement to conceale them. The sight of this gold doth not onely dazle <hi>Fiesco's</hi> eyes, but eclipse his fidelity; so he holds it no sinne towards God, nor treachery towards his master to reveale it; but takes it, and informes him, that hee is the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Carpi</hi> his Lacquay, who sent him from <hi>Naples</hi> thither, with a letter from him to the Lady <hi>Fidelia</hi> his sister. <hi>Alcasero</hi> growes pale hereat, and is very curious and hasty to see the Letter: <hi>Fiesco</hi> delivers it him, who steps aside, and reads it: whreon hee plucks his hat downe his fore-head, and so making three or foure paces, reads it ore againe. He is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed to know as much as he sees, and grieved, not to see and finde as much as he desireth to know: hee now confirmes his former suspition of <hi>Carpi,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves that he is a chiefe Actor or Agent in his fathers <hi>Tragedy.</hi> But hee knowes it wisdome to use silence in the discovery of a crime of this nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cals <hi>Fiesco</hi> to him, bids him stay that night, and to speake with him in the morning before he depart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcasero</hi> withdrawes himselfe from the Garden to his Closet, and there againe peruseth this Letter of <hi>Carpi's:</hi> he finds it full of suspition and ambiguities, and perceives it hath a relation to former letters; yea, there is a mystery in this Letter, the which he must unlocke and finde out ere hee bee satisfied: for although <hi>Carpi</hi> be squint-eyed, yet he feares he hath looked too right on his father. Hee flies to <hi>Fidelia's</hi> Closet, Trunke, and Casket, and findes a former Letter of <hi>Carpi's</hi> to her, and the copie of one of hers to him; and the perusall of these two Letters are so farre from diminishing his suspition, as it doth augment and increase it; for now hee verily beleeves that <hi>Carpi</hi> and his sister <hi>Fidelia</hi> have joyntly had a great hand in his fathers murther. But all this while hee doth not once so much as suspect or imagine that his other sister <hi>Caelestina</hi> hath played any part in this <hi>Tragedy:</hi> but <hi>Time</hi> is the daughter of <hi>Truth,</hi> as <hi>Truth</hi> is that of <hi>Heaven.</hi> In the morne he cals for <hi>Fiesco,</hi> to whom he gave this farewell: <hi>Tell the</hi> Baron <hi>of</hi> Carpi <hi>thy Master, that my sister</hi> Fidelia <hi>is in another world, and not in this, and that shortly I resolve to see him at</hi> Naples, <hi>and that in the interim I will reserve his Letter. Fiesco</hi> departs, but knowes, hee hath so highly betrayed and wronged his Master, as
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16653:154"/>
he dares not see him, and so shewes him a faire paire of heeles. Such Laquayes farre better deserve a halter than a Livery. <hi>Carpi</hi> wonders at his Laquayes long stay: In which meane time <hi>Alcasero</hi> comes to <hi>Naples,</hi> where hee is yet irresolute, whether to accuse <hi>Carpi</hi> by the order and course of Law, or to fight with him: but he resolves to doe both; and that if the Law will not right him for the murther of his father, his sword shall. He goes to the <hi>Criminell Iudges,</hi> and with much pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and sorrow accuseth the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Carpi</hi> for murthering of the Captaine <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevente</hi> his father; and for proofe hereof produceth his two Letters to his sister <hi>Fidelia,</hi> and the copie of one of hers to him. Whereupon the Judges grant power to apprehend <hi>Carpi,</hi> so hee is taken and constituted prisoner; and now hee hath leasure to thinke on the basenesse and foulenesse of his fact. But he is so farre from dejecting himselfe to sorrow, or addicting himselfe to repentance, as hee puts a brazen face on his lookes and speeches, and so peremptorily intends and resolves to deny all. Had he had more grace, or lesse impiety, he would have made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter use of this his imprisonment, and have shewen himselfe at least humble, if not sorrowfull, for his offence and crime. But hee holds it wisdome in greatest dangers to shew most courage and resolution, and so makes himselfe fit to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and encounter with all accidents and occurrences whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>Men may palliate their sinnes, but God will finde them out, and display them in their naked colours. <hi>Alcasero</hi> is an importunate solicitor to the Judges to draw and hasten on <hi>Carpi</hi> his arraignment: But they (resembling themselves) proceed therein modestly and gravely: they consult, and consider the three Letters: they finde conjecturall sentences enow to accuse, but no solide proofe to condemne him: they hold, that their opinions ought not to bee swayed with the wind of every presumption, and that it is not fit so trivially to set the life of a man at six and seven. Besides, as they approve of <hi>Alcasero</hi> his affection to his father, so they dislike of his impetuosity and vehemencie towards <hi>Carpi.</hi> They all resolve to lay the Sword of <hi>Iustice</hi> in the ballance of <hi>Equitie,</hi> and then ordaine that <hi>Carpi</hi> shall bee rackt, to see whether they can draw more light from his tongue, than from his pen. But he endures these his tortures and torments with wonderfull constancie; and still denies all. Had his cause beene more religious and humane, and not so bloudy, this fortitude and courage of his had beene as praise-worthy, as now it is odious and execrable. The <hi>Court</hi> by sentence (pronounced in open <hi>Senate)</hi> acquit and cleare <hi>Carpi</hi> of this murther; whereat <hi>Alcasero</hi> exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines and murmures.</p>
                     <p>It is not enough that <hi>Carpi</hi> hath now escaped this danger; for <hi>Alcasero</hi> remaines still constant in his conceit, that he is the murtherer of his father, and therefore vowes and resolves to fight with him: He lets passe some six weeks time, till he be sound of his limbs, and then resolves to send him a challenge. Had <hi>Carpi</hi> beene innocent, it had beene more honourable and requisite, that hee had challenged <hi>Alcasero,</hi> than <hi>Alcasero</hi> him: but his cause being unjust, and his conscience feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, he dares not runne the hazard, to be desirous or ambitious to fight with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casero:</hi> the which if hee had attempted, <hi>Alcasero</hi> will anticipate and prevent him; who making <hi>Plantinus</hi> his second, hee out of the ashes of his sorrow, and the fire of his revenge, sends him to <hi>Carpi</hi> with this Billet of Defiance.</p>

                     <p>Whiles the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Carpi</hi> is triumphing to see how hee hath bleared the eyes of his Judges, and so freed himselfe from the feares and danger of death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, <hi>Plantinus</hi> finds him out, and delivers him <hi>Alcasero</hi> his Challenge.

                           </gap>e,</hi> when setting a good face upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, he adresseth himselfe to <hi>Plantinus</hi> thus:</p>
                     <p>Sir, I presume you know this businesse: for I take you to bee <hi>Alcasero's</hi> Second. He hath (replyed <hi>Plantinus)</hi> done me the honour to make choice of mee, in stead of a more worthy. Well (quoth the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Carpi)</hi> tell thy master from mee, That although I have not deserved his malice, yet that I accept his challenge, and will performe it, onely I must fight single, because I am at present unprovided of a Second. <hi>Plantinus</hi> (as full of Valour as Fidelity) prayes him, that hee may not see his hopes and desires frustrated, but that hee may enjoy part of the feast. But <hi>Carpi</hi> gives him this answer, which he bids him take for his last resolution: That hee will hazard himselfe, but not his friend. So <hi>Plantinus</hi> returnes with joy to his master, and discontent to himselfe: when nothing proving of power, to quench the fire of these two <hi>Gentlemens</hi> courage and revenge, they meet at the time and place appointed. <hi>Carpi</hi> fights with passion and vehemencie; <hi>Alcasero</hi> with judgement and discretion. <hi>Carpi</hi> lookes red and fiery with choller, and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casero</hi> pale and ghastly, not for feare of his cause, but for the remembrance of his sorrowes: and to conclude and shut up this combate in the issue thereof, <hi>Iustice</hi> is not now pleased to shew the effects of her power and influence; nor <hi>God</hi> that of his Justice, onely it is reserved for another time, and for a more shamefull manner: so <hi>Carpi</hi> hath the best of the day, for he is onely hurt in his right hand, and scarred over both his lips, as if the providence and pleasure of <hi>God</hi> had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that that hand which committed the murther, and that mouth which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, should bee purposely punished and no part else. As for <hi>Alcasero,</hi> hee had five severall wounds, whereof one being thorow the body, made <hi>Carpi</hi> beleeve it was mortall, and the rather, for that hee fell therewith speechlesse to the ground: so leaving him groveling and weltring in his bloud, hee departs, resting very confident, that hee was at his very last gaspe of life, and point of death. But <hi>Carpi</hi> his <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> (being more humane and charitable than his master) leapes over the next hedge, and comes to his assistance: Hee leanes him against a banke, binds up his wounds, and wraps him in his cloake, and so runnes to a Litter, which he saw neere him, and prayes the Lady that was in it, that shee would vouchsafe to take in <hi>Don Alcasero,</hi> who was there extreamly and dangerously
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:16653:155"/>
wounded: and this did <hi>Carpi</hi> his <hi>Chirurgion</hi> performe, in the absence of <hi>Alcasero's</hi> owne <hi>Chirurgion;</hi> who out of some distaste or forgetfulnesse, came not at the houre and place assigned, according to his promise. It was the Lady <hi>Marguerita Esperia,</hi> who out of her noble and charitable zeale to wounded <hi>Alcasero,</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly descended her Litter, commanding her servants to lay him in softly, and to convey him to his lodging, and shee her selfe is pleased to stay in the fields till her servants returne it her. It was a <hi>courtesie,</hi> and a <hi>charity</hi> worthy of so <hi>Honourable</hi> a Lady as her selfe: and in regard whereof, I hold it fit, to give her remembrance and name a place in this History. All <hi>Naples,</hi> yea, the whole Kingdome rings of this combate; the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Carpi</hi> and <hi>Alcasero</hi> are (joyntly) highly commended and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled for the same; the last for his affection and zeale to his dead father; the first, for giving <hi>Alcasero</hi> his life, when it was in his power and pleasure to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it from him. But God will not permit <hi>Alcasero</hi> to die of these wounds, but will rather have him live to see <hi>Carpi</hi> die before him, though in a farre more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble and shamefull manner.</p>
                     <p>As soone as <hi>Alcasero's</hi> wounds are cured, and hee prettie well recovered, hee leaves <hi>Naples,</hi> and returnes to <hi>Otranto,</hi> where his sister <hi>Caelestina</hi> did as much shake and tremble at the imprisonment of the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Carpi,</hi> as shee now rejoyces at his liberty; especially, sith shee is assured, that hee hath no way accused her, nor used her name for the death and murther of her father, which indeed makes her farre more pleasant and merry than before, and within six moneths after marries with <hi>Seignior Alonso Loudovici,</hi> whom shee ever from her youth had loved and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and with whom shee lives in great pleasure, state, and pompe; and no lesse doth her brother <hi>Alcasero,</hi> who for the courtesie which <hi>Dona Marguerita Esperia</hi> shewed him when he was so dangerously wounded, in requitall thereof doth now marrie the faire <hi>Beatina,</hi> her onely daughter, with whom hee lives in the highest content and felicity, as any <hi>Gentleman</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> or of the whole world can either desire or wish.</p>
                     <p>But this <hi>Sunne-shine</hi> of <hi>Carpi's</hi> prosperity, and <hi>Caelestina's</hi> happinesse and glory shall not last long: for there is a storme breaking forth, which threatneth no lesse than the utter ruine, as well of their fortunes as lives. Where men cannot, God will both detect and punish murthers; yea, by such secret meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, as we least suspect or imagine. They are infallible <hi>Maximes,</hi> that we are never lesse secured, than when wee thinke our selves secure; nor neerer dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than when we esteeme our selves farthest from it. And if any be so incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, or as I may say, so irreligious, as not to beleeve it, haue they but a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and they shall instantly see it verified and made good in the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Caelestina,</hi> who thinking themselves now safe and free from all adverse fortunes, and fatall accidents whatsoever, and enjoying all those contents and pleasures, which their hearts could either desire or wish to enjoy, or which the world could prostitute or present them; they in a moment shall be bereaved of their delights and glory, and enforced to end their dayes on a base scaffold, with much shame, infamie, and misery. The manner is thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God</hi> many times beyond our hopes and expectations, doth square out the rule of his Justice, according to that of his will: all men are to bee accountable to him for their actions, but he to none for his decrees and resolutions: it is in him to order, in us to obey; yea, many times hee reprives us, but yet with no intent to pardon us. Curiosity in matters of Faith and Religion, proves not onely folly but impiety: for as we are men, we must looke up to <hi>God,</hi> but as we are <hi>Christians,</hi> we must not looke beyond him. Hee oftentimes makes great offenders accuse
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:16653:155"/>
themselves for want of others to accuse them; and when hee pleaseth, hee will punish one sinne by another, the which wee shall now see verified in <hi>Lorenzo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Carpi</hi> his Laquay; that wretched and bloudy <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> who as wee have formerly heard, assisted this his Master to murther Captaine <hi>Benevente</hi> and <hi>Fia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,</hi> neere <hi>Alpiata;</hi> who ever since being countenanced and authorized by his Masters favour, in respect of this his foule fact, wherein his bloudy and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hand was deeply and joyntly embrewed with him; he from that time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes so debaush'd and dissolute in his service, as he spends all that possible he can procure or get, yea, and runnes likewise extreamly in debt, not onely with all his friends, but also with all those whom he knowes will trust him: so as his wants being extremely vrgent, and enforced to see himselfe reduced to a miserable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence and poverty. He being one day sent by the <hi>Baron</hi> his Master to the <hi>Senate</hi> house with a Letter to his Councellor, hee there in the throng and crowd of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cut a purse from a Gentlewomans side, wherein was some five and twenty Ducketons in Gold, was taken with the manner, and apprehended, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned for the fact, and the next morne his Processe was made, hee found guilty, and condemned to bee hanged: So hee is dealt withall by a couple of Fryers in prison, who prepare his soule for <hi>Heaven:</hi> Hee sees the foulnesse of his former life, and repents it. The <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Carpi</hi> his Master, no sooner understands this newes, but he shakes and trembles, fearing lest this his Laquay should reveale the murther of the Captaine and his man: whereupon he resolveth to flie; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering againe, that if his Laquay accuse him not, his very flight will proclaime and make him guilty: hee stayes, and as hee thinkes, resolves of a better course. Hee goes to the prison, and deales with his Laquay to bee secret in the businesse hee wots of; protesting and promising him, that in consideration thereof, hee will enrich his mother and brothers. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> tels him, that he need not feare; for as hee hath lived, so hee will die his faithfull servant: But wee shall see him have more grace, than to keepe so gracelesse a promise. <hi>Carpi</hi> flattering himselfe with the fidelity and affection of his Laquay, resolves to stay in the City: but hee shall shortly repent his confidence. Hee was formerly betrayed by <hi>Fiesco,</hi> which mee thinks should have made him more cautious and wise, and not so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to entrust and repose his life on the incertaine mercy of <hi>Lorenzo's</hi> tongue: but Gods Revenge drawes neare him, and consequently he neare his end; for he neither can nor shall avoid the judgement of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lorenzo</hi> on the gallowes, will not charge his soule with this foule and execrable sinne of murther: but Grace now operating with his soule, as much as formerly Satan did with his heart, hee confesseth, that hee, and the Baron of <hi>Carpi</hi> his Master, together with the Knight <hi>Monte-leone,</hi> and his Laquay <hi>Anselmo,</hi> murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Captaine <hi>Benevente,</hi> and his man <hi>Fiamento,</hi> and threw them into the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the which hee takes to his death is true: and so using some Christian-like speeches of repentance and sorrow, he is hanged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lorenzo</hi> is no sooner turned over, but the <hi>Criminall Iudges</hi> advertised of his speeches delivered at his death, they command the Baron of <hi>Carpi</hi> his lodging to be beleagred, where he is found in his study, and so apprehended, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted prisoner, where feare makes him looke pale; so as the Peacocks plumes both of his pride and courage strike saile. He is againe put to the Racke, and now the second time hee reveales his foule and bloudy murther, and in every point acknowledgeth <hi>Lorenzoes</hi> accusation of him to be true: So he is condemned, first to have his right hand cut off, and then his head, notwithstanding that many great friends of his sue to the <hi>Viceroy</hi> for his pardon. The night before he was to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:16653:156"/>
die the next morne, one of his Judges was sent to him to prison, to perswade him to discover all his complices in that murther, besides <hi>Monte-leone</hi> and his Laquay <hi>Anselmo;</hi> yea, there are likewise some Divines present, who with many religious exhortations perswade him to it: So <hi>Grace</hi> prevailes with Nature, and <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> with Impiety and sinne in him; that he is now no longer himselfe, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and repentance hath reformed him; hee will rather disrespect <hi>Caelestina,</hi> than displease God: whereupon he affirmes, that she and her deceased sister <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia,</hi> drew him and <hi>Monte-leone</hi> to murther their father, and his man <hi>Fiamento,</hi> and that if it had not beene for their allurements and requests, they had never attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either the beginning or end of so bloudy a businesse: and thus making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe ready for <hi>Heaven,</hi> and grieving at nothing on <hi>Earth,</hi> but at the remembrance of his foule fact, he in the sight of many thousand people, doth now lose his head.</p>

She is at that instant at a <hi>Noblemans</hi> house, at the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his daughters marriage, where she is apprehended, imprisoned, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to bee the authour and plotter of the <hi>Captaine</hi> her fathers death; neither can her teares or prayers exempt her from this affliction and misery. She was once of opinion to deny it, but understanding that the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Carpi</hi> and his Laquay <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> were already executed for the same in <hi>Naples,</hi> shee with a world of teares freely confesseth it, and confirmes as much as <hi>Carpi</hi> affirmed: whereupon in expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of this her inhumane <hi>Paracide,</hi> she is condemned to have her head cut off, her body burnt, and her ashes throwne into the ayre; for a milder death, and a lesse punishment the Lord will not (out of his Justice) inflict vpon her, for this her horrible crime, and barbarous cruelty committed on the person of her owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or at least seducing and occasioning it to be committed on him; and it is not in her husbands possible power to exempt or free her hereof. Being sent backe that night to prison, she passeth it over (or in very truth the greatest part thereof) in prayer, still grieving for her sinnes, and mourning for this her bloudy offence and crime; and the next morne being brought to her execution, when she ascended the scaffold, she was very humble, sorrowfull, and repentant, and with many showres of teares requested her brother <hi>Alcasero</hi> and all her kinsfolkes to forgive her, for occasioning and consenting to her fathers death, and generally all the world to pray for her; when her sighs and teares so sorrowfully interrupted and silenced her tongue, as she recommending her soule into the hands of her <hi>Rede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>She was lamented of all who either knew or saw her, not that she should die, but that she should first deserve, then suffer so shamefull and wretched a death: and yet shee was farre happier than her sister <hi>Fidelia,</hi> for shee despaired, and this confidently hoped for remission and salvation.

                     <p>As the shortest errours are best, so those <hi>Vices</hi> which have longest perseverance and predominance in us, prove still the most pernicious and dangerous: It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to crush a Serpent in the egge, but if we permit it to grow to a Serpent, it may then crush us: a plant may be removed with ease, but an old tree difficultly: To fall from sinne to repentance, is as great a happinesse, as it is a misery to fall from repentance to sinne; and indeed to use but one word for the affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confirmation of this truth, there can no greater misery befall us, than to thinke our selves happy, when (through our sinnes) we are miserable.</p>

Three dayes are scarce past before he makes two requests to her, the one for new clothes, the other for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; when to the end that her wisdome might shine in her affection, as well as her affection in her wisdome, she cheerefully grants him the first, but perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily denies him the second, because shee well knowes it would bee so much cast away on him, sith he would instantly cast it away on Wine; and to write the truth, the grant of his apparell doth not so much content him, as the refusall of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

His faith is so weak to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and so strong with the Deuill, as hee will not retire with Grace, but advance with impiety, to see as well the end, as the beginning of this bloudy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse: He consults hereon with his delight, not with his reason; with his will, not with his Conscience; with his heart, not with his soule. Hee sees hee hath no money, and knowes, or at least beleeves, that his mother hath enough, and therefore concludes, that if shee were once dead, it were impossible that his life should want any. So these two wretched Councellors, <hi>Covetousnesse</hi> and <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> (or rather Covetousnesse to maintaine his Drunkennesse) like two infernall fiends and furies, haule him on head-long to perpetrate this bloudy and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full murther of his deare and tender Mother, the end whereof, will bring him as much true misery and infamy, as the beginning doth flatter and promise him false content and happinesse; his youth hath no regard to her age, and lesse to her Life, neither will he vouchsafe to remember, that he first received his of her: yea, all the bloud which flowes in his heart, and streames in his veines and body, cannot any way have the power to prompt him, that it is derived and descended

from hers. And if <hi>Morges</hi> will not divert him, <hi>Losanna</hi> should; if his yeares can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not instruct him, yet his bookes might; and if <hi>Nature</hi> prevailed not with his heart, yet mee thinkes <hi>Grace</hi> should with his Conscience, to represent him the foulenesse of this attempt, and the unnaturall cruelty thereof, in resolving to embrew his diabolicall hands in her innocent bloud; or if the influence of these earthly considerations could not allay the heat of his malice, or quench the fire of his revenge towards her, yet me thinks looking from prophanenesse to piety, from Earth to Heaven; from the time present to the future; from the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Body, to the immortality of his Soule; from Sin to Righteousnesse, from Revenge to Religion, and consequently from Satan to God, he should hate this bloudy designe and project of his as much as now he loves it, and seeke the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of his Mother, with as much obedience and affection, as now he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives and pursues her untimely end with impiety and detestation. But his Vices will still triumph over his Vertues; and therefore it is rather to bee feared than doubted, that they will in the end make him too miserable, ever to see himselfe so happy.</p>
                     <p>Miserable <hi>Maurice</hi> therefore, (as the shame of his time, the disgrace of his sex, and a prodigious monster of Nature) having hellishly resolved on the matter, now with a devillish fortitude and hellish assurance passeth on to the manner of her Tragedy. Hee will not give eare to God, who seekes to divert him from it, but will hearken to the devill, who useth his best Oratory to perswade and entice him to it. But as the devill is malicious in his subtilty, so should we be both wise and cautious in our credulity; for if we beleeve him, he will betray us; but if we beleeve God, we shall then betray him: he is impatient of delayes, yea, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is so bloudy, and his revenge so cruell, as hee thinkes every houre a yeare, till he hath sent her from Earth to Heaven. He proposeth unto himselfe divers wayes to murther her, and the devill who is never absent, but present in such hellish oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, makes him as well industrious as undictive and implacable in the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and finishing thereof. Now he thinks to cut her throat as she is in bed: Then to poyson her at table, either in her meat or drinke. Then againe hee is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to hire some to kill her as shee is walking in her vineyards; or else to cause two Watermen to drowne her, as shee is taking the ayre in a Boat on the Lake, which twice or thrice weekly she is accustomed to doe; but yet still he is irreso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, either which, or which not to resolve on, till at last after a weekes dilatory protaction, having with a fatall and infernall ratiotination banded and rebanded these seuerall bloudy projects in his braines and contemplations, hee rejecteth them all, as more fuller of difficulty and apparant danger, than of warrantable safety, when considering there was a deepe Well in the outer yard, adjoyning to the Garden, he holds it fittest for his purpose to drowne her therein, whereon the devill and he strikes hands, and set up their rest and period.</p>
                     <p>Whiles thus this gracious mother <hi>Christina</hi> endevours with her best care and Prayers to divert her gracelesse sonne <hi>Maurice</hi> from this his intemperate and beastly sinne of Drunkennesse, hee (as if hee were no part of her, but rather a limbe of the Devill) with a monstrous and inhumane ingratitude, sets his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and braines on the tenter-hookes, to espie out the occasion and time to dispatch her. When burning with a flaming desire, to quench the insatiable thirst of his revenge in her bloud, he (taking time and opportunity at advantage) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his mothers people abroad to gather in the Vintage, the Well open, and she with a Prayer booke in her hand, walking in the Garden next adjoyning, the Devill infuseth such courage to his heart, his heart such cruelty and inhumanity
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:16653:162"/>
to his resolutions, that all things seemed then to conspire to see an end to this his so long desired and affected businesse of murthering and dispatching his mother, he taking on him the part of a madman, whom it seemed sorrow had suddenly afflicted, and griefe distracted, he with his hat in his hand, hastily and furiously rusheth into the Garden to his mother, and cryes out to her, that there is one of the neighbours children fallen into the well, which hee espied from his chamber window: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto (harmelesse good woman) she adding beliefe to his false and perfidious spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and being (beyond her selfe) afflicted and amazed with this sodaine and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull newes, she throwes away her Booke, and hand in hand with him, (her sighes interrupting her words, and her teares her sighes) shee (as if pitty added wings to her feet) trips away to the well, both to see this mournefull spectacle, and chiefly to know, if it any way lay in her possible care to assist, or power to preserve the said childe from death: when bringing her to the well, he better like a fury, then a man, and rather resembling a meere Devill, then a sonne, fastneth his left hand on the well-post; and as shee lookes into the profundity thereof, hee with his right hand tips and throwes her in; and so without any more doing, claps downe the cover thereof; when rejoycing in his heart that he had sent her to death, because he sees and knowes it now, not in the power of the whole world to save her life. He (the better to overvaile this his impious villany, and to obscure this his barbarous and bloody fact) ascends her chamber, breakes open her cupbords, trunckes, and chests, takes away most of her money, and silver plate, which hee privately hides away for his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe and use, and so scattereth a few pieces of money, and some of her clothes and apparell in the floore, thereby subtilly to insinuate and intimate to the world, that it were theeves who had robbed and drowned his mother; when stealing a horse out of the stable, he with much secrecy gets him out of the backe doore, which he leaves open, and from thence rides away to his mothers people in the Vineyards; to whom hee relates hee hath beene all that morne abroad to take the aire, and is now come to passe the remainder of the day with them, and to be merry: to which end (in his mothers name) hee sends for wine from the skirts of the towne; and so (as well men as maids) they carouse and frollike it till towards night, and then they all returne home, where they find both doores open, his mother their Mistris wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and no creature whatsoever in the house, whereat they much admire and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. So the servants and himselfe seeke and call her in the Orchards and Gardens, but in vaine, for they find no newes of her; when the maids one way, and he and the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants another way, seeke her as well in the roomes and chambers, as in the streets and neighbours houses, where she is accustomed to frequent, but to no purpose; for they can neither see nor heare of her; till at length the maidens rushing into her bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, they find her Cupboard, Chests, and Trunks broken open, and some of her money and apparell strewed here and there on the floore; whereat amazed, they lamentably cry out at the windowes, that theeves have beene there and robbed their Mistris her Chests and Trunkes: which <hi>Maurice</hi> and the men-servants of the house over-hearing, they ascend, and admire at the sight thereof; neither doth his outward feares, or their inward apprehensions, stop or stay at the meere losse of the goods, but they joyntly apprehend, and feare the absence of his mother, and their Mistris <hi>Christina,</hi> and are already become jealous and umbragious of her safety, and very fearefull, that the theeves have offered her some violence and cruelty. Whereupon late at night, hearing no newes of her, her sonne (because chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrested in this disastrous accident) goes and acquaints the <hi>Bayliffe</hi> of <hi>Morges,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Criminall Officers</hi> therewith, who on all sides inquire for her, and make a secret and curious search in the towne, to finde out the theeves; and

in the meane time (together with <hi>Maurice</hi> and the servants) leave not a roome nor place of the house unsought for her: but their diligence proves vaine, for they can purchase no newes of her, much lesse of the theeves. They remaine in the house all night, and they all with sorrowfull and watchfull eyes, every minute of an houre, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect her, or newes of her. Eight of the clocke the next day strikes, but as yet she is not so much as seene or heard of: So they againe, in presence of the <hi>Bayliffe,</hi> revisite and search all places and corners both in the House, Gardens, Orchyards, and Yards; but still to no effect or purpose: when behold the sacred and secret providence of God, in revealing her to be drowned in the well, not onely beyond the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but also beyond the beliefe of all that were present: for as they are in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of their doubts and feares, yea in the very depth of their research and perquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, loe, one of the servant Maids, named <hi>Hester,</hi> who was neerest in the favour, and dearest in the affection of her <hi>Mistris,</hi> having that very instant mornng taken a nappe of an houres sleepe, or thereabouts in a chaire, starts suddenly out of her sleepe and rest, trips to them, and saies, she then and there dreamt, that her <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris Christina,</hi> was cast into the well and drowned; the which shee affirmed with many words, and more sighes, out-cries, and teares; which piercing into the eares and thoughts of the Bayliffe and Servants, and into the very heart and Conscience of this our execrable <hi>Maurice,</hi> they looke pale with griefe and amazement, and he straineth the highest key of his Art and pollicy to keepe his cheekes from blushing for shame thereat, and the better to hood winke their eyes and judgements, from the least sparke or shaddow of this his guiltinesse herein; he with many showres of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall teares, prayes the Bayliffe that upon <hi>Hesters</hi> dreame and report, the Well may be searched, adding withall, that it was more probable then impossible; that those theeves who robbed his Mothers house, might likewise bee so devillishly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious to murther her and throw her into the Well: which the Bayliffe seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously considering, as first the maides dreame, then the Sonnes request and teares, hee instantly in presence of all those of the house, as also of many of the next neighbours whom hee had purposely assembled: Caused the Well to bee searched and sounded, where the hooke taking hold of her cloathes, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly bring up the dead body of his Mother and their Mistris <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>As soone as he hath buried his Mother, his blacke mourning apparell doth in his heart and actions worke such poore and weake effects of repentance and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for her untimely death, as where divers others lament and grieve, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise rejoyceth and triumpheth thereat, and by her decease being now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Lord and Master of all, he like a gracelesse villaine fals againe to his old car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowsing companions, and veine of drunkennesse, wherein hee takes such singular delight and glory, as he makes it not onely his pastime and exercise by day, but his practise and recreation by night: And as God hath infinite meanes and wayes to scourge and revenge the enormity of our delicts and crimes, so we shall shortly see for our instruction, and observe for our reformation, that this ungodly and beastly vice of drunkennesse of his, which is his most secret bosome and darling sinne, will in the end prove a ravenous <hi>Vulture</hi> to devoure, and a fatall <hi>Serpent</hi> to eat out the bowels, first of his wealth and prosperity, and then of his life; for it not onely takes up his time, but his studie, in so much as I may as truly averre to my griefe, as affirme to his shame, that hee levelleth at nothing more, than to make it his felicity, which swinish excesse and intemperancy, (as a punishment inseparably incident &amp; infallibly hereditary to that sin) doth within three months make him sell away all his Lands, yea, and the greatest part of his plate and hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sholdstuffe; so his drunkennesse first, but then chiefly Gods Justice and revenge pursuing his foule and inhumane crime of drowning his Mother, makes him of being left rich by her, within a very short time become very extreame poore and miserable; so as he runnes deeply into debts, yea, his debts are by this time become so exceedingly urgent and clamorous, as contrary to his hopes and feares, when hee least dreames thereof; hee is imprisoned by his Mercer and Draper, for the blacks of his Mothers Funerall, to both whom he is indebted the summe of three hundred crownes, which is farre more than either his purse can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, or his credit and Estate now satisfie.

Hee prayed God to be mercifull to his soule, and then besought the world to pray unto God for that mercy; when speaking a few words to himselfe, and sealing them with many teares, and farre fetched sighes; he lastly bids the world farewell, when enviting the Executioner to doe his Office he is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned over.</p>
                     <p>And such was the vitious life, and deserved death of this Execrable Sonne and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Villaine <hi>Maurice:</hi> wherein I must confesse, that although his end were shamefull and sharpe; yet, it was by farre too too milde for the foulenesse of his crime, in so cruelly murthering his deere Mother <hi>Christina,</hi> whom the Lawes both of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to preserve and cherish: Yea, let all Sonnes and Daughters of all ages and ranckes whatsoever looke on this bloody and disasterous example of his, with feare; and feare to commit the like by the sight of his punishment. It is a History worthy, both of our meditation and detestation, whether we cast our eyes on his drunkennesse, or fix our thoughts and hearts, on his murther: Those who love and feare God, are happy in their lives, and fortunate in their deaths; but those who will neither feare nor love him, very seldome proove fortunate in the one, never happy in the other; and to the rest of our sins, if wee once consent and give way to adde that scarlet, and crying one of Murther; that blood which we untimely send to Earth, will in Gods due time draw downe vengeance on our Heads from <hi>Heaven; Charity</hi> is the marke of a <hi>Christian,</hi> and the shedding of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood, either that of an <hi>Infidell,</hi> an <hi>Atheist;</hi> or a <hi>Devill.</hi> O therefore let us affect and strive to hate it in others, and so wee shall the better know how to detest and abhorre it in our selves, which that we may all know to our comforts, and remember to our consola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

IN the City of <hi>Santarem</hi> which (by tract of time, and corruption of speech) some tearme Saint <hi>Aren,</hi> and which (after <hi>Lisbon)</hi> is one of the richest and best peopled of <hi>Portugall;</hi> there dwelt a Gentleman of some fifty five yeares old, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly descended, and of a great estate and meanes, named <hi>Don Sebastian Idiaques,</hi> whose wife and Lady being aged, of well neere fifty yeares, was termed <hi>Dona Honoria,</hi> and well she deserved that honourable name, for all sorts of Vertues and honours made her youth famous, and her age glorious to all <hi>Portugall</hi> and <hi>Spaine.</hi> They had lived together in the bonds of Matrimony almost thirty yeares, with much Honour, content, and felicity, and for the fruits of their affection and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they had two sonnes and foure daughters; but God in his pleasure and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence (for some reserved reasons best knowne to his All Divine Majesty) tooke from Earth to Heaven all their daughters, and one of their sonnes, so as now they have left them but one sonne, named <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> a gallant young Gentleman, of some twenty five yeares old, of disposition brave and generous, who after his first youthfull education under his father, had his chiefe breeding under the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> to whom he was first a Page, and then a chiefe Gentleman retaining to him, whom (in regard of the death of his brother and sisters) his father called home unto him, to be his comfort and consolation, and the prop and stay of his age, as also of the Lady his mother, who had formerly acted a great part in griefe, and a mournfull one in sorrow for the death of her children; and indeed <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> this sonne of theirs, for all regards of Courtship, was held to be a compleat Gallant, and one of the prime Cavalliers of <hi>Portugall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Idiaques</hi> the father, though in all the course and progresse of his life, and in all the life and conduction of his actions, he bewrayed many morall and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous vertues, yet as one discordant string marres the harmony of the best tuned Instrument, and the concent of the sweetest melody and musicke; and as one foule Vice is naturally subject, and fatally incident to ecclipse and drowne many rich and faire vertues, so (in this his old age, when time had honoured him with white haires) he deboshed himselfe so much, and so sottishly sacrificed his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular affections to heart-killing concupiscence, and his exorbitant desires to soule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destroying adultery, that hee very often made himselfe a false and inconstant husband to his wife, and a true, yea, too true a friend to Curtisans and Strumpets. His vertuous Lady <hi>Honoria</hi> extreamly grieves hereat, that now in his later years he should thus lasciviously forget himselfe, both towards her, and towards God. She useth all sweet perswasions, prayers and teares, to diswade and divert him from it, but seeing that all proves vaine, and that he rather prooves worse then better thereat, her discretion makes her brooke it with as much patience as she can, and therefore she seemes not to see, or know that whereof (to her griefe and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) she cannot be ignorant; But here comes an accident which will breed both of them, and their Sonne <hi>Don Ivan</hi> misery of all sides.</p>
                     <p>Some six leagues from <hi>Santarem</hi> was a wonderfull faire young Gentlewoman being a widdow, aged but of Twenty two yeares, named <hi>Dona Marsillia</hi> well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sended, but by her late deceased Husband left but small meanes, yet she beares out her port bravely, and maintaines her selfe highly and gallantly; and indeed shee is the prime young Lady for beauty in all those parts; Now the base Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and Emysaries of <hi>Idiaques</hi> his beastly and obscaene lust (the true Vipers and Cankers of Common weales) give him notice of her, and of her singular beauty, as well foreseeing and knowing that it would bee sweet and pleasing newes unto him. He visits and courts her, but as young as she is she puts him off with peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:16653:170"/>
refusals, and in vertuous and modest tearmes checks his age for this his lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious suit and motion to her: But he is as constant in his affection to her, as she is disdainfull to him; for his heart is so insnared and intangled in the fetters of her fresh and delicate beautie, that although shee refuse him, yet he will not forsake her; but after many pursuits and visits, she at last well perceiving that he loved her tenderly and dearly, and that hee still most importunately frequented her house and company, she as a subtill and cunning young Gentlewoman, tels him plainly and privately, that she will acquaint him with a secret of her heart, and a request of her minde and affection, which if hee will cause to be performed, shee then vowes she will for ever be at his disposing and command; <hi>Idiaques</hi> thinking that she will crave some summe of money of him, or some yearely pension or annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he constantly promiseth to grant and performe her request; so she (taking time at advantage) and first swearing him to secrecie, then (with many smiles and blushes) shee tels him, that if ever he thinke to enjoy her love and her selfe, hee must use the meanes to marry his sonne <hi>Don Ivan</hi> to her, which being ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, shee with much pretended shew of piety and affection, religiously sweares to him, that shee will never have the power or will to deny him any thing, but that his requests shall bee to her as so many commands, and (but onely for himselfe) if his sonne <hi>Don Ivan</hi> bee her Husband, shee with many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations and asseverations sweares, that shee will sacrifice her best bloud and life, rather than distaine his bed, or offer him the least shadow of any scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall or dishonour whatsoever. <hi>Idiaques</hi> wondreth with admiration, and admires with wonder at this her strange proposition, the which hee findes so knotty and intricate, as measuring Grace by Nature, his Judgement by his Lust and Concupiscence, and his Soule by his Affections, hee knowes not what to say or doe herein; so hee answereth her with more love than wisdome, and for that time leaves her in generall tearme. Hee goes homes, walkes pensively in his Garden, and there consults <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> on this businesse; faine hee would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his sonnes honour, and keepe the honour of his bed immaculate, but then the sweet Roses and Lillies of <hi>Marsillia's</hi> youth and beauty act wonders in his heart, and beares downe all other reasons and considerations before it: Hee visits her againe and againe, but hee findes her inviolably constant in her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer resolution. All the favour and courtesie which he can gaine from her, are a few extorted kisses, which so inflame and set on fire his aged heart and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as at last like a gracelesse father, hee faithfully promiseth her to use his best art and power to procure his sonne to marrie her. To which end hee takes him aside, and in the softest and sweetest tearmes hee can devise, paints out <hi>Marsillia's</hi> praises and Vertues to him in the purest and rarest colours, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withall, that although shee bee not exceeding rich, yet that her perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage is so exquisite, and her perfections so excellent, as that shee every way meriteth to bee wife to a Prince. <hi>Don Ivan</hi> (by what fatall fortune I know not) relisheth this motion of his father, to seeke the Lady <hi>Marsillia</hi> for his wife, with much delight and joy, and farre the more and the sooner, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard hee (in divers companies) hath formerly heard the fame of her beauty extolled, and the glory of her Vertues advanced to the Skie, so hee takes time of his father to consider hereof, and rides over sometimes with him to Saint <hi>Estiene</hi> to visit her; Hee findes her wonderfull faire and beautifull, and wonderfull coy; of a very sweet and Majesticall carriage, and of a delicate and curious speech, fit baits to ensnare the heart, and to betray the judgement of a more solide understanding than that of <hi>Don Ivan.</hi> Shee acts her part as wisely
<pb facs="tcp:16653:171"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:16653:171"/>
                        <pb n="306" facs="tcp:16653:172"/>
as he doth amarously and passionately; For the more she makes shew to retire and conceale her affection from him, the more he is provoked to advance and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his to her; but he cannot be so much enamoured of her beauty, as shee is with the great Estate of Lands and Demaines whereunto God and his father have made him heire.</p>
                     <p>Whiles thus the father privately, and the sonne publikely are seeking to make <hi>Marsillia</hi> his wife, the old Lady <hi>Honoria</hi> the mother, by many strong reasons seeks to divert him from her. Shee hath perfect notice of her husbands long and often frequenting of <hi>Marsillia's</hi> house and company, and therefore fearing the vanity of his age, and doubting the frailty of her youth and chastity, her jelousie and judgement at last findes out and concludes, that his familiarity with her is farre greater than honour can warrant, or honesty allow of; Upon which founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shee in her discontented lookes and silence, bewrayes unto her sonne <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> her constant and resolute aversnesse from him to marry her, the which she peremptorily and religiously forbids him upon her blessing, adding withall, that if he marry her, there will infallibly more miseries and calamities attend their nuptials, than as yet it is possible for him either to know or conceive; the which shee prayes him to read in her lookes and silence, to remember it when he sees her not, and to take it as the truest advise, and securest Counsell of a deere Mother to her onely Sonne. Don <hi>Ivan</hi> ruminates on these speeches and advise of his Mother, as if there were some deepe abstruse mysterie or ambiguous Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle contained and hidden therein, the which because he hath equall reason as well to feare that this match of his with <hi>Marsillia</hi> may prove fatall, as to hope and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that it may prove fortunate, he makes a stand thereat, as vowing to proceed therein with advisement, and not with temeritie and precipitation; and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares for a month or two to visit her: But the more the Sonne flyes off in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from <hi>Marsillia,</hi> the more doth shee doe the like from his father in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, whereat he grieves with discontent, and shee seemes to bite her lippe with sorrow. <hi>Idiaques</hi> chargeth his son to tell him from whence this his sudden strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and unkindnesse towards <hi>Marsillia</hi> proceedeth; the which hee answereth with a modest excuse, as favouring more of discretion than disobedience, but yet wholly concealeth his Mothets counsell and advise to him from his Father, the which notwithstanding hee vehemently suspecteth it proceeds from her and her Jealousie. <hi>Marsillia</hi> is enraged to see her selfe deprived of <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> whom in her ambitious thoughts, hopes, and wishes shee had already made her Husband; and howsoever <hi>Idiaques</hi> his Father seekes to conceale and palliate this businesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, yet shee beleeves it is his fault, and not his Sonnes. Shee layes it to his charge, and knitting her browes, shee conjureth him to tell her from whence his Sons unkindnesse to her proceeds: He tels her, he is confident, that it is his old Mother who hath diverted him from her, whereat shee is exceedingly enraged; When seeing this old Letcher so open and plaine with her, shee foothing him up with many kisses, tels him that this old Beldam his wife must first be in heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can hope to enjoy her, or she his Son here on Earth; when (being allured and provoked by the treacherous suggestions and bloody temptations of the Devill) she proffers him to visit her, and so to poyson her, which hee opposeth and contradicteth; and contrary to all reason &amp; sense, and repugnant to all Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Christianity, yea, to Nature and Grace, (as a Husband fitter for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, than for this good old Lady his Wife) hee undertakes and promiseth her speedily to performe it himselfe; yea, the Divell is now so strong with him, and he with the Divell, that because hee loves <hi>Marsillia,</hi> therefore hee must hate his
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:16653:172"/>
owne deare wife, and vertuous Lady <hi>Honoria,</hi> and because he hates her, therefore he must poyson her; A lewd part of a man, a fouler one of a Christian, but a most hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and bloody one of a Husband to his owne wife, who ought to be neere and deere unto him, as being his owne flesh and blood, Yea the other halfe of himselfe. Hee cannot content himselfe to seeke to abuse and betray his Sonne, but hee must also murther the mother, So wanting the feare of God before his eyes, and repleate with as much impiety and Cruelty, as hee was devoyd of all Grace, he is resolute in this his hellish rage and malice against her, and so to please his young Strumpet, hee will send this good old Lady his wife to <hi>Heaven</hi> in a bloody Coffin, so without thinking of <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> or of God, or his soule, hee procures strong poyson, and acting the part of a fury of Hell, and a member of the Devill, he as a wretched and execrable Husband, administreth it to her in preserved Barbaries, which he saw her usually to love and eat, whereof within three daies after she dies, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame griefe and sorrow of her Sonne <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> who bitterly wept, for this his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hasty and unexpected death, but the manner thereof he knowes not, and indeed doth no way in the world either doubt or suspect thereof.</p>
                     <p>His Father <hi>Idiaques</hi> makes a counterfeit shew of sorrow and mourning to the world, for the death of his wife, but God in his due time wil unmaske this his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hypocrisie, and detect and revenge this his execrable and deplorable murther. Now as soone as <hi>Marsillia</hi> is advertised of the Lady <hi>Honoria's</hi> death, she not able to containe her Ioyes, doth infinitely triumph therear, and within lesse than two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths after her buriall, <hi>Idiaques</hi> and <hi>Marsillia</hi> worke so politiquely with <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> as hee marries <hi>Marsillia</hi> although his mothers advise to him in the garden, doe still runne in his mind and thoughts, and now hee brings home his lustfull Spouse and Wife to his lewd and lascivious Fathers house at <hi>Sentarem,</hi> where (I write with horrour and shame) hee most beastly and inhumanly very often commits Adultery and Incest with her, and they act it so close that for the first yeare or two, his Sonne <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> hath no newes or inkling thereof, and now <hi>Marsillia</hi> governeth and rules all, yea her incontinency with her Father <hi>Idiaques</hi> makes her so audacious and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as shee commands not onely his house, but himselfe, and domineeres most proudly and imperiously over all his Servants. Her waiting maid <hi>Mathurina</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves and takes exact and curious notice, of her young Ladies lustfull, and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full familiarity, with her Father in Law <hi>Idiaques,</hi> the which her mistris understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, shee extreamely beats her for the same; and twice whippes her starke naked in her Chamber, and dragges her about by her haire, although this poore young Gentlewoman, with a world of teares and prayers, beggs her to desist and give over.</p>
                     <p>God hath many wayes and meanes to set forth his glory, in detecting of Crimes, and punishing of offenders, yea he is now pleased to make vse of this young maidens discontent and choller against her insensed Lady and Mistris, for we shall see her pay deare for this cruelty and tyranny of hers towards her, for <hi>Mathurina,</hi> being a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman by birth, she takes those blowes and severe vsage of her Lady in so ill part, and lodgeth it so deepely in her heart and memory, as she vowes her revenge shall requite part of that her cruelty and tyranny towards her; Whereupon (with more haste then discretion, and with more malice then fidelity) she in her hot blood, goes to <hi>Don Ivan</hi> her young master, tels him of this foule businesse betwixt his young wife and old Father, to the disgrace and shame of nature; and makes him see and know his owne dishonour, in their brutish and beastly adultery and incest. <hi>Don Ivan</hi> extreamely grieves hereat, yea hee is both amazed and astonished at the report of this unnaturall crime as well of his young wife as aged Father. Hee cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:16653:173"/>
from choller and teares hereat, to see himselfe thus infinitely abused by her beauty, and betrayed by his lust; and if it be a beastly, yea a prophane part, for one man, and friend to offer it to another, how much more for a father to offer it to his owne, yea to his onely Sonne. Hee expected more goodnesse from her youth and grace from age, but as his wife hath hereby infringed her vow, and oath of wedlocke, so hath his wretched father exceeded and broken those rules and precepts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yea, he is so netled with the report, and inflamed with the considetation and memorie hereof, that he abhorres her infidelity, and in his heart and soule detesteth his inhumanitie; so as the knowledge hereof doth so justly incense him against her, and exasperate himselfe against him; that resolving to right his owne honour, as much as they have blemished and ruined it, and there in their owne, he scornes to be an eye-Witnesse, much lesse an accessary of this his shame and their infamy: So he here enters into a discreet and generous consultation with himselfe, how to beare himselfe in this strange and dishonourable accident; when perceiving and finding that both his wife and father, had by this their beastly Adultery and Incest, made themselves for ever unworthy of his sight and companie; he here for ever disdaining henceforth to see her, or speake with him, very suddenly (upon a second conference, and examination of <hi>Mathurina,</hi> who stood firmely and vertuously to her former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and accusation against them) takes horse and rides away from <hi>Santarem</hi> to <hi>Lisbone,</hi> where providing himselfe of monies and other necessaries, hee takes poast for <hi>Spaine,</hi> and there builds up his residence and stay at the Court at <hi>Madrid,</hi> where wee will for a while leave him, to speak of other accidents which fall out in the course of this History.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Idiaques</hi> seeing the sudden departure of his Sonne, and <hi>Marsillia</hi> of her Husband, <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> and being both assured that he had some secret notice and intelligence of their lascivious dalliances and affection, he exceedingly grieves, and shee extremely stormes thereat, because they know that this foule scandall will wholly reflect and fall upon them; and now by this his sudden and discontented departure from them, will be made notorious and apparent to all the world. But how to remedy it they know not; because he hath neither signified him where he is gone, nor when he will returne; the which the more bewrayeth his small respect, and discovereth his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable displeasure towards them. But as there is no malice and revenge to that of a Woman, so <hi>Marsillia</hi> assuring herselfe that it was her Maid <hi>Mathurina</hi> who (to the prejudice and scandall of her Honour) had unlocked this mysterie to her Husband <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> shee enters into so furious a rage, and so outragious a fury against her, as shee provides her selfe of rods, and intends the next morne e're shee bee stirring out of her bed, to wreake her fierce anger and indignation upon her: But this sharpe and severe resolution of hers, is not so closely carried by her, but <hi>Mathurina</hi> hath perfect notice thereof, and to prevent this intended correction and crueltie of her incensed Lady and Mistris, shee the night before takes horse, and so rides home to the Towne of St. <hi>Saviours</hi> to her father; and there, from point to point relateth him all which had past betwixt her Lady and her selfe, and betwixt her Husband, her selfe, and her father in Law; and that now disdaining any more to serve her, as her body, so her tongue is at liberty; for she is not, and she will not be sparing to publish her Mistris, and her father in law's shamefull familiarity and adultery together. But this indiscretion, and licentious folly of her tongue will cost her farre dearer than shee thinkes of, or expecteth.</p>
                     <p>For her late Lady and Mistris, <hi>Marsillia,</hi> being now perfectly certified of <hi>Mathu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina's</hi> infidelitie and treachery towards her in the point of her dishonour and shame, shee (to salve up her reputation, and to provide for her fame (will not wholly relye
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:16653:173"/>
upon her owne judgement and discretion herein; but resolves to acquaint <hi>Don Alonso De Perez,</hi> her owne onely brother herewith, and to crave his ayd and assistance, as also his advice, betwixt whom and her selfe there was so strict a league and simpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of affection, that (if reports be true) I write it to their shame, and mine owne sorrow, it exceeded the bounds of Nature and Honour, and of Modesty and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity; onely the presumption hereof is great and pregnant, for if there had not beene some extraordinary tyes and obligations betwixt them, it is rather to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved than doubted, that for her sake and service, he would never have so freely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himselfe to such eminent feares and dangers, as we shall immediately see him doe; and although (of honour and disposition) he were brave and generous, yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve he would not have undertaken it. For the Reader must understand that to this brother of hers, <hi>Don Perez, Marsillia</hi> speedily acquaints the infidelity and treachery of her Maid <hi>Mathurina's</hi> tongue against her Fame and Honour, which had so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately occasioned her Husbands, <hi>Don Ivans,</hi> discontented departure from her. Shee protesteth most seriously and deepely to him of her and her father in Law <hi>Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aques</hi> innocency in this pretended crime and scandall: Tels him that <hi>Mathurina</hi> is the onely author and reporter thereof, and therefore till that base and lewd tongue of hers be eternally stopped and silenced, shee shall never enjoy any true content to her heart, or peace to her thoughts and mind either in this world, or this life: When his affection to her makes him to yeeld such confidence to her speeches, vowes, and complaints, that hee holds them to bee as true as Scripture; yea, and the undoubted Oracles of Truth and Innocency; when to please and satisfie her, hee bids her be of good cheare and comfort, and that he will speedily take such order that <hi>Mathurina's</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>candalous tongue shall not long ecclipse her fame, or any further blemish the lustre of her reputation: When this base and bloody Gentleman, <hi>De Perez,</hi> to make good this his promise to his execrable Sister, he secretly rides over to St. <hi>Saviours,</hi> and there by night wayting neere her fathers doore, when <hi>Mathurina</hi> would chance to issue forth; he in a darke night espying her (without any more ceremony or further expostulation) runnes her thorow the bodie two severall times, whereof poore harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse innocent soule shee fals downe dead to his feet without once speaking or crying. So <hi>De Perez</hi> seeing her dispatched, he presently takes horse (which his man there led by him) and poasts away ro <hi>Santarem,</hi> being neither seene nor discovered. And thus this bloody villain most deplorably embrued his guilty hands in the innocent blood of this vertuous young Gentlewoman, who never offended him in thought, word, or deed in all her life; and albeit that her father <hi>Signeor Pedro de Castello</hi> makes curious enquiry and research for the Murtherer of his Daughter, yet <hi>De Perez</hi> (mounted at advantage) hath recovered <hi>Santarem</hi> in safety. But God will in due time finde him out to his shame and confusion; yea, and than when his security and courage little dreames thereof.</p>
                     <p>As soone as he comes to <hi>Santarem,</hi> hee acquaints his sister <hi>Marsillia</hi> of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching of <hi>Mathurina,</hi> who is infinitely glad thereof, and extremely thanke full to him for the same, and now her malice and revenge lookes wholly on her Husband <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> for offering her this unkind and scandalous indignity of his departure, and for tacitely taxing and condemning her of incontinency with his father <hi>Idiaques,</hi> which her adulterous heart, and incestuous soule and conscience doth inwardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse and acknowledge, though the perfidiousnesse and hypocrisie of her false tongue doe publikely deny it; yea, with her best art and policy, and with her sweetest smiles and kisses, shee hath by this time so exasperated this her bloody brother against him, that (out of his vanity and folly) hee prophanely vowes unto God, and seriously protests and sweares unto her. That if he knew where he were, hee (for the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:16653:174"/>
of her honour and innocencie, would ride to him and fight with him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he would resolve to give him &amp; her some valuable reparation, and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble satisfaction to the contrary, which he seales and confirmes to her with many amarous smiles, and lascivious kisses. But as we are commonly never nearer dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than when we thinke our selves farthest from it: So God being as secret in his decrees, as sacred in his resolutions, we shall shortly see <hi>De Perez</hi> to verifie and confirme it in himselfe; for as in the heat of this his sottish affection to his sister, he is ready to fight with her Husband <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> if he knew where he was; loe the newes of his residence in <hi>Madrid,</hi> when he least thinkes thereof, is accidentallie brought him by a Seruant of his owne whom hee purposely sends to <hi>Santarem</hi> with these two ensuing letters, The one sent and directed from him to his Father the other to his wife <hi>Marsillia</hi> That to his Father spake thus.</p>

Their malice and revenge each to other is so violent and impetuous, that without any thought either of God or their Soules, or of Heaven or Hell, they passe over the night, if not in watchfulnesse, yet in broken and distracted slumbers, yea the morne no sooner peeped from Heaven through their windowes to their chambers, but they leape from their beds to the Prado, where <hi>De Perez</hi> with his friend <hi>Lopez</hi> come first on horse-backe, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after them <hi>Don Ivan</hi> in his Coach, with a young Gentleman his friend, tearmed <hi>Don Richardo De Valdona:</hi> So these two Duelists disdaining to be tainted with the least spice of dishonour, or shadow of cowardise, they at first sight of each other, throw off their doublets, and in their silke stockings and pumps, with their Rapiers drawne, they without any further complement or expostulation approach each other; But here before they beginne to reduce malitious contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation into bloudy action, I hold it fit to informe my Reader with a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that now past betweene them, wherein doubtlesse the Providence of God was most conspicuous and apparant; For as by the Law and custome both of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Portugall,</hi> all Rapiers should bee of one length, yet <hi>De Perez</hi> curiously casting his vigilant eye upon that of <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> either his feare, or his judgement, or both, informe him that that Rapier is longer than his, whereat <hi>Don Ivan</hi> grieves farre more than <hi>De Perez</hi> can possible either rejoyce or wonder, for he is so farre from any way blemishing his honour with this, or with any other point or shadow of dishonour, as now he gives his Rapier to measure, and to write the truth, his is found one inch longer than that of <hi>De Perez,</hi> when biting his lip for anger, he (resembling himselfe) proffers to fight with that either of <hi>Lopez</hi> or <hi>Valdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> which was sufficient reason for one Gentleman of Honour to give, and for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take; but when he sees that this proffer of his will neither secure <hi>De Perez</hi> feare, nor confirme his content, then as a Noble and generous Gallant, he freely exchangeth Rapiers with him, gives <hi>De Perez</hi> the longer, and contents himselfe to fight with the shorter, whereat <hi>De Perez</hi> rests satisfied, and well he may, sith this action and his receit thereof, doth as much testifie <hi>Don Ivans</hi> glory, as his owne dishonour and shame, and now they againe approach each other to fight.</p>

At their first comming up <hi>Don Ivan</hi> runnes a firme thrust to <hi>De Perez</hi> breast, but hee (bearing it up with his Rapier) runnes <hi>Don Ivan</hi> in the cheeke towards his right eare, which drawes much bloud from him, and he in exchange runnes <hi>De Perez</hi> thorow his shirt sleeve without hurting him: At their second meeting they againe close without hurting each other, and so part faire without offering any other violence: At their third assault <hi>De Perez</hi> runnes <hi>Don Ivan</hi> thorow the brawne of his left arme, who in exchange requites him with a deepe wound in his right side, from whence issued much bloud, and now they breathe to recover wind, and to the judgements of <hi>Lopez</hi> and <hi>Valdona,</hi> (as also of their Chirurgions) they hitherto are equall in valour, and almost in fortune; so although these spectators doe of both sides earnestly entreat them to desist and give over, yet they cannot, they will not be so easily or so soone reconciled each to other; So after a little pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and breathing, they (with courage and resolution) fall to it afresh, and at this their fourth encounter <hi>Don Perez</hi> gives <hi>Don Ivan</hi> a deepe wound in his left shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and he requites him with another in exchange, in the necke; and although by this time their severall wounds hath engrained their white shirts with great effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their scarlet bloud, yet they are so brave, so generous, or rather so inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and malitious, that they will not yet give over, as if they meant and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved rather to make death feare them, than they any way to feare death; But their fifth close will proue more fatall; for now after they had judiciously traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their ground, thereby to deceive each other of the disadvantage of the Sunne, whiles <hi>De Perez</hi> directs a full thrust to <hi>Don Ivans</hi> breast, hee bravely and skilfully warding it, in requitall thereof, runnes him cleane thorow the body, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his right pap, when closing nimbly with him, and pursuing the point of his good fortune, hee whips up his heeles, and so nailes him to the ground, when he had the strength to begge his life of <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> and God knowes he much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that it was not then in his power to give it him, for this his last wound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desperately mortall, hee presently died thereof, having neither the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to call on God, much lesse to begge mercy of him for his sinfull soule; but as hee lived abominably and prophanely, so he died miserably and wretchedly: And although I confesse it was too great an honour for him to receive his death from so brave a noble Gentlemans hands as <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> yet it is a most singular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and remarkable punishment of God, that hee died by the hands of his owne lascivious sisters Husband, and which is yet more, by his owne sword, as if God had formerly decreed, and purposely ordained, that the selfe fame sword should give him his death, wherewith so lately and so cruelly hee had bereaved that harmlesse innocent young Gentlewoman <hi>Mathurina</hi> of her life, although in regard of this his foule and lamentable murther, hee (with lesse honour and more infamy) every way deserved to have died rather by a halter than a sword; But Gods Providence is as unsearchable as sacred.</p>

                        <hi>Don Ivan</hi> having rendred thanks to God for this his victory, he out of his noble courtesie and humanity, lends <hi>Lopez</hi> his Coach to transport the dead body of his brother in Law <hi>De Perez</hi> into the City, and taking his horse in exchange, he by a private way gets home to his lodging. But this their Duell is not so secretly carried, but within three houres after all <hi>Madrid</hi> rattles thereof; who knowing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants to be both of them noble Gentlemen of <hi>Portugall,</hi> it gives cause of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall talke, and argument of universall envie and admiration in all Spaniards, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the nobler sort of Souldiers and Courtiers. When the very day after that <hi>Don Ivan</hi> had caused this his brother to be decently buried, <hi>Lopez</hi> repaires to his chamber to him, and in a faire &amp; friendly manner enquires of him if he please to

At the relation and knowledge of this mournfull newes, <hi>Idiaques</hi> cannot refraine from much sorrow, nor <hi>Marsillia</hi> from bursting forth into bitter teares and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations thereat; for seeing her deare and onely brother thus slaine by the hand of her owne unkinde Husband; by losing him shee knowes she hath lost her right arme, and he being dead shee knowes not to whom to have recourse either for counsell, assistance, or consolation. And yet as much as hee sorrowes and she grieves at this diasterous accident, they notwithstanding are yet so farre from thinking it a blow from Heaven, or from looking either up to God, or downe to their owne sinfull hearts, consciences, and soules for the same, that without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any good use, or drawing any divine or profitable morall thereof, they still continue their beastly pleasures and damnable Adultery and Incest together, as if there were no God to see, nor no deserved torments or miserie reserved to punish it.

And thus was the lamentable and fearfull end which God gave to this gracelesse young Lady, the which I cannot as yet passe over, without annexing and remembring one remarkable point and circumstance therein, in which the Justice and Mercy of God to both sexes, and all ages and degrees of people, doth miraculously resplend and shine forth; for that very horse which threw and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her was the verie same which shee formerly lent to her Brother <hi>De Perez,</hi> and whereon he rid to Saint Sauiours when he (by her instigation) killed her waiting maid <hi>Mathurina.</hi> Good God, how just, and wonderfull are thy decrees, Deere Lord, how immense and sacred is thy Iustice.</p>

They carefully enquire of him if his dead Lady had not sometimes a waiting Gentlewoman named <hi>Mathurina,</hi> hee answered them yes, and that she was lately murthered in the streets of <hi>Saint Saviours,</hi> and that her murtherers were as yet unknowne: They demand of him againe whose daughter she was; hee informes them that her father is a Gentleman who dwels in <hi>Saint Saviours,</hi> and that his name is <hi>Seignior Pedro de Castello,</hi> which being as much as they sought for; putting their seruants to watch ouer this foot-man, that he might not escape to give the least inkling of their demands to his old Master <hi>Idiaques,</hi> they presently send away poast to <hi>Saint Saviours</hi> for <hi>Castello,</hi> and (in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Justice) these two Corigadors as Christian Magistrates, having put all things in order for the vindication of the truth of these deplorable matters, that very night <hi>Idiaques</hi> arrives at <hi>Coimbra,</hi> and descends from his Coach to the house of one of these Corigadors, where the dead body of his daughter <hi>Marsillia</hi> lay; at whose mournfull fight, as soone as his passionate griefe and sorrow had caused him to shed and sacrifice many rivolets of teares, when hee least dreames or thinks therof, these two Corigadors cause him to be seized on, and instantlycom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him close prisoner, without acquainting him with the cause hereof; where all that night his guilty heart and conscience (as so many Fiends and Furies) assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him that it was for poysoning of his owne Lady <hi>Honoria;</hi> there horror and terrour, griefe and despaire, and sorrow, and anguish, doe act their severall parts upon the Theatre of his soule.</p>
                     <p>The next morne <hi>Castello (Mathurina's</hi> father) likewise arrives to <hi>Coimbra,</hi> to whom the Corigadors communicate this Letter of <hi>Don Ivan</hi> to his wife, which he sent her from <hi>Spaine,</hi> wherein they tell him the murther of his daughter <hi>Mathu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi> seemes probably and strongly to reflect upon <hi>Idiaques,</hi> and his daughter in law <hi>Marsillia;</hi> when they farther acquainting him with her tragicall death, as also with his imprisonment; <hi>Castello</hi> (with a world of teares and cries) exclaimes that undoubtedly they were the authours, if not the actors of his daughters lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble murther, and so very passionately and sorrowfully craves justice of them on <hi>Idiaques</hi> for the same, which they are as willing to grant and performe, as hee to desire: So after dinner in the publike Tribunall of Justice, they send for <hi>Idiaques</hi> legally and juridically there to appeare before them; where this sorrowfull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (with much passion, and more teares) doth strongly accuse him for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committed and perpetrated on his daughter <hi>Mathurina;</hi> the which <hi>Idiaques</hi> with many high and stout answers denieth; he alleageth many oylie words, and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:16653:179"/>
sugred and silken phrases, to justifie and Apologize his innocencie: Which these Corigadors (led by the finger of God) hold rather to be far more ayrie than solide, and farre more plausible than reall or true; so they (still remembring his sonne <hi>Don Ivans</hi> Letter to his wife <hi>Marsillia)</hi> doe (without regard to his quality or age) adjudge him to the Racke. The which <hi>Idiaques</hi> (fearing infinitely more the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his owne Lady <hi>Honoria,</hi> than that of <hi>Mathurina)</hi> endures the tortures and torments thereof, with a fortitude and resolution farre beyond his strength and age, and with an admirable constancie stands firmly to the deniall of this fact and accusation; so seeing the Racke taken away, and himselfe from the Racke, he is therefore very confident and joyfull, that his danger is likewise o're past and o're blowne: But these vaine hopes of his will yet both deceive, and in the end betray him, for as yet his conscience hath not made peace with God. For the griefes &amp; sorrowes of this mournfull father for this lamentable murther of his daughter, have now made him both industrious in his solicitation, and religious in this his prosecution against <hi>Idiaques</hi> towards these Corigadors, to whom againe he becomes an earnest, and yet an humble Petitioner, that they will give him eight dayes time more to fortifie his accusation, and that all that time he may still remaine prisoner without Baile or Surety; which they finding reasonable, and consonant to all equity and law, they freely grant him. When <hi>Castello</hi> having God for his Councellor, and whom in a small time <hi>Idiaques</hi> shall finde for his Judge, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to minde some words of his deceased daughter touching the suspition of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning her old Lady by her Husband, to make way for this match with <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> hee doth no more accuse him for murthering of his daughter <hi>Mathurina;</hi> but some two dayes after he frames and presents a new Inditement and accusation to his Judges against him, for poysoning his old wife the Lady <hi>Honoria.</hi> Which these Judges admiring and wondering at, they then partly; nay almost confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that there is some great crime, and foule fact in this businesse against <hi>Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aques,</hi> which God will in fine detect and bring to light, by the solicitation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of this honest poore Gentleman <hi>Castello.</hi> So they admit againe of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Inditement against him, and by vertue hereof convent him before them at their Tribunall of Justice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Idiaques</hi> understanding hereof, his guilty conscience now denounceth such thundering peales of feare and amazement to his appalled heart and trembling soule, as they will give no peace either to himselfe or them; and the Devill who had ever heretofore promised him his best aid and assistance, now flies from him, and leaves him to stand or fall to himselfe: And here it is that his courage begins to faile him, and that his feare and shame is almost resolved and ready to proclaime himselfe guilty of this his last and worst accusation, the poysoning of his owne wife the Lady <hi>Honoria:</hi> But againe the hope of life is yet so sweet to him, as the feare of death is displeasing and bitter, and therefore (with a wretched resolution, and a miserable confidence) he againe artificially endevoureth to bleare the eyes of these his Judges, with his chiefest Eloquence, and sweetest Oratory; who having given him his ful carreer to speake in his owne defence and justification, when they perfectly knew he yet spake not one valuable word or reason, either to defend or justifie himselfe; Then one of these cleere-sighted Corigadors (in the behalfe of both of them) returnes him this grave reply and pious exhortation.</p>
                     <p>That as they have not the will to accuse him, so they have not the meanes or power to excuse him, for being (at least) accessary to both, or either of these murthers, of his Lady <hi>Honoria,</hi> or <hi>Mathurina;</hi> that the sudden death of the first, and the violent and untimely one of the last, the voluntary absence of his sonne

That he could cast no mist of delusion before Gods eyes, though he artificially endevoured and laboured to cast a vaile before theirs. That the shedding of innocent blood was a crying Sinne, which despight of sorcery and of Hell would (in Gods due time) draw downe vengeance to Earth from Heauen on their Authors. That if he were guiltie of his accusation, he had no better plea than confession, nor safer remedie than repentance. That contrition is the true marke, of a true Servant of God, and though we fall to Nature and sinne as being men yet wee should rise againe to grace and righteousnesse as being Christians. That to deny our Crimes, is to augment them and consequently their punishments, both in Earth, and in Hell, and that he was not a Christian, but an Infidell, who would attempt to save his life with the losse of his soule, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religious exhortations concurring and looking that way.</p>
                     <p>But all this, notwithstanding, <hi>Idiaques</hi> his Faith and Conscience, was yet so strong with Sathan, and therefore so weake with God, that he left no excuse; policy or evasion uninvented to bleare the eyes of these Corigadors, and so to make his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency to passe current with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But his eloquence and asseverations cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with the solidity of their Iudgements, for God will not suffer them to bee led away with words nor seduced or deluded with shadowes: But from the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of circumstances, they now flie to the centre of truth, and to the Authour and giver, yea to the life and soule thereof, God. So they againe adjudge him to the rack for his second accusation of Murther, as they formerly had done to him for his first. At the pronouncing of which sentence, If wee may judge of his heart by his face, hee seemed to be much afflicted, appaled and daunted, which his Iudges perceiving before they expose him to his torments, they in Honour to his Age and qualitie, but farre more to Truth and Iustice (whom they know to be two Daughters of Heaven) they now hold it a point of Charity and Piety to send him two Diuines to his prison to worke upon his Conscience and Soule, which they doe: And God in the depth of his goodnesse, and the richnesse of his mercy, was so mercifully propitious and indulgent to him, that hee added such efficacy to their perswasions and power to their exhortations, as at the very sight of the racke, hee with teares in his eyes, then and there confessed unto them, That hee was innocent of <hi>Mathurinaes</hi> murther, but guiltie of poisoning his owne wife, the Ladie <hi>Honoria,</hi> for the which he said he most heartily and sorrowfully repented himselfe. Whereupon his Iudges (and the rest present) admiring with wonder and praising God with admiration for the detection of this his foule bloody and lamentable crime, they pronounce sentence against him. That for expiation thereof, hee at eight of the clocke the next morning shall have his head cut off at the place of common execution in that Towne. When <hi>Idiaques,</hi> who (yet adhered so much to Sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:16653:180"/>
Corigadors of <hi>Coimbra</hi> for the preservation of the priviledges of their Court and Towne, doe obstinately expose and vehemently contest it, yet at last well knowing, and being conscious with themselves, that smaller Townes and Courts in <hi>Portugall</hi> are bound and subject to depend of the greater; They therefore making a vertue of necessitie, and contenting themselves to give way to that which they cannot reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, doe ordaine that <hi>Idiaques</hi> should bee conveighed and tryed at <hi>Santarem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet before they suffer him to depart their Towne, they in honour to Iustice, in wisedome to themselves, and in reputation to their Towne and Court, doe seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and religiously charge him in the name and feare of God to declare truly to them, whether his unburyed Daughter in Law <hi>Marsillia</hi> were not likewise accessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with him in poysoning his Wife, the Lady <hi>Honoria,</hi> which at first he strongly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to them. But then they send away for the two Divines who had formerly dealt with him and his Conscience in Prison, who exhort him to carrie a white and candyd soule to Heaven, and threaten him with the torments of Hell fire if hee doe not. When with sighes and teares, he confesseth that to them, and that it was hee himselfe who administred that poyson to his wife, but that his daughter in Law <hi>Marsillia</hi> bought it for him. So these Iudges (upon the validity of this free and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne confession) in detestation of this her lamentable crime, doe reverently resolve to second, and glorifie God in his Iudgements towards her, and therefore they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently condemne her dead body to bee burnt that afternoone in their market street, the common place of execution, which accordingly is then and there performed in presence of a great concourse of people, who infinitly rejoyce that God so miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously destroyed the life, and their Iudges the body of so execrable a female Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
                     <p>By this time we must allow, and imagine that our old Lecher, and new murthere <hi>Idiaques</hi> (by vertue of his appeale) is brought to his owne City of <hi>Santarem,</hi> and I thinke either with a ridiculous hope or a prophane and impious resolution to see whether God will punish him there with death, or the Divell preserve and save him from it. Hee hath many friends in this Court, who are both great and powerfull, and therefore builds all his hopes of life, on this reeling quicksand, this snow, this nothing, that his great estate of money and lands will undoubtedly act wonders with them for his pardon. But still he hopes, because still the divell deceives him; He is arrived here at <hi>Santarem,</hi> where this faire Citie which might heretofore have proved his delight and glory, is now reserved for his shame and appointed and destined for his confusion; They cannot brook the sight, much lesse the cohabitation and company of such monsters of nature, and divels incarnat of men, who glory in making themselves guilty of these soule sinnes, and crying crimes, Adultery, Inces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So that <hi>Idiaques</hi> (who hath made himselfe a principall of this number, and a monster of Art in these sinnes) thinking here in <hi>Santarem</hi> to find more mercy and pity during his life, shall find lesse of both of them after his death. For the criminall Iudges of this Court who reverence and honour Iustice because Iustice doth daily and reciprocally performe the like to them, doe confirme the sentence of <hi>Coimbra;</hi> that the next morne he shall lose his head, but in detestation and execration of these his foule and bloody crimes, they adde this clause and condition thereto, that both his head and body shall be afterwards burnt, and his ashes throwne into the ayre, which gives maatter of talke and admiration, not onely to <hi>Santarem</hi> but to all <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall.</hi> And thus most pensively and disconsolately is <hi>Idiaques</hi> reconveyed to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son where Church-men are sent him by the Iudges of that court, to direct his soule in her slight and transsiguration from earth to Heaven whom they finde (or at least <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:16653:180"/>
he is the next morning brought to the place of execution, which for the greater example and terrour to others, and of ignominy to himselfe, was before his owne house, wherein he had acted and perpetrated all his enormous crimes. Where the scaffold is no sooner erected, but there flocke an infinite number of people from all parts of the City, to be spectators of this last scene of his Tragedy. He came to the scaffold (betweene two Friers) in a sute of blacke Taffeta, a gowne of blacke wrought tuffe Taffeta, and a great white set ruffe, which yet could not be whiter than his broad beard: At his ascent on the scaffold, his grave aspect and presence engendred as much sorrow &amp; pity, as his beastly crimes did detestation in the hearts and tongues of the people, to whom (after hee had a short time kneeled downe and prayed) he made a short speech to this effect.</p>
                     <p>That although the poysoning of his owne wife, and his adultery with his sons wife, were crimes so odious and execrable, as had made him unworthy any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger either to tread on earth, or to look up unto Heaven, yet although he deserved no favour of his Judges for his bodie, he humbly repented and begged some of God for his soule, and for the more effectuall obtaining thereof, hee zealously prayed all those who were present to joyne their prayers to his. Hee confessed that it was <hi>Marsillia's</hi> beauty which first (at the instigation of the devill drew him to that adultery with her, and this poysoning of his owne wife <hi>Honoria,</hi> whereof from his heart and soule, he now affirmed hee implored remission of God, of the Law, of his sonne <hi>Don Ivan,</hi> and of all the world, and prayed them all to be more godly and lesse sinfull by his example, and so kneeling downe, and praying a little whiles to himselfe, he rose up, and putting of his gowne, ruffe, and doublet, which hee gave to the Executioner, hee binding his head and eyes with his handkerchiefe, bade him doe his office, which he presently performed, and with one blow of the sword, made a perpetuall double divorce betwixt his head and his shoulders, his body and his soule; when presently according to his sentence, both his head and his body were then and there burnt and consumed to fire, and his ashes throwne into the ayre.</p>
                     <p>And this was the deplorable life and death of <hi>De Perez, Idiaques,</hi> and <hi>Marsillia,</hi> of whom the spectators (according to their severall humours and affections) spake diversly, all condemning the bloudy cruelty of <hi>De Perez</hi> towards innocent <hi>Mathurina,</hi> and of <hi>Idiaques</hi> towards his vertuous wife <hi>Honoria.</hi> Againe, some pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, and others execrated <hi>Marsillia's</hi> youth, beauty, and lust; but both sexes, and all degrees of people (as so many lines terminating in one Center) magnified the providence and Justice of God, in so miraculously and condignly cutting off these monsters of nature, and bloudy butchers of mankinde.</p>
                     <p>And if the curiosity of the Reader will yet farther enquire, what afterwards became of <hi>Don Ivan;</hi> The reports of him are different, for as first I heard that his discontent and griefe was so great, yea, so extreame for the death of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and wife, that he cloistered himselfe up a <hi>Capuchin</hi> Fryer in their Monastery at <hi>Madrid:</hi> So contrariwise I have since credibly beene enformed, that he shortly after these disasters left <hi>Spaine,</hi> and still lives in <hi>Santarem</hi> in <hi>Portugall</hi> in great honour, welfare, and prosperity; But which of these his resolutions are most inclining and adherent to the truth, it passeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my knowledge, and therefore shall come too short of my affirmation.</p>

Harcourt,</hi> and the second <hi>Monseiur De Hautemont,</hi> who were two very proper young Gentlemen, excellently well bred and qualified, as well in Arts as Armes, or in any other vertue or perfection which was requisite, both to shew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themselves to bee the sonnes of their father. And (to content my Reader with their characters) <hi>Harcourt</hi> was tall, but not well favoured, but of a milde and singular good disposition; <hi>Hautemont</hi> was of a middle stature, neatly tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, of a sweet and amiable countenance, but by nature hasty and head-strong; <hi>Harcourt</hi> had a light Aubrnn beard, which (like a Countrey Gentleman) he wore negligently after the Ovall cut; <hi>Hautemont</hi> had a coale blacke beard, which (Courtier-like) he wore in forme of an invaled Pyramides; <hi>Harcourt</hi> was thirty two yeares of age, very chaste and honest; <hi>Hautemont</hi> was twenty five, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times given to women, and ready to bee deboshed and drawne away by any; though but of an indifferent quality and complexion. To <hi>Harcourt</hi> (the eldest son) their father gave his chiefest Mannor house, with eight hundred Crownes of yearely Revenew, and all his Goods and Chattels. To <hi>Hautemont</hi> (his second son) he gave his second Mannor house, worth foure hundred Crownes yearely, and fifteene hundred Crownes in his purse, by his Testament: Estates, which though it came short of their bloud, yet it exceeded that of most of the Gentlemen their neighbours, and is held in <hi>France</hi> at least the double, if not the triple of as much here with us in <hi>England.</hi> So having neither the happinesse, or the care to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with any sister or other brothers, they interchangeably sweare a strict league of brotherly love and deare affection each to other, which by their Vertues and Honours they sweare shall never receive end, but with the end of their lives: They many times consult together for the conduction and improving of their Estates, which they promise to manage with more frugality than lustre, and with more solide discretion than vaine ostentation or superfluity, and not to live in <hi>Paris,</hi> or to follow the Court, but to build up their residence in the Countrey. To which end they cut off many unprofitable mouths, both of servants, horses, and hounds, which their father kept. They likewise vow each to other to bee wonderfull charie and carefull in their mariages, as well fore-seeing and knowing it to be the greatest part of their earthly felicity or misery. So here we may see and observe many faire promises, rich designes and resolutions, and many sweet covenants voluntarily drawne up betweene these two brothers, which if they make good and performe, no doubt but the end thereof will bee successefull and prosperous unto them, or if otherwise, the contrary.</p>
                     <p>But before I wade farther in the streame and current of this History, I must first declare, that by the death of <hi>Vimory</hi> the father, and by the custome of <hi>France,</hi> we must now wholly abandon and take away the title of <hi>Hautemont</hi> from the second brother, futurely to give him that of <hi>Harcourt</hi> the eldest, and that from <hi>Harcourt</hi> the eldest, to give him that of <hi>Vimory</hi> their father, for (by the right and vertue of the premised reasons) these are now become their proper names and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations, which the Reader is prayed to observe and remember.</p>
                     <p>A yeare and halfe is not fully expired and past away since their father past from Earth to Heaven, but the eldest brother <hi>Monseiur De Vimory</hi> being extreamly ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and covetous of wealth, and understanding that a rich Counsellour of the Court of Parliament of <hi>Dijon,</hi> named <hi>Monseiur De Basigni</hi> was dead, and had left a very rich widow, (of some forty yeares of age) named <hi>Madamoyselle Masserina,</hi> he earnestly seekes her in marriage.

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:16653:182"/>
to <hi>Cupids</hi> lascivious Altars and Shrines. <hi>Harcourt</hi> is very averse and bitter against this match for his brother. They have many serious consultations hereon: Hee alleageth him the inequality of her age and birth in comparison of his, her corpulency, the ill getting of her Husbands goods, who was held a corrupt Lawyer, and (as the voyce of the world went) who gained his wealth by the teares and curses of many of his ruined and decayed Clients; and when he saw that nothing would prevaile to disswade his brother from her, he rounds him in his eare, that it was spoken and bruted in <hi>Diion,</hi> that she was not as chaste as rich, nor so continent as covetous; <hi>Vimory</hi> is all enraged hereat, and chargeth <hi>Harcourt</hi> his brother to name the reporters of this foule scandall vomited forth (quoth he) against the vertues and honour of chaste <hi>Masserina; Harcourt</hi> replies, that hee speakes it wholly upon fame, no way upon knowledge, much lesse upon beleefe; so <hi>Vimory</hi> being wilfully deafe to his brothers advice and requests, (and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Masserina's</hi> wealth to her honesty) hee marries her. But shee is so wise for her selfe, as first (both by promise and contract) shee ties him to this condition; that he shall receive all her rents, which are some twelve hundred Crownes <hi>per Annum,</hi> she to put her ready money to Use into whose hands she pleaseth, and he also to have the one halfe of the interest money, but the principall still to remaine in her owne right, propriety, and possession, and as well in her life as death, to be wholly at her owne disposing.</p>
                     <p>Not long after <hi>Harcourt</hi> being at a great wedding (of a Gentleman his Cousin Germaine) at the City of <hi>Troyes</hi> (in <hi>Champagne)</hi> he there at the balles (or publike dancing) espies a most sweet and beautifull young Gentlewoman, whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently fancieth and affects for his wife: He enquires what shee is, and findes her to be named <hi>Madamoyselle La Precoverte,</hi> daughter to an aged Gentleman of that City, tearmed <hi>Monseiur de la Vaquery. Harcourt</hi> courts the daughter, seeks the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, finds the first willing, and the second desirous; but at last he plainly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly informes <hi>Harcourt,</hi> that his daughters chiefest wealth, are her vertues and beautie; that he hath not much land, and lesse mony; that hee hath two great suits of Law for store of Lands depending in the Parliament of <hi>Diion,</hi> which promise him store of money, and that he will futurely impart a great part thereof to him, if he will marrie his daughter, the which (for the present) he tels him, he is content to make good &amp; confirme to him both by bond &amp; contract. <hi>Harcourt</hi> loves his faire young Mistresse <hi>La Precoverte</hi> so tenderly and dearly, as he is ready to espouse her on those tearmes, but he will first acquaint his brother <hi>Vimory</hi> therewith, and take his advice therein. <hi>Vimory</hi> informes his brother <hi>Harcourt,</hi> that he knowes <hi>Monseiur De Vaquery,</hi> of <hi>Troyes,</hi> to be a very poore Gentleman, that most of his lands are morgaged out, and in great danger never to be redeemed; that his law suits are as uncertaine, as the following thereof chargeable. <hi>Harcourt</hi> extols the beauty of <hi>La Precoverte</hi> to him to the skie; <hi>Vimory</hi> replies, that beauty fades and withers with a small time, and that those who preferre it to wealth, are many times enforced to feed on repentance in stead of content and joy, and to looke poverty in the face in stead of prosperity. But <hi>Harcourt</hi> having deeply setled his affection on <hi>La Precoverte,</hi> he rejecteth this true and whole s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

gratious eye, a modest countenance, a pure Lillie-rose at complexion, of a milde nature, and sweet disposition, respectfully courteous to all the world, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly devout and religious towards God, as perpetually making it, her practise, delight, and glory, to consume a great part both of her time and of her selfe in prayer, and in the service of God.</p>
                     <p>And although she were formerly sought for in mariage by many as good Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen as <hi>Harcourt,</hi> yet she could fancie none, nor affect any man for her husband but himselfe. Never wife was more carefull or more desirous to please a husband than she, and as (for one whole yeare) it was her former content and joy to see him to be a provident, kinde, and loving Husband to her, so now it is her match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse griefe and calamity, to see his good nature perverted, his resolutions trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and his affections drowned in deboshed and vitious company. She leaves no sweet advice, nor courteous requests and perswasions unattempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime him from these his foule vices of drunkennesse, swearing, dicing, evill company, and whoredome; for of no lesse sinnes in quality, nor fewer in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, she (with extreame griefe and sorrow) sees him to be guilty: But all this will not prevaile, no nor her infinite teares and sighs which many times she spends and sheds to him both at boord and bed, yea, and sometimes on her knees, but still (with a wretched violence, and sinfull impetuosity) he goes on in his vitious courses, and ungodly life and conversation; neither caring for his health, or his estate and meanes, but wilfully neglects the first, and prodigally wastes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes the second, whereat she wonderfully grieveth and lamenteth.

Thus leaving her sorrowes, sighs and teares, to bee diminished through time, or dissipated and defaced by God, The order of our History invites and conjures me now againe to speake of this her base and deboshed Husband, who hath many beastly and bloudy parts to act herein.</p>

When taking time at advantage, as his brother and her husband <hi>Vimory</hi> were rid to <hi>Diion,</hi> he finding her in a wonderfull pleasant humour, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly disposed to be merry, when (God knowes) his owne sweet and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wife, was (according to her frequent custome) disconsolately at her prayers and booke in her owne chamber, and her doore shut to her, then, then I say, hee taking his said sister in law <hi>Masserina</hi> to a window in a private Parlor, hee there (for himselfe, or the devill for him) breaks his minde to her, and is so farre from shame, as he glories to make her acquainted with his deepe affection, &amp; lascivious suit to her: Neither doth he faile of his hopes, or they of his voluptuous desires, for he findes this his sister in law so dishonestly prepared, and so lustfully resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and disposed to grant him his desires, that sealing her affection to him with many smiles, as he did his to her with more kisses, she is so impudent, so grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, as at this his very first motion, she vowes to him she hath not the power to deny him any thing, and therefore most cheerfully and willingly gives him her heart and her selfe, and hee doth the like to her, which they mutually ratifie and confirme betweene them with many private kisses, and amarous daliances, as also with many secret protestations, and solemne oaths: But because Satan is, therefore God will not be present at this their vitious contract, and lascivious combination.</p>

Hereupon he puts himselfe againe into new and rich apparell, but yet is so base, unkinde, and ingratefull to his owne sweet and vertuous wife, that hee will give her neither gold nor new apparrell, but permits her to goe in her old.

And never were those her sweet perfections and vertues either more conspicuous and glorious in her, than now at her enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced exile, and sorrowfull banishment and departure from her Husband: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were cruelly unkinde, or unkindely cruell to her, yet knowing and considering him to be her Husband, shee therefore holds it her duty and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence still to attend and wait on him as his wife, and not, either so soone or so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to separate her selfe from him. When her eyes see, her judgement knowes, her heart doubts, and her soule feares, that then more than ever his vices wanted her prayers, and his sins her vertues &amp; presence, to seeke to rectifie and reforme them. But although she descended so low from her selfe to him in her affection and humility, as with bitter sighs and teares to cast her selfe on her knees to begge and request him, that (as by the lawes of mariage and nature, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and grace) she was obliged and bound, so that she might enjoy the content and happinesse to live and die with him, being infinitely contented, and extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desirous, as she then affirmed, (and againe and againe repeated and confirmed to him) to participate and beare her part and share, as well in his poverty as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, yet hee (as an ignoble Gentleman, and a base and vitious Husband) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wholly taken away his heart and affection from this his sweet and vertuous wife <hi>La Precoverte,</hi> and fully and absolutely given it to his lascivious sister in law <hi>Masserina,</hi> hee (I say) is so hard hearted, ingratefull and treacherous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, as (without any respect to her teares, or regard to her prayers) hee will no way permit her to live with him in St. <hi>Symplician</hi> or <hi>Sens,</hi> at his brothers, nor yet vouchsafe to bee pleased to goe and live with her to <hi>Troyes,</hi> at her fathers: But here we may observe his malice in his disdaine, and his disdaine in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice towards this deare and sweet young Gentlewoman his wife, (of whom God knowes, and the world sees, he is no way worthy) for he will grant her neither of these her two most reasonable &amp; loving requests, but indeed (rather as a devill than a man, and a tyrant than a Husband) he with thundring looks and speeches, commands her away his sight &amp; presence, without once giving her so much as one poore kisse, as he was bound in affection, or (which is yet lesse) a poore farewell at their parting, as hee was obliged both in conscience and christianity.

So if you will abandon your deboshed Sister, and come home and live with me who am thy chaste and sorrowful wife, my armes and heart shall bee as open as ever they were, both to receive and forgive you, yea, I will wholly forget what is past, and prepare my selfe to welcome you home, with a thousand Smiles and Kisses, if you will resolve and remember henceforth to love mee as much, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

                           <p>MY departure and absence hath neither wronged mine owne Husband nor abused thine, for it is my pure zeale to God, and not any lascivious lust in my selfe which drew me to this devotion to see <hi>Loretto,</hi> and him (through his goodnesse) to the resolution honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to accompany me thither, and therefore my heart defies that foule sinne of Adultery, and my soule detests that odious one of Incest, whereof I am farre more innocent than thou thinkest me guiltie.

To the Magistrates of <hi>Geneva</hi> they are firme Protestants, and as they pretended, so they then (as they constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed) intended to live and die. To <hi>La Precoverte</hi> in their Letters they are sound Roman Catholikes, and in the sublimity and singularity of their zeale tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling towards the Lady of <hi>Loreto</hi> in devotion. O wretched Christians, or indeed rather O miserable wretches, thus with your hypocrisie to think to deceive God, when therein you onely deceive your owne selves and soules. For can there be a greater misery found by us on earth, or sent us by the devill from hell, to make Religion (which of it selfe is a precious and soveraigne Antidote) to become a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall drugge, and a pernitious ingredient to poyson, not to preserve our soules, and so only to delight our earthly humours and affections, and to please our carnall desires and concupiscences? Of all sorts of men (after the Atheist and the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer) the Hypocrite is the veriest devill upon earth, and hee is so much the more wretched and execrable, in that he guilds over his speeches, life and actions with the seeming shew of piety and devotion, when God and his ulcerated conscience know, that he is nothing lesse. To be lukewarme in religion, is to bee prophane, not religious: And as wine mixt with water is neither wine nor water, so he that is of two religions is of neither. For God who is still jealous of his owne honour, and of our salvation, will not onely have our soules, but our hearts to serve him, and not only our hearts, but also our tongues to glorifie him, that is to say, all our actions, and all our affections, not a peece of our heart, but he will have our whole heart, and not an angle or corner of our soule, but our whole soule: For in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his divine worship and service, (which consists in that of our faith, and of his glory) he will not admit of any Rivall or Competitor, nor bee served in any other manner, than as he hath taught us by his sacred Word and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and instructed us by his holy Prophets, and blessed Apostles.</p>

(holding <hi>Geneva</hi> no place for them, nor they for <hi>Geneva)</hi> they trusse up baggage, and so with much secrecie leave it, and direct their course to the great and famous Citie of <hi>Lyons,</hi> (some two and twenty leagues thence) and which is the frontier Towne of <hi>France,</hi> and there they thinke to shrowd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves among that great affluence and confluence of people which inhabite and aboord there from divers parts, and they make choice to live in this frontier Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, because it is neere to <hi>Savoy,</hi> where if any danger should chance to betide or befall them, they might speedily and safely retire themselves there, and so lay hold on the law and priviledge of Nations, which is inviolable throughout all the world.

They have not beene in <hi>Lyons</hi> fifteene dayes, but there befell them an accident very worthy both of our observation, and of their remembrance, which was thus; A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the City of <hi>Tholouse</hi> named <hi>Monseiur De Blaise,</hi> having some five dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore treacherously killed his elder brother <hi>Monseiur De Barry,</hi> in the high way as they travelled together upon a quarrell which fell out betweene them, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deboshed and clandestine stollen away his said elder brother <hi>De Barry's</hi> wife from him, and conveyed and transported her away with them: There was a privie search then made in <hi>Lyons,</hi> when that same night <hi>Harcourt</hi> and <hi>Masserina</hi> were upon suspition apprehended for them, and laid in sure keeping. But the next morning before the Seneschall and Procureur Fiscall, they justified their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, by many who knew <hi>De Blaise,</hi> and so were cleared; but yet it gave them both a hot Camisado and fearfull Alarum, and left an ominous impression in their hearts and minds, whereof (for the conformity of the circumstances of this action with their owne) had they had the grace to have made good use, they had not (hereafter) made themselves so famously infamous, nor consequently this their History so prodigiously deplorable.</p>

Yea both of them make it their practise to frequent the fields often, but the Churches and streets seldome, as if their foule crime of Adultery had made them unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the communion of Gods Saints, and consequently all good company too worthy for them. He exceedingly feares his brother <hi>Vimory's</hi> silence and revenge, and she highly envieth and disdaineth her sister in law <hi>La Precovertes</hi> jelousie, and still that disgracefull word of Strumpet (which she upbraided her with, and obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to her in her Letter) strikes &amp; sincks deeply in her heart and remembrance, in such sort, that it so possesseth her thoughts with malice, and takes up her minde with choller &amp; fierce indignation, as she vowes to her selfe not thus to let it passe in silence, or to vanish and die away in oblivion, quite contrary to that which her late Letter to her sister <hi>La Precoverte</hi> promised and spake. And here it is that the devill first begins to take possession of her heart, and by degrees to seize upon her soule, and to make her wholly to forsake God. For knowing <hi>La Precoverte</hi> to be wife to her brother in law and lover <hi>Harcourt,</hi> (whom she affects a thousand times dearer than her owne Husband, yea, than her owne life) shee is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so great a beame to hereye, so sharpe a thorne to her heart, and so bitter a corrasive to her content, as shee not onely assumes bad thoughts, but bad bloud against her: For vowing that none shall share with her in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, shee forgetting her Conscience and Soule, Heaven and God, is speedily
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:16653:188"/>
resolved to cause her to be poysoned, her inraged malice being capable of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excuse or reason but this, that it is impossible she can reape any perfect feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or content in earth, till she have dispatch't and sent her to <hi>Heaven.</hi> To which end she insinuates her selfe into the acquaintance of two Apothecaries of that City, and deales with them severally and secretly to effect this hellish businesse, for the which she promised either of them a hundred crownes of the summe in hand, and as much more when they have effected it, and fifty more to defray the charge of their journey, But the devill hath made her so crafty and subtile, as she still retaines from them, the name <hi>Masserina</hi> and the place <hi>Troyes</hi> where the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dwelt; There are good, and bad men of all countryes, faculties, and professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, these two Apothecaries are as honest as she is wretched, and as religious and charitable as shee is prophane and bloody, so the one denies her request with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and choller, and the other with charity and compassion, alleaging her many pious considerations and reasons to divert and disswade her from this foule and bloody act, the execution whereof, though tacitely, yet infallibly threatneth (saies hee) no lesse than the utter subversion of her fortunes, and the ruine and confusion of her life in this world, if not likewise of her soule in that to come; So shee being hereat a little galled and stung in Conscience, to see that this great City of <hi>Lyons</hi> affoords poyson but no poysoners, to act and finish this her bloody project; The devill hath yet notwithstanding, made her so curious in her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and so industrious, and resolute in her revenge, as enquiring whether there were any Italian Empericke or Mountebancke in that City, (whom she thought might bee made fit and flexible to her bloody desires and intents) she is adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that there departed one hence some eight daies since, who is gone to reside this spring of the yeare at the Bathes at <hi>Pougges,</hi> a mile from the city of <hi>Nevers,</hi> his name being <hi>Signior Baptista Tivoly</hi> (whom I conjecture may derive his sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name from that pleasant small towne of <hi>Tivoly,</hi> some twenty small miles from Rome, wherein there are many Cardinalls, country Pallaces, or houses of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) being very skilfull in Mineralls, and in attracting the spirits and quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of divers other vegitives; Of a vaine glorious, and ambitious humour and disposition, and yet of a very poore estate and meanes, and such a one, as indeed <hi>Masserina</hi> holdes every way a fit agent and instrument for her turne and purpose.</p>

But I must proceed in this our sad and mournefull History, and rherefore with an unwilling and trembling resolution, I am enforced to declare that this limbe of the Divell <hi>Tivoly,</hi> rides away to <hi>Troyes,</hi> where he speedily and secretly makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his Empery. When understanding that <hi>Monseiur de la Vaquery</hi> is constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Citie he (with an Italian impudence and policy) soone skrewes and insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates himselfe into his Company. And as it is the vanitie of our times, and the weakenesse and imbecility of our Iudgements, (in any profession whatsoever) still to preferre and respect strangers, before our owne Countreymen, so <hi>Monseiur de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>query,</hi> hearing this Italian to devoure Latine at his pleasure, and rather to vomit than utter forth whole Catalogues of phisicall phrases which hee had stollen, not learnt from <hi>Aristotle, Galen,</hi> and <hi>Parecellsus,</hi> His ignorance beleeves him to be very learned, and therefore hee holdes him a most fit Phisitian, to cure his Daughter <hi>La Precoverte</hi> of her consumption, whereinto (as before) she was deeply and dangerou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slie fallen, by the unparalleld griefes and sorrowes which she conceived, for her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands former unkindnesse to her, but more especially, for his present absence and flight with his lascivious Sister <hi>Masserina.</hi> So (in a most unhappie hower) Her Father <hi>La Vaquery</hi> mentioneth it to <hi>Tivoly;</hi> Which (being the only occasion and opportunitie hee gaped for) he freely promiseth him his best art and skill for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and the next day goes home to his house with him, &amp; visiteth his daughter; He findes her to be weake, leane, and pale, the which serves the better for his turne, to coulour out this his bloody purpose to her. When (if there had been any humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his thoughts, any Grace in his heart, or any sparke of religion or pietie in his Soule) the very sight of this sweet, this harmelesse, this beautifull young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would have moved him to compassion, and not with hellish crueltie to resolve to poyson her. But his sinnefull heart, his seared Conscience, and his ulcerated and virulent soule had (in favour of gold) made this compact with the Divell, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee will advance, and not retire in this his infernall resolution. Hee feeles her pulse, casts her estate in an Vrinall, receives thirty Crownes of her Father for her cure, and so bidding her to be of good comfort, he administreth her two pills, three mornings following, whereof (harmelesse sweet Gentlewoman) within three dayes after, shee sodainly dyes in her bed by night; <hi>Tivoly</hi> affirming to her sorrowfull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Friends, that before hee came to her, the violency, and inveteracy of her consumption, had turned all her blood into water, and exhausted and extenuated all the radicall humours of her life, which opinion of this base and bloody Italian Mountebanke past current with the simplicitie of his beliefe and their Iudgements: So he burieth his daughter and with her his chiefest earthly delight and ioy: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three daies after that this sorrowful and lamentable tragedy was acted, This mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, this Divell incarnate <hi>Tivoly,</hi> leaves <hi>Troyes,</hi> and poasts away to <hi>Nevers,</hi> where he ravisheth <hi>Masserina's</hi> heart, with the joyfull newes and assurance of <hi>La Precover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> death and buriall, of whom he receives his other hundred and fifty Crownes, the which according to her promise shee failes not presently to pay him downe.

So having a Cordelier (or Gray) Fryer, sent him that night to pryson to prepare his soule for Heaven; Hee the next morning (according to his sentence of condemnation) is brought to his execution: Where on the Ladder, he (to free his Conscience and soule) doth constantly and sorrowfully Confesse, that hee had formerly poysoned <hi>Madamoyselle La Precoverte,</hi> daughter to <hi>Monseiur de La Vaquery</hi> of <hi>Troyes,</hi> and that he was hired to doe it by the Lady <hi>Masserina</hi> of whom at <hi>Pougges</hi> he received two hundred and fifty Crownes and a small Saphir Ring to performe it, as also fifty Crownes more, which she gave him for his charges from <hi>Nivers</hi> to <hi>Troyes,</hi> and so hee dies in the constant confession of this his foule and lamentable murder, and is hanged for his Robbery: and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy afterwards burnt for destroying and poysoning of this young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman <hi>La Precoverte,</hi> whom many Gentlemen and Ladies there present well knew, and exceedingly bewayled, for the goodnesse of her sweet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and pure beauty, as also for the excellencie of her honourable perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and religious vertues; And although the Spectators of this wretch <hi>Tivoly</hi> his death expected some speech from him, at the taking of his last fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of this world, yet (besides his former confession hee spake nothing, but mumbled out some few words to himselfe, which were not understood; And thus he lived wretchedly as he dyed miserably, giving no testimony of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition or sorrow to the World, or of any sparke of griefe, or repentance, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</p>
                     <p>Now before his body was fully consumed to ashes. This our Wretched and bloudy Gentlewoman <hi>Masserina,</hi> together with her old Lover but new Husband <hi>Harcourt,</hi> are (by order of the Judges of <hi>Sens)</hi> apprehended and taken prisoners in their owne house of <hi>Saint Simplician,</hi> as they were wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and Kissing together, without any thought of danger, muchlesse of death. They hereat looke each on other with griefe and astonishment, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Masserina,</hi> who understanding (by some of those that apprehend them.) That it was the Italian Mountebanke <hi>Tivoly,</hi> who at his execution accused her, but not her Husband <hi>Harcourt</hi> for having and causing him to poyson her Sister <hi>La Precoverte,</hi> shee then sees her selfe to bee a dead woman, and no hope left her in the world of her life, But every way a firme assurance and confidence of her death; yet seeing <hi>Tivoly</hi> dead, she resolves to stand upon her Iustification. Shee is all in teares at this her lamentable disaster, curseth the name and memory of <hi>Tivoly</hi> for ruining her, with himselfe, and now, when it is too late shee blames herselfe of indiscretion, for neglecting,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:16653:191"/>
and not dealing effectually with <hi>Tivoly</hi> in prison, to conceale this her fact and name. As for her Husband <hi>Harcourt,</hi> hee (knowing himselfe absolutely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of this murther, hee grieves not for the death of his first wife <hi>La Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverte,</hi> but now extreamely mourneth and lamenteth to thinke of this, of his second wife <hi>Masserina</hi> for, live, hee feares she cannot. He bids her yet bee of good comfort, and whispereth her secretly in her eare that hee will give all his estate and meanes to save her life, or else that he will dye with her, shee thankes him with a world of sighes and teares, and rounds him as privately in his eare with many deepe oathes and asseverations, that her tongue shall never dare to speake any one word or sillable to her Iudges, which shall tend to the prejudice of his reputation, safety or life, and so they are by their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henders separated; and then severally conveyed to the prison of <hi>Sens: Masserina</hi> is first arraigned by the Iudges, where (according to her former resolution) she (not with teares, but with high words and speeches) stands upon her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Iustification, they informe her how strongly <hi>Tivoly</hi> at his death declared shee had given him two hundred and fifty crownes, a Saphir Ring, and fifty crownes more to pay his charges at <hi>Pugges</hi> and how he at her instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in favour of this her gold poysoned <hi>La Precoverte</hi> at her father <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seiur La Vaqueris</hi> house at <hi>Troyes,</hi> She termes <hi>Tivoly</hi> witch and devill, yea worse then a thousand devils thus to accuse her fasly of this murther of her sister <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverte,</hi> whereof she vowes to God and the world, to Earth and Heaven, that she is as Innocent as that damned Italian was guilty thereof; but the Iudges (notwithstanding all these her great fumes and crackes) doe presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne her to the racke, the which as soone as shee saw and considered the sharpe nature of those exquisite torments, then God was so mercifull to her soule by his grace, though shee was not so heretofore to her body by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration of her foule sinnes, that shee would not permit her tender dainty limbes to be exposed to the misery of those cruell tortures, but then and there confesseth her selfe to bee the author of poysoning <hi>La Precoverte</hi> her sister, as <hi>Tivoly</hi> was the actor thereof, when being here by her Iudges farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded whether her last Husband <hi>Harcourt</hi> were not likewise accessary with her in poysoning of his first wife <hi>La Precoverte,</hi> shee with much assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and constancy cleeres him hereof, and is so kinde and loving to him, as shee speakes not a word to them, of his pistolling to death of her first Husband his Brother <hi>Vimorey:</hi> So for this her foule and bloudy fact of hers she is condemned to bee hanged the next morning, and for that night againe returned to prison, where shee and her sorrowfull husband, make great suit to the Iudges that they may for a short time see and speake one with the other, but it will not be graunted them: When <hi>Harcourt</hi> being as confident of his owne life, as hee was of his wifes death, makes secret proffer (by some friends of his) to the Iudges of all his lands and demaynes to save his wife, but they (resembling themselves) doe so much feare God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and honour the sacred Name of Iustice as they are deafe to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.</p>
                     <p>The next morning (according to her sentence) she is brought to the place of her execution, but (at her earnest and importunate request) so early, that very few people were present at her death, where being ascended the Ladder, she there againe cursed the name, and execrated the memory of that wretched Villaine <hi>Tivoly,</hi> and wished much prosperity and happinesse to her Husband <hi>Harcourt,</hi> when turning her eye about, and seeing a Cosen Germaine of his

                     <p>Now though <hi>Harcourt</hi> seemed outwardly very sorrowfull for this shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death of his wife <hi>Masserina,</hi> yet hee is inwardly exceeding Ioyfull, that her silence at her death, of murthering his Brother <hi>Vimory,</hi> hath preserved his life with his reputation, and his reputation with his life; Whereupon being the same day freed and acquitted by the Iudges of <hi>Sens;</hi> both of his pretended cryme, as also of his imprisonment; Hee composing his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance equally betwixt joy and sorrow, returnes to his house of <hi>Saint Sympli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> where now thinking himselfe absolutely discharged and cleered of all these his former Adulteries, as also of his late cruell murthering of his Brother; Hee within two (or at most within three moneths after his wife <hi>Masserinaes</hi> Execution casts of his mourning apparell, (which he wore for her death) and neither thinking of his soule or his conscience, or of heaven or hell, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:16653:192"/>
his murthering of his Brother <hi>Vimorye,</hi> or of the deplorable and untimely ends of his two wives, as with much vanity, and with farre more haste then discretion or consideration, he now speedilyresolves to take and marry a third. But his hopes will deceive them, because God in his sacred Iustice and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will deceive his hopes.</p>
                     <p>For, when he thinkes himselfe secure and safe, not onely from the danger, but likewise from the suspition of any fatall or disasterous accident which can possibly befall him; then, the triumphant power of Gods revenge will both suddenly and soundly surprise him. His honest man <hi>Noell,</hi> (with an observant eye, and a Conscionable, and sorrowfull heart) hath heard of <hi>La Precovertes</hi> poysoning, and of <hi>Vimories</hi> pistolling to death, and hath likewise seene the hanging both of <hi>Tivoly,</hi> and of his last Mistris <hi>Masserina.</hi> In all which severall accidents, as one way hee wondereth at the malice of Sathan: So another way hee cannot but infinitely admire and applaud the just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lords: Hee likewise knowes what his Master <hi>Harcourt</hi> is to him and hee to his master, and in the time of his service and attendance under him, what different and severall passages of businesse and secrets have past betweene them: Hee hath remarked farre more vices then vertues in his Master, whereat hee much grieveth, but hee was infinitely more enforced then desirous either to see or know them, and this againe doth exceedingly rejoyce him: Hee well knowes that fidelity is the glory of a servant, and yet it is a continuall sensible griefe to his heart, and vexation to his soule, to see that his Master serves God no better: Hee doth not desire to know things (which concerne his said Master) whereof hee is ignorant, but doth wish and pray to God that he were ignorant of many things which hee knowes, and of more which he feares; and being very often perplexed in his minde with the reluctation of these different causes, and their as different effects. Hee cannot but in the end satisfie himselfe with this resolution: That as <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> is his Earthly Master, so God is his Heavenly Master; But here betides an unexpected and unwished Accident to this <hi>Noell,</hi> which will speedily try of what temper and mettall both himselfe, his heart, his conscience and his soule is made, and what infinite disparity there is betwixt Earth and Heaven.</p>
                     <p>By the pleasure and visitation of God: Hee is suddenly taken extreame sicke of a pestilent Feaver, but not in his Master <hi>Harcourts</hi> house, but in his owne Fathers house, who dweltsome foure leagues thence at a parish cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Saint Lazare,</hi> and his Phisition yeelding him a dead man, hee as a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Roman Catholicke, takes the extreame Vnction, and then prepares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to dye: But hee is so morall, and so good a Christian, as (the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses considered) he resolves to carry his conscience pure, and his Soule white and unspotted to Heaven. Hee prayes his Father therefore, that hee will speedily ride to <hi>Sens</hi> (in whose Iurisdiction <hi>Saint Lazare</hi> was) and to pray two of the three Iudges to come over to him, for that hee hath a great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to reveale them now on his death bed, which conduceth to the glory of God, the service of the King, and the good of his owne soule. His Father accordingly rides to <hi>Sens,</hi> and brings two of those Iudges speedily with him to his Sonnes bed side, to whom (in presence of three or foure more of his Fathers neighbours) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:16653:193"/>
in mony, and forty Crownes Annuity during his life to performe it, but hee refused it, and knowing the said <hi>Mounseiur De Vimorye</hi> to bee since mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by a pistoll, hee therefore verily beleeves, that it is either his said Master, or some other for him; which is guilty of that lamentable murther, the true detection whereof he saies he leaves to God and to them, and within halfe an houre after, (yea before they were departed his Fathers house) this <hi>Noell</hi> dies.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon, these Iudges wondring at the providence of God, in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this dying man for the discovery of this lamentable murther. They speedily send away their officers who apprehend <hi>Harcourt</hi> in his owne house of <hi>Saint Simplitian,</hi> carowsing and froliking it in his best wine in Company of three or foure of his deboshed consorts and Companions, and so they bring him to <hi>Sens:</hi> Where lying in prison that night, the next morning the Iudges of that City cause him to bee arraigned before them; and Charge him with pistolling of his Brother <hi>Mounseiur De Vimorie</hi> to death, which (fortified and armed by the Devill) hee strongly and stoutly denies, they reade his man <hi>Noells</hi> dying Evidence against him, to prove it: So they adjudge him to the fiery torment of the Scarpines, for the vindication of this truth, the which hee endureth with a wonderfull fortitude and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, and still denies it: When their hearts being prompted from Heaven, and their soules from God: That hee was yet the undoubted murtherer of his Brother, they the second time adjudged him to the racke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on permitting himselfe to bee fastened, and the tormenters giving a good touch at him, God is more mercifull to his soule, then his Tortures are to his body, and so with teares in his eies, hee confesseth that it was hee which pistolled his Brother <hi>Vimorye</hi> to death, and which afterwards ranne him twice thorow the body with his Rapier: Whereupon for this bloody and unnaturall fact of his: His Iudges (without any regard to his extraction or quality) condemne him the next afternoone betweene foure and five of the clocke, to bee broken a live on the wheele at the publike place of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution: Some few Gentlemen his kinsfolke solicite his reprivall, because as yet they dispaire of his pardon, but their labours proves vaine, and they purchase no reputation in seeking it, for now all <hi>Sens</hi> and the adjacent Country cry fie on him, and on his foule and enormous Crymes of Adultery and Fratricide.</p>
                     <p>So the next day, (at the houre and place appointed) hee is brought to his execution, where a mighty concourse of people both of <hi>Sens</hi> and the adjacent Country flocke to see, this monster of nature take his last farwell of this world: Being mounted on the Scaffold, in a Tawny Sattin sute with a gold edge: Hee confesseth himselfe guilty of murthering his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Vimorye,</hi> and yet hee grieves farre more for the death of his last wife <hi>Masserina</hi> then hee doth for that of his first, <hi>La Precoverte:</hi> Hee demands forgivenesse of God, and the world for this his foule crime of Fratricide and praies all who are there present to pray to Almighty God for the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his soule, and that they become more charitable and religious, and lesse bloudy and prophane by his example: So commending his soule unto God, his body to the Earth from whence it came, and marking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe three or foure times with the signe of the Crosse, hee willingly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffers the Executioner to fasten his Legges and Armes upon the wheele, the

THe foundation of this History; is layd in the faire and famous City of <hi>Verona,</hi> (anciently a great Colony of the Romans, since a free estate of it selfe, but now dependant and subject to the Estate and Seignory of <hi>Venice)</hi> wherein their lately dwelt, an old Gentleman being a widdower, and one of the chiefest and noblest families of that City, named Seignior <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Miniata,</hi> who was rich in lands, but exceeding wealthy in money, (whereof he had put a great and remarkeable Sum in the bank of <hi>Venice)</hi> he had one only Childe, a daughter of some eighteene yeares of age, named <hi>Dona Felisanna,</hi> who was wonderfull faire, and a most lovely sweet Creature, tall and slender of stature, of yellow golden haire, and sanguine damaske Rose Complexion; Now as her beautie was every way answerable to her birth and extraction, no lesse were her singular vertues and sweet perfections to her beautie, and as wealth, beautie, and vertue concurring and meeting together, are three pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful lures and attractiue Adamants to draw the desires and affections of many Noble gentlemen to seeke her in mariage. So two of her chiefe Suitors and who cheifly flattered their hopes to enioy this sweet and pretious Jewell of nature, and who stood in best possibility to beare away her affection and her selfe, was <hi>Seignior Thomas Planeze</hi> a brave young gentleman of the neighbour citie of <hi>Mantova</hi> of a sweet presence, and proper comely feature of some twentie five yeares old, not verie rich, yet indued with competent meanes to maintaine himselfe like himselfe, but infinitly well bred and adorned and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with all those generous parts and endowments which are requisit to make the gallants of our times compleat, and the other <hi>Seignior Inan de Borlari,</hi> a verie rich Gentleman, of the same citie of <hi>Verona,</hi> a proper man of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but of personage some what crooke backed and much Camber leggd and drawing towards fortie yeares of age, but of education, conditions, and qualities so ignorant and inciuill as hee seemed to bee rather a Citizen then a Gentleman, or indeed more a clowne then a citizen, and yet otherwise of mettall and courage enough: And that we may the more apparantly see and perfectly know upon what tearmes they both stand, aswell in the opinion of the Father as the affection of the Daughter; <hi>Miniata</hi> is infinitly desirous of <hi>Borlari</hi> for his Sonne in law but not of <hi>Planeze,</hi> and <hi>Felisanna</hi> is excedingly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take <hi>Planeze</hi> for her Husband, but not <hi>Borlari;</hi> which they both perceiving, whiles <hi>Borlari</hi> intends to seeke the affection and cosent of the Father before that of the Daughter; <hi>Planeze</hi> shapes a contrary course, resolues to seeke and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that of the daughter before the Father; the regard of <hi>Borlari</hi> his wealth and of <hi>Planezes</hi> poverty with covetous <hi>Miniata</hi> like a furious stream or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Torrent beares downe all other regardes and considerations before it. But the consideration and respect of <hi>Borlari</hi> his deformed personage, and then that of <hi>Planezes</hi> sweet feature and deportment with amorous <hi>Felisanna,</hi> as a delicious charme and heart-ravishing extasy, sweepes away all other regards and respects whatsoever. The Father bids <hi>Borlari</hi> to be couragious and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and then hee shall not faile to have his daughter for his wife; But the daughter wills <hi>Planeze</hi> to be descreet and constant, and then she will not faile to take him for her Husband; <hi>Miniata</hi> to shew his love to <hi>Borlari,</hi> forbids <hi>Planeze</hi> his his house, and the company of his daughter; <hi>Felisanna</hi> to reveale her deere and fervent affection to <hi>Planeze,</hi> assureth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

with the Father publikely, no lesse, or indeed farre oftner doth <hi>Planeze</hi> privat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and whiles the first hath more cause to despaire, than reason to hope of her affection and consent to be his wife: the second hath all the reasons and causes of the world, not onely to hope but to assure himselfe thereof; But the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a little time, will shortly resolve our curiositie, whereunto these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent affections will tend, and what the event and issue will bee of these their opposite intentions and resolutions.</p>

Now to gaine this her chambermaide <hi>Radegonda</hi> to his will, that thereby with the more facility and cheerefullnesse, shee may obtaine him her Mistris, her favour and affection: Hee bribes her with silver and Gold, and many other gifts, if not too costly for his giving, yet I am sure too rich for her receiving, and in requitall thereof she with her tongue promiseth him her best power and assistance towards her Mistris, but in her heart intendes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary which is directed to betray him; He sends likewise by her to his love, and her Mistris divers curious rich presents and two Letters and prays her to take time at advantage, and so to deliver them to her from him, the which likewise shee faithfully promiseth, but yet intends nothing lesse, so she holds it rather a vertue than a vice, to keep these presents for her selfe, and to give the letters to his Corrivall <hi>Planeze,</hi> to whom (by solemne oath) she had formerly ingaged her best art and power, and her chiefest assistance.

is so furious, and their courages so inflamed each against other, as passing over their saluting ceremonies without a ceremony, they putting themselves into their shirts, doe both of them draw, and so approach each other. At their first comming up, <hi>Planeze</hi> runnes <hi>Borlari</hi> through the left thigh, and <hi>Borlari</hi> him in the right shoulder, and the sight of their scarlet bloud upon their white shirts doth rather revive than quench their courages: At their second meeting <hi>Borlari</hi> runnes <hi>Planeze</hi> into the right arme of a large and deep wound, and <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neze</hi> dies not in debt for it, but requites it with a dangerous one in the small of his belly, which went neere to prove mortall, for it fetcht much bloud from him, made him to beginne to faint and stagger, so being both of them well neere out of breath, they make a stand to breath and take the benefit of the aire, but their hearts and animosity are so great as they will not as yet desist or leave off but now begin a fresh to redouble their blowes and courages, and here they traverse their ground to gaine the advantage of the Sunne: with far more advisement and discretion then before. Now at this their third comming up, <hi>Borlari</hi> presents <hi>Planeze</hi> a furious thrust, but he very actively and nimbly wards it off him, and in exchange runnes <hi>Borlari</hi> into the necke, a little wide of his throat bole: whereat <hi>Planeze</hi> instantly closing with him, he fairely attempted to whip up his heeles, but that <hi>Borlari</hi> his strength prevented <hi>Planezes</hi> agility: when each having the other by the coller of their doublets with one hand, and their rapiers in the other, as they are striving and strugling together, God (more out of his gratious goodnesse and mercy, then of their desires and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes) is pleased that neither of them shall for this time dye. For the Earle of <hi>Lucerni</hi> riding poast (with three gentlemen in his company) from <hi>Venice</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Turin,</hi> chanced to espie and see them in the meddow, almost all covered over with sweat, bloud, and dust, when he and they leaping from their Horses, hee very honourably and charitably runnes to them and parts them; offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them his best power and a pretty parcell of his time, to end and shut up their differences in a friendly attonement and reconciliation, but so inveterate and strong (by this time) is their malice each to other, as he found it no way feaseable but impossible to effect it: So this brave and honourable Earle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himselfe, to reconduct and see them safe into the City, where privately leaving them to their future fortunes, hee againe takes horse and away. Our two Duellists having first thanked him for his noble Courtesie towards them, but otherwise they are exceedingly grieved to see the victory puld out of their hands, for the vanity and impiety of either of them flattered and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their hopes with no lesse ambition and felicity, then each their owne life and either of them the death of his adversary. But as they are gratefull to the Earle of <hi>Lucerni</hi> for this his honourable courtesie towards them; yet they are so irreligious as they looke not up to Heaven, nor once have the Grace to thinke of God, much lesse to thanke his divine Majesty, for now so merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and so gratiously withdrawing them as it were from out the very Iawes of death; but still they retaine their malice and cherish and foment their revenge each to other, especially <hi>Borlary</hi> to <hi>Planeze,</hi> for it is a Continuall private griefe and a secret Corrasive to his content and minde, to see that hee is inforced to weare the willow Garland, and that <hi>Planeze</hi> must beare away his faire and beautifull Mistres <hi>Felisanna</hi> from him: But we will for a little time, leave them to their thoughts and their thoughts to God, and so againe speake of <hi>Romeo,</hi> the Laquey of <hi>Borlari,</hi> who as a wretched and most execrable villane comes now to act a bloody and wofull part in this History.</p>

For we must here understand, that this lewd Laquey <hi>Romeo,</hi> is so extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incensed with Choller and inraged with malice against the Lady <hi>Felisanna</hi> for the losse of his eare, as (being seduced and encouraged by the Devill) hee was once of the minde to have murthered her in the street, the very first time he had met or seene her: but then againe respecting his master <hi>Borlari,</hi> whom he knew affected her tenderly and deerely, hee forsooke that opinion of his, and resolved to wreake his wrath and indignation upon her-three ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who were the Actors of cutting off his eare, as he was the Author therof: But then againe remembring that he knew them not, nor any of them for that they were all purposely masked and disguised, He then swaps a bargaine with the devill, and the devill with him, that the storme of this his malice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge should assuredly fall on <hi>Radegonda</hi> her Chambermaid, from whom it ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally proceeded, and from this resolution hee is so execrably prophane and bloudy, as he vowes that neither Heaven or Earth God or man shall divert him.</p>

The Souldiours of the Castle sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him to bee the murtherer, they send a boat after him and apprehend him: so by the criminall Iudges he is committed to prison for that night, and being the next morning accused by <hi>Seignior Miniata</hi> by way of torture, and by the Lady <hi>Felisanna</hi> his daughter by legall order for the murthering of her Chambermaid <hi>Radegonda,</hi> he without any thought of feare, or shew of sorrow or repentance, freely confesseth it, for the which he is presently condemned to bee hanged, and the same day after dinner hee was accordingly dispatched and executed, notwistanding that his master <hi>Borlari,</hi> used his best friends and power, yea and proffered two hundred zechines to save him. Thus wee see there was but one poore night betweene <hi>Romeoes</hi> taking away of <hi>Radegondaes</hi> life, and losing of his owne, and betweene her murthering and his hanging; At his execution hee spake not a word either of the losse of his eare by the Lady <hi>Felisanna,</hi> or of that of <hi>Radegondaes</hi> haire by his master <hi>Borlari,</hi> whereat both of them exceedingly rejoyce and no lesse doth <hi>Planeze:</hi> But for the other spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which this bloudy footman delivered on the ladder at this execution they

                     <p>And here to leave the dead Servant <hi>Romeo,</hi> returne wee againe to speake of his living Master <hi>Borlari:</hi> who after he had spent much time and labour, and as I may say ran his invention and wit out of breath, to seeke to prevent that <hi>Planeze</hi> mought not marry the fayre <hi>Felisanna,</hi> hath notwithstanding, to his matchlesse griefe, and unseparable sorrow sees that it is al bootlesse and in vaine for by this time she through the importunity of her teares and prayers hath obtained her father <hi>Miniataes</hi> consent, to take and enjoy <hi>Seignior Planeze,</hi> for her Husband: when to both their hearts delight and content, they are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely married in <hi>Verona,</hi> and in that height of pompe and bravery as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to their noble ranke and quality: When <hi>Planeze</hi> the more to please his new wife leaves <hi>Mantova,</hi> and wholly builds up his residence in <hi>Verona</hi> with her and in her father <hi>Miniataes</hi> house, who never hated him so much heretofore, as now he deepely affects and loves him, and to say and write the truth, hee well deserved that affection of the father, and this love of the daughter: sith the lustre and vertue of his actions made it apparant to all <hi>Verona,</hi> yea to all <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> that hee proved a most kinde and loving Husband to the one, and a most obedient, and respective sonne in law to the other.</p>

To which end his affection or rather his folly, giving no truce to his thoughts, nor peace to his minde, because both the one and the other were still ranging and ruminating on <hi>Felisannaes</hi> sweet Idea, and delitious feature, Hee enters into a consideration and consultation with himselfe, whether hee should bewray his amorous flame to her by himselfe or by some other, or either by his penne or his tongue, when after hee had proposed and exchanged many poore reasons and triviall Motives <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> hee at last resolves on the last, which is to doe it by letters, when hying himselfe to his closet, he traceth her these lines, which by a confident friend of his he forth with sends her.</p>

And although he had farre more reason to rest assured than doubtfull, that this second Duell of theirs would not prove so fortunate as their first, but would rather terminate in one, if not in both of their lives. He yet loves <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisanna</hi> so dearly, albeit she hate him extreamly, that he will by no meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to fight with her husband once againe for her sake, yea and to kill him for his owne, if possible he can, the devill making him strong in the vanitie of this beleefe and confidence; that if it prove now his good fortune to kill <hi>Plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But this is to write upon the water, and to build Castles of vaine hopes in the ayre, which the least breath of Gods mouth, or wind of his nostrils will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily reverse and blow away. For this is to consult and resolve with Satan and not with God; and therefore no marvell if he see his lascivious desires to come too short of his ridiculous hopes, and both his hopes and desires herein to end in as much true misery, as they beganne in false hope of felicity and joy.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Borlari</hi> having made a turne or two in his Garden to resolve upon this businesse which so much imported both his honour and life: Hee at last with joy in his lookes, and courage in his countenance turnes to <hi>Planeze</hi> his Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:16653:202"/>
and felicity. But her husband <hi>Planeze</hi> beares this businesse, and these his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions so secretly from his wife, as it was impossible for her to have any suspition, much lesse knowledge of this his next dayes intended Duell.</p>
                     <p>The night which brings rest to others, hath not power to give it to our two inflamed Duelists. For the consideration of their honours and their lives, of their quarrell, and the cause thereof, doth equally possesse their braines, and pre-occupate and prevent their eyes of their sleeping faculties. So preferring their danger to their safety, their resolution to their rest, and the field to their beds, they (under other pretexts) are not long from it, I meane from the City ditch, the prefixed place of their rendezvous: Which <hi>Planeze</hi> first entreth, and there makes halfe a dozen of turnes, before hee have any newes of his Contendant or Adversary <hi>Borlary,</hi> whereof he doth not a little muse, yet he no way despaires of his comming, because (by late experience) he knowes him to be couragious and valiant. But to put <hi>Planezes</hi> musing out of doubt, and his doubt out of question, in comes <hi>Borlari</hi> all unbraced and untrussed, and a farre off espying <hi>Planeze</hi> in the Ditch before him: He (ashamed of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he had because of long stay) with his hat in his hand prayes him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse this errour of his, affirmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>At their first meeting <hi>Borlary</hi> give <hi>Planeze</hi> a wound in the right arme, and <hi>Planeze</hi> requites him with another in his right side, which if his Rapier had not met with a rib, it had the undoubtedly ended the quarrell with his life. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it make him lose much bloud, yet he hath strength &amp; courage enough not to die in his debt for it, onely he desireth <hi>Planeze</hi> that they may breathe a little, the which he generously granteth. At their second comming up, <hi>Planeze</hi> presents a thrust to <hi>Borlari,</hi> but he wards it, and runnes <hi>Planeze</hi> into his left thigh, of a deepe wound, and yet they will not give over, although their Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ves a faire thrust to <hi>Planezes</hi> brest, but he very dexterously and fortunately wards it, beating downe the point of <hi>Borlary</hi> his sword into the ground, and then with much agility leaps to him, and whips up his heeles, who falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne Rapier, breaks it in two peeces, at which unlooked for disaster, <hi>Borlary</hi> seeing his naked brest exposed to <hi>Planezes</hi> bloudy Rapier, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his life to lie at his mercy, (without once striving or endevouring to grapple with his enemie) he (more desirous to live with shame, than to die with honour) descends so farre from true and noble generosity, as hee begs his life of <hi>Planeze;</hi> when (although many hot and jealous spirits would gladly have taken hold of this advantage, and wreaked the utmost of their gall and spleene upon the misfortune of this accident) yet <hi>Planeze</hi> is so truly noble and generous, as disdaining to fight with an unarmed man, and so to eclipse or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish the lustre of his reputation in killing him who begged his life of him, and when it lay at his pleasure to give or take it, as he throwes away his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, making him promise and sweare hee will never henceforth attempt against the honour of his wife, <hi>Planeze</hi> very freely and cheerfully gives him
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:16653:203"/>
his life: And to shew himselfe the more generous in this his courtesie, hee lends him his hand to raise him up on his feet; for which infinite kindnesse <hi>Borlary</hi> yeelds him many thanks: When muffling up their faces with their cloaks, they part very good friends, and so get themselves into two of the nearest houses of the Suburbs, very secretly and silently to dresse their wounds, and at night they returne to their houses: Where our deare and faire <hi>Felisanna</hi> understanding the manner and cause of this combate betwixt her husband and <hi>Borlary,</hi> it is impossible for me to define whether she wept and sighed more for the losse of her husbands bloud, or rejoyced and praised God for the saving and sparing of his life.</p>
                     <p>Yet this Combat of theirs is not so secretly acted, but in lesse than two dayes all <hi>Verona</hi> hath newes, and prattles thereof. When measuring the first Duell of <hi>Planeze</hi> and <hi>Borlari</hi> by the second, and the second by the first. They extoll <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> his courage to fight with <hi>Planeze,</hi> but infinitely applaud the noble courtesie and generosity of <hi>Planeze,</hi> in giving <hi>Borlari</hi> his life when it lay in his power and pleasure to have taken it from him. And as most commended the Lady <hi>Felisanna</hi> for disdaining to make shipwracke of her honour on the <hi>Cylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis</hi> of <hi>Borlaries</hi> lust, and for not sacrificing her chastity to his lascivious affections and desires; So, in generall all Gentlemen and Ladies condemne her of indiscretion in shewing his Letters to her husband, and in acquainting him with his suits and desires, it having beene sufficient for her secretly to have given him the repulse and deniall, and herselfe the glory. Againe, there want not divers, especially the younger sort of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Verona,</hi> who tax <hi>Borlari</hi> of Cowardize, in shamefully begging his life of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neze,</hi> when either his good fortune in struggling, or his peece of sword in his defence, might peradventure have preserved it. Thus every one speakes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne fancies and affections.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Borlary</hi> having lost so much bloud for the affection which he bore to <hi>Felisan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and recived and reaped nothing from her but disdaine and hatred, hee is not a little grieved and vexed hereat. But when he understands that hee hath now made himselfe the laughture of all <hi>Verona,</hi> in this his cowardly begging his life of <hi>Planeze,</hi> and that his reputation doth therefore universally suffer in this action, he is then as it were pierced to the heart with sorrow, and to the soule with shame. He knowes it were far better for him to be borne a Clowne, than to be held and esteemed a Coward; and that having once purchased that base title, he shall difficultly ever lose. Yea, wheresoever he goes hee heares and sees that his Superiours, his Equals, and his Inferiours, not onely prattle at his shame, but point at his infamy herein, so that he is (in a manner) a shame to all Gentlemen, and therefore almost a shame to himselfe. But see here the vanitie and impiety of this inconsiderate Gentleman, and if it be not worthy the Readers curiosities, yet it will deserve his compassion and pity, to see what use, or rather what abuse he makes of this his imaginary dishonour: For neither with reason, which is the soule of his heart, nor with Religion which is the life of his soule, doth he once looke up to Heaven to thanke God for so mercifully protecting, and so miraculously preserving of his life in these two Duels, when he as it were stood on the brinke, and in the very jawes ofdeath and when betwixt his life and his death there was nothing but the point of <hi>Planezes</hi> Rapier, and of his pleasure. No, no, <hi>Borlary</hi> is too much a man, to be so much a Christian, and too much the member of Satan, to bee so much the childe of God: For having formerly given up his heart to the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:16653:203"/>
turpitude of lascivious desires and lust; now as a limbe and agent of the devill he will wholly abandon it to infernall rage and hellish revenge, sor knowing <hi>Planeze</hi> to be both the author and object of his dishonour, and the instrument and cause of his disgrace, hee therefore retaines this diabolicall and bloody A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorisme in his heart, that as long as he lives it will live with him, and when he dies will die with him, and therefore to refetch his honour out of his infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, his heart wholly sacrificing to malice, and his thoughts and resolutions to revenge) he most ingratefully and desperately resolves to murther <hi>Planeze,</hi> or at least to cause him to be murthered. Lo here the wofull estate, and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched resolution of this execrable Gentleman <hi>Borlari,</hi> and what a monstrous ingratitude and prodigious cruelty is this in him to conspire his death, of whom (in a manner) he but rightly now received his life, he little knowes, or (which is worse) hee will not know, that revenge still proves as pernitious as pleasing to their authors, and that murther endeth in as much true misery as it beginnes in false content and Ioy; for it is a better Oblation, and an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sacrifice to the Lord, who is the God of peace, and the father of all vnity and charity.</p>
                     <p>But the devill is so familiar a guest, and so frequent a counsellor to <hi>Borlari</hi> that he wretchedly vowes and execrably sweares that <hi>Planeze</hi> shall no longer live but dye. Once he was of opinion either to pistoll or poniard him in the street by night, but then againe seeing the eminencie of that danger in the misfortune of his Laquey <hi>Romeo,</hi> he rejects it as ruinous, and resolves on poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which hee thinkes is the shortest, and safest way for him to send him for Heaven, and thinkes none so fit for his purpose to give and administer it to him as <hi>Planezes</hi> owne Apothecary <hi>Castruchio,</hi> being the more confident in this his choice, because he knowes him to be a wonderfull poore man, and withall extreamely vitious and debaushed, as neither fearing nor caring for God, but more an Atheist than a Christian, and more a devill then a catholike, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beleeves that a little mony will act wonders in his heart and resolution; Neither doth he faile in his judgement, or deceive himselfe in the hopes of his choyse, for he no sooner proffereth him three hundred Dukatons, to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>Planeze</hi> (one halfe in hand, and the other when it is performed) but he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts thereof, ingageth himselfe (by hand and oath) speedily to dispatch and finish it, and so like two Factors or furies of Hell, both of them sweare secresie each to other herein.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>This wretched Apothecary <hi>Castruchio,</hi> having received his other hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dukatons of <hi>Borlari</hi> (as we have formerly understood) for minishing this bloody businesse, and being (as wee know) of a most vitious and debaushed life, hee had already in his riots and prodigalities spent and consumed all his estate: And now this three hundred Dukatons which received of <hi>Borlari</hi> for performing this bloudy businesse, makes him by many degrees farre worse then he was before, for (as by Gods sacred and secret providence) it was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssible to prosper with him, so his prophane vices and sinnes and his beastly pleasures and prodigalities made it consume and melt away as snow against the Sunne, in such sort that it seemed to him that he was a thiefe to himselfe and that one of his hands and pockets hourely cozened and betrayed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And although for a time he bore this his vitious course of life very close and secret from the eye and knowledge of the world, whereby his credit farre exceeded his estate, soafter the committing of this foule murther, both his Estate, credit, and all went to wracke and spoyle, for hee left nothing either unspent or unpawned, and which is yet worse he fell into many arrerages and debts which at last grew so clamorous (especially when his prodigall and and beastly life of whoring, drunkennesse, and dicing, came to be divulged and spred to the world; that by three of his greatest creditors he is arrested and clapt into prison, and his shoppe seized on by them, which they finde as emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of drugges, as his masters heart was of pitty and his soule of piety: And as it is the nature and (or rather the misery) of prisons that where one man vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously improves his life and actions their, a hundred doe vitiously ruine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, so <hi>Castruchio</hi> being one of this last number, he there wasteth and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all that he hath, or which he can possibly procure, and in a few weeke reduceth himselfe to soe extreame poverty and beggery, that he is clapt into the common goale among the poorest sort of prisoners who live by the alm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And so often doth <hi>Castru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio</hi> send the boy <hi>Bernardo</hi> to <hi>Borlari</hi> for money, that at last being weary thereof, and resolute to depart with no more money, (God here makes his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse partly the meanes to chaulke out a way to his owne confusion) and is resolved neither to speake nor to see <hi>Bernardo,</hi> and to that effect gives order to his servants: When little <hi>Bernardo</hi> seeing that he weares out his time, and his shooes in vaine to hunt after <hi>Borlari,</hi> whom he knowes will not be spoken with by him, he tels <hi>Castruchio</hi> that he provide himselfe of another messenger towards <hi>Borlari</hi> for he will goe no more to him, because he sees it is wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for him to speak with him: and at this discourtesie of <hi>Borlari, Castruchio</hi> doth now bite his lip with discontent and hung his head for anger, and from henceforth he begins to assume badbloud, and to conceive dangerous thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But <hi>Miniata</hi> seeing and knowing that it was the immediate finger of God which thus strangely had revealed this murther of his sonne in Law <hi>Planeze,</hi> he calls in two Gentlewomen his next neighbours to comfort his daughter <hi>Felisanna,</hi> and so leaving <hi>Dorilla</hi> to the

guard of two of his servants, he (with two other Gentlemen his neighbours) takes his Coach, and having <hi>Castruchio's</hi> Letter in his hand, he drives away to the State-house, where he findes out the Podestate and Prefect of the Citie, and shewing them the Letter which revealed the poysoning and poysoners of <hi>Planeze</hi> his sonne in Law, they (in honour to justice, and out of their respect to the sorrowfull Lady his daughter) take their Coaches, and returne with <hi>Miniata</hi> home to his house: Where they first examine <hi>Felisanna,</hi> and then <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla,</hi> who is constant in her first deposition. Whereat these grave and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Personages, wondring and admiring that a Gentleman of <hi>Barlari</hi> his ranke and quality, should make himselfe the guilty and bloudy Authour of so foule a Murther, they likwise admiring and blessing Gods providence in the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereof) doe presently send away their Isbieres (or Serjeants) to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <hi>Borlari,</hi> and so they goe to their Forum (or seat of Iustice) and speedily send away for <hi>Castruchio</hi> to be brought from the prison before them: Who at the very first newes of their accusation of him, and the producing of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Borlari,</hi> he curseth the person and name of this old Bawd <hi>Dorilla,</hi> who is the prime Authour of his overthrow and death, and then confesseth himselfe to be the Actor, and <hi>Seignior Borlari</hi> to be the Authour, cause, and Instigator of this his poysoning of <hi>Planeze;</hi> but never puts his hand on his conscience and soule, that the strange detection of this lamentable murther came directly from Heaven, and from God.</p>
                     <p>The Serjeants (by order from the Podestate and Prefect) finde <hi>Borlari</hi> in his owne house, ruffling in a new rich suit of apparrell, of blacke Sattin, trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with gold buttons, which he that day put on, and the next was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ride to the City of <hi>Bergamo,</hi> to seeke in marriage a very rich young wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, whose Husband lately died, drowning himselfe (as it were) in pleasure and security, without so much as once thinking of his poysoning of <hi>Planeze,</hi> or how he was revealed to be the Authour thereof by <hi>Castruchio</hi> his Letter, sent unto him by <hi>Dorilla;</hi> He is amazed and astonished at this his apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, now beating his brest, and then repenting (when it was too late) that ever he embrewed his hands in the innocent bloud of <hi>Planeze.</hi> So both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and <hi>Castruchio</hi> are brought to the State house, where the Podestate and Prefect first examine them a part, and then confront them each with other. Where finding that neither of them deny, but both of them to confesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves guilty of this foule murther, they pronounce sentence of death against them, and condemne <hi>Borlary</hi> to have his head cut off, and then his body to be burnt; and <hi>Castruchio</hi> to be hanged, and his body to be throwne into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Addice,</hi> whereon he was first taken, the which the next morning was accordingly executed. All <hi>Verona</hi> is as it were but one tongue to talke and prattle of this foule and lamentable murther, and especially of Gods miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous detection thereof by this drunken Bawd <hi>Dorilla,</hi> who having heretofore often brought <hi>Castruchio</hi> to whores willingly, now at last she brings him to the gallowes against her will. The morning they are brought to their execution, where there flocke and resort a world of spectators from all parts of the City. And although the charity of their Judges send them Priests and Fryers to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their soules for heaven, yet this miserable wretch <hi>Castruchio,</hi> seeming no way repentant or sorrowfull for this his foule fact, uttered a short prayer to himselfe, and so caused the top-man to turne him over, which he did, and within two houres after his body was throwne into the River. But for <hi>Borlary</hi> he came to the scaffold better resolved and prepared; for with griefe in his
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:16653:206"/>
lookes, and teares in his eyes, hee there delivered this short and religious speech:</p>
                     <p>That he grieved in heart, and was sorrowfull in soule, for this lamentable murther of his committed on the person of <hi>Planeze,</hi> as also for seducing of <hi>Castruchio</hi> to effect it by poyson, for whose death he affirmed he was likewise exceedingly afflicted and sorrowfull: That it was the temptations of the flesh and the devill, who first drew him lustfully to affect the faire, chaste, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Lady <hi>Felisanna,</hi> and consequently to murther her husband, in full hope afterwards to obtaine her for his Wife, or for his Curtesan: That he was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely sorrowfull for all these his enormous crimes, for the which he religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously asked forgivenesse, first of God, and then of the Lady <hi>Felisanna,</hi> and likewise prayed all those who were there present, to pray unto God for his soule; that he was more carefull of his reputation towards men, than of his salvation towards God, and that his neglect of prayer, and of the participation of the blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist, was the originall cause of this his misery. So againe commending himselfe to the prayers, and recommending his sinfull, yet sorrowfull soule into the hands of his Redeemer, the sword of the Executioner at one blow made a perpetuall divorce betweene his soule and his body, which pious and Christian speech of his was as great a consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the vertuous, as his death, as that of <hi>Castruchio</hi> was a terrour to the vitious spectators and Auditors: So to confirme the sentence, the dead body of <hi>Borlary</hi> is presently burnt.</p>
                     <p>And thus was the bloudy lives and deserved deaths of these three irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unfortunate persons; Of <hi>Romeo</hi> the Laquey: Of <hi>Borlary</hi> the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and of <hi>Castruchio</hi> the Apothecary. And in this manner did the justice of the Lord of Hosts (in due time) justly triumph o're their execrable crimes, in their sharp punishments, and shamefull ends. Pray we that we may reade this their History with feare, and as religious and godly Christians remember these their lamentable Murthers with horror and detestation.</p>

Now to lay this History upon its proper seat, and naturall foundation, we must understand that there was a very rich Counsellour of the Presidiall Court of <hi>Chartres,</hi> named <hi>Monsieur De Rosaire,</hi> whose wife being dead, left him no other childe, but one faire young daughter, of the age of some eighteene yeares, named <hi>Madamoyselle De Blancheville,</hi> very tall and slender of stature, and of a wanne and pale complexion, and a Coale-blacke haire and eyes browes, and of deportment and gesture infinitely proud, coy, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious, to whom at one time both these our two Gentlemen, <hi>Champigny</hi> and <hi>Beaumarys</hi> were importunate Sutors, and passionate Rivals to marry her, in so much as the one of them could difficultly be absent from the fathers house, and daughters company, but the other was present, which engendred some malice, but more emulation betweene them. But in the end, (after a whole yeares research and more) as the Willow was destined and reserved for <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marays,</hi> so was the Laurell for <hi>Champigny;</hi> for to his joy, <hi>Blanchevilles</hi> desire, and her fathers content, he marries her. Whereat <hi>Beaumarays</hi> knowing his birth to be more Noble, and his breeding farre more generous than that of <hi>Champigny,</hi> (though not in outward shew, yet in inward sense) was extreamly discontented and sorrowfull, but to remedy it he could not.</p>
                     <p>In such and the like refusing accidents, discretion is ever farre better than passion, and contempt than care. But <hi>Beaumarays</hi> cannot or at least will not be of this temper. He forsakes reason to flie to choller, and so loseth his reall and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid judgement, in the Labyrinth of her imaginary beauty. For being at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in company of some five or six Gentlemen, where mention was made of <hi>Blancheville,</hi> hee transported with malice and revenge towards her, forgate himselfe so farre, as (between iest and earnest) to let fall these indiscreet and rash words, <hi>That she was more disdainfull than chaste:</hi> a speech which hee shall have time enough both to remember and repent. The honour of Ladies and Gentlewomen ought still to be deare and precious to all Gentlemen of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, because their losse thereof can seldome be repaired, but never so well or so fully recovered, but that there still remaines some staine or blemish thereof. This undeserved scandall of <hi>Beaumarays</hi> to his quondam Mistresse <hi>Blancheville,</hi> fals not to the ground, for the iniquity of our times, and the depravation of our manners are such, as there are few companies without a Foole or a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to their friends, and some are accompanied with with both. <hi>Monsieur Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Chartres</hi> (more vaine than honest) will make himselfe one of this last number, for he being ambitiously desirous to skrew himselfe into
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:16653:208"/>
the favour and familiarity of <hi>Blancheville,</hi> (whom from her infancie he affected and loved) reports and tels her this speech of <hi>Beaumarays,</hi> whereat she is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly incensed and exasperated: But for that time (as a true woman) she dissembles her malice and revenge towards him, and so rakes up the memory thereof in the embers of silence; but yet with this condition and reservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that hereafter she will take time to make it flame forth (towards him) with more violence and impetuosity.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time there fals out an unexpected and untimely difference betweene her husband and <hi>Beaumarays,</hi> whereat she is so farre from grieving, as she rejoyceth: <hi>Beaumarays</hi> quarrelleth with him for his priority and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of seats in the Church, (as being both of one Parish) as also for that he takes the holy bread first, and goes before him in all Processions, as preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it due to him by his right of extraction and propriety. <hi>Champigny</hi> is of too high a graine to yeeld that to him which he never yeelded, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore resolute to justifie his equality of birth, and consequently not to wrong his ancestors in himselfe. When seing <hi>Beaumarays</hi> passionately bent to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and preserve that which he had undertaken, he flies to Justice, and so presently puts him in suit of Law for the same, in the Presidiall Court of that Citie. <hi>Blancheville</hi> (whose pride in her selfe exceeded her birth, and whose malice and revenge towards <hi>Beaumarays</hi> at the least surmounted her discretion and reason) brings no water to quench, but oyle to inflame this quarrell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and her husband, when seeing them already entred into a deepe processe of Law; she disdaining to see her selfe thus abused, and her husband thus wronged by him, can reape no truce of her thoughts, nor they any peace of her choler, before she have written him these lines:</p>

speake with him as soone as they depart. In the interim his eyes cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from amorously gazing and ranging upon the excellencie of her blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing beauty, and upon her sweet vermillion cheeks, great rolling eyes, and flaxen haire, wherewith his heart at the very first encounter is surprized and ravished. Here <hi>Le Valley</hi> kisseth and re-kisseth <hi>Martha,</hi> and entertaines her with much prattle, and many pleasant love speeches, yea, then and there loves her so dearly, as hee vowes she shall remaine his Mistresse, and hee her servant till death. So some halfe an houre after the two Gentlemen take leave of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and then <hi>Le Valley</hi> brings <hi>Martha</hi> to him, who orderly delivers him her Mistresses Letter and message, so he wondring at the last, receives the first, leaves her in the Hall with his man <hi>Le Valley,</hi> and so steps to his study, and with much admiration, and more laughture, peruseth this Letter. Here he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth his owne indiscretion in speaking against <hi>Blanchevilles</hi> chastity, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly condemneth <hi>Marins</hi> treachery in revealing it to her.

But the Master is not so unkinde to <hi>Martha,</hi> as his man <hi>Le Valley</hi> is courteous; For he being deeply enamoured of her beauty, brings her the one halfe of her way home, and goes into a Mercers shop, buyes her a faire paire of gloves, and as the pledge of his future affection, bestowes them on her, the which (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther excuse or ceremony) she thankfully accepts, and promiseth him to weare them for his sake. <hi>Martha</hi> returning home to her Lady and Mistresse, she delivers her <hi>Beaumarays</hi> his answer <hi>verbatimas</hi> he told it her, but no Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Blancheville</hi> seeing herselfe thus wronged and sleighted of him, in that he disdaineth to give her any satisfaction, and which is worse, that he peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily refuseth, and scornes to answer her Letter: She is so strangely transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with malice and choler towards him for the same, as shee vowes to cry quittance, and to be revenged of him; but as yet she knowes not in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to performe and perpetrate it: Onely she againe resolves not as yet to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her Husband therewith, but to attend and watch for some future desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red opportunity.</p>
                     <p>Two yeares are almost past away, wherein <hi>Beaumarays</hi> and <hi>Champigny</hi> (to their great cost and charge) doe vehemently contest in Law about their Church quarrell fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And as most of the great Iudiciall Courts of <hi>France</hi> are too too frequently oppressed with Law suits of this nature, so I may affirme with as much truth as pity, that this is a fatall rocke whereon many hot contentious French spirits doe most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerately suffer shipwracke.

He cannot see <hi>Beaumarays</hi> but with envie, nor his wife heare speake of him but with infinite malice and detestation. She is all bent on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge towards him, and with her speeches and actions both day and night precipitates her husband onwards to it. And now her old grudge and malice against him beginnes a fresh to revive and flourish, and now she thinks it a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fit time and opportunity to acquaint her husband with <hi>Beaumarys</hi> his base and scandalous speeches against her honour, the which with much passion, and many teares she effects, and also shewes him the Coppy of her Letter which she sent him by her maid <hi>Martha,</hi> whereunto she informes him, he disdainfully returned her no answer but contempt and silence. <hi>Champigny</hi> is so deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed hereat against <hi>Beaumarays,</hi> as his wife needs not many words or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to induce and perswade him to revenge it on him: when presently he being as incapable of delay, as of better advise and counsell, he finds out <hi>Marin,</hi> who (more in love to <hi>Blancheville,</hi> than in hatred to <hi>Beaumarays)</hi> confirmes as much to him as he would have him affirme. Now as <hi>Blancheville</hi> thinks that her Husband <hi>Champigny</hi> will question <hi>Beaumarays</hi> by the Law of Iustice, for this his crime towards her: He (as a valiant and generous Gentleman) flies a higher pitch, and assumes a contrary resolution, to doe it by that of his sword. When having prayed, &amp; procured <hi>Marin</hi> to be his Second, and they both agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fight on horse backe, he (consulting with nature, not with grace) the very next morning by <hi>Serou</hi> his foot man, sends <hi>Beaumarays</hi> this Challenge.</p>

                     <p>Whiles thus the Marquis of <hi>Bellay</hi> is travelling towards <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Beauma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rays</hi> and his brother <hi>Montagne</hi> posting for <hi>Caen,</hi> come we briefely to <hi>Chartres</hi> which now resounds and ratles with the report and issue of this combate, where Gentlemen Cittizens and all (according to their passions and affections speake differently thereof; some condemne the vanity of <hi>Beaumarais,</hi> others the folly and treachery of <hi>Marin,</hi> but all doe highly extoll the courage and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity of <hi>Champigny</hi> and <hi>Montagne.</hi> But leave we them to their censures, and come we againe to speake of <hi>Blancheville</hi> who takes the newes of this untimely death of her husband so tenderly and sorrowfully that shee is ready to drowne

herselfe in her teares, It is not onely a griefe to her heart to see, but a terrour to her conscience to know, that her husband <hi>Champigny</hi> and her friend <hi>Marin,</hi> have both of them lost their lives for her sake, and when againe shee falls on the consideration and remembrance, that the first dyed by the hand and sword of <hi>Beaumarays,</hi> her mortall enemy, and the second by that of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Montagne,</hi> then she is againe ready to burst her heart and brest with sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereat. She is so uncapable of Counsell, as she will heate of no consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor speake of any thing but of her malice and revenge toward <hi>Beauma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rays,</hi> and to write the truth, this implacable wrath and revenge of hers to him, takes up all her thoughts and speeches, her contemplations and actions, and both her time and her selfe. To which end shee converts most of her Corne and Wine into money, goes to <hi>Paris,</hi> casts herselfe at the Kings feet, and to the feet of that great and illustrious Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> for Iustice, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Beaumarays</hi> the murtherer of her husband, the which againe and againe shee aloud resounds and ecchoes forth to their eares, yea her rage is so great and her malice so outragious towards him, that notwithstanding his body is absent, yet she spends five hundred Crownes in law to have him according to the law and custome of France to bee hanged up in <hi>effigie:</hi> But although her sute be just, yet (by reason of his great friends in Court) shee sees herselfe so unfortunate that shee cannot obtaine it. Whereupon after twelve monethes vaine stay in <hi>Paris</hi> and a profuse expence of money, shee (with much griefe and sorrow) secretly vowes to herselfe, that if ever hee returne againe to <hi>Chartres,</hi> or which is more, into France, that shee herselfe will bee both his Iudge and Executioner, by revenging her Husbands death in his, and from this hellish resolution of hers she deepely sweares, that neither Earth nor Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven shall divert her.</p>
                     <p>Now to follow the naturall streame and tyde of this History: Wee must againe bring <hi>Beaumarays</hi> and his brother <hi>Montagne</hi> on the stage thereof: For the Reader must understand, that their wounds being dressed and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured having bestowed both of their horses on the Chyrurgeon and guide, the two servants of the aforesaid Marquis of <hi>Bellay,</hi> and likewise written him a thankfull Letter for his honourable courtesie extended to them, and therewith likewise prayed him to solicite the King for their Grace and pardon in their absence, they privately (without any followers) embarque them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon an English vessell at <hi>Caen</hi> and so with a prosperous gale arrive at <hi>Rie,</hi> and from thence take Horse for <hi>London,</hi> where they settle up their aboad and residence, from whence <hi>Beaumarais</hi> sends to <hi>Chartres</hi> for two of his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and his Brother <hi>Montagne</hi> for one of his, which come over to London to them some six weekes after, and brings their masters word, how earnestly and violently their adversaries follow the rigour and severity of the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them in <hi>Paris,</hi> but especially against <hi>Beaumarays,</hi> they receive these advertisements from their servants and friends, rather with griefe then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and therefore to prevent their malice, and their owne disgrace and danger, they often write from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> to the Marquesse of <hi>Bellay,</hi> and likewise to the Bishop of <hi>Chartres</hi> (their deere friend and kinsman) to hasten their pardons from the King: So that Noble Lord, and this reverend Prelate, pitying their danger and absence, as much as they wish their safety and returne, take time at advantage, and the King in a well disposed humour, and so doe most effectually and powerfully acquaint his Majesty; how these two absent Gentlemen and brothers <hi>Beaumarays</hi> and <hi>Montagne</hi>
                        <pb n="384" facs="tcp:16653:212"/>
were without just cause or reason provoked to this unfortunate combate by their adversaries; that they were the Challenged, not the Challengers; that heretofore they had never committed any act unworthy either of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or of themselves: That for their vertues and generosity they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of all their Countrey and acquaintance: That they had formerly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many wounds in his Majesties warres; and that their valour and courage was such, that in these times, which threatned more troubles than promised peace, they would undoubtedly prove happy and necessary members for his service, with many other prevailing motives and reasons conducing that way; which at last so weigh downe the heart and minde of the King, that he freely conceded and gave them their pardons under his great Seale, the which to make the more authenticall, they caused them to be enregistred and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Court of Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and thereupon both the Marquesse and Bishop joyntly and speedily writ to them thereof from <hi>Paris.</hi> And after some five moneths of their stay in <hi>London,</hi> they send them over these their Pardons, which are delivered to them by the Earle of <hi>Tillieres,</hi> then ordinary Ambassadour there for this present French King, <hi>Lewis xiij.</hi> the which they receive with infinite honour, content, and joy.</p>
                     <p>This good newes of theirs makes them now like the aire of <hi>France</hi> better than that of England. So they speedily packe up their baggage, leave <hi>London,</hi> and with all celerity poast away <hi>Dover, Callais,</hi> and <hi>Paris.</hi> Where being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the first thing they doe, they finde out the Marquis of <hi>Bellay,</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> to whom they owe their peace, as they doe their lives to the King: To whom they expresse a thousand demonstrations of thankfulnesse for this their honour and favour shewed them. They likewise burne with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to testifie so much to the King, when the Marquis, seconded by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, present them to his Majestie, who falling to his feet, hee gives them his Royall hand to kisse. They can better expresse their thankfulnesse in deeds than words to him, and in language of their swords, than in that of their tongues: Onely they tell his Majestie, that having received their lives of his meere clemencie and Royall favour, they most humbly therefore implore him to gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>t them the favour and honour, that they may spend and end them in his service. He allowes of their zeale and humility, and to redouble his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, he gives them againe his hand to kisse, adding farther to them, that it is rather likely than impossible, that he shall shortly have occasion to use their swords and service, and so dismisseth them.</p>
                     <p>These our two brothers remaine a moneth in <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein almost daily they tender their thankfull respects and service to the Marquis and Bishop, at the end wherof leaving their duties, and receiving their commands, they take horse and returne home for <hi>Chartres,</hi> (from which by reason of their disaster they have beene so long absent) where all their kinsfolks and friends welcome them home with infinite delight and joy, yea, almost all <hi>Chartres</hi> and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen thereabouts, exceedingly rejoyce of their fortunate and safe returnes. Onely the Parents of <hi>Marin</hi> doe envie <hi>Montagne</hi> deeply, and <hi>Blancheville,</hi> the sorrowfull and incensed widdow of <hi>Champigny,</hi> hate <hi>Beaumarays</hi> deadly. As for <hi>Montagne</hi> he makes such good meanes and friends, that in lesse than two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths he obtaines a perfect reconciliation of the first; but although <hi>Beauma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rays</hi> have made many faire overtures and proffers of attonement by his friends to the second, yet in six moneths he sees it is wholly impossible for him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it of her, and which is worse, she is still so outragious and revengefull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:16653:212"/>
him, that he thinks he never shall; for shee disdaines to see him, and scornes to heare of him; and still her malice and indignation against him, makes her constant in her former hellish and bloudy resolution, that by one meanes or other she will ere long murther him, as he hath her Husband: A fearfull and most execrable resolution, every way unworthy the heart of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, and farre more the soule of a Christian.</p>
                     <p>In the former part of this History we have understood the affection of <hi>Le Valley (Beaumarays</hi> his man) to <hi>Martha, Blanchevilles</hi> Chambermaid. In the middle thereof we have remarked and seene the implacable intended malice and revenge of <hi>Blancheville</hi> towards <hi>Beaumarays:</hi> And wee shall nor goe farre before the end hereof will enforme us what mournfull fruits, and deplorable effects, these different accidents and persons will procure us.</p>
                     <p>As there is no love to that of a man, so I am of opinion, that there is no malice comparable to that of a woman, and if the truth deceive not my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein, I beleeve wee shall shortly see the Antitheses of this position made good and verified in the persons of <hi>Le Valley,</hi> and <hi>Blancheville.</hi> For whiles <hi>Le Valley</hi> is lovingly thinking and inventing all possible meanes how hee may marrie <hi>Martha;</hi> so is <hi>Blancheville</hi> malitiously pondering and ruminating with her selfe how or by what meanes or agents she may murther <hi>Beaumarays.</hi> Thus we see that the heart of the first is as full of kindnesse and courtesie, as the mind and resolutions of the second is of cruelty and bloud. Now the Reader for his better information, will I hope remember, that in all this time of two yeares and upwards, since <hi>Le Valley</hi> first saw and spake with his sweet heart <hi>Martha,</hi> in his Masters house, that there hath past many love tokens betweene them, but as yet he could never draw her consent to marry him; for still shee tels him that she loves her Mistresse so dearly, that she will not depart from her service, nor wed any man, without her free consent, and therefore that they have farre more reason to doubt than to hope of this match betweene them, considering the lamentable accident &amp; disaster which hath past between their Masters. <hi>Le Valley</hi> seeing he must first winne the Mistresse, before he can wed the maid, with his sweet hearts advise, resolves to seeke <hi>Blanchevilles</hi> consent therereto, the which hee doth in faire and orderly tearmes. <hi>Blancheville</hi> who had formerly heard an inkling how dearly <hi>Le Valley</hi> affected her maid <hi>Martha</hi> in the way of mariage, now by this his motion thereof to herselfe, she is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed thereof. When observing more passion than judgement, as well in his affection to her maid, as in his speeches to her selfe, she presently (being industrious in her malice, and vigilant in her revenge towards <hi>Beaumarays)</hi> forgets God and all goodnesse, abandoneth all Christianity and humanity, and so the devill brings her a plot, or else her owne heart and head fetcht it from hell: She thinks that this poore servant <hi>Le Valley,</hi> is a fit agent and instrument for her, either to poyson or pistoll his Master <hi>Beaumarays</hi> to death, and that his love to her maid <hi>Martha,</hi> and his consideration of her fresh youth and beauty, is a sufficient bait, and powerfull lure to make him undertake and performe it, and hereon she settles up her bloudy resolution. To which end <hi>Blancheville</hi> having already sufficiently woven this treachery in her heart, and closely and finely spunne it in her braines, shee politickly gives <hi>Le Valley</hi> more hope than despaire, that he shall shortly marrie her maid <hi>Martha;</hi> onely shee tels him shee must first conferre with her, to see how shee stands affected to him, and that if hee repaire to her againe at the end of the weeke, shee will then as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly give him such an answer, as she doubts not but will content and please
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:16653:213"/>
him, or else the fault shall be his: But to conclude her speech, shee chargeth him not to speake or utter a word hereof to his Master <hi>Beaumarays,</hi> all which <hi>Le Valley</hi> faithfully promiseth her to performe. He goes from the Mistresse to the maid, and reports what she hath told and spoken, so these young folkes flatter themselves, that they very shortly shall be man and wife. <hi>Blancheville</hi> (whose heart and minde runnes wholly upon a bloudy revenge towards <hi>Beaumarays)</hi> no sooner understands that <hi>Le Valley</hi> is gone forth her doores, but she sends for her maid <hi>Martha</hi> into her chamber, where (no way acquainting her with her bloudy intent and policie) she chargeth her to sweare that she will never mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <hi>Le Valley</hi> without her free consent, and that in the end she shall not repent the following of her advise and counsell herein, which <hi>Martha</hi> solemnly doth, whereof this malitious and vindictive Dame is exceedingly glad and satisfied. The end of the weeke being come, away comes <hi>Le Valley</hi> to his sweet heart <hi>Martha,</hi> to know if she be shortly resolved to marry him, who having beene perfectly taught her lesson, tels him plainly, that shee will be his wife, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally that he can gaine her Mistresse <hi>Blanchevelles</hi> consent thereunto, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without it. Whereof he being exceedingly joyfull, hee giving her many kisses, intreats her to bring him to her Mistresse, and that he hopes to receive pleasing newes from her, to both their contents. <hi>Blancheville</hi> (with much longing impatiencie (attends his comming, and receives and welcomes him into her Closet with a cheerfull countenance, where bolting the doore, this hellish <hi>Erinnis</hi> (not heavenly <hi>Vrania)</hi> passionately tels him, that it shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for him ever to enjoy or marrie her maid <hi>Martha,</hi> except he first sweare to her to performe a secret businesse for her, which infinitely concernes her content and service. <hi>Le Valley</hi> desires to know of her what it is, but shee first sweares him to secrecie herein, both from <hi>Martha,</hi> and from all the world, the which he freely sweares: When <hi>Blancheville</hi> (with hypocriticall, yea, with diobolicall teares in her eyes) being instructed and prompted by the devill, representeth unto him, how fouly his Master <hi>Beaumarays</hi> had first wronged her chastity and honour, then abused her husband in the Church, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards killed him in the field, and therefore that hee should not onely marry her maid <hi>Martha,</hi> but that she would likewise give him three hundred Crowns of marriage money with her, if for her sake, and at her request) he would kill his said Master, either by poyson, Ponyard, or Pistoll, of which summe shee told him he should have the one halfe in hand, and the other when hee had performed it, the which if he refused to doe, shee swore by her part of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that he should never marrie her, nor come neare her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Le Valley</hi> is amazed and astonished at this bloudy proposition and request of hers, the which she might well perceive by the distraction of his looks, and the perturbation of his countenance. He tels her, that although he loves <hi>Martha</hi> farre dearer than his life, yet hee cannot finde in his heart to kill the poorest Christian in the world, much lesse so good and so deare a Master as <hi>Beaumarays</hi> was to him. <hi>Blancheville</hi> (being now as subtill in her malice, as she was maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in her revenge towards <hi>Beaumarays)</hi> shewes <hi>Le Valley</hi> the three hundred Crownes in faire gold) which was farre more than ever before he had seene, Tels him what a deare friend she will ever remaine to him and his wife, and (in a word) leaves no lure unpractised, nor charme unattempted, to draw him to the enterprize of this deplorable, and to the execution of this hellish fact. But finding him as frozen as she was fiery therein, she bids him to take a weeks t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:16653:213"/>
to remember his oath of secrecie herein from all the world, both which points he constantly promiseth her to performe. As he descends the stairs from her, his sweet heart <hi>Martha</hi> comes presently to him to know the minde and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of her Mistresse, whom he thinks good then to satisfie with this pleasing answer, that hee hopes a small time will worke and compasse both their desires. So after a few kisses and embraces, they for that time take leave each of other. He is no sooner returned home, but his heart is as pensive and sorrowfull, as his minde and braine is perplexed and troubled for the cause thereof. He consults with himselfe, and his resolutions are as different as his desires. He cannot as yet finde in his heart to kill his Master, and yet hee can resolve rather to die than to lose <hi>Martha</hi> his Mistresse. True it is, that the sight of the Lady <hi>Blanchevilles</hi> gold doth act wonders in his hearts, but farre more the sight &amp; remembrance of <hi>Marthas</hi> sweet youth &amp; delitious beauty: So the first tempts him exceedingly, the second extreamly, and the devill in both of them infinitely; yet notwithstanding his faith and soule are so strong with God, that hitherto hee cannot consent or bee drawne to imbrue his hands in the innocent bloud of his Master. But here befals an unexpected accident, which violently precipitates and throwes him headlong on the contrary resolution.</p>
                     <p>His Master <hi>Beanmarays</hi> (not for want of any respect or love to <hi>Blancheville,</hi> but because hee perfectly knew shee extreamly hared him) having formerly charged his man <hi>Le Valley</hi> that he should not frequent her house, nor no more dare to seeke her maid <hi>Martha</hi> in mariage, the which he confidently promised him he would: He now understands that contrary thereunto, his man <hi>Le Valley</hi> the very day before was there, and continued still an earnest sutor to her; so he hereupon cals him to him, and gives him five or six sound boxes on the eare, for his disobeying him, and vowes that if he ever any more returne thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and seeke <hi>Martha</hi> in marriage, he would utterly cashier him, and wholly discharge him from his service. <hi>Le Valley</hi> not accustomed to receive blowes of his Master, was so extreamly incensed hereat, as disdaining the blowes for his Master, and his Master for the blowes sake, they engender such bad bloud in him, as he presently strikes a bargaine, first with his choller, then with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, that he would now adhere to the request of <hi>Blancheville,</hi> and so speedily returne his Master a sharp requitall and bloudy revenge for the same; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from that time forwards he never looked on him but with an eye of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and detestation. So without farther delay, the same night as soone as his Master was gone to bed, hee trips away to <hi>Blanchevilles</hi> house, informes her at large what had past betwixt his master and himselfe, and therefore assures her that he is fully and constantly resolved to murther him within three or foure dayes, if she would performe her promise to him, to give him the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crownes, and that also within a moneth after h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But the receit thereof shall cost him deare.</p>
                     <p>From the intended matter of the murther of <hi>Beaumarays,</hi> these two agents of Satan and Hell, <hi>Blancheville</hi> and <hi>Le Valley,</hi> proceed to the manner thereof, she proposeth that infernall drugge poyson, but he rejecteth it, as dangerous to be bought, and difficult to be applied.

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:16653:214"/>
death, and this is their difinitive, cruell, and hellish resolution. <hi>Le Valley</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus dispatcht his businesse with <hi>Blancheville,</hi> and taken leave with kisses of his sweet <hi>Martha,</hi> (who poore soule is as innocent, as they two are wholly and solely guilty of this deplorable conspiration) he puts a cheerfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance on his revengfull heart, so returnes home, and the very next day gets his Masters pocket pistoll, which he loads with a brace of bulletts, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every day and houre for a desired opportunity to send him to heaven. So the third day after Monsieur <hi>Montagne</hi> going abroad a hawking with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Hawks and Spannels, and taking almost all his men servants with him, and leaving <hi>Le Valley</hi> to wait and attend on his Master, then and there this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall occasion answered his prodigious expectation. For that very Fore-noone, his Master <hi>Beaumarays</hi> comming from the house of office, hee cals up <hi>Le Valley</hi> to him in his chamber to trusse his points, which wretched Villaine he is busie in performing, but alas, in most barbarous and bloudy manner: For as that good and Noble Gentleman thought of nothing lesse than of his danger or death, then this monster of nature fingering his hinde points with his left hand, very softly drew his Pistoll out his pocket with his right, and then and there (with an infernall courage and audacity) shot him into the reynes of his backe, nearly opposite to his heart, whereof he presently fell downe dead to the ground, without having either the power or happinesse to utter on prayer or word whatsoever, but onely two or three small fainting, or indeed dying groanes.</p>
                     <p>This bloudy and execrable wretch <hi>Le Valley,</hi> seeing his Master dead, he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs in his good fortune, to see what a brave Butcher he had proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in so speedily and neatly dispatching him. When to put the better varnish on his villany, and so to make it appeare to the world, that his Master was his owne murtherer, hee taketh the pistoll and placeth it in his dead right hand, layes the key of the Chamber upon the Table, and the doore having a strong Spring-locke, puls and shuts it fast after him. When againe, to make his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie the more cleare and conspicuous to the world, he speedily and secretly taking a horse out of the stable, a Hawke on his fist, and a Spanniell at his heels, and so very joyfully and cheerfully gallops away to the fields, where (after some houre at least, or houre and halfe at most) hee finds out Monsieur <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne,</hi> and tels him his Master dispatcht him to him with a fresh Hawke, which was his best and chiefest Gashawke. They Hawke all day together, and <hi>Le Valley</hi> (as accustomed) is very officious and diligent to Monsieur <hi>Montagne,</hi> who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night returnes home to <hi>Chartres,</hi> having (betweene them all) taken eight Partridges and one Phesant. Hee arrives at his brothers house, where missing him, he gives the Phesant and foure of the Partridges to the Cooke to dresse for their Supper; when afterwards againe missing his brother <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marays,</hi> and enquiring for him, the meniall servants of the out-houses tell him they saw him not to day. Supper being preparing, and the Table co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, he sends up <hi>Le Valley</hi> to looke him in his chamber, who returnes him this answer, that his Master is not there, but the doore is shut: <hi>Montagne</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velleth at his brothers long (and unaccustomed) absence, and so doe all his Servants. They finde his Cloake, Rapier and Belt, hanging up at a pinne in the Hall, and therefore deeming him not farre, but at some neighbours house, he sends <hi>Le Valley</hi> one way, and the rest of the servants to other places to finde him out; but whiles they seeke after him, <hi>Le Valle</hi> (favoured by the night) trips away speedily to the Lady <hi>Blanchevilles</hi> house, and there most briefly and
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:16653:214"/>
secretly acquaints her how bravely hee hath dispatched his Master that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, shee cannot Containe herselfe for Ioy of this sweet newes, nor expresse it to him in lesse then a Kisse, he saies he will tell her the rest to morrow night and then come and receive the remainder of her promise to him, the which she againe and againe sweares to him shee will performe it with a surplusage and advantage, so hee kisseth his sweet heart <hi>Martha,</hi> and againe dispeeds himselfe home: Where he and the rest of the servants who were sent into the streetes returne <hi>Montagne</hi> no newes of their master his brother: Supper being more then fully ready, his long missing of him doth at last bring him much doubt, and some suspition and feare of his wellfare. It runnes still in his mind that he may be yet a sleepe in his Chamber; wherfore he ascends thither with <hi>Le Valley</hi> and others of his Servants, who call a loud and bounce amaine at the doore, but they heare no answer nor speech of him, the which doth the more augment his doubt and redouble his feare of his Brother: At last he commands them to force and breake open the doore, but it being exceeding thick and strong, they cannot, <hi>Montagnes</hi> tender care of his brother doth by this time infinitely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his feare of him, which at last so powerfully surpriseth him, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently commands a Ladder to be erected to his brothers chamber window to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the garden, and sends up one of his Laqueyes with a torch to looke into the chamber, the laquey forceth open the casement, and then thrusts in his torch first, and his head after, which he speedily withdrawing very passionately cryeth out: That his master hath murthered himselfe with his pistoll, and lies there dead all gored in his bloud. <hi>Montagne</hi> at this lamentable newes teares his haires weepes and cryes out a maine for sorrow thereof and so doe all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: Among whom <hi>Le Valley</hi> is obserued to be one of the most, who weepes, and cries mightly thereat. <hi>Montagne</hi> being almost as dead with griefe and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hereat, as his Brother <hi>Beaumarays</hi> was with his wound, He bids the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quey to teare downe the casement and to enter and unlocke the doore, which he doth: So he with <hi>Le Valley</hi> and the rest of the servants ascend and enter the chamber, where to their unexpressable griefe and sorrow) they see this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and murthered personage, with the discharged pistoll fast in his hand, and the key of the chamberdoore on the table, as hath beene already expressed. Once <hi>Montagne</hi> thought that his brother might be robbed and killd by theeves, but seeing all his trunkes fast locked, and then opening his study dore, and finding all his gold, silver, and Iewels there in good order, he abandons that sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition and Iealousie and then both he and they all beleive, that he hath abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely murthered himselfe. The report of this tragicall and sorrowfull accident sounds loud in the streets of <hi>Chartres: Montagne</hi> sends for the Kings Attourny, and the Fiscall to see, and for Chirurgions to visit his dead brothers body, they all concurre and agree in opinion with <hi>Montagne</hi> and his servants, and so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally affirme and conclude: That <hi>Beaumarays</hi> hath (with his little pistoll) shot himselfe into the backe with a brace of bullets, whereof hee dyed, which is sweet musick and melody to <hi>Le Valley,</hi> but his wormewood and gall comes after. And now <hi>Montagne</hi> withall requisite order, state, and decency, solemnizeth his brothers funerals, and not onely all <hi>Chartres,</hi> but all <hi>Beausse,</hi> and all Gentlmen who knew him, yea the bishop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Bellay,</hi> and the King himselfe much lamented and bewayled the unfortunate losse of this noble, and valiant Gentleman.</p>
                     <p>The griefe and sorrow of <hi>Montagne</hi> for his Brothers untimely death, is the joy and felicity of <hi>Le Valley</hi> and <hi>Blancheville,</hi> for as he triumphes, so for her part
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:16653:215"/>
she is so extreamly delighted and ravished with this sweet newes, as at their next meeting (which is the very next night) she gives him his hundred &amp; fifty crownes, and because he hath dispatched his master <hi>Beaumarays</hi> so speedily and secretly, she therefore takes a Diamond ring off her finger (worth one hundred crownes) and likewise gives it him: When to make good her oath and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to him, (as also to make his pretented joy compleate) the very same day moneth after, marryeth him to her maid <hi>Martha.</hi> But marriages that are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and cymented with innocent bloud, never have prosperous ends. Now is <hi>Blancheville</hi> proud in her revenge for the death of her mortall enemy <hi>Beauma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rays,</hi> and now likewise is <hi>Le Valley</hi> (in his conceit and minde) rapt up into the third Heaven of joy, in injoying his faire and sweet wife <hi>Martha,</hi> and neither of them hath the conscience to thinke of, or the grace to repent this foule and bloudy fact of theirs: Which (when they least dreame thereof) wee shall see God in his sacred mercy in Iustice, will speedily detect, revenge, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, as the sequell thereof will declare and informe us.</p>
                     <p>As the matter and manner of the detection of this lamentable murther of <hi>Beaumarays</hi> proceeded primarily from God, so it did secondly from his sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full brother <hi>Montagne,</hi> who wanting all other witnesses &amp; evidence (and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guided by sacred power, and swaid by divine influence) was led to it by foure remarkeable circumstances and considerations, every way worthy of our Knowledge and retention. The first was his finding and perusing of <hi>Blanche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villes</hi> Letter to his brother <hi>Beaumarays</hi> (which formerly we have seene) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he observed a wonderfull deale of inveterate malice towards him from her; The second was <hi>Le Valleyes</hi> suddaine marrying of her chambermaid <hi>Martha,</hi> by the which he conceived that that suspition strongly reflected on her, and this on him: The third was from the sight of the Diamond Ring which <hi>Le Valley</hi> wore on his finger (being the same which wee have formerly seene <hi>Blanche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> to give him) for <hi>Montagne</hi> beleeving that hee had stolen it from his dead brother his master, he challenged him for it by order of law, when <hi>Le Valley</hi> to cleere himselfe of this predended theft, was inforced to informe both him and the Iudges, that it was given him in marriage with his wife by the Lady <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheville</hi> her Mistris, the which confession of his, indeed added much suspition and jealousie of them both to the heart and mind of <hi>Montagne,</hi> as beleeving that it must be some extraordinary tye and service which should make <hi>Le Valley</hi> capable to deserve so great a bounty and reward of her. But the fourth and last consideration was farre more powerfull and pervalent with him than all the three former to ground his suspition against <hi>Le Valley</hi> for thus murthering of his brother, and wherein the Reader may deservedly admire and wonder at the celestiall providence and justice of God, which most miraculously and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely appeares herein, for the same day two monethes after the murther of <hi>Beaumarays,</hi> and the same day moneth that <hi>Le Valley</hi> marryed his wife <hi>Martha,</hi> It pleased the Lord (in his secret pleasure and justice) to send him a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greene in his right hand, which beginning to extend and spread, his Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons to save his life, advised his said hand to bee speedily cut off, which was accordingly performed.</p>
                     <p>This sodainely cutting of <hi>Le Valleyes</hi> right hand by advise of his Chyrurgeons brings terrour to him, feare to <hi>Blancheville,</hi> and astonishment and admiration to <hi>Montagne,</hi> who (led by the immediate spirit and finger of God) doth now confidently beleive, that it was that hand of his which pistolled his brother to death, and that it might be rather probable than impossible, that <hi>Blancheville</hi>
                        <pb n="391" facs="tcp:16653:215"/>
mought be the Author, and hee the actor of this cruell Murther. Wherefore grounding this his strong suspition upon the piety and innocency of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers life and disposition, as also on his owne fowre former premised serious considerations and circumstances, hee neither can nor will take any contrary Law or peace of his thoughts. But goes to the <hi>Seneshall,</hi> and Kings attourny of that Citty, and accuseth <hi>Le Valley</hi> to be the murtherer of his brother <hi>Beauma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rais.</hi> The wise and prudent judges, advertised the presidiall court thereof likewise: So they presently cause him to bee apprehended and imprisoned for the same: They charge him with this cruell murther committed on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his master, but he stoutly denyes it with many fearefull oathes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations: But his crime being greater then his Apologie, they adjudge him to the racke, where in the middest of his tortures, God so deales with his heart and prevailes with his soule, that he confesseth, it was he who murthered his master <hi>Beaumarais</hi> with a pistoll charged with a brace of bullets, and that hee was hired to performe it by the Lady <hi>Blancheville,</hi> who gave him three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred crownes in gold, and a Diamond ring to effect and finish it.

But this poore and passionate Apologie of hers, will not passe current with her Lyncee-eyed Iudges, who cause her to be confronted with <hi>Le Valley,</hi> who stands firme to his former accusation against her, and yet her faith is so weake with God, and so strong with sathan as with many cryes and curses, she againe and againe cryes out and protesteth of her Innocency: They produce her her ring, and part of gold, but she boldly denies and stoutly forsweares both; So they presently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge her to the racke, whereto with much constancy she permits herselfe to be fastened: But at the very first touch and wrench thereof, her dainety delicate limbs not able to brooke those exquisite torments, God was pleased to be so gratious &amp; mercifull to her soule, as she presently (with many teares) cries out that shee was the guilty Author of this horrible murther, and so in all points and circumstances concurres and agrees with <hi>Le Valleis</hi> deposition and accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against her; Here her Iudges againe demand of her if her maid <hi>Martha</hi> were never accessary or consenting with her and <hi>Le Valley</hi> in this their bloudy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>We have seene the perpetration and detection of this inhumane and lamen table murther, committed by these two unfortunate wretches <hi>Le Valley</hi> and <hi>Blancheville:</hi> And now (by the mercy and Iustice of God) we are come to see the triumphes of his revenge to fight against them in their condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the same.

IT is not the meannesse of the personages, but the greatnesse and eminence of Gods Judgements which hath prevailed with me to give this History a place among my others: The which to draw from the head-spring, and originall, we must understand, that in <hi>Italy,</hi> (the Garden of Europe, as Europe is that of the whole world) and in the City of <hi>Genova,</hi> (seated upon the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean Sea, which the Italians for the sumptuousnesse and statelinesse of her buildings, doe justly stile and entitle, proud <hi>Genova)</hi> neare unto the Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall upon the Key, there dwelt (of late yeares) a proper tall young man, of a coale blacke haire, some twenty five yeares old, named <hi>Andrea Lorenzo,</hi> who by his trade was a Baker, and was now become Master of his profession, and kept forth his Oven and shop for himselfe; wherein he was so industrious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that in a short time he became one of the prime Bakers of that City, and wrought to many Ships and Galleyes of this Estate and Seigniory: He in few yeares grew rich, was proffered many wives, of the daughters of many wealthy Bakers, and other Artificers of <hi>Genova,</hi> but he was still covetous, and so addicted to the world, as he could fancy none, nor as yet be resolved or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to seeke any maid or widdow in marriage, sith hee knew it to be one of the greatest and most important actions of our life, and which infallibly drawes with it, either our chiefest earthly felicity or misery.</p>
                     <p>But as marriages are made in heaven, before consummated on earth; So <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> going on a time to the City of <hi>Savona,</hi> which (both by Sea and Land) is some twenty little miles from <hi>Genova,</hi> and heretofore was a free City and Estate of it selfe, but now swallowed up in the power and opulencie of that of <hi>Genova,</hi> he there fell in love with a rich Vintners daughter, her father named <hi>Iuan Baptista Moron,</hi> and shee <hi>Firmia Moron,</hi> who was a lovely and beautifull young maiden, of some eighteene yeares of age, being tall and slender, of a pale complection, and a bright yellow haire, but exceedingly vertuous and religious, and endowed with many sweet qualities and perfections; who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thouhh she were sought in marriage by divers rich young men, of very good families of that City, with the worst of whom (either for estate or extraction) <hi>Lorenzo</hi> might no way compare, yet shee could fancie none but him, and hee above all the men of the world she (secretly in her heart and minde) desired might be her Husband. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> (with order and discretion) seeks <hi>Fermia</hi> in mariage of her father <hi>Moron,</hi> who is too strong of purse, and to high of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to match his daughter to a Baker, or to any other of a mechanicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and so gives him a flat and peremptory deniall. But <hi>Lorenzo</hi> finds his daughter more courteous and kinde to his desires, for she being as deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured of his personage, as he was of her beauty and vertues, after a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or two which he had made to her at at <hi>Savona,</hi> she consents and yeelds to him to be his wife, conditionally that hee can obtaine her fathers good will thereunto, but not otherwise; which <hi>Lorenzo</hi> yet feared and doubted would prove a difficult taske for him to compasse and procure; for her father know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Fermia</hi> to be his owne and onely childe and daughter, and that her beautie and vertuous education, together with the consideration of his owne wealth and estate, made her every way capable of a farre better husband than <hi>Lorenzo:</hi> As also that his daughter in reason and religion, and by the lawes of heaven and earth, was bound to yeeld him all duty and obedience (because of him she had formerly received both life and being) therefore he was resolute that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> should not have his daughter to wife, neither would he ever hearken to accept, or consent to take him for his sonne in Law.</p>

                        <hi>Lorenzo</hi> having thus obtained the heart and purchased the affection of his sweet and deare <hi>Fermia,</hi> he now (out of his fervent desire and zeale to see her made his wife, and himselfe her husband) makes it both his ambition and care (according to her order) to drawher father <hi>Moron</hi> to consent thereunto, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the more importunate, humble, and dutifull he (both by himselfe &amp; friends) is to <hi>Moron,</hi> the more imperious, averse, and obstinate is he to <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining any farther to heare of this his suit and motion for his daughter. But <hi>Lorenzo</hi> loves the daughter too tenderly and dearly thus to be put off with the first repulse and deniall of her father, and so (notwithstanding) hee againe persevereth in his suit towards him, with equall humility and resolution: Hee requesteth his consent to their affections with prayers, and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Fermia</hi> (having formerly acquainted her father with her deare and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable love to <hi>Lorenzo)</hi> she now prayes him thereto with teares: But (as one who had wholly wedded himselfe to the singularity of his owne resolution and pleasure) he againe proudly refuseth him with disdaine, and peremptorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth her with choller and indignation, and so secretly vowes to himselfe, and publikely sweares to them, that he will first die, and salute his grave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever he will permit him to marry his daughter. Which unkinde answer, and thundering resolution of his, proves the extreame greife of his daughter <hi>Fermia,</hi> and infinite affliction and sorrow of her lover <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> who hereupon are enforced to beare up with the time, yea, and to make a vertue of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by separating their bodies, but not their hearts and affections. So hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes to <hi>Genova,</hi> and she lives and remaines with her father in <hi>Savona,</hi> having no other comfort left them in their absence but hope, nor no other consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but sometimes to visit each other with their Letters, which they doe.</p>
                     <p>Old <hi>Moron</hi> now finds his young daughter <hi>Fermia,</hi> farre more pensive, reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and sorrowfull than heretofore, and therefore although he grieve to see her affection intangled with this Baker <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> yet he rejoyceth to see that he comes to <hi>Savona,</hi> as also to understand that his daughter hath no way ingaged her selfe to him in promise of marriage, but with the condition of his free will and consent thereto, which as heretofore, so now againe, hee deeply sweares he will never be drawne or perswaded to grant. And the sooner and better eternally and fully to dash these their irregular loves and affections, he thinks it fit for him to provide, and requisite to present his daughter with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Husband: To which end he gives her the choice of two or three proper young men, and of very good families in <hi>Savona,</hi> but shee will have none of them, for her affection is so deeply fixed, and constantly setled on <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> that say her father what he will, or doe hee or they what they can, hee can hardly draw her to see, much lesse to speake with any one of them: Whereat he cals her foolish Gigglet, and fond Girle, and sweares that he will wholly renounce her for his daughter, and absolutely disinherit her, and leave her a begger, if she marrie <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and then and there flies from her in rage and choller, and leaves her alone to her selfe, to entertaine her disconsolate and sorrowfull thoughts, with a world of sighs and teares.</p>
                     <p>As for the Letters which passe from <hi>Genova</hi> to <hi>Sevona,</hi> and that are also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Savona</hi> to <hi>Genova,</hi> betweene these our two lovers <hi>Lorenzo</hi> and <hi>Fermia,</hi> deeming them impertinent to this their History, I have therefore purposely excluded, and for order and brevities sake omitted them: The which entertained their time, and tooke up their affections and patience so long, that three yeares are now past and blowne over, since they first saw
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:16653:219"/>
each other, and since <hi>Lorenzo</hi> first motioned <hi>Moron</hi> for his consent to marry his daughter, during all which long tract of time, which to those our two young lovers seemed at least so many ages. The Reader is prayed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and take notice, that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> hath made five or six journeyes from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nova</hi> to <hi>Savona</hi> to see his <hi>Fermia,</hi> and hath importunately requested her father <hi>Moron</hi> for his consent, and that at least as many times shee likewise hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all her Parents and friends towards him, yea, and hath beene more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on her bended knees to him to begge it, but all these their requests and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards him prove vaine.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Lorenzo</hi> at last considering and remembring, that he had used all the lawfull meanes he could possibly invent, and <hi>Fermia</hi> all her best endevours and inventions which lay in her mortall power to draw her father <hi>Moron</hi> to their desires and wishes of mariage, and that neither they nor all the world could prevaile with him, he thinkes it now high time (as well for the setling of his fortunes and trade, as also for the confirmation of his hearts content) to lay close siege to his <hi>Fermia,</hi> that (notwithstanding her fathers refusall) she would consent and yeeld to marry him, and so very secretly by night to leave him and <hi>Savona,</hi> and to come live and die with himselfe in <hi>Genova,</hi> telling her, that although he had never a Duckaton of marriage money with her from her father, yet that God had given him estate and meanes enough to maintaine her and his family, in full and plentifull prosperity, and that hee would bee a thousand times more tender and carefull of her than of his owne life. Thus with a world of sweet words and sugred promises, and perswasions, this sweet and faire young maiden (contrary to her former wholesome, vertuous, and obedient resolutions) is at last drawne and tempted away by him, now to prove disobedient to her father, yea, and to forsake and flie away both from his house and himselfe. So <hi>Lorenzo</hi> having to that end secretly provided himselfe of a fine small Frigot, of foure oares in each side, hee therewith comes by night into the key of <hi>Savona,</hi> (which the policie of the Genouesses (now their Lords and Superiours) have dammed up, and made uncapable of ships of burthen, that thereby all the trade and commerce by Sea, may arrive to their owne capitall City) where giving notice to <hi>Fermia</hi> of his being there, shee (taking her best cloathes, and other chiefest necessaries with her) in the dead time of the night, when her father and his servants were fast in sleepe, and all things being hushed up in silence, seemed to conspire to her rash and inconsiderate escape, shee by the Garden doore issueth forth to <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> who there received her with much joy, and many kisses, and so conducts her to the Frigat, where the wind (in favour of this their clandestine flight) proving very faire, they hoise up saile, and early the next morning arrive at <hi>Genova,</hi> where (within two houres after) <hi>Lorenzo</hi> conducts her to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Saviours Church, and there very secretly (yet solemnly espouseth and marries her. But O <hi>Fermia,</hi> how I pitie thy youth and beauty, thine innocencie and indiscretion, thy few yeares and many vertues, thy affection and misfortune, and thine ignorance and credulity, so rashly and disobediently to flie from <hi>Savona</hi> to <hi>Genova,</hi> and to take (or rather to steale) away thy selfe from thy father, purposely to give thy selfe in marriage to <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> for which indiscreet and disobedient fact of thine, it is not unpossible for thee to see this ensuing position verified and confirmed in thy selfe, <hi>That there is nothing so easie in young people as to commiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, nor so difficult as to repaire them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whiles thus our young maried couple celebrate their nuptials in <hi>Genova</hi>
                        <pb n="399" facs="tcp:16653:219"/>
with delight and joy, old <hi>Moron</hi> the father grieves and stormes thereat in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vona,</hi> for the sudden flight of his daughter: When fearing and beleeving that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had stollen her away, he secretly makes enquiry thereof at his house of <hi>Genova,</hi> from whence he hath perfect notice, that she is there, and maried to him, whereat he passionately converts his griefe into choller, both against her and him, and (in regard of this their disgrace and dishonour offered him) most constantly vowes to himselfe, and to all who are neere him, that they shall never touch nor enjoy the vallew of one Duckaton of all his Estate and wealth, as long as he or they live, and that he will not once send after thm, nor ever hereafter see them, which sharp vow and bitter sentence against our <hi>Lorenzo</hi> and <hi>Fermia,</hi> we shall be enforced to see him too carefully to keepe, and too severely and punctually to performe.</p>
                     <p>Some ten dayes after this mariage of <hi>Lorenzo</hi> and <hi>Fermia,</hi> when their wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding joyes and pleasures had given them some truce and time to consider of their worldly affaires, because they know &amp; repute it folly, to thinke to be able wholly to live by love, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> considering the injury &amp; disgrace which he had offered his father in law <hi>Moron</hi> in this action, and therefore very desirous yet now againe to seeke his consent and good will to this their mariage, that thereby he may participate and share of some part of his wealth, he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth shortly to ride over to <hi>Savona</hi> to him, and with his best respects and duty to comply and labour with him for a reconciliation; and yet neverthelesse he thinks it very fit, and hold it most expedient, that his wife in the meane time should first excuse her selfe to her father by her Letter, the which she doth in these tearmes:</p>

                        <hi>Moron</hi> received this Letter in <hi>Savona,</hi> and understanding by the messenger who brought it, that it came from his daughter <hi>Fermia</hi> from <hi>Genova,</hi> he was at first in such a fret and fume of choller thereat, as hee once thought to have throwne it into the fire, without vouchsafing to read it: But after hee had made three or foure turnes in his Parlour, and so somewhat abated the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his passion and choller, hee then procures so much time from his pleasure, and so much patience from himselfe, as he breaks up the seales there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and peruseth it, the which as soone as he had performed, he in presence of the messenger who brought it, teares her Letter in peeces, and then (all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with choller) throwes it into the fire, when againe turning himselfe to him, he bade him tell the Gigglet his daughter, <hi>That her carriage had beene so base, disobedient, and ingratefull to him, that he disdained to returne any answer to her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and was very sorry that he had so much descended from himselfe as to have received and read it:</hi> When without once enquiring of him how his daughter did, yea, without giving the messenger any reward, or which is lesse, without making him drinke, he hastily and chollerickly flings from him, and will no more see or speake with him. Who returning to <hi>Genova,</hi> and reporting to <hi>Lorenzo</hi> and his wife what cold entertainment his Letter and himselfe had of her father <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> in <hi>Savona;</hi> she grieves and stormes thereat publikely, and he privately, and at their first relation and knowledge of this her fathers unkindnesse in answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her Letter with silence, they looke each on other with their countenances composed partly of discontent, and partly of sorrow, and for her part shee cannot refraine from teares, till at last her Husband <hi>Lorenzo</hi> steps to her, when (as much to dissipate her griefe, as to dissemble his owne) he gives her many smiles, and comforts her with these speeches; That according to her promise (in her Letter) to her father, he will the next weeke goe over to him, and will then beare himselfe so respectively towards him, that he hopes his presence shall purchase his affection, which her Letter could not, so she hereat remaines better satisfied than her Husband contented with this harsh carriage, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde resolution of their father towards them.</p>
                     <p>Now some eight dayes after <hi>Lorenzo</hi> rides over to <hi>Savona,</hi> (handsomely clad, and rather above than below his quality) and putting up his horse in an Inne, hee a little before supper time, goes to his father in law <hi>Morons</hi> house, where enquiring of his servants for him, they tell him he is above in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when desirous to see and speake with him, one of them steps up to him and enformes him thereof: Whereat <hi>Moron</hi> starting up as if he had beene sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly awaked out of a dreame, he at the first mention and name of <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> but especially of that of his sonne in law <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> bolts himselfe fast in his chamber, and then calling up his servants to him, hee flatly chargeth them to deny his being within to <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and as soone as he is gone forth, to shut the doores against him, and at any hand not to admit him into his house, for that his pleasure and resolution is neither to see nor speake with him. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> bites the lip at this baffle of his servants, first to say their Master his father in Law was within, and then in one breath to contradict and deny it. When for that time he holds it discretion to depart, goes to his Hostary (or Inne) to Supper, and returnes thither againe speedily after, but findes the same answer. So then fearing the truth, that his father Law was (infallibly) within, and yet would not be within, he returnes to his lodging, and in much choller betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to his bed, but this discourtesie of his father in Law will not permit him any sound rest, but onely affords him many broken discontented slumbers.

The next morning very early hee returnes thither againe to see and speake with him, but the first prove the last answer of his servants, whereat <hi>Lorenzo</hi> (all nelted with choller and anger) takes horse and rides away for <hi>Genova.</hi>

                     <p>At the end of six moneths <hi>Lorenzo</hi> prayes his wife <hi>Fermia</hi> to ride over to <hi>Savona</hi> to see what alteration this long time hath wrought in her fathers affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and so recommends her portion from him to her care &amp; remembrance, but resolves not to write to him because of his unkindnesse to him at his last being at <hi>Savona. Fermia</hi> (more in obedience to her husband, than out of her owne willingnesse or desire) accepts of this journey, but still she feares that shee shall finde her father to bee one and the same man in his discontent and displeasure against them. But yet in regard shee is his owne flesh and bloud, his onely childe; and therefore a great part of himselfe, she yet flatters her selfe with this hope, that he cannot be so unnaturall to her, as he was unkinde to her husband. She comes to <hi>Savona,</hi> but looke what entertainment her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Lorenzo</hi> found from her father, the same in all respects and points doth she, and no otherwise: For he will neither speake with her, no nor see, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her, either to lie, eat, or drinke in his house, but most uncourteously and unnaturally causeth his doores to be fast shut against her; yea, and to adde cruelty to his unkindnesse, he is extreame angry with his servants for daring to admit her to speake with him, and with her Aunt <hi>Alcyna,</hi> (his owne sister) for receiving and lodging her.</p>
                     <p>Our sweet <hi>Fermia</hi> the daughter is extreamly perplexed, afflicted, and grieved at this her fathers bitter unkindnesse and cruelty towards her, the which she seales with many sighs, and confirmes with infinite Rivolets of teares, which trickle downe her beautifull cheeks as so many pearled drops of dew on blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing and fragrant damaske Roses: When againe imploying her aforesaid Aunt <hi>Alcyna,</hi> and likewise entreating father <hi>Bernardin De Monte,</hi> her fathers owne ghostly father, to perswade him in her behalfe, which they doe.

the other vaine and to no effect, then as she came from <hi>Genova</hi> to <hi>Savona</hi> with some hope and joy, so she is againe constraind to returne from <hi>Savona</hi> to <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> with infinite griefe and dispaire; Where from point to point (betwixt anger and teares) shee relates to her husband <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> the unnaturall discourtesie, which her father had offered her: Whereat as before, so now he againe dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth his discontent thereof and with many sweet speeches, and some few kisses seekes to comfort and pacifie her: But still the remembrance hereof stickes deepe in her minde, and yet farre deeper in his thoughts, for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his father in Law <hi>Morons</hi> discourtesie first offered to himselfe, and now to his wife in <hi>Savona,</hi> being knowne and reported to many of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and friends in <hi>Genova,</hi> they scoffe and taunt at his foolish ambition, in marrying and stealing away his wife, and in all companies which he frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, they give him this quip, that hee had done farre wiser to have marryed a poore trades mans daughter in <hi>Genoua</hi> with a small portion, then a rich Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in <hi>Savona</hi> with nothing: which foolish and malitious speech of theirs, falles not so easily from his memorie as from their tongues, but leaves an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression therein, for from henceforth, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> of a wise man proves himselfe a foole, of an honest man a knave, and so of a good christian to God, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame bad husband both to his wife and himselfe: for now seeing the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of his hopes of a rich wife turned to molehils, and they to nothing through his fathers displeasure and unkindnesse to them, hee lookes not on his wife with so kinde and respective an eye as heretofore, although poore harmelesse young woman, shee knowes farre better to lament and greive, then how to remedy her fathers cruelty towards them: But this is but the beginning of his ingratitude and her unfortunacy, for before a whole yeare be past since their marriage, her husband so farre forgets his love to his wife, his regard to himselfe and his reputation and credit to the world, as hee first beginnes to sleight her, and then to neglect both himselfe and his profession: And here now it is that idlenesse beginnes first to enter into his hands, vice into his heart, and sinne into his soule; and here it is that he first fals into bad courses, and wicked company from whence in the end (I feare) will proceed nothing but shame, repentance, misery, and confusion of all sides.</p>
                     <p>Hee who formerly prayed often with his wife and family in his house and was a devout and religious frequenter of his Church, now he is so dangerously fled from God and so desperately following of the devill as hee scornes the Church, and will neither pray himselfe at home with his wife, nor (which is worse) permit or suffer her to doe it at home with her family: He hath forgotten her deere affection and constancy to him, and how shee hath incurred her fathers indignation for making him her husband and herselfe his wife: He hath forgotten his former oathes and promises of his tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and constant love to her, and how that in life and death hee would live and dye more hers then his owne: Hee hath forgotten how for his sake, and for the fervent love shee bore him, that she forsooke divers rich young men of <hi>Savona</hi> who were every way his Superiours in Birth, Wealth, and profession: Or els if he did remember it, hee would not thus sleight her by day, or lye from her by night in lewd and lascivious company, spending both his time, his meanes, and himselfe: upon panders, bauds, and strumpets, from which ungodly life and sinfull conversation, neither her prayers, intreaties, requests, perswasions, sighes or teares can possibly reclaime him; but he lets all things runne at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and confusion without order, care, or consideration, so that within the

compasse of one yeare and a halfe, his trade is neglected, his credit crackt, his reputation lost, his estate spent, and nothing left either to maintaine himselfe or releive her, but griefe, sorrow, dispaire and misery. Shee sets all his best friends, and most vertuous acquaintance to convert him from this his abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable life, yea she holds it more shame, then sinne to acquaint his confessor therewith, who taking a fit time, deales roundly with him for his reformation, and failes not to paint out his sinnes and vices, as also their deserved punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their foulest and most hideous colours: But still her husband <hi>Lorenzo</hi> is so strongly linked to the devill, and so firmely wedded to his beastly vices and enormities that all the world cannot divert, or disswade him from them, and still he is so farre from abandoning and forsaking them, as he adds new to his old: for the devill hath now taught him to delight in cursing and swearing, for in his speeches and actions he useth many feareful oathes and desperate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations: He beginnes to revile her, and to give her foule language, tear ming her Beggar, and her father villaine, and that hee is bound to curse them both, because (saith he) they have beggerd him: When God and his sinnefull soule and conscience well knowes that there is nothing more untrue or false: For if his piety toward God, or his care and providence of himselfe and his family had equallized hers, he had than made himselfe as happy as nowhe is miserable; and she as joyfull, as now we see her disconsolate and sorrowfull; and then no doubt but time and God would have drawne her father <hi>Moron</hi> to have bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some portion on him with his wife, whereas now the knowledge of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious life and lascivious prodigalities doth justly occasion him to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Againe here befalls another accident which brings our sorrowfull <hi>Fermia</hi> new griefe, vexation and teares, for shee sees herselfe great, yea quicke with childe by her Husband <hi>Lorenzo</hi> so as that which shee once hoped would have beene the argument of her joy, now proves the cause of her affliction and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, for his vices hath scarce left her wherewith to maintaine herselfe, and therefore it grieves her to thinke and consider, how hereafter she shall be able to mainetain her childe, when God in his appointed time shall send it her, for he hath so consumed his estate, and spent, sold, and pawned all their best hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold stuffe and apparell, that almost they have nothing left to give themselves maintenance, hardly bread: But yet still how lewd and irregular soever <hi>Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi> be, his vertuous and sorrowfull wife <hi>Fermia</hi> serves God duely and truely, and spends a great part of her time in prayer, still beseeching the Lord to give her patience, and to forgive her husband all his foule sinnes, towards him, and cruell ingratitude towards herselfe: When in the middest of this her poverty and misery, once she thought to have left her husband in <hi>Genova,</hi> and to have cast herselfe at her fathers feet in <hi>Savona,</hi> that he would pardon, receive and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine her: But then againe considering his flinty heart and cruelty towards her, and that he would rather contemne then pitty her youth and misery, but especially calling to minde her duty to her husband, and her Oath given him in marriage, in presence of God and his Church for better for worse, for richer for poorer: Then I say the consideration and remembrance thereof, is so strong a tye to her conscience and so strict an obligation to her soule, that she thinkes his vices and poverty hath now more need of her assistance, prayers and company then of her absence, so as a vertuous wife and a religious chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, she will not consent to forsake and leave him, but resolves to stay and live with him, to see what the Lord is pleased to impose on her, and (for his sinnes and hers) what afflictions and miseries hee hath ordained and decreed

                     <p>The receit of this her fathers unkinde and cruell letter to her, doth at one time kill both her hopes with dispaire, and her heart with griefe; or if that doe not, then the mad tyranny, and new cruelty of her deboshed husband doth: for now contrary to nature, beyond reason and opposite to Grace, he many times beates her; she is all in teares hereat, useth all possible meanes to reclaime him from his new vices to his old vertues: She continually perswades him fairely with exhortations, sweetly with sighes, and deerely with teares, yea poore sweet young woman, shee many times casts herselfe at his feet, and with her armes crossed, her hands elevated towards heaven, her haire dishevelled and dandling about her cheekes, and her pearled teares bedewing the lillies of her mournefull and disconsolate countenance, begs him to forsake his vices to himselfe, and his undeserved unkindnesse and cruelty towards her: But all this is in vaine, for hee proves death to her requests and prayers, and blinde to her sighes and teares. He hath no longer mony to buy corne, and is so farre from selling any bread to others, as he hath scarce enough to give to himselfe and to his great bellied wife, and as for his servants hee is inforced to put them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: His vanity to himselfe and cruelty to his wife is too too lamentably no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and remarkeable, for when he wants mony, he beats her, if she will not presently supply his wants, and furnish his expences. Now in the middest of all these her griefes and miseries, God sends her a faire young sonne, of whom the father is not worthy, no nor of his vertuous wife who bore it: For had not the care, affection, and charity of her neighbours beene farre greater then that of her husband to her, both the mother had miscarryed, and the childe perished in the sharpe throwes and agony of her delivery; and the name of this her little sonne, whom she causeth to be christened in a very poore man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and ceremony, is <hi>Thomaso:</hi> for she is so poore as she hath nothing but raggs to wrappe and cover him with, and therefore with much griefe and shame, she begges poore linnen clouts of her neighbours to keepe him cleane and sweet: When it is waking, she lookes and kisseth it often with joy, but when it sleepes or suckes, then shee grieves that it is so unfortunate both in a wicked father, and poore disconsolate mother, who hath more meanes to lament and pitty, then milke to feed and nourish it: Shee often shewes her husband his child, and importunately begges him hence forth to have a more provident care of himselfe for his childes sake, and of his childe for his owne sake: But hee as a lewd husband and too degenerate a father doth neither love nor care for either but hates both of them, yea his vices &amp; crueltie makes her sorrow so infinit, that she reputes herselfe a burthen to herselfe, &amp; a thousandtimes wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth she were in heaven; And one time among the rest after her husband with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause, had given her many bitter words and some sharpe and cruell blowes
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:16653:225"/>
her childe being in its cradle, he gone forth from her in choller, she fals downe on her knees to prayer, the which so soone as shee had ended, and her childe awaking and crying, she takes it up in her armes, and mournfully sitting downe on the floore by her bed side, she (weeping as fast as her poore infant babe sucked) having bolted her chamber doore, was over-heard by one of her neighbours, (twixt whom and her selfe there was but a wainscot enterclose and partition) to pronounce these (or the like) sorrowfull speeches to her selfe.</p>
                     <p>O poore <hi>Fermia,</hi> it had beene an infinite happinesse for thee if thou hadst never seene thy Husband <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> or perished and sunke in the Sea when thou fleddest with him from <hi>Sevona</hi> to <hi>Genova,</hi> before hee was thy Husband. For surely thou hast great causeto thinke, and reason to beleeve, that this cruelty of his towards thee, is a just plague and punishment sent thee from God, for disobeying thy father, in marrying without his consent and blessing; with whom when thou livedst single, thou hadst so much felicity and joy, as thou knewest not what belonged to sorrow and misery, and now living a wife to this thy Husband, thou art enforced to taste so much griefe and misery, as thou knowest no more what belongs to joy and felicity. Then thou didst surfet with the choice of the costliest meats and viands, and now thou art ready to starve meerly for want of bread: Then thy apparrell was rich, but now rent and torne: Then thy beauty made thee sought in mariage by divers, and now the griefes and sorrowes having defaced and withered it, thou art contemned and hated of him who maried thee. For can thy griefes be matched, or thy afflictions and sorrowes parralleld, when thou hast a Husband who neither feares nor serves God, who will neither goe to Church, or pray himselfe, or permit or suffer thee to doe it; and who is so farre from loving thee, as hee loves nothing better than to hate, revile, and beat thee: For (aye me) hee drownes himselfe and his wits in wine, and keeps whores to thy nose, spends all his estate upon them, and upon Bawds, Panders and Drunkards (the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scumme and Catterpillers of the world) with whom he consumes his time and himselfe, making night day, and day night in these his beastly revels, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene voluptuousnesse, and upon whom he hath spent so much, as hee now hath nothing left either to spend or maintaine himselfe and thee; yea, thy miseries are so great, and thy afflictions and sorrowes so sharpe and infinite, that thou hast no parent left to succour or releeve thee, and which is lesse, no friend who will assist or comfort thee. Poore young woman, and disconso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late sorrowfull wife that thou art, it were a blessed happinesse, and a happy blessing for thee that thou wert either unborne or unmarried. Alas, alas, thy mother died too soone for thee, when thou wert young, and therefore shee cannot, and thy father lives, (and is exceeding rich) yet hates thee so much as he will not assist &amp; releeve thee. And as all thy kinsfolks refuse to lend or send thee any comfort in these thy wants and calamities; so those who professed themselves thy friends in thy prosperity, will not now either see thee in thy poverty, or know thee in thy misery. When againe and againe looking on her pretty babe, and giving it many tender kisses, then (her teares interrupting her words, and her sighs againe cutting her teares in peeces) shee continueth her speech thus: And thou my sweet babe, what shall I say to thee, sith almost I can doe nothing for thee, for I have no food to give my selfe, how then can I give milke to thee; and yet I love thee so dearly and tenderly, that although thy unkinde and cruell father hate me so deadly, yet I will starve before thou
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:16653:225"/>
shalt want, yea, I will cheerfully worke, and (if occasion serve) begge my selfe to death to get sustenance and necessaries for the preservation of thy life. For live thou my sweet babe as happy as thy poore mother is miserable and unfortunate: And if I die before thee, (as I hope I shall not live long) say thou hadst a mother who loved thee a thousand times dearer than her own life, and who was rich in care and affection, though poore in estate and means to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thee. And if I leave thee nothing behinde me, (because I have now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left me either to give or leave thee) yet I will give thee my blessing, and leave thee heire to these my most religious prayers; That God in his divinest favour and mercy will not power downe his wrath and punishments on thee, but thou mayest live to be as happy in thy vertues, as I feare thy father will be miserable in his vices; and as true a servant and instrument of Gods glory, as (with griefe and teares) I see he is of his owne disgrace and dishonour.</p>
                     <p>Neither is our vertuous <hi>Fermia</hi> deceived in the cloze of this her passionate and presaging speech towards her husband, for he continues his odious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly course of life both towards God and her, and now (as well in his fresh as his drunken humours) makes it his practice to revile, and his delight and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to beat her; who not withstanding yet thinking and hoping to worke some good in him, through his sight of this poore infant his sonne. Shee often shewes it to him, and with sighs and teares prayes him to leave off this his sinfull life towards God, and these his cruell courses and actions towards her selfe. But he is still the same man, yea, he is so wretchedly debauched and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, as he will not endure to thinke of making himselfe better, and to say the truth, I beleeve and thinke that the devill cannot possibly make him worse; the wich his poore sorrowfull wife perceiving, as also that her childe being now by this time almost two yeares old, shee hath not wherewithall in the world to maintaine it meat or cloaths, she is enforced to make a vertue of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and so works exceeding hard with her needle, thereby to give life to her selfe, and her pretty young sonne; and yet say she what she will with sighs, and doe she what she can with teares, her husband still forcibly takes away the two parts of the poore profit, and small revenewe of her labours, both from her selfe, and her little sonne <hi>Thomaso,</hi> not caring if they starve or die, so hee have to maintaine his vitious expences among his lewd Consorts and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; yea, her miseries and wants are now so great, and her affection to her childe so deare and tender, that when shee hath no meanes to set her selfe to worke, nor can procure any from others, then (though to her matchlesse griefe and shame) shee descends so farre from her selfe, as shamefully and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in remote streets and Churches, she begs the almes and charity of some well disposed people for their subsistence and maintenance: But at length, when she sees that her husband is informed and acquainted therewith, and that he is so inhumane in himselfe, and so cruell hearted to her and her sonne, that he likewise takes these small moneyes away from her, (which in effect is to take bread out of their mouths, and life out of their bodies) then not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what (in the world) to doe, or which way to winde or turne her selfe any longer, to maintaine her son, which (by many degrees) she loves better than her selfe, she resolves to write to her father to take him home to him at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vona;</hi> and maintaine him, which she doth by this her ensuing Letter, which carried him this humble language and petition:</p>

her husband <hi>Lorenzo</hi> either to kisse or see him at his departure, as if it were no part of his affection to blesse it, or of his duty to pray to God to blesse it, much lesse to kisse it at parting. A most unkinde and unnaturall part of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his sweet and pretty young sonne. Which strange and discourteous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of his, it is not impossible for us to see God as strangely both to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite and revenge.</p>
                     <p>Sorrowfull <hi>Fermia</hi> having thus sent away her little sonne <hi>Thomaso</hi> to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Moron</hi> at <hi>Savona,</hi> she the very same night dreames in her poore bed and house in <hi>Genova,</hi> that she shall never be so happy to see him againe; when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awaked, and remembring this her sorrowfull dreame, she for meere griefe bitterly weeps thereat, and although she would, yet she cannot possibly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or suppresse the remembrance thereof, or once put it out of her minde; so that thinking her selfe fortunate in placing this her little sonne with her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Grandfather, shee is now very pensive and sorrowfull for his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, because she can no longer see him, play with him, and kisse him, and is infinitely disconsolate and mournfull when she thinks of her dreame of him. In the meane time her lewd husband growes from bad to worse, so that her coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation is but a bondage with him, and her mariage and wedlocke but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture of slavery, and a contract of misery under him. Such is her incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable griefe, such her unparalleld afflictions and calamities.</p>
                     <p>Five yeares our disconsolate <hi>Fermia</hi> lives in this rich misery, and miserable poverty with her husband, and yet all the whole world cannot perswade her father <hi>Moron</hi> to take her home to him and maintaine her. She hath no conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation left her but prayers, nor remedy but enforced patience; so shee armes her selfe with the last, and adorneth her selfe with the first. She was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to begge for the maintenance of her little sonne <hi>Thomaso,</hi> but now being eased of that burthen, she will give it over, so she works hard to get her hard and poore living, which yet she cannot get so fast as her husband spends it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally and lasciviously. Her care and vertues make her the pitie, as his lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and vices make him the scorne and contempt of all their neighbours. So whiles she sits at home close at her needle in poore apparell, he idlely wanders and gads abroad untill he have brought his apparell to ragges, and himselfe almost to nakednesse. And here it is that her wretched husband <hi>Lorenzo</hi> now first beginnes to hearken to the devill, yea, to prove a very devill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe towards this his deare and vertuous wife; for he enters into a consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with himselfe, that if he were once rid of his wife <hi>Fermia,</hi> he might mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry some other with a good portion to maintaine him, and so againe set up his trade of baking which now had forsaken him, because he had vitiously and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftily forsaken it. When his faith being as weake with God, as his infamous life and vices were odious to the world, he assumes a bloudy and damnable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to murther her, and hereunto the Devill is still at his elbow to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and egge him onward, and continually blowes the coales to this his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and indignation against her: So neither his minde or heart, his conscience or soule can divert him from this fearfull enterprize, and lamentable and bloudy businesse: The which to performe and perpetrate, he on a great holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day (which was the purification of the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary)</hi> takes her with him into a Vineyard some halfe a mile from the City of <hi>Genova,</hi> under colour to recreate themselves, and to take the aire, which God knowes she poore soule takes for a great, because an unaccustomed favour and courtesie at his hands, where she most lovingly and willingly goes with him, and there feigning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:16653:227"/>
fast a sleep, and she (innocent harmlesse young woman) then &amp; thereslept soundly, and every way being as devoid of feare as he was of grace, he with a barbarous and diabolicall cruelty, (seeing the coast cleare) softly riseth up and cuts her throat, without giving her the power, time or happinesse to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one word before her death: Where leaving her weltring and goring in her bloud, he speedily and politikely enters <hi>Genova</hi> by a contrary gate, thereby to avoid all suspition of this his bloudy and damnable fact.</p>
                     <p>The very same night this her breathlesse murthered body is found out by some of <hi>Genova,</hi> who accidentally walked that way; and they causing it to be brought to the City, it is knowne by some of <hi>Lorenzo's</hi> neighbours to bee his wife <hi>Fermia,</hi> whereat to adde the better cloke to his knavery, and shadow to his villany, he seemes to be wonderfully sad, and passionately sorrowfull for the same, and so requesteth the Criminall officers both in and about the City, to make curious research and enquiry for the murtherers of his wife, which they doe; but this hypocriticall sadnesse and false sorrow of his, though (to the eye of the world) it prevaile for a time, yet (to that of Gods mercy and justice) in the end it shall little availe him; so he gives her a poore and obscure buriall, every way unworthy the sweetnesse of her beauties, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of her vertues. Her father <hi>Moron</hi> hath speedy notice of this deplorable death of his daughter, who considering how she had cast away her selfe upon so bad a Husband as <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> though outwardly hee seeme to bewaile and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it, yet inwardly he much cares not for it; and for her little sonne <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maso,</hi> his few yeares dispenceth with his capacity from understanding, much lesse from lamenting and mourning for this disastrous end of his mother.</p>
                     <p>A moneth after the cruell murther and buriall of this vertuous, yet unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate young woman <hi>Fermia,</hi> her bloudy and execrable husband <hi>Lorenzo</hi> (is yet so devoid of feare and grace) as he goes to <hi>Savona</hi> to request his father in law <hi>Moron</hi> to give him some maintenance, in regard he had no portion from him with his wife his daughter, as also to see his sonne <hi>Thomaso.</hi> But <hi>Moron</hi> by his servants sends him a peremptory refusall to both these his requests, and so will neither see him, nor suffer him to see his sonne, but absolutely for ever forbids him his house: Whereat <hi>Lorenzo</hi> all in choller leaves <hi>Savona</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes to <hi>Genova,</hi> where selling away his wives old cloaths to provide him new, he seeks many maidens and widdowes in mariage, but the fame of his bad life and infamous carriage and deportment with his late wife is so fresh and great, that they all disdaine him; so that utterly despairing ever to raise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his fortunes by mariage, he forsakes and leaves <hi>Genova,</hi> inrols himselfe a Bandetti, and for many yeares together practiseth that theevish profession, to the which we willl eave him, and speake a little of his young and little sonne <hi>Thomaso.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Old <hi>Moron</hi> traines up this his Grand-child <hi>Thomaso</hi> very vertuously and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously, and at the age of fourteene yeares bids him chuse and embrace any trade he best liketh: When <hi>Thomaso</hi> exceedingly delighting in limming, graving, and imagery, he becomes a Goldsmith, and in foure or five yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is become a singular, expert, and skilfull workman in his trade: His Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father loves him dearly and tenderly, and intends to make him his heire; but <hi>Thomaso</hi> (led as I thinke by the immediate hand and providence of God, or out of his owne naturall disposition and inclination) being of a gadding hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to travell abroad, and see other Cities and Countreyes, and having a particular itching desire to see <hi>Rome,</hi> (which he understood is one of the very
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:16653:227"/>
prime and chiefe places of the world for rich and curious Goldsmiths.) Hee finding a french ship of <hi>Marseilles</hi> (which by contrary winds stopt in the Road of <hi>Savona</hi> bound up for <hi>Civita Vechia,</hi> very secretly packes up his trunke and trinkets and so goes along in that ship: Now as soone as his Grandfather <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> understands hereof, he very much grieves at this his rash and sodaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture: So <hi>Thomaso</hi> arrives at <hi>Civita Vechia,</hi> goes up to <hi>Hostia</hi> by sea, and thence on the River <hi>Tiber</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where hee becomes a singular ingenious Gold-Smith, and thrives so well, as after a few yeares) he there keepes shop for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and constantly builds up his residence.</p>
                     <p>In all this long tract and progression of time, which (my true information tels me) is at least twenty foure yeares, his father <hi>Lorenzo</hi> continues a theevish Bandetti in the state of <hi>Genova</hi> and <hi>Luca,</hi> where hee commits so many Lewd robberies, and strange rapines, depraedations and thefts, as that country at last becomes too hot for him, and he too obnoxious for it so he leaves it and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velleth into <hi>Thoscany,</hi> and to the faire &amp; famous Citty of <hi>Florence</hi> which is the Metropolis therof, where with the moneys he had gotten by the revenewes of his robberies he againe sets up his old trade of a Baker; in which profession he knew himselfe expert and excellent, and here hee setleth himselfe to live and dwell, takes a faire commodious house, and lookes out hard for some rich old maiden or young widdow to make his new wife: <hi>But God will prevent his thoughts and frustrate his designes and desires herein:</hi> For as yet his bloudy thoughts have not made their peace with his soule, nor his soule with his all seeing and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God for the cruell murthering of his old wife <hi>Fermia</hi> which as an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous storme and fierce tempest will sodainely befall him when hee least dreams or thinkes hereof, yea by a manner so strange, and an accident so mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous that former ages have seldome if ever paralleld, or givenus a precedent hereof, and wherein the power and providence, the mercy and Iustice of God resplends with infinite lustre and admiration, and therefore in my poore judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and opinion) I deeme it most worthy of our observation as we are men, and of our remembrance as we are christians.</p>

                     <p>When therefore the Panders and strumpets, and the new pride and bravery of our <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had eaten out all his mony and credit in <hi>Rome,</hi> and that (to his griefe) he now saw that by no possible meanes he could procure or borrow any more there being infinitely unwilling to let his vice and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie strike saile, and so as hee vainely and foolishly thinkes to disgrace his Lord Cardinals service instead of honouring it: Hee once was minded, and resolved to steale some gold out of the Argentiers or pay masters truncke; But then consulting with his Iudgement and discretion, and finding that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to bee full of danger, ingratitude, and infamy: He buries that resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as soone as it was borne, and then gives conception and life to another, which was to steale some peices of plate out of a young Goldsmithes shoppe there in <hi>Rome</hi> with whome hee was familiarly acquainted, and whose shoppe and company, hee with divers others of his fellowes) very often haunted and frequented since his comming to <hi>Rome;</hi> The which, watching and taking his time he doth, and from him takes away two faire rich guilt Chalices, and a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious small gold crucifix set with a few Saphires and Emeralds, all mounting to the valew of foure hundred and fifty Dukatons.

                     <p>The next morning hee is brought to his death, at the common place of execution at the Bridge foot, in a little walled court close to the castle of <hi>Saint Angelo,</hi> where a world of people flocke from all parts of <hi>Rome</hi> to see the Cardinall of Florence his Baker take his last leave of the world, and being the night before prepared by a Fryar, in his soules journey towards heaven, as soone as hee ascended the Ladder, hee there confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth this his robbery: And likewise that his name was <hi>Andrea Lorenzo,</hi> and that he (about some Twenty and three yeares since) murthered his owne wife named <hi>Fermia Moron</hi> in a vineyard neere <hi>Genova,</hi> whereof hee saith hee will no longer charge his soule: The which the young Gold-Smith (whose name was <hi>Thomaso Lorenzo</hi> over hearing) hee presently bursts forth into teares, and very passionately and sorrowfully cryes out, that this man on the Ladder is his owne Father; and that <hi>Fermia Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> was his owne Mother, and therefore hee with a world of sobbes, sighes, and teares prayeth the Officers, and then the Executioner of Iustice to forbeare, and leave the prisoner for a small whiles, which accordingly they doe: When at the descent of his Father from the Ladder: <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maso</hi> (in presence of all that huge number of people who were present) throwes himselfe at his feet, and seeming to drowne himselfe in his teares for sorrow, confesseth himselfe to bee his Sonne, and acknowledgeth <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia Moron</hi> to bee his mother, and therefore prayes him to forgive him this his innocent ingratitude towards him, in seeking his death of whom hee had received his owne life: And although the consideration of his mothers lamentable Murther doth pierce him to the heart with griefe, yet knowing him likewise to bee his Father, and himselfe his Sonne, hee freely and willingly offers the Captaine of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Iudges all his Estate to save his Fathers life, but this his robbere is so foule, and that former murther of his so inhumane and lamentable, yea so odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to God and the world, and so execrable to men and Angells that none will presume or dare to speake in his behalfe: So the next day <hi>Lorenzo</hi> is hanged, having first freely forgiven his Sonne <hi>Thomaso,</hi> and entreated him likewise to forgive him for murthering of his mother, and for any other thing else, hee at his death said little: But cursed the name and memory of that miserable and covetous wretch his Father in Law <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> whose unkindenesse and cruelty hee said had occasioned and brought him to all this misery. But he spake not a word of his griefe or sorrow for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving murthered his wife <hi>Fermia Moron;</hi> Onely he said and beleeved that this his untimely death was a just revenge and punishment of God to him for the same.</p>
                     <p>The common sort of the Spectators and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> seemed to taxe the Cardinall of Florence his Master for not saving this his Bakers life: but the wiser and more religious sort, applauded his generosity and piety for not attempting it from the Pope: But all doe admire and wonder at Gods sacred providence and divine Iustice in making the Sonne the cause and instrument of his fathers hanging for murthering of his mother, the which indeed gave cause of speech and matter of wonder to <hi>Rome, Genova, Savona,</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> yea to all <hi>Italy:</hi> And thus was the wicked life and deserved death

of this bloudy Villaine <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and in this manner did the Iustice of the Lord triumph ore his crime in his punishment. And as for his Sonne <hi>Thomaso</hi> (the Goldsmith) after this infamous and scandalous death of his Father, hee could no longer content himselfe to live in <hi>Rome,</hi> but returned to <hi>Savona</hi> to his Grandfather <hi>Moron,</hi> who received him with many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of Ioy, and affection, and after his death made him sole heire to all his wealth and Estate.</p>

Againe, <hi>Iaquinta</hi> is proud and stately, <hi>Babtistyna</hi> chollericke, sullen, and revengefull, and <hi>Amarantha</hi> (to the eye and judgement of the world) pleasant and courteous. Have we but a little patience, and we shall shortly see each of these three Sisters, appeare in their true coulers, and in very different wayes to act their severall partes upon the Stage and Theater of this their History.</p>

                        <hi>Streni</hi> seeing himselfe a widdower, not so much favoured of God to have any Sonne to enjoy his name and Landes, and all his three Daughters to be now capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

of marriage; He (as a provident and loving Father) holds it a great poynt of affection and discretion in him now to leave his Mannor house of <hi>Cardura</hi> neere <hi>Pistoia,</hi> and to betake himselfe to live and reside in <hi>Florence,</hi> hoping thereby with lesse difficulty, and farre more advantage, to looke out and provide fit Husbands for his daughters, answerable to their ranke and degree; which disposition and resolution of his pleased them well, and administred them cause of great content and joy, siith it is now growne to a custome, and a habit, that young Ladyes and Gentlewomen doe infinitely desire to live in great Townes and Cities, where they may see, and be seene, and especially in those of <hi>Italy,</hi> more then in any Country of the World, where the whole Nobilitie and Gentrie make all their aboad and resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the which indeed is one of the maine poynts, and essentiall reasons, why their Cities are so rich, populous, and fayre.</p>
                     <p>Thus we see <hi>Streni</hi> and his three Daughters by this time come to <hi>Florence,</hi> and dwel (as I have formerly said) neere the Monastery of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryers, where his wealth, birth, and port, cause him to be visited and frequented of the best and noblest sort of that Citie, and as the time of his residence, so the number of his acquaintance encreaseth, for vertue is capable to purchase friends every where, and his wealth and Daughters beauties like so many powerfull Lures and Adamants draw many young gallant Gentleman to his house to see and serve them; Where although <hi>Babtistyna</hi> and <hi>Amarantha,</hi> are beloved and sought in marriage of many, yet their Father is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute to marry their eldest Sister <hi>Iaquinta</hi> first, wherefore when any noblemen or Gentlemen come to his house, she is to be seene, and courted, but <hi>Babtistyna</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marantha</hi> are mewed and fast locked up in a Chamber. They grieve hereat, but they can neither alter nor remedy this their Fathers resolution, for his word must bee their Oracle, and his will their Law. Now before I proceed farther in the dilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this History, as I one way commend <hi>Streni</hi> his resolution to marry his eldest daughter first, so yet in approving his discretion for her preferment, I must never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse taxe his want of affection, in hindring that of his two youngest daughters; For as it was a courtesie of him to have <hi>Iaquinta</hi> seene of Suters, so it was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of dis-respect, I may say, of cruelty in him to confine <hi>Babtistyna</hi> and <hi>Amaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> as prisoners to their Chambers, when divers of them came purposely and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably to his house, both to see and seeke them in marriage.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Iaquinta</hi> (armed with her fathers love and authority) growes extremely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious and stately; She triumpheth in conceit to see her selfe preferred of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before her Sisters. Shee sees her two sisters <hi>Babtistyna</hi> and <hi>Amarantha</hi> are sued and sought for in marriage by divers Cavalliers, and the very consideration hereof grieves, and the remembrance afflicts her, but withall shee observes, that they dare not disobey, or contradict their fathers command, to affect or speake with any, and therefore the very knowledge and remembrance hereof, againe rejoyceth her. As it is a happinesse for us to purchase friends, so it is a misery to lose them. Her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters love her, but she loves not them, they are as unworthy of her hatred, as she is of their affection. Nature (indeed) hath given her the prerogative, and priviledge, but yet she should consider, that they are her Sisters, and not her Servants, and that their bloud is hers, and hers theirs. It is an argument both of indiscretion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencie, for one Brother or Sister to thinke themselves better then another; But many Gentlewomen, who are Sisters, esteeme pride a second beauty, or at least an excellent Grace and Ornament to them, and therefore to preferre and elevate themselves, they care not how they disparage and deiect others. The beauty of <hi>Babtistyna</hi> and <hi>Amarantha</hi> is an eye-sore to <hi>Iaquinta.</hi> The tree of malice never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth good fruit. It is still a happy vertue for us to checke and vanquish our
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:16653:238"/>
owne vices. She knowes that many Gentlemen love them, but sees and observes with griefe, that none affect her. Her desire to marry is so immodestly licentious and boundlesse, as she could willingly resolve to accept of any Gentleman for her husband, that would be content to take her for his wife: but Incontinencie prooves still a pernicious counsellor to young Ladies and Gentlewomen. Now, as <hi>Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> flie still to the fayrest flowers; so shee sees (and indeede infinitely bites the lip, and grieves to see) that all Lovers and Sutors flie to one of these her two Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and wholly abandon and forsake her selfe: but being a woman, she wants not an invention to apply a present remedy to this her discontent and choller. Shee must have her Sisters beauties and braveries eclipsed, that hers may appeare more bright, and resplend and shine with more lustre and glory: She knowes that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall seemes precious when Diamonds are not in place; to which end, shee very passionately, and yet subtilly workes upon the affections of her Father, and obtaines of him, that as her yeares, so her apparell may excell and exceede that of her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, the which hee inconsiderately grants her; and this shee receives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to bee a step to her advancement, and an obstacle to theirs. So if they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly grieved to see themselves imprisoned in a chamber, whiles shee to her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and pleasure rejoyceth both to see, and bee seene of Gentlemen: So now their discontent thereof growes into choller, and their choller into rage, to see this their elder sister <hi>Iaquinta</hi> not onely to step some degrees beyond them, but likewise many beyond her selfe in her apparell.</p>
                     <p>It is ever a wise and discreet vertue in Parents to distribute their favours and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections equally to their Children, or if they chance to affect one better then others, at least that they bee so reserved and cautious, as to conceale it secretly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that the rest may neither perceive nor know it. That <hi>Streni</hi> sought to marry <hi>Iaquinta</hi> before <hi>Babtistyna</hi> and <hi>Amarantha</hi> (as I formerly have sayd) he did well, but yet to make them lose when they might find and gaine a fortune, was withall to be indiscreet, if not unnaturall. Mens fancies and affections in marriage are many times counselled and led by the eye, as the eye is by the heart. Some will prise and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beauty without vertue, others vertue without beauty; but where both meete and concurre, it doth not onely please, but delight, and so joyntly sympathize to make each other excellent. Many of the best and noblest Cavalliers of <hi>Florence</hi> love <hi>Babtistyna</hi> and <hi>Amarantha,</hi> but not <hi>Iaquinta;</hi> or if they seeme to court <hi>Iaquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> it is but with a reserved hope and intent to injoy the sight and company of <hi>Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistyna</hi> and <hi>Amarantha:</hi> but as Iealousy and Malice have alwayes foure eyes in stead of two; so it is at least a torment, if not many deaths, to <hi>Iaquinta,</hi> to see her two Sisters to live and be beloved of all Sutors, and her selfe of none; the which to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and so to stop the progresse of their triumphs, and consequently of her owne discontent and affliction, she (not desirous to have two such starres of beauty to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare and shine together in the firmament of her Fathers house in <hi>Florence)</hi> doth so secretly undermine, and so cunningly prevail with him, as her two sisters (when they least dream or think thereof) are by his order and command suddenly sent away by Coach to his Countrey house of <hi>Cardura,</hi> neere <hi>Pistoia</hi> (whereof wee have already made mention) notwithstanding all their requests, sighes, and teares to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and there by his appoyntment to be privately and disconsolately shut up, from any accesse or conversation of any man whatsoever, and under the charge and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody of an old ill-favoured Beldame (sometimes their Schoolmistris) named <hi>Dona Malevola.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Babtistyna</hi> and <hi>Amarantha,</hi> being enforced to banishment from <hi>Florence</hi> to <hi>Cardura,</hi> beleeved that it proceeded as well by the pride and malice of their Sister <hi>Iaquinta</hi>
                        <pb n="429" facs="tcp:16653:238"/>
as by the severitie of their Father; They know not from what Saint to implore aide or assistance, or from what point their Art, or Invention to expect for hope or redresse hereof; But at length (being constrained to make a Vertue of Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) they brooke this their disgrace, with as much patience as they may, no way doubting (much lesse dispayring) but that a little time will worke a great alteration in their Estates and Fortunes; But seeing a moneth past over, and their Keeper <hi>Malevola,</hi> still more and more bent to restraine them of their liberty, without suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to see or speake with any stranger, or any stranger with them, they at last recollect, and plucke up their spirits to themselves, and so resolve to write a faire Letter to their Father, and a peremptory one to their Sister <hi>Iaquinta,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their returne to <hi>Florence,</hi> which they doe, and send it by one <hi>Bernardo</hi> a trusty Servant of theirs, That to their Father spake thus.</p>

                        <hi>Babtistyna</hi> and <hi>Amarantha</hi> having thus read and considered these two severall Letters of their Father and Sister <hi>Iaquinta,</hi> they are infinitely incensed and chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke to see his discourtesie, and her dissimulation and cruelty towards them, in that they must bee inforced to live a solitary countrey life in <hi>Cardura,</hi> whiles shee triumphs in pride, and flants it out in bravery in <hi>Florence;</hi> and as they much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine and murmure at his dis-affection, so they infinitely disdaine and complaine of her imperious courses and carriage towards them, adding no beliefe to her Letter, but judging it to be hypocriticall. They pitty the weakenesse of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers judgement, in suffering himselfe to bee so violently transported and carried away by the subtile policie and secret malice of their Sister towards them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in although their duety and obedience doe some way excuse his age, yet their blood and beauty can no way possibly dispense with the pride and malice of her youth, which they hourely see confirmed and made apparent in the unaccustomed strict and hard usage of their Governesse <hi>Malevola</hi> towards them, which with her best endeavours and ambition sought as well to captivate their mindes as their persons, by making her selfe to be as much their Goaler as their Governesse; but they vow to requite her unkindenesse, and to revenge their Sister <hi>Iaquinta's</hi> cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards them: They see her deformity in their beauty, her malice in their love, and her pride in their humility; so they alter the course of their naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and now decline, in stead of increasing, in sisterly love and charity towards this their Sister. To goe retrograde in vertue, is to goe forwards in vice; for as it is the marke, so it is the duety of Christians to render good for evill, but not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill for good: yea, all contrary examples and Axiomes are ill taught, and worse practised, and it is to bee feared, that the end thereof will produce at least sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, if not misery and destruction.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Baptistyna</hi> and <hi>Amarantha</hi> are too young and wilfull to make good use of their Sister <hi>Iaquinta's</hi> bad affection, and malicious carriage towards them; for else, had they had as much wit as beauty, or as much affection as malice, they would then flie that which they follow, and detest this bloudy designe and resolution of theirs, which they now intend to imbrace and put in practice. They are weary of their Sisters hard usage of them, they cannot digest her imperiousnesse and pride, and (in all outward semblance and apparance) if they stay from marriage till she be married, they may all dye Mayds, and as our English adage goes, <hi>Whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

ere shee bee a wife, they thereupon abandon all reason and religion, and so at one time beginne both to desire and to plot her death; and of these two wretched Sisters <hi>Babtistyna</hi> is the most forwards in this their intended deplorable busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; for she is so weake with God, and Sathan so strong with her, that she sayes often to her selfe, shee can reape no content in this world, before her Sister <hi>Iaquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> see another. It were better for us not to foresee a sinne, then seeing it, not to prevent, but perpetrate it. To which end, shee purposely lets fall some words to her Sister <hi>Amarantha,</hi> tending, and bending that way; but <hi>Amarantha</hi> is too curteous to be so cruell, and too religious to bee so outragious and diabolicall to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, especially to her Sister: had shee lived in the piety, and persevered in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of this opinion and conscience, peradventure her dayes had seene: better fortunes, and her end beene freed from so much misery. It is not enough for us to bee vertuous and godly, except wee religiously and faithfully continue therein; for constancie in all good and pious actions, makes men and women excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and of being wholly mortall, to become (in a manner) partly divine: But (to report truth in her naked colours) <hi>Amarantha</hi> is too weake to resist her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Babtistyna's</hi> strong temptations and perswasions. It is an excellent vertue and happinesse in us, to have our eares still open to good counsell, and shut to that which is evill and pernicious: but <hi>Amarantha</hi> hoping and desiring to gaine a good Husband, makes her in a small time consent to the losse of a bad Sister; and now shee is therefore fully resolved to joyne with <hi>Baptistyna,</hi> to make <hi>Iaquinta</hi> away, Good God, what cruelty, rage, and barbarisme is it for two Sisters to resolve to murther their third! But this is not all; for we shall see more bloud spilt upon the Theater of this History, before we see the Catastrophe thereof. These two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall young Gentlewomen having thus swapt a bargaine with the Devill to dispatch their Sister <hi>Iaquinta,</hi> they now consult on the manner thereof, whether or no, they should performe it, with Ponyard, or Poyson; but at last they agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Poyson, but disagree which of them shall administer it to her, and if there were anysparke of grace remaining in either of these two bloudy minded Sisters, it was in <hi>Amarantha;</hi> for she cannot finde in her heart or conscience to doe it, and yet she is so gracelesse and impious, as shee freely gives way to the performance of this bloudy fact; so in the end, they fall upon this ungodly resolution, that Lots must decide it: thus the Devill holds, and they as his infernall factors and agents, draw them, and it falls to <hi>Babtistyna</hi> to doe it. But here ere they proceede farther in the progresse of this lamentable businesse, and how to execute it, they are now as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayld with a doubt and difficulty of no meane importance; for as they hold it requisite for them to performe this Murther in <hi>Florence,</hi> so they know not how to escape from their watchfull Governesse <hi>Malevola</hi> from <hi>Cardura:</hi> but they are Women, and therefore they will bee industrious in their malice; they are La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and therefore they will bee swift and subtile in their revenge; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gold (though not their liberty at their command) they resolve that the first shall speedily procure the second: To which end, they, by their servant <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo,</hi> secretly hire a Coach for foure Duckatons, the next night to carry them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way very closely and privately from <hi>Cardura</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> and with so many more to corrupt the Gardiner to give him the Key of the Garden Posterne gate; both which (with much care, fidelity, and silence) hee effecteth, being himselfe onely by them appoynted to attend, and commanded to accompany them in this their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Governesse <hi>Malevola</hi> was in bed and fast asleepe, who was as innocent as they were guilty of this their clandestine departure, in comes <hi>Bernardo</hi> about midnight to their chamber doore, to which giving a soft knocke, they presently descend the stayres with him to the Garden, and from thence to the Coach, wherein sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselves, they leave <hi>Cardura,</hi> and so with great speed drive away for <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> where they arrive to their Fathers house, betwixt nine or ten of the clocke the next morning, hee much wondring, and their sister <hi>Iaquinta</hi> extreamely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and grieved at this their suddaine and unexpected arrivall, they cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at their Fathers feete, and crave his blessing and excuse, but hee receives them with more anger then joy, and so gives them frownes and checks in stead of Kisses: He heares their reasons of their unlook'd for departure from <hi>Cardura,</hi> which hee rejects both with contempt and choller, sharpely reproves their disobedience, and voweth speedily to returne them; they answer him, that his presence is the sole felicity and glory of their life, and that they had rather dye with him in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> then live without him in <hi>Cardura.</hi> As for their Sister <hi>Iaquinta,</hi> shee dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles her love to them, as they doe their malice to her; for whiles shee secretly wisheth them out of <hi>Florence,</hi> so (in counterchange) do they as silently wish &amp; desire her in heaven: but after a day or two was past over, then their hypocrisie and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation was such each to other, as (to the eye of the world) it seemed they could not be better friends, nor dearer or kinder Sisters, then now they were; so artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially could all of them overvaile their malice, and so cunningly could they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale their different intentions, thereby the better to compose their countenances and speeches. But when <hi>Iaquinta</hi> againe perceives that the Gallants of <hi>Florence</hi> doe afresh repayre and flocke to her Fathers house, purposely to neglect her, and to admire and adore the excellent beauties of these her two younger Sisters, then her old jealousie revives, and inflame her new malice towards them; so as with all her power and art, shee againe secretly tampers with her Father, either to returne them againe to <hi>Cardura,</hi> or to contract and espouse them to a Nunnery, that shee might thereby triumph alone at her pleasure, and being then sole heire to all his lands and estate, might wed her self to the greater fortune, and nobler Husband; and she wanted neither sighes nor teares to draw him to this her earnest desire and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</p>
                     <p>This is not so secretly borne betwixt their Father and Sister <hi>Iaquinta,</hi> but <hi>Babtistyna</hi> and <hi>Amarantha</hi> have present and pregnant notice heereof, the which strongly and fully to prevent, they (now incouraged and animated by the Devill) resolve to reduce, and draw their bloudy contemplation into action, and so (with more hast then good speed) to dispatch their Sister for heaven, because they loved <hi>Florence,</hi> disdayned <hi>Cardura,</hi> and above all (from their hearts and soules) infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detested to spend and end their dayes in a Nunnery; when neither having the feare of God in their hearts, nor his justice or judgements before their eyes, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantha</hi> buies the poyson, and <hi>Babtistyna</hi> administreth it to their Sister <hi>Iaquinta,</hi> in a Lemmon posset, which they observed she often used to drinke the Summer time, so that some ten dayes after she dyed hereof, when none but God, besides them, was witnesse of this their unnaturall and bloudy businesse: So they rejoice as much as their father grieves and sorrowes hereat, and now they are alone, and domineere at their pleasures in their Fathers house at <hi>Florence,</hi> without rivalls o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and the fresh roses and lillies of her beauty did exceedingly fade, and wither of the Iaundies: A sicknesse, which I thinke God sent her purposely to punish her for that execrable crime of hers in poysoning her Sister. But the beauty of <hi>Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistyna</hi> cannot be so much eclipsed or deformed, as that of <hi>Amarantha</hi> daily growes more deliciously sweet, and sweetly delicious and amiable; so as all those No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Gallants of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Tuscanie,</hi> who come to seeke <hi>Streni</hi> his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in marriage, doe infinitely preferre <hi>Amarantha</hi> before <hi>Babtistyna,</hi> and passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately desire the first, as much as they now sleight and neglect the second: <hi>Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistyna</hi> is not ignorant hereof, but sees it with griefe, observes it with sorrow, and remembers it with choller and indignation; and yet she seekes and strives to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it from her Father, and to dissemble it to her Sister <hi>Amarantha.</hi> She in this wane of her beauty and joy, beginnes now to participate of her dead sister <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinta's</hi> living humours and conditions; she is now become the eldest Sister, and therefore will not permit or suffer her younger to bee her mate, or equall, much lesse her superiour; and although her Sicknesse hath depriv'd her of a great part of her beauty, yet it hath no way diminished, but rather increased and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her desire to marry, shee envies the sight and fame of her Sister <hi>Amarantha's</hi> beauty, as much as shee lamenteth the decayes, and pittyeth the ruines of her owne; and both grieves and scornes to see so many Gallants court and seeke her in marriage, and none her selfe: Now as pride and malice (for the most part) are in separable companions, so her discontent hereof hath made her so devillish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly malicious, as shee secretly vowes to her selfe, that shee could almost finde in her heart to make <hi>Amarantha</hi> as well a companion of <hi>Iaquinta's</hi> fortune, as of her bloud: but God then presenting her first Murther to her eyes and remembrance, the devil was not then enough prevalent or powerful with her, to draw her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or commit a second. Thus not being willing to adde murther to murther, and so to gallop in stead of pacing to hell and destruction, she neverthelesse deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately resolves to emulate and imitate the actions of her dead Sister <hi>Iaquinta,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her living one <hi>Amarantha;</hi> and yet so to wreake her malice and revenge on her, as closely to insinuate, and under hand surreptiously to prevaile with her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that shee bee speedily eclipsed, and againe sent away to <hi>Cardura,</hi> under the guard and custody of <hi>Malevola,</hi> the which shee effectually and briefely obtayneth of him; so our young and faire <hi>Amarantha</hi> (though infinitely against her will) is now inforced to leave <hi>Florence,</hi> and suddainely (when shee least thought or dreamt thereof) is againe confined and banished to <hi>Cardura,</hi> notwithstanding all her sighes, teares, and prayers to her Father to the contrary.</p>

                        <hi>Amarantha</hi> (with much sorrow and more indignation) being arrived to <hi>Cardura,</hi> she is not a little perplexed and grieved therat, but rather exceedingly discontented with her Father, and infinitely incensed against her Sister <hi>Babtistyna</hi> for the same, as well knowing that it wholly proceeded from her meere pride and malice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her; the which she now doth not conceale, but make apparant to her old Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Governesse <hi>Malevola,</hi> both in her lookes, speeches, and actions.

                        <hi>Amarantha</hi> is all inflamed with choller at this proud and cruell carriage of her Sister <hi>Babtistyna</hi> towards her, yea the remembrance thereof, so transporteth her thoughts with envie, and her heart with revenge against her, that shee vowes shee neither can, nor will brooke it at her hands; and heere, not hearkening either to Reason, or Religion, or to her Conscience, or Soule, shee now violently se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and exasperated by the Devill, doth afresh revive her old malice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes her former pernicious resolutions to her Sister <hi>Babtistyna:</hi> Shee hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wit, much lesse the grace, to consider, That Choller increaseth her own torment and misery, and that if wee vanquish not our owne malice and revenge, it is more to bee feared then doubted, that it will in the end both vanquish and ruine us.

O that so young a Lady, and so sweete a beauty should make her selfe accessary and guilty of so foule
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:16653:243"/>
and inhumane crimes: but this I may write to her shame, and the Reader may please to observe it to his comfort, and retaine it to his instruction; That had she had the grace to have beene formerly sorrowfull and repentant for her first Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, she had then never proceeded so farre, as to have made het selfe guilty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving and resolving a second.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Babtistyna</hi> hath a Chamber-mayd named <hi>Pierya,</hi> of some twenty foure yeares old, who was farre more faire then rich, as being heire to much beauty, though to no lands, or estate; and having hereto fore for some trivial respects somtimes incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the anger and displeasure of her Lady, and for the same received many a sharp word, and bitter blow from her, as being a freer Gentlewoman of her hands, then of her purse; Shee now accidentally chancing to breake a faire rich Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-glasse of hers, her Lady doth not onely exceedingly beat her, but also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pitty or humanity drawes and drags her by the haire about her Chamber, and then againe and againe kickes her with her foot. <hi>Pierya's</hi> heart is not so ill lodged, nor her extraction and quality so contemptible, but that shee is very sensible of this her disgrace, as holding her fault farre inferiour to her correction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore disdaining any longer to serve so cruell a Mistresse, she very privately packes up her apparell, leaves <hi>Florence,</hi> and flies to <hi>Cardura,</hi> forsakes <hi>Babtistyna,</hi> and so resolves henceforth to live and dye with her younger Sister <hi>Amarantha:</hi> But as there are many of both these places, who report that it was onely her hatred to <hi>Babtistyna,</hi> and her affection to <hi>Amarantha,</hi> which drew her to this resolution; yet there are diverse others both of <hi>Florence, Cardura,</hi> and <hi>Pistoia,</hi> who (better acquainted with <hi>Pierya,</hi> and her secrets) have solidly affirmed to mee, that it was wholly her affection to <hi>Bernardo,</hi> which was the truest reason, and strongest motive thereof, and the event and issue of this History, will confute the first, to confirme this second opinion of these her deliberations and resolutions; for, for the terme of at least three or foure yeares heretofore, <hi>Pierya</hi> was knowne to be passionately in love with <hi>Bernardo,</hi> and shee had imployed many friends towards him, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade and draw him to marry her; but hee was still as averse, as shee forward in this sute: For although hee were inamoured of her beauty, and loved her tall and slender personage, yet hee hated her poverty, and (because of some small lands and meanes hee had) as hee thought himselfe too good to bee her husband, so she in regard of her beauty, youth, and chastity, both highly and infinitely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned to bee his strumpet; and indeed the passage, and processe of these their affections was not from time to time unknowne to <hi>Amarantha. Pierya</hi> is as wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to <hi>Amarantha,</hi> as <hi>Babtistyna</hi> is sorrowfull for her departure, and the youngest Sister now entertaynes her with as much courtesie, as the eldest formerly retayned her with cruelty; as for <hi>Bernardo,</hi> hee inwardly delights, though outwardly will not seeme to rejoyce in her company, and so gives her his eyes, though not his heart; and for <hi>Pierya,</hi> her carriage was so modest, and yet withall so respective to him, as if shee indeavoured to make it her chiefest ambition and glory, that her vertues and chastity should make as true and as perfect a conquest of his heart, as her beauty had of his eyes: as for <hi>Babtistyna</hi> (her quondam Lady) she is now angry with her selfe, as soone as shee knew of her departure from her; but when shee understands that <hi>Pierya</hi> is fled to <hi>Cardura,</hi> and lives with her discontented Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Amarantha,</hi> then (under hand) shee makes strong meanes to her to returne againe to her service, intimating to her that shee is ready to redeeme her former discourtesie towards her, both with acknowledgement and requitall. But these her hopes will deceive her, for she will finde that errors are not so soone repayred as committed, and that her want of kindenesse to her Chamber-mayd <hi>Pierya</hi> may
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:16653:243"/>
in the end (perchance) prove cruelty to her selfe. <hi>Pierya</hi> is deafe to all these her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>o <hi>Babtistyna's</hi> old unkindnesse, as preferring the courtesie of the first to the choller and indignation of the second. On the other side, <hi>Amarantha</hi> is glad of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of her new Mayd <hi>Pierya;</hi> for the Devill being still at her elbow, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually sets fire to her malice, and (as an infernall incendiary) perpetually blowes the coles to her revenge against her Sister <hi>Babtistyna;</hi> yea, and now he so captivateth her soule, and extinguisheth her devotion and zeale towards heaven, that (I write it with pitty and sorrow, and not with passion, but compassion) shee had neither the power to pray, nor the happinesse or grace, either to frequent the Church for Gods sake, or to desire Gods presence and assistance for her owne: No, no; Such thoughts of piety were farre from her prophane thoughts and minde: for as her best blood, so her best zeale was now corrupted and polluted with revenge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her Sister. And here, as a wretched Lady and a bloudy Sister, shee doth yet farre worse; for (by the Devills suggestion) shee assumes this horrible reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, not onely to ingage and hazard her selfe, but others therein, as if shee tooke a pride, and conceived a glory, not to shipwracke her selfe alone, but to confound and cast away others with her for company in this prodigious and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable businesse of hers. The manner is thus:</p>
                     <p>Shee knowes, that by reason of her strict exile in <hi>Cardura,</hi> she must needes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy some factors and agents, either to poyson or murther this her Sister <hi>Babtistyna</hi> in <hi>Florence;</hi> and therefore shee thinkes none so fit and proper to attempt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, as her old trusty servant <hi>Bernardo,</hi> and her new mayd <hi>Pierya</hi> his sweet-heart, whom (by degrees) shee purposely drawes and obligeth to her by gifts and promises; and her reason for this conceipt and opinion of hers, that they will concurre with her in this bloudy fact, is derived from this foundation and ground, that Love and Money may easily act wonders in the hearts and mindes of those, who desire the one, and want the other; as also, for that shee perfectly knowes, that for many yeares <hi>Pierya</hi> hath deepely loved <hi>Bernardo,</hi> and deerely desired and wished him for her husband, and that hee hath ever affected her, but onely disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her poverty: Wherfore believing that she would doe much for the obtayning of this husband, and he for preferment and gold, she is resolute in making this her bloudy proposition to them; when not caring any more to write to her Father, shee is now as hasty as bloudy in her malice and revenge towards her Sister; and so impatient of delay (and without any further consideration with her selfe, or consultation either with her soule, or with God) shee taking time at advantage, first breakes with <hi>Pierya</hi> about this bloudy businesse, adding withall, that her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and resolution is to have her Sister <hi>Babtistyna</hi> stifled in her bed; for now the Devill hath cast off her resolutions from poyson or ponyard; to which effect, shee promiseth to gaine her <hi>Bernardo</hi> to her husband, and to give them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to maintayne themselves well being marryed, if shee will consent with him to undertake and performe her request: which profers and promises of her Lady doe sound so sweetly in poore <hi>Pierya's</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Amarantha</hi> having thus given this promise to <hi>Bernardo,</hi> and likewise received his, and his intended wifes <hi>Pierya's</hi> oaths in counterchange, she now thinkes with her selfe, that she must againe returne <hi>Pierya</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> and by some slie hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, to reinvest and skrew her anew into her old Lady <hi>Babtistyna's</hi> service, thereby to be the more able and fit to dispatch her. Now, as she is maliciously rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on this invention, there falls out an accident, which seemes both to favour her hopes, and to further her desires and expectation herein; For by this time, <hi>Babtistyna</hi> writes over to <hi>Malevola,</hi> to deale secretly and seriously with <hi>Pierya</hi> for her returne to <hi>Florence</hi> to her service, and that shee shall finde her welcome to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed her expectation and desires: So the truth is apparant, that <hi>Pierya</hi> (instructed by the Premises) now needs not many great perswasions from <hi>Malevola,</hi> to draw her to consent to this resolution; for as she and her <hi>Bernardo</hi> receive the first motion of this (unexpected) newes with joy, so <hi>Amarantha</hi> imbraceth and entertaines it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and now their last consultation is held between them, about the conclusion and finishing of this mournefull businesse. To which end, <hi>Pierya</hi> is dispatched for <hi>Florence,</hi> and the fifteenth day after, <hi>Bernardo</hi> is likewise secretly and precisely to arrive there to her by night, and then is, the direct appoynted time for them to close and shut up this Tragedy. Wee must now allow and conceive <hi>Pierya</hi> to be againe entertayned of her old Lady <hi>Babtistyna</hi> in <hi>Florence,</hi> with much courtesie and joy; and for the seale and cyment of this their reciprocall reconciliation, her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy gives her a new blacke wrought Silke Gowne, and a purple Damaske Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, the which (as a treacherous dissembling wretch) she seemes to receive of her with much content and thankefulnesse, the which yet wee shall shortly see her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite with a most inhumane and prodigious ingratitude; for her desire of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and longing for a husband makes her thinke every houre ten, before the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day bee arrived. And for her late Lady <hi>Amarantha</hi> (who sees by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eyes but by those of malice and revenge towards her Sister) shee thinkes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day an age, before shee heare of her dispatch. At the expiration of which time (according to their former agreement) <hi>Bernardo</hi> arrived by night at <hi>Streni's</hi> house in <hi>Florence,</hi> and at one of the Clocke after midnight hee findes the little Garden doore open, and his <hi>Pierya</hi> there purposely to receive and welcome him; so they beginne their meeting with kisses. Shee leades him by the hand to the outer doore of her Ladies chamber, and they two having agreed on the manner how to stifle her in her bed, shee had there to that purpose provided two pillowes, keepes one and gives him another to effect it: These miserable wretches (for the more secrecie) put off their shooes, and out the candles, and the darknesse of the Moone, and the obscurity of the night seeming to conspire to their conspiracie, they softly enter her chamber, goe one by one side, and the other by the other, where unfortunat <hi>Babtistyna</hi> lying soundly sleeping and snoring, they stifle her with their Pillowes, and then a little whiles after thrust a handkercher into her mouth, and their fury and malice was so fierce and implacable towards her, as shee hath neither the grace to speake, nor the power once to screech or crye. Thus she who

had formerly poysoned her elder Sister <hi>Iaquinta,</hi> is now also cruelly murthered by the treachery of her youngest <hi>Amarantha,</hi> which makes me crie out and say, <hi>O Lord, as thou art immense in thy mercie, so thou art inscrutable in thy judgements, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as wee ought not, so we cannot resist his divine power and eternall preordination.</hi>

All that night <hi>Bernardo's</hi> dead body lay gored in his blood (which abundantly issued forth his mouth) as also in the dirt of the street, unespyed of any mortall eye; but as soone as the morning began to appeare thorow the windowes of heaven, then it was found, and likewise to bee done by the fall of a horse, whereof his necke the beholders saw was broken, the which the sooner they were induced and led to believe, because they likewise found a horse neere him stragling in the streets without his rider: This his dead body is therefore presently exposed to the Criminall Iudges of that faire and famous City, who forthwith cause his Pockets to be searched, where in stead of gold they by the direction of God find the before nominated promise of a yearly Annuity, which we have formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood <hi>Amarantha</hi> gave him: Whereupon, they knowing the Lady <hi>Amarantha</hi> to be <hi>Seig.

But the newes of this dead found Corps ratling thorow the streets of the City, it devanceth this care of theirs, and so speedily arrives to <hi>Streni's</hi> house before them; whereat <hi>Pierya</hi> (looking for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse) takes so hot an allarum of griefe, feare, and despaire, that her guilty thoughts and conscience (like so many Blood-hounds) still pursuing her, she see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this unlookt for disaster and death of her <hi>Bernardo</hi> to bee an act of God, and a blow from heaven, which infallibly predicted both her danger and death; she therefore presently flies out a doore, and (with much celerity, and more feare) betakes her selfe to the least frequented and most remotest streets of the City for
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:16653:245"/>
her safety. By this time the Criminall officers are arrived at <hi>Streni's</hi> house, whom they acquaint with this mournefull accident, shew him this assurance of Annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and inquire of him if it bee the Lady <hi>Amarantha</hi> his Daughters hand, as also the dead Corps, and if this were her servant, who (with a countenance compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of astonishment, feare, and sorrow) acknowledgeth to them, that it is his Daughter <hi>Amarantha's</hi> owne hand writing, and the dead personage to bee her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingman <hi>Bernardo:</hi> Whereupon they confidently believe, and hee sorrowfully feares, that this death of his, and that assurance of hers, doth either import or include some greater disaster and misfortune; whereupon, they againe modestly, yet juridically, demand of him for his Daughter <hi>Amarantha,</hi> and her Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayd <hi>Pierya,</hi> who returnes them this answer, that the first is at his Mannor of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dura</hi> neere <hi>Pistoia,</hi> and the second here in his house, and now serving his eldest Daughter <hi>Babtistyna;</hi> they demand to speake with <hi>Pierya,</hi> whom hee causeth to bee sought in all places of his house, but shee is not to bee found; so hee sends to looke her in his Daughters chamber, her Mistresse, but his servants returne and report that the doore of that Chamber is fast lock'd, and that they can get no speech either of her, or of the Lady <hi>Babtistyna;</hi> which answer of theirs doth exceedingly augment the jealousie of the Iudges, and the feare of the Father: So <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

They are amazed, and her Father <hi>Streni</hi> almost drowned in his sorrowfull teares at the fight of this deplorable accident, and mournefull spectacle; and therefore what to say, or how to beare himselfe herein hee knowes not.</p>
                     <p>But the Iudges upon farther knowledge and consideration of the flight of <hi>Pierya,</hi> the death of <hi>Bernardo,</hi> and the promised Annuity of <hi>Amarantha</hi> upon their marriage (as it were prompted by God) doe vehemently suspect and believe that they all three were undoubtedly consenting &amp; guilty of <hi>Babtistyna's</hi> death, notwithstanding that the Key of her Chamber was found thrown in within side: So they presently leave this sorrowfull Father to his teares, and betaking themselves to their Seat of Iustice, doe instantly cause all the Gates of the City to be shut, and a strict and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious search to be made in all parts thereof, for the apprehension of <hi>Pierya,</hi> which (in their zeale and honour to sacred justice) they performe with so much care and speed, as within three houres after shee is found out, and apprehended in an Aunts house of hers, who was a poore woman and a Laundresse of that City named <hi>Eleanora Fracasa.</hi> The Iudges being presently advertised hereof, convent her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and (by vertue of this Annuity) charge both her and her lover <hi>Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> to bee the actors, and <hi>Amarantha</hi> to bee at least the accessary, if not the authour with them of murthering <hi>Babtistyna,</hi> shee can hardly speake for teares at this her examination, because her sighes still cut her words in pieces; and yet she is so farre from grace and repentance, as at first shee stoutly denyes all, and boldly affirmes that both <hi>Amarantha, Bernardo,</hi> and her selfe were every way innocent of attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing against <hi>Babtistyna's</hi> life, and that if shee were dead, shee dyed onely of a naturall death by the appoyntment of God, and no otherwise; and to this Answer of hers the Devill had made her so strong, as shee added many fearfull oaths and deprecations, both for her owne and their justification; but yet (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

this her Apologie) these grave and cleere-fighted Iudges are so farre from diminishing, as they augment their suspition both of her and them, and so commit her to prison, and forthwith to the racke. At the pronouncing of which Sentence, <hi>Pierya</hi> is much daunted, seemes to let fall some of her former fortitude and constancie, and to burst forth into many passionate teares, sighs, and exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But they will nothing availe her; for, seeing her pretended Husband <hi>Bernardo</hi> dead, in whom lived the imaginary joyes of her heart, shee so fainted, as at the very first sight of the Racke (with some teares, and more deep fetch'd sighes) shee confessed to her Iudges, that shee and <hi>Bernardo</hi> had stifled her Lady <hi>Babtistyna</hi> in her bed; but still constantly affirmed that her sister <hi>Amarantha</hi> was wholly innocent thereof, flattering her selfe with this hope, that for thus her clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of her Lady <hi>Amarantha</hi> from this crime and danger, shee (in requitall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) could doe no lesse then bee a meanes to procure a pardon for her life: But these hopes of hers will deceive her, and flie as fast from her hereafter, as ever shee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did from God. So the Iudges (in detestation of this her foule and bloudy crime) adjudge her to bee hanged for the same; but first they send her backe to prison, and the very next morning before breake of day, they secretly send away three of their <hi>Isbieres</hi> (or Sergeants) to <hi>Cardura,</hi> to fetch the Lady <hi>Amarantha</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> being very confident (notwithstanding <hi>Pierya's</hi> denyall) that shee likewise had a deepe finger and share in her Sister <hi>Babtistyna's</hi> murther.</p>

                     <p>The truth and decorum of this History must now invite the Reader to visite <hi>Amarantha</hi> in prison, who being there debarr'd from speaking with any, or any with her, except (those miserable comforters) her Sergeants and Goalers, shee now seeing the imminencie of her danger, and fearing the assurance of her death, for that shee heard a secret inckling (from the lower Court, through her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber window) <hi>That her Sister</hi> Babtistyna <hi>was murthered, her Mayd</hi> Pierya <hi>imprisoned, and shee her selfe vehemently suspected for the same:</hi> Shee therefore now beginnes to think of her former bloudy crimes with repentance, and of these her inhumane cruelties towards her two elder Sisters with contrition, and solemnly vowes to God, that if his divine Majesty will now please to save her life, shee will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth religiously redeeme the first and second with repentance. So in the middest of these good thoughts, though vaine desires and wishes of hers, shee yet still flatters her selfe with this poore hope, that if her man <hi>Bernardo</hi> bee living, then her promised Annuity to him written with her owne hand is still sure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tacitly dead in his custody; and that both hee and <hi>Pierya</hi> cannot any way wrong her without infinitely wronging themselves, and indangering their owne lives: so albeit her Iudges have matter of suspicion, yet they can have no cause of death against her, or if peradventure they have, yet that the power of her Fathers greatnesse and friends are so prevalent in <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Tuscany,</hi> that (if the worst fall out) he and they can obtaine at least her reprivall for the present, if not her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the future.

At which speeches of her Iudges, and confession and death of <hi>Pierya,</hi> this wretched and unfortunate Lady <hi>Amarantha</hi> (seeing her selfe so palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly convicted of this her bloudy and inhumane crime) being wholly vanquished either with feare toward her selfe, or choller towards <hi>Pierya,</hi> she falls on her knees to her Iudges feet, and (with a great showre of teares) makes her selfe (by her free confession) to bee the prime authour of her Sister <hi>Babtistyna's</hi> murther; That shee had hired <hi>Bernardo</hi> and <hi>Pierya</hi> to performe it, and given him an Annuity of 150 Duckatons <hi>per annum,</hi> and to each of them 50 Duckatons more in hand to that effect, concealing no poynt or part therof, as we have already formerly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood: when (contrary to the expectation of her Iudges) she most bitterly exclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on the name, memory, and ingratitude of this base wretch <hi>Pierya</hi> (for so shee then termed her) in that she could not be contented to die her self, but also as much, and as maliciously, as in her power, to think likewise to hazard her owne life with her. And now our chollericke, and yet sorrowfull <hi>Amarantha</hi> (between these two different extreames of hope and feare) layes hold of her Iudges late promise and profered courtesie to her to save her, and then and there (with many reverences, teares, and ringing of her hands) most humbly beseecheth them for Gods sake, and for honours cause, to bee good unto her, and to give her her life, although she confesseth she is most worthy of death, in being so degenerate and bloudy minded towards her owne Sister. But they (having by this commendable meanes, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall policie, drawn this worme from <hi>Amarantha's</hi> tongue, I meane this truth from her mouth) are exceeding sorrowfull, and as much detest this her barbarous fact, as they pitty her descent, youth, and beauty; but well knowing with themselves that God is glorifyed in the due and true execution of Iustice upon all capitall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, and especially on murtherers (who are no lesse then monsters of nature, the disgrace of their times, and the very butchers of mankinde) and that the greatnesse of their quality and blood doth onely serve but to make these crimes of theirs the greater: therefore (I say) these wise and religious Iudges proove deafe to her requests, and blinde to her teares; and so having first caused then to signe this her confession, and then confronted her with <hi>Pierya,</hi> who now to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantha's</hi> face confirmed as much as she her selfe right now confessed and affirmed, they now in expiation of this her cruell murther, adjudge her likewise to bee hanged the next day, at the common place of execution, in company of <hi>Pierya,</hi> although her aged sorrowfull Father <hi>Seignior Strent</hi> (being well nigh weighed

down to his grave with the extreme grief and sorrow of these his misfortunes and calamities) profered the Iudges and the great Duke the greatest part of his estate, and lands, to save this his youngest, and now his only Daughter <hi>Amarantha:</hi> But his labor proved lost, and his care and affection vaine in this his sute and solicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because those learned Iudges, and this prudent and noble Duke, grounded their resolutions and pleasures upon this wholsom and true Maxime, That Iustice is one of the greatest Colossus and strongest columns of kingdoms and common-weales, and the truest way and means to preserve them in florishing prosperity and glory, and consequently, that all wilfull and premeditated murtherers cannot bee either too soone exterminated, or too severely punished, and cut off from the world. So <hi>Amar antha</hi> with more choller then sorrow, and <hi>Pierya</hi> with more feare then choller, are now both sent backe to their prisons; and that night <hi>Streni</hi> sends his Daughter, and the Iudges send <hi>Pierya,</hi> some Fryers and Nunnes to prepare their soules for heaven, but (in honour of the truth) I must affirme with equall griefe and pitty, that both these two female monsters had their hearts so sealed, and their soules so seared up with impiety, that neither of them could there be perswaded, or drawne, either to thinke of repentance or of God.</p>
                     <p>Whiles thus <hi>Florence</hi> resounds of these their foule and inhumane crimes, as also of their just condemnations, the next morning about ten of the clocke, they are brought to the destin'd place of execution, there to receive their condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments for the same. <hi>Pierya</hi> first mounts the Ladder, who made a short speech at her death, to this effect, That her desire to obtaine <hi>Bernardo</hi> for her husband had chiefely drawne her to commit this murther on her Lady <hi>Babtistyna,</hi> and that it was farre more her Sister <hi>Amarantha's</hi> malice to her, then her owne, which seduced her to this bloudy resolution; and that this her owne shamefull death was not halfe so grievous to her, as the unfortunate end of her lover <hi>Bernardo,</hi> whom, shee there affirmed to the world, and tooke it to her death, that shee loved a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times dearer then her owne life, with many other vaine and ridiculous spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches tending that way, and which savoured more of her fond affection to him, then of any zeale or devotion to God; and therefore I hold them every way more worthy of my silence, then of my relation: and so shee was turned over.

once looking up towards heaven, or inviting or praying her spectatours to pray to God for her soule, shee (with a gracelesse resolution, and prophane bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) conjured her Executioner speedily to performe his office and duety, which by the command of the Magistrate he-forthwith did. So this wretched <hi>Amaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> was hanged for her second murther, and then by a second decree and sentence of the Criminall Iudges, her body is after dinner burnt to ashes for her first; who likewise, in honour to Iustice, and to the glory of God, doe also cause the dead body of <hi>Bernardo</hi> (for two whole dayes) to bee hanged by his feet in his shirt to the same Gallowes, and then to bee cast into the River of <hi>Arno.</hi> And here the Iudges also, to shew themselves, themselves, were once of opinion to have unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed <hi>Babtistyna,</hi> and likewise to have given her dead body some opprobrious pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, for being accessary with her Sister <hi>Amarantha</hi> to poyson their elder Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Iaquinta;</hi> but having no other evidence or proofe hereof, but onely the tessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of her condemned dying Sister <hi>Amarantha,</hi> whom it was more probable then impossible, shee might speake it more out of malice then truth, as also that God had already afflicted a deplorable end and punishment to her, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore omitted it.

knowne, and famous in that City, Province, and Kingdome) who had by her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased Husband <hi>Don Roderigo de Ricaldo,</hi> two sonnes, <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and <hi>Don Martino,</hi> and one Daughter named <hi>Dona Cecilliana.</hi> Her eldest sonne <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Cavallier of some eight and twenty yeares of age, tall, and well-timbred, by complexion and hayre blacke, and of a swart and martiall countenance, who for the space of seven yeares served as a voluntary Gentleman under that wise and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Commander <hi>Don Gonsalez de Cordova</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and against the Lords States of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and since in the <hi>Voltoline</hi> and <hi>Millane,</hi> against the <hi>Grisons</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> In both which warres, he left behind him many memorable testimonies of his prowesse, and purchased divers honorable trophees of true valour, and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity: but for any other intellectuall endowments of the minde, hee was no schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and but of an indifferent capacity, yet very honest, courteous, and affable, particularly to his friends, and generally to all the world. His Brother <hi>Don Martino</hi> was of some foure and twenty yeares of age, short of stature, very slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but crooke-back'd, of an Aubrun hayre, a withered face, a squint eye, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination extreamely sullen, and of disposition and nature envious and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as desirous rather to entertaine a night-quarrell in the street, then a day-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in the Field; but as God is many times pleased to countervaile and reward the defects of nature in the body, with some rich gifts and perfections of the mind, so though not by profession, yet by education he was an excellent Scholler, of an active and sharpe wit, a fluent tongue, and singularly able either to allure or divert, to perswade or disswade, according as the streame of his different passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affections led him; Vertues enough relucent and excellent to build a fame, and sufficient to rayse an eminent fortune, if his former vices doe not too fatally eclipse the one, and deface the other. Their Sister <hi>Cecilliana</hi> (aged of some twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares) was of an indifferent height, but growing to corpulencie and fatnesse, of a blacke hayre, an amiable browne complexion, a big rolling eye, and the ayre of her countenance rather beautifully amorous, then modestly beautifull: Shee was of a nimble wit, of humour pleasant and facetious, yet so reserved in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall demonstration thereof, that through her Mothers pious and austere edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of her, shee (in all outward semblance) seemed rather to bee fit for a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery then a Husband, and more proper to make a Saint, then a Wife; but as the face proves not still a true Index of the heart, nor our lookes and speeches still a true Sybile of our soules, so how retired soever her Mother kept her from the company of men, yet her wanton eye, conspiring with her lascivious heart, made her the more desirous thereof, and farre the more licentiously, in regard shee was strictly forbidden it; so as (not to contradict or dissemble the truth) I am here inforced to relate and affirme, that shee imparteth her favours upon two or three young Gentlemen of that Citie, of her private acquaintance, and is more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar with them, then modesty can well warrant, or chastity allow of. But there is a young Gallant of this City likewise (more noble by birth, then rich in estate and meanes) named <hi>Don Balthazar de Monfredo,</hi> who (deeming <hi>Cecilliana</hi> as famous for her chastity, as for her beauty) beares a singular affection to her; yea, his heart and thoughts are so fervently intangled in the snares of her delicious beauty, that in publicke and private, in his desires and wishes, and in his speech and actions he proclaimes her to bee his Mistresse, and himselfe her servant; and if hee affect and desire <hi>Cecilliana</hi> for his Wife, no lesse doth shee <hi>Monfredo</hi> for her Husband; so that they many times by stealth meet and conferre privately in remote Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Chappells, it being rather a prophane then a religious custome of <hi>Spaine</hi> (wherein Heaven is too much made to stoope to Earth, and Religion to Impiety)
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:16653:249"/>
for men to court their intended wives, and (which is worse) many times their Courtizans and Strumpets. <hi>Cecilliana</hi> (oftentimes warranted by her Mothers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition) can no sooner take Coach to injoy the pleasure and benefit of the fresh ayre abroad in the fragrant fields, but <hi>Monfredo</hi> assuredly meets her, where leaping from his Coach into hers (and leaving his Page to accompany her Wayting-gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle woman in his own) they at first familiarly kisse and confer, and in a few of these meetings at last effectually resolve to give themselves each to other in the sacred bonds of marriage; so he gives her a rich Diamond ring, and she reciprocally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes him a paire of Gold bracelets, in token of marriage, and they then and there (calling God to witnes) very solemnly contract themselves man and wife, yet for some solid reasons, and important considerations, which conduce to the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing of their desires, they for a time conclude to beare it secretly and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently from all the world; and it is concluded and agreed betweene them, that a moneth after, and not before, hee shall attempt to seeke her publikely in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, both of her Mother the Lady <hi>Catherina,</hi> as also of her two Brothers <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and <hi>Don Martino.</hi> So when this moneth is past over (which to these out two Lovers seemes to be many ages) <hi>Monfredo</hi> very fairely and orderly seekes her of her Mother in marriage, and likewise (in tearmes fit for him to give, and them to receive) acquaints her two Brothers with his sute and affection to their Sister, and with his best art and eloquence indeavoureth (on honorable tearmes) to gaine and purchase their consents thereunto. As for her Mother, she (preferring wealth to honour, and riches to content) considering the weakenesse of <hi>Monfredo's</hi> estate, the death of his parents, whereby shee sees him deprived of all future hope to raise his fortunes, doth absolutely denye to bestow her Daughter on him in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and the more to bewray her extreame distaste of this his sute and dislike of himselfe, shee (with much obstinacie and choller) forbids him her Daughters company, and (with more incivility and indignation) conjures him to leave and forbeare her house, telling him shee hath already firmely ingaged her word and promise to <hi>Don Alonso Delrio,</hi> that hee shall shortly espouse and marry her. Now although this sharpe answer of hers seeme to nip <hi>Monfredo's</hi> hopes and desires in their blossomes, yet relying more on the affection and constancie of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then on the power or resolution of the Mother, hee againe and againe (with a most respective and honourable importunity) solliciteth her consent; but he sees it lost labour, because shee is resolute that her first shall bee her last answer to him herein. As for her Brother <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> he loves his Sister so perfectly, and her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent so dearely, that hee findes him to stand well affected to their affections, and in regard of his love to her, and respect to him, that hee utterly contemnes the motion and mention of <hi>Delrio;</hi> and therfore faithfully promiseth <hi>Monfredo</hi> his best assistance towards his Mother for the effecting of their desires. But for her yonger Brother, <hi>Don Martino,</hi> he findes a contrary nature and disposition in him; for he never loved, but hated his Sister <hi>Cecilliana,</hi> and therfore hates <hi>Monfredo</hi> for her sake, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

having a white head and beard, of a hard and soure favoure, and exceedingly ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-legged; yet as old as hee was, hee was so passionately inamoured of the fresh and sweet beauty of <hi>Cecilliana,</hi> that hee thought her not too young to bee his wife, nor himselfe too old to bee her husband, but led more by his lust then his judgement, and incouraged by <hi>Dona Catherina</hi> her Mother, for that his great lands and wealth wholly inclined and weighed downe her affection towards him, hee often visiteth her Daughter <hi>Cecilliana,</hi> and with his best oratory and power seeks and courts her affection in the way of marriage: but shee having her heart fixed on <hi>Monfredo's</hi> youth, and comely feature, shee highly slights <hi>Delrio's</hi> frozen age, as disdayning to make her selfe a <hi>May</hi> to this <hi>December,</hi> because shee appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly knew, and perfectly believed, that hee was every way fitter for his grave, then for her bed; for it was <hi>Monfredo,</hi> and onely <hi>Monfredo,</hi> whom her heart had elected and chosen for her second selfe and Husband: And suppose (quoth she) that <hi>Monfredo</hi> bee not so rich as <hi>Delrio,</hi> yet all <hi>Castile,</hi> yea all <hi>Spayne</hi> well knowes, that by descent and generosity hee is farre more noble, and that there is as great an <hi>Antithesis</hi> and disparity betweene the vertues of the first, and the defects and imperfections of the last, as there is betweene a Clowne and a Captaine, and a Peasant and a Prince; therefore let my Mother say whar she will, <hi>Delrio</hi> what he can, or my Brother <hi>Martino</hi> what he dare, yet they shall see, and the world know, that I will bee wife to none but <hi>Monfredo,</hi> and that either hee, or my Grave, shall bee my Husband.</p>
                     <p>But the Lady <hi>Catherina</hi> her Mother (notwithstanding her Daughters aversnesse and obstinacie) layes her charge and blessing upon her to forsake <hi>Monfredo,</hi> and take <hi>Delrio,</hi> urging to her the poverty of the one, and the wealth of the other, what delights and contentments the last will give her, and what afflictions and misery the first doth threaten her: but the affection of <hi>Cecilliana</hi> is still so firmely fixed, and strongly setled and cymented on her <hi>Monfredo,</hi> that she is deafe to these requests, and blinde to these reasons of her Mother, in seeking to disswade her from him, and in consenting and perswading her to accept of <hi>Delrio</hi> for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and although her Mother follow her in all places as her shadow, and haunt her at all times as her Ghost, to draw her hereunto, yet shee still findes her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as resolute to denye, as shee is importunate to request it of her, vowing that shee will rather wed her selfe to a Nunnery, then to <hi>Delrio,</hi> whom shee sayth shee cannot affect, and therefore peremptorily disdayneth to marry.

her heart, before she see her cloystered up and espoused to a Nunnery. But this compact of theirs is not so closely carryed betweene them, but the vigilancie of <hi>Don Pedro</hi> (whose affection and care aymes to give <hi>Monfredo</hi> and his Sister con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) hath perfect notice and intelligence hereof, the which for a time hee holds fit to conceale from them both; when firmely purposing to prevent it, and so to crosse his Mother and Brother, who herein delight and glory to crosse him, hee bethinkes himselfe of an invention (worthy of himselfe) how and which way to effect it. Hee sends for <hi>Don Alonso Delrio</hi> to the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> Church, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates him the friendship he beares him, that hee will not see him runne himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an errour in seeking his Sister <hi>Cecilliana</hi> in marriage, whom hee knowes he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly obtayne; Shee (to his knowledge) beeing already firmely contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <hi>Monfredo,</hi> notwithstanding all that his Mother and Brother <hi>Don Martino</hi> have sayd or can doe to the contrary. <hi>Delrio</hi> heartily thankes <hi>Don Pedro</hi> for the expression of this love to him, the which he affirmes he shall ever finde him ready both to deserve and requite; when measuring the time future by the present, and of <hi>Cecilliana's</hi> blooming youth by his weather-beaten and blasted age, hee vowes to <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> that hee will henceforth no more desire or seeke his Sister in marriage, nor yet speake with her, or come neere his Mother or Brother; so that businesse is for ever dashed, and receives an end, almost as soone as a beginning. The which <hi>Don Martino</hi> (out of his deepe reach and politicke pate) understanding, and knowing that this falling off of <hi>Delrio,</hi> from farther seeking his Sister in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, proceeded wholly from the secret underminig of his Brother <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> he is extreamly in choller against him for the same; and so (with more passion then discretion) goes and chargeth him herewith: Whereupon these two Brothers fall at great contention and variance, and many bitter words and outragious speeches here interchangeably passe betweene them, the repetition whereof I thinke good to bury in silence, because it matters not much to give it a place in this History; onely (to deale on generalls) I must say that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was high, and <hi>Don Martino</hi> hot, and that the first spake not so much as hee dared, and the last dared not so much as hee spake. But this tongue combate of theirs was so violent and bluste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as the issue thereof redounding to <hi>Don Pedro's</hi> glory and generosity, and to <hi>Don Martino's</hi> shame and basenesse, and <hi>Martino</hi> finding that he had more will then power to bee now revenged hereof on his brother, hee is inflamed with choller and revenge against him for the same, as consulting with Satan, not with God, hee is so revengefull and inhumane, as hee wisheth his sayd brother in heaven, and from thenceforth plotteth with himselfe how to finish it, reasoning thus unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably and damnably with himselfe; That hee being dead, and his sister pent and mewed up in a Nunnery, hee shall then bee sole heire and Lord to all the Lands and Estate which his Father left him.</p>

As thy mother is desirous to see mee, so am I to serve her, and likewise thy selfe; and as thou writest religiously and truely, that Marriages should first bee made in heaven, ere solemnized in earth; so, doubtlesse, God hath reserved thy sister for a farre better husband then <hi>Delrio,</hi> and him for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>The next morning, the Lady <hi>Catherina</hi> (storming at <hi>Monfredo's</hi> yesterdayes presumption and boldnesse) sends for her daughter <hi>Cecilliana</hi> into the Garden to her, as being fully resolved to deale effectually with her for ever to forsake <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredo,</hi> or if shee cannot, then to commit her to a Nunnery. Shee comes; when (in great privacie and efficacie) shee layes before her the poverty of <hi>Monfredo,</hi> the which shee affirmes will bring her to more misery then shee can expect or thinke of, or indeed which shee deserves, at least if shee bee not so wilfull to ruine her selfe and her fortunes, as shee is to preserve them. <hi>Cecilliana</hi> now seeing her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bent to play her prize against the merits and honour of her <hi>Monfredo,</hi> and therefore against the content and felicity which shee expects to injoy by injoying him, shee no longer able to brooke or digest it, cuts her off with this reply, that (her duety excepted) it is in vaine for her, either to seeke to disparage <hi>Monfredo,</hi> or any way of the world to attempt to withdraw her affection from him, and therefore with much observance and respect prayes her to affect and honour him, if not for his owne sake, yet for hers. Her Lady mother weeps to see her daughter thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate (shee might have sayd thus constant) in her affection to <hi>Monfredo,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (with frownes in her lookes, and anger in her eyes) she thunders out a whole Catalogue of disprayses and recriminations against him; and because yet shee despayreth to prevaile with her hereby, shee now (thinking it high time) resolves to divert and change the streame of her affection from him to God, and so at last to mew and betake her to a Nunnery, whereon her desires and intentions have so long ruminated, and her wishes and vowes aymed at: to which end calming the stormes of her tongue, and composing her countenance to patience and piety, she with her best art and eloquence speakes to her thus; That in regard she will not accept of <hi>don Delrio</hi> for her husband, with whom shee might have injoyed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, content, and glory, but will rather marry <hi>Monfredo,</hi> from whom she can, and must expect nothing but poverty, griefe, and repentance, shee therefore (out of her naturall regard of her, and tender affection to her) hath by the direction of God, bethought her selfe of a <hi>medium</hi> betweene both, which is to marry nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, but in a religious and sanctifyed way to espouse her selfe to God and his holy Church; when (thinking to have taken time by the forelocke) shee depainteth her the felicity and beatitude of a Nunnes profession and life, so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God and the World, to Heaven and Earth, to Angels and Men: When her daughter <hi>Cecilliana</hi> being tyred and discontented with this poore and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous oration of hers, shee lifting up her eyes to Heaven, with a modest boldnesse, and yet with a bold truth, interrupts her mother thus, that God hath inspired he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When her daughter no way dejecting her lookes to earth, but rather advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and raysing them to heaven, requites her with this answer; That it is not the body, but the minde, not the flesh, but the soule, which is chiefly requisite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to give our selves to God and his Church; that to throw, or (which is worse) to permit our selves to be throwne on the Church through any cause of constraint, or motion of distaste or discontent, is an act which savoureth more of prophanenesse then piety, and more of earth then heaven; that as Gods power, so his presence is not to bee confined or tyed to any place, for that his Centre is every where, and therefore his circumference no where; that God is in <hi>Aegypt</hi> as well as in <hi>Palestyne</hi> or <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and that heaven is as neere us, and wee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in a Mansion house, as in a Monastery or Nunnery; that it is not the place which sanctifyeth the heart and soule, but they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the place; and that Churches and Cloysters have no priviledge or power to keepe out sin, if we by our owne lively faith, and God by his all-saving grace doe not. Which speech of hers as soon as she had delivered, and seeing that the Lady her mother was more capable to answer her thereunto with silence then reason, she making her a low reverence, and craving her excuse, departs from her, and leaves her here alone in the Garden to her selfe and her Muses.</p>
                     <p>Her mother having a little walked out her choller, in seeing her daughters firme resolution not to become a Nunne; shee leaves the garden and retires to her Chamber, where sending for her sonne <hi>Martino,</hi> she relates him at full what confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence had there past betweene his sister and her selfe, who likewise is so much perplexed and grieved hereat, as putting their heads and wits together, they within a day or two, vow to provide a remedy for this her obstinacie and wilfulnesse. As for <hi>Cecilliana</hi> shee likewise reports this verball conference, which had past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene her mother and her selfe, to her brother <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and <hi>Monfredo,</hi> when (according to promise) they met that afternoone in the <hi>Augustines</hi> garden, who exceedingly laugh thereat; and yet againe fearing lest the malice of their brother <hi>Don Martino</hi> towards them, mought cause his mother to use some violence or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance to her, and so to make force extort that from her will, which faire meanes could not, they bid her to assume a good courage, and to be cheerefull and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, promising her that if her mother attempted it, that <hi>Monfredo</hi> should steale her away by night, and that hee, as hee is <hi>don Pedro</hi> her brother, will assist her in her escape and flight; whereon they all resolve with hands, and conclude with kisses: Neither did their doubts prove vaine, or their feare and suspicion deceive them herein; for her incensed mother being resolute in her will, and wilfull in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The mother now acquaints both her sonnes with this resolution of their sister, which is the next Sunday to give her selfe to God and the Church, and to take holy Orders; when <hi>don Pedro</hi> purposely very artificially seemes as strongly to oppose, as his brother <hi>don Martino</hi> cheerefully approves thereof, now extolling her devotion and piety as farre as the Sky, if not many degrees beyond the Moone; so the day appoynted for her entrance and reception drawing neere, the Lady Abbesse is dealt with by her Mother, her Cell provided, her Spirituall apparell made, all her kinsfolkes and chiefe friends invited to a solemne Feast, to celebrate this our new Holy Sisters marriage to God and the Church. But whiles thus <hi>dona Catherina</hi> the mother, and <hi>don Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino</hi> her sonne are exceeding busie about the preparation and solemnity of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall businesse, <hi>don Pedro</hi> and <hi>Monfredo</hi> resolve to runne a contrary course, and so to steale away <hi>Cecilliana</hi> the very night before the prefixed day of her entrance into the Nunnery, as holding that Saturday night the fittest time and most voyd of all suspicion and feare, whereof (both by tongue and letter) they give her exact and curious notice; which striking infinite joy to her heart and thoughts, shee accordingly makes her selfe ready, packes up all her Iewells and Bracelets in a small Casket, and acquainting none of the world therewith, for that her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>don Pedro's</hi> chamber was next to hers, and hee as vigilant and watchfull as her selfe, for <hi>Monfredo's</hi> comming about midnight, which was the appoynted houre for his <hi>Rendevouz:</hi> when at last both their severall Watches (in their severall Chambers) assuring them that it was neere one of the clocke, it being the dead of the night, none of the house stirring, but all hushed up in silence,, as if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing seemed to conspire to her escape and flight; then, I say, <hi>don Pedro</hi> issues forth his Chamber to hers, where the doore being a little open, and her candle put our, hee findes his sister ready, when conducting her by the arme, they soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly descend the stayres, and so to a Posterne doore of the Garden; where they finde <hi>Monfredo</hi> (joyfully ready to receive the Queene regent of his heart) assisted with two valiant confident Gentlemen his friends, who were well mounted on excellent horses with their swords and Pistolls, and for himselfe and her a Coach with sixe horses: When briefely passing over their Complements and congees each from other, they (with a world of thankes) leave <hi>don Pedro</hi> behinde them, and so away as swift as the winde, who seeing them gone, secretly and softly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes to his Chamber and bed, silently shutting all the doores after him, whiles <hi>Monfredo</hi> with his other selfe and his two friends drive away to <hi>Valdebelle,</hi> a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor house of his some eight leagues from <hi>Burgos.</hi>

The mother is amazed hereat, and no lesse (rather more) is her sonne <hi>don Martino;</hi> so they both run to her Chamber, and knocke and call aloud, but hearing no answer, they force open the doore, where they finde the nest, but the bird flowne away; whereat the mother infinitely weeps, and her sonne <hi>don Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino</hi> doth exceedingly rage and storme, at this their afront and scandall, he tells his mother he will ingage his life, that his brother <hi>don Pedro</hi> is accessary to his sister <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilliana's</hi> flight, and gone with her; so they both run to his Chamber, but find him in his bed fast sleeping and snoring, as hee pretends and they believe: their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries awake him; but they shall finde him as subtile and reserved in his policie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, as they were in their malice to his sister; so he heares their newes, puts on his apparell, seemes to bee all in fire and choller hereat, profereth his mother his best indeavours and power to recover his sister, and to revenge himselfe on the villaine who hath stolne her away. But his brother <hi>don Martino</hi> is so galled and netled at the escape of his sister, and these words of his brother, as hee tells him to his face, in presence of their mother, that his speeches and profers are counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, and himselfe a dissembler, and that it is impossible but hee assisted and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured her escape and departure; for which uncivill and foule language of one brother to another, <hi>don Pedro</hi> gives him the lye, and seconds it with a boxe on the eare, and then very cunningly betakes himselfe to consolate and comfort the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy his mother, who is not a little grieved and angry at this her second affliction, and the more in regard hee did it in her presence; so <hi>don Pedro</hi> reconducting her to her Chamber, and leaving her weeping in company of many of their sorrowfull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But <hi>Monfredo</hi> being touched to the quicke, with these ignoble and base speeches of <hi>Don Martino,</hi> both to himselfe and <hi>Cecilliana,</hi> he is too generous long to digest them with silence, and therefore preferring his affection to her, before any other earthly respect, and her reputation and honour dearer than his life, hee composing his countenance to discontent and anger, returnes him this answere: That if any other man but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, had given him the least part of those unworthy speeches, both against his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as also against that of his sister <hi>Cecilliana,</hi> his Rapier, not his tongue, should have answered him; That his affection and respects to her, are every way vertuous and honourable; and that shee is, and shall be more safer here in <hi>Valdebelle,</hi> than the life of his noble brother <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was in his mothers house at <hi>Burgos;</hi> That as the young Ladie his sister is pleased to referre her stay or returne to him, so (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally to requite her courtesie) doth hee to her; and for his part, hee is fully resolved not to perswade, much lesse to advise her to put her selfe either into her Mothers protection, or his courtesie; for that hee is fearefull, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And so with cold entertainment, and short ceremonies, <hi>Don Martino</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to returne to <hi>Burgos</hi> to his Mother, without his Sister, where assoone as hee is arrived, hee tells his Mother of his Sister <hi>Cecilliana's</hi> constant resolution, from whence hee thinkes it impossible to draw or divert her, because he finds <hi>Monfredo</hi> of the same opinion: but whether hee have married her or no, hee knowes not, neither could he informe himselfe thereof.

But because of the two, <hi>Monfredo</hi> seemed to intend and portend him the greatest choller, and the most inveterate rage, therefore (as a limbe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, or rather as a Devill incarnate himselfe) hee resolves to begin with <hi>Monfredo</hi> first, and as occasions and accidents shall present, then with his sister <hi>Cecilliana</hi> after, without ever having the grace to thinke of his Conscience or Soule, or of Heaven or Hell, or without once considering, that our owne malice and revenge doth more hurt us then our enemies; That anger is a short madnesse, and that it is a most assured happinesse for us rather to forget offences, than to revenge them; and which is more, that (in a manner) it is but right now that hee came from poysoning of his owne brother, whose innocent blood is yet hardly cold in his untimely grave, but still cries alowd for vengeance from Heaven on his head for that cruell and damnable fact.</p>
                     <p>But this shame, this monster of nature, <hi>don Martino,</hi> who feares none lesse than God, and loves none more than the Devill, will not thus forsake his cruell ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, norabandon his execrable revenge: but understanding that <hi>Monfredo</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

The next morning at breake of day, this breathlesse body of <hi>Don Menfredo</hi> is found in the street: so all <hi>Burgos</hi> resounds of this his lamentable murther, but no mortall eye hath seene, or tongue as yet can tell who the murtherer should bee.

But leaving her for a while in her discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation and sorrow at <hi>Valdebelle,</hi> I come now to this wretched villain <hi>Don Martino</hi> her brother in <hi>Burgos,</hi> who having thus committed these two cruell and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Murthers, doth for the first two or three moneths after put a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and frolike countenance thereon, thereby the more absolutely to betray, and bleare the eyes of the world, that the least sparke or shadow thereof should not diffuse or reflect on him. But here before I proceed further, the Reader is reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to observe this one remarkable circumstance of Gods Iustice and Providence, in detecting of <hi>Don Martino,</hi> to bee the sole Author, and Actor of these two unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and deplorable Murthers. For as the Devill had made him so cautious in his malice, and subtill in his revenge, that hee imployed no other Minister, nor used no other agent or assistant herein but himselfe; so being deprived of any witnesse, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to accuse, or make him guiltie heereof; God (I say) out of the immensitie of his power, and profundity of his providence, will make himselfe to become a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against himselfe, and wanting all other meanes, will make himselfe the onely meanes both to detect and destroy himselfe. The manner thus.</p>

night and day) the ghosts of his harmelesse brother <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and of innocent <hi>Don Monfredo</hi> still pursue him for revenge, and justice of these their murthers. And now his lookes are extravagant, fearefull, and ghastly, which are still the signes and symptomes either of a distempered braine, a polluted conscience and soule, or of both. Hee knowes not to whom, or where, or where not to goe for remedy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but still his heart is in a mutinie and rebellion with his Conscience, and both of them against God. He is afraid of every creature he sees, and likewise of those who see him not. If he looke backe, and perceive any one to runne behinde him, he thinkes 'tis a Sergeant come to arrest him; and if he chance to be hold any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in a scarlet cloake comming towards him, he verily beleeves &amp; feares 'tis a Iudge in his scarlet Robes to arraigne and condemne him. He hath not the grace to go into a Church, nor the boldnesse to looke up to the Tower therof, for feare lest the one swallow him up alive, and the other fall on him, and crush him to death: If hee walke in any woods, fields, or gardens, and see but a leafe wagge, or a bird stirre, hee is of opinion there some furies or executioners come to torment him; or doth he heare any Dog howle, Cat crie, or Owle whoot, or screech, he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at so suddenly appalled and amazed, as hee thinkes it to bee the voyce of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, who is come to fetch him away. Hee will not passe over any bridge, brooke, or River, for feare of drowning, nor over any planke, gate, or style, lest hee should breake his necke. The sight of his shadow is a corosive to his heart, and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique terrour to his thoughts, because he both thinkes and beleeves, that it is not his owne, but the hang-mans; and when any one (out of charitie or pitie) come to see and visite him, hee flyes from them, as if Hell were at his backe, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill at his heeles. The very sight of a Rapier, stabs him at his heart, and the bare thought, or name of Poyson, seemes to infect and kill his soule; and yet miserable wretch and miscreant that he is, all this while he hath not the goodnesse to looke downe into his heart and Conscience with contrition, nor the grace to lookeup to Heaven and to God with repentance. The Lady <hi>Catherina</hi> his Mother is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully perplexed and grieved hereat, and so are all his kinsfolkes and friends in and about <hi>Burgos,</hi> who cause some excellent Physicians and Divines to deale with him, about administring him the meanes to cure him of this his lunacie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction. But God will not permit, that either the skilfull Art of those, or the powerfull perswasions of these doe as yet prevaile with him, or performe it. Two Moones have fully finished their Celestiall course, whiles thus his phrensie and madnesse possesseth him; and in one of the greatest, and most outragious fits ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hee (without wit, or guide) runnes to Saint <hi>Sebastiano's</hi> Church, finds out Father <hi>Thomas</hi> his Confessor, and in private and serious confession, reveales him, how he hath poysoned his brother <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and also murthered <hi>Don Monfredo;</hi> adding withall, that God (out of his indulgent mercie) would no longer permit him to charge his soule with the concealing thereof, and then beggs his absolution, and remission for the same. His Confessor (being a religious Church-man) much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, and wondring at the foulnesse of these his (Penitents) two bloody facts, although hee finde more difficultie than reason to grant his desire, yet enquiring of him, if there were any other accessary with him in these murthers, and <hi>Don Martino</hi> freely and firmely acknowledging to him there was none, but the Devill and himselfe: hee (after a serious checke, and religious <hi>repremendo)</hi> in hope of his future contrition and repentance, gives him a sharpe and severe penance (though no way answerable to his crimes) and so absolves him; and yet for the space of at least a whole moneth after, his lunacie (by the permission of God) still followes him, when (for a further triall of his comportment, and hope of his repentance)
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:16653:258"/>
God is againe pleased to slacke the hand of his judgement, and so frees him from his madnesse and distraction, to see whether he will prove Gold or Drosse, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian or a Devill.</p>
                     <p>Not long after this, his Confessor Father <hi>Thomas</hi> (being Curate of one of the neighbouring parishes) falls extreame sicke of a Piurisie, and so dangerously sicke, that his Physician (despairing of his life) bids him prepare his body for death, and his soule for Heaven, and God: Who then revoking to minde (what hee hath heard and seene) how grievously and sorrowfully the Lady <hi>Cecilliana</hi> takes the Deaths of her Brother and Husband, and the more, in that she is ignorant who are their Murtherers, he is no longer resolved to burthen his conscience and soule with concealing thereof; but to write it to her in a Letter, the which he chargeth and conjureth his owne Sister <hi>Cyrilla</hi> to deliver into her owne hands, some three dayes after his buriall; the which we shall see her shortly performe: for the Priest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Thomas,</hi> her brother, lived not three weekes after.</p>

True it is, I cannot recall their lives, but it is likewise as true that I may prevent his death; for as the first lay not in my power to remedie, yet all the world knowes, that the second meerely depends of my pity, courtesie, and compassion to prevent: but Ahlas (saith she) the tyes of heaven are, and ought to be infinitly more strong than those of earth, and the glory of God to be far preferred before all our naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and obligations to our best Friends, or neerest or dearest Kinsfolkes whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.

For if by Faith wee doe not first beleeve, then pray unto God for our owne preservation, it will bee no hard matter for him to tempt us in our choller, to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with our best friends, and in our malice and revenge to murther even our neerest and dearest Kindred. O <hi>Faith,</hi> the true foundation of our soveraigne felicitie! O <hi>Prayer,</hi> the sweet preservative, and sacred Manna of our soules, how blessed doe you make those who embrace and retaine you! and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, how miserable and wretched are they who contemne and reject you! Of which last number, this insuing Historie will produce us one, who (by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched life, and corrupt conversation) trampled those two heavenly Vertues and Graces under his feet, without thinking of God, or regarding, much lesse fearing his judgements: But how God (in the end) requited him for the same, this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie will likewise shew us.

                        <hi>Cassino</hi> did well to place his young neece <hi>Eleanora</hi> with the Ladie <hi>Sophia,</hi> but ill in forgetting that she had a very debauched yong Gentleman to her sonne, named <hi>Seignior Alphonso,</hi> of some two and twentie yeares of age, who (to her griefe and shame) haunts her and her house as a ghost, makes himselfe the publike laughter and pitie of all the different humors of <hi>Cassall,</hi> yea the lewdnesse of his life, and the irregularitie of his conversation, and actions, hath reduced him to this fatall point of miserie, that he holds it a noble vertue in him, to precipitate himselfe and his reputation into base debts, vices, and company, making this his shame his glorie, and lewd vices his honour, till in the end not caring for the world, the world will not care for him, nor hee for himselfe, untill he have wholly lost himselfe in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, without either desert, or hope ever to be found or recalled againe. But at last seeing so sweet a Beautie, and so rich an heire as <hi>Eleanora</hi> fallen into his mothers hands, and therefore he vainely thinkes into his; and hoping that her wealth shall redeeme his prodigalities, and revive his decayed Estate and Fortunes, he secretly courts her: but <hi>Eleanora</hi> (as young as shee is) sees his vices with disdaine, himselfe with contempt, and his affection to her with scorne. Hee is importunate in his sute, and shee perverse and obstinate in her deniall, but shee resolves to conceale it from all the world. As for <hi>Alphonso,</hi> hee (after some six moneths time) acquaints the Lady <hi>Sophia</hi> his mother herewith, and with his fervent desire and affection to marry <hi>Eleanora;</hi> but shee chargeth him on her blessing, never to proceed any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther herein without her consent and order; and quoth shee, if here (in the presence of God and my selfe) thou wilt now sweare wholly to abandon all thy former vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, henceforth to bee absolutely led by my advice and counsell, and to steere all thy actions by the star of Honour, and the card of Vertue, then I will promise thee to use all my best endeavors, and possible power, both with <hi>Cassino,</hi> and <hi>Eleanora,</hi> to effect thy desires. <hi>Alphonso</hi> hereat (with much courtesie and humilitie) thanks his mother, and solemnly sweares to God and her, to performe all these poynts care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and punctually; and to adde the more Religion and reverence to this oath, he doth it on his knees; and it is a wonderfull joy to her, to see that the fruits and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Cassino</hi> comes over three severall times to <hi>Cassall</hi> to see his Neece. The Ladie <hi>Sophia</hi> gives him her best entertainment. Hee is wonderfull glad to see that shee hath imprinted such characters of vertue and honour in her; and during his stay there, <hi>Sophia</hi> chargeth her sonne <hi>Alphonso,</hi> not to speak or motion a word to <hi>Cassino,</hi> of this his affection to his young Neece <hi>Eleanora:</hi> so he beares himselfe exceeding modestly and respectively towards him, and for his mother, she holds it fit not as yet to breake or speak a word hereof to <hi>Cassino. Cassino</hi> (no way dreaming of their intents and desires towards his Neece) tells the Lady <hi>Sophia,</hi> he is infinitely joyfull to see that her sonne <hi>Alphonso</hi> proves <hi>Fame</hi> to bee no true, but a tatling goddesse in his condition, and conversation; whereat shee heartily thankes him: and thinking then (though reservedly and secretly) to take time and opportunity at advantage, shee leaves not a vertue of her sonnes either undisplayed, or unmagnified, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols them all to the skie, and himselfe beyond the moone, and so leaves the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hereof to time, and the issue to God. But yet revolving and ruminating in her mind, how (in a faire and honorable way) to obtaine this rich and beautifull young prize for her sonne; and holding it discretion, not as yet either to motion or menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to her, she secretly layes wait at <hi>Verceli</hi> to know when <hi>Cassino</hi> will have home his Neece, and so some three weekes before that time shee holds it fit to motion it to him by her Letter, which shee doth in these tearmes.</p>

                     <p>The Lady <hi>Sophia</hi> grieves, and her Sonne <hi>Alphonso</hi> stormes at the receipt of this unkind Letter from <hi>Cassino,</hi> whereby they see their hopes of his Neece <hi>Eleanora</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed and frustrated; and although this his flat refusall made her of opinion no more to stirre or enter-meddle herein, yet (as Lovers are impatient of denials and delayes) some three weekes after, hee prayes his Mother to ride over to <hi>Vercelie,</hi> againe to prove <hi>Cassino,</hi> and likewise to (againe) motion and solicit it to <hi>Eleanora,</hi> hoping that her presence may purchase that which her Letters cannot procure; and he is very desirous and willing to accompany her himselfe. His Mother <hi>Sophis</hi> grants both his requests; they arrive to <hi>Vercelie,</hi> where the Mother courts the Vncle, and the Sonne the Neece; and although they find exceeding great Cheere and noble Entertainment, yet in the point of their busines, which is <hi>Alphonso's</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to <hi>Eleanora,</hi> they find themselves lost, and their sute in vaine, and so they are enforced to returne to <hi>Cassall</hi> with their definitive sentence of deniall, which makes her bite the lip, and infinitly grieves and exasperates her Sonne; so now he againe casts off the Cloake of vertue, and farre worse then ever, flies to his old vices and sinnes, which his Mother with her sweet perswasions and remonstrances, can no longer retaine or conceale, especially from his Whoring and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: yea, and which is most lamentable and deplorable, hee will no longer serve God, either abroad or at home, for he forsakes the Church, and wholly abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that sweet and Heavenly Vertue of Prayer, which is the spirituall food and life of the soule. His Mother <hi>Sophia</hi> exceedingly weeps and grieves hereat, but how to remedy it she knowes not: For his discontent hath made him so vicious, his vices so obstinate, and his obstinacie so outragious and violent, as his Mother surfets with his Love-sute to <hi>Eleanora,</hi> and will no more entermeddle with it. Hee prayes and reprayes her, to make one Iourney more for him to <hi>Vercelie,</hi> to see what alterations time may have wrought in the hearts of <hi>Cassino</hi> and <hi>Eleanora,</hi> but shee is as averse and wilfull, as he is obstinate and peremptory: and therefore constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vowes, neither to write, nor ever to conferre more with them herein. But this resolute answer of the Mother breeds bad blood in the Sonne, yea it makes a Mutiny in his thoughts, a Civill warre in his heart, and a flat Rebellion in his resolutions against her for the same, to which the Devill (the Arch-enemy, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary of our soules) blowes the Coles.

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:16653:264"/>
from Heaven to Hell; and so resolves to murther her, thinking with himselfe, that if hee had once dispatcht her, he should then be sole Lord of all her wealth, and that then this his great and absolute estate would soone induce <hi>Cassino</hi> and <hi>Eleanora,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his affection: But he reckons without his soule and without God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no marvell if these his bloody hopes deceive and betray him: his Religion and Conscience cannot prevaile with him, neither hath his Soule either grace or power enough to divert him from this fatall busines, and execrable resolution; for he will be so infernall a Monster of nature, as to act her death of whom he received his life. He consults with himselfe, and the Devill with him, whether hee should stab or poyson her, but he holds it farre more safe and lesse dangerous, to use the Drug then the Dagger, and so concludes upon poyson; to which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>This refusall of <hi>Cassino</hi> to her Sonne <hi>Alphonso,</hi> and his miserable relapse to whoredome, drunkennesse, and neglect of prayer, doth exceedingly distemper the Lady <hi>Sophia</hi> his Mothers spirits, and they her body, so that she is three dayes sicke of a Burning feaver; when to allay the fervor of that unaccustomed heate, shee causeth some Almond-milke to bee made her, the which shee compoundeth with many coole herbes, and other wholesome Ingredients of that nature and quality, which she takes three times each day; morning, after dinner, and before shee goes to bed: So the third day of her sicknesse, walking in the afternoone in one of the shaddowed Allies of her Garden with her Sonne, and there with her best advice rectifying and directing his resolutions from Vice to Vertue, she is unexpectedly surprised with the Symptome of her Feaver, when sitting downe, and causing her waiting Maid to hold her head in one of the Arbours, she prayes her Sonne <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso</hi> to runne to her Chamber, and to bring her a small wicker Bottle of Almond milke, the which he doth; but bloody Villaine that he is, nothing can withhold him (but his heart being tempered with inhumanitie and crueltie) hee first poures in his poyson therein and then gives it her, who, good Lady, drinkes two great draughts thereof; when a sweat presently over spreading her face, and shee begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to looke pale, he (as a wretched Hypocrite) makes a loud outcry from the Garden to the house, and calling there Servants to her assistance, hee likewise cals for a Chaire, so she is brought to her Chamber, and laid in her bed, and within few houres after (as a vertuous Lady and innocent Saint) she forsakes this life and this world for a better, and the ignorance of her Servants, and her bloody Sonne (drench'd as it were in the rivolets of his fained teares, together with his excessive lamentations) doe coffin her dead body up somewhat privately and speedily, so that there is no thought nor suspicion of poyson; and thus was the lamentable Murther, and deplorable end of this wise and religious Lady <hi>Sophia</hi> committed by her owne wretched and infernall Sonne. Now this Devill <hi>Alphonso</hi> (to set the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter luster on his forrowes, and the better varnish and colour on his mourning for the death of his Mother) gives her a stately Funerall, the pompe and cost where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not only equalized, but exceeded their ranke and quality: For he left no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, or Lady in or about <hi>Cassall</hi> uninvited to be at her buriall, and his Feast, and dighted himselfe and all his Kinsfolkes and Servants in mourning attire, thereby the better to carry off the least reflexion or shaddow of suspicion from him of this his foule and inhumane Murther.</p>

                     <p>And here the true order of our History cals us againe, to speake of this dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and debaushed Gentleman <hi>Alphonso,</hi> who had no sooner embrued his guilty hands in the innocent blood of the Lady <hi>Sophia</hi> his Mother; but he then without any farther shew of sorrow, or sight or sense of repentance for the same, againe desperately abandoneth himselfe to all old vices and prodigalities, flaunting it out in brave apparell (for his mourning weeds he speedily cast off) and swimming as it were in the Vast Ocean of all his carnall delights, and worldly pleasures and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualities, never thinking of Religion or Prayer, but passeth away whole dayes and nights, yea consumeth whole weekes and moneths in all licencious riots, and excessive prodigalities with his debaushed Companions and Strumpets, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to drowne his Estate, and to devoure his Lands apace: and in the heate and ruffe of these his Ioviall follies, and exorbitant intemperancies, he be thinkes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe againe of the wealth and beauty of the young Lady <hi>Eleanora,</hi> and so (in the vanity of his conceits, and the imbecility of his judgement) flattering himselfe, that being now Lord of all his deceased Mothers lands and wealth, her Uncle <hi>Cassino</hi> could not refuse to give her him in marriage, not so much as once dreaming or remembring how plainely and peremptorily, both hee and she had formerly given him the repulse: To which effect hee dights himselfe and his Followers in exceeding rich apparell, and (with a traine too worthy of himselfe) he rides over to <hi>Vercelie,</hi> and there becomes a most importunate Sutor, both to <hi>Cassino</hi> and <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora,</hi> first seeking her, and then courting her Vncle for her: but all in vaine, for he puts him off with disrespect, and she rejects him with disdaine; and when yet they see that his importunacie herein passeth the bounds of reason, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the limits of Discretion and Civilitie, then <hi>Cassino</hi> tels him plainely that his Neece is married; and that therefore (in that consideration) hee forbids him his

house and her company; which point of discourtesie (and as <hi>Alphonso</hi> termes it of dishonour) to him, he takes in so ill part from <hi>Cassino,</hi> that exchanging his reason into rage, and forgetting himselfe to bee a man, or which is more a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or which is most of all a Christian, he againe strikes hands and agrees with the Devill, and for meere despight and rage vowes that hee will murther <hi>Cassino:</hi> The Devill making him strong in the vanity of this beliefe and confidence, that this speech and suggestion of his, that his Neece <hi>Eleanora</hi> is married, is but fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and false, and that if he were once dead, he could not impeach or hinder him from enjoying the faire and rich <hi>Eleanora</hi> to his wife, which is the same prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious baite and lure whereby Sathan formerly drew, and betrayed him to poyson his Mother: the Devill still so closely over-vailing his conscience and soule, and so ecclipsing, and wincking his understanding and judgement, that as his hand so his heart is inured and obdurated to the effusion of innocent blood, and therefore he will not retire with grace, but onwards with impiety to the finishing of this cruell Murther of <hi>Cassino;</hi> and although hee had an itching desire, and a hellish ambition likewise to effect it by poyson, yet in regard he was denied accesse to his house and company, as also for that he was unacquainted with any Apothecary or Physician of <hi>Vercelie,</hi> hee therefore resolves with the Devill to doe it by a Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, which many times by night hee wore and carried about him. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing easier then to doe evill, and as it is the nature, so it is the policie of Sathan, as well to furnish us with the meanes, as the matter thereof: For when we cast our selves from Malice to Revenge, and from Revenge to Murther, he then makes us industrious, first in the contriving, and then in the execution thereof, but in the end God will so ordaine that this hellish policie shall turne to misery.</p>

                        <hi>Alphonso's</hi> malice against <hi>Cassino</hi> will give no peace to his thoughts, so he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes himselfe, that every morning and evening he is accustomed to walke alone in his Garden, for an houre or two in his spirituall meditations, and therefore hee thinkes this a fit place (from some adjacent house and window) to shoote at him; when being likewise assured, that there was a poor smal taverne (not much frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with company) that lay some-what neere and commodious to <hi>Cassino's</hi> Garden, he resolves to make choise of that, and there to give end to this bloody busines, which his heart so much desireth, so abandoned by God, and guided and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Devill, he about sixe of the clocke in the evening rides thither, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his horse to the doore, he in a disguised sute of apparell, pretending there to stay for a friend of his, which promised to come thither to meet him (and having purposely sent away his Servants before him to <hi>Cassall)</hi> he goes up into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, cals for wine and something to eate, the better to favour and colour out his stay there, when bolting the Chamber doore to him, hee (putting aside the paper Casements, which they use in <hi>Italy</hi> to expell the fervencie of the Sunne) from thence (according to his former intelligence) plainely perceives <hi>Cassino</hi> walking in his Garden, with his Hat in one hand, and his Breviary (or Praier-booke) wherein he reads, in another, with the which hee was as busie with God in his meditations and devotions, as he was with the Devill, in charging his Carabine with a brace of bullets, and dressing of his fire locke, and priming of his powder touch-holl, when, without the least sparke of grace, or feare of God, or his punishments, hee lets fly at him; and the Devill had made him so expert a Marke-man, that as <hi>Cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> was saftly comming on, walking towards the window, wherein he secretly and scelerously stood, both the bullets hit him right in the brest a little below the left pap, whereof this harmelesse and religious old Gentleman <hi>Cassino</hi> fell presently dead to the ground, and none being in the Garden with him (wherein I my selfe

have since some times beene) I could not understand, that hee had the power or happinesse to speake a word: But wee shall see, that this his inhumane and bloody Murtherer, shall not goe farre before the judgements of God will surprise and ore take him. The manner whereof is thus.</p>
                     <p>As soone as <hi>Alphonso</hi> had given this bloody blow, and seene <hi>Cassino</hi> fall dead to the ground, he unbolting the Chamber doore, presently resolves to take horse and fly a way, but God ordained the contrary: For as hee had againe put up his Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine into his Belt, God presently strucke him into a stupified swoone, whereof falling to the ground, the noyse of his fall, the report of his Carabine, and the ratling of his sword and it, presently invited the people of the house below, to see what had befallen above to this Gentleman, where finding him groveling and gasping for life, they (by Gods immediate direction) doe thinke that hee hath there shot and murthered himselfe; when devesting him of his apparell, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in bed to search for his wounds, they find none; but yet it is an houre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they perceive any motion, or action of life in him: And then opening his eyes, he with a distracted looke and amazed countenance, deeming himselfe upon the very point of death; and that for his murthering of <hi>Cassino,</hi> the Lord in his judgement had infallibly strucken him with suddaine death, he finding this foule and bloody act of his, to lie heavie upon his soule and conscience, in this last Scene (as he then thought) of his life, he (rather raving then speaking) in the heate of his madnesse and distraction, cryes out againe and againe, that he had murthered <hi>Cassino:</hi> The which the people of the house are exceedingly astonished to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. And now by this time <hi>Cassino</hi> is found dead in his Garden, and shot tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with a brace of bullets. So his Neece <hi>

                           </gap>leanora</hi> is all in teares hereat, and all <hi>Vercelie</hi> resounds of this his lamentable murther. When <hi>Cassino's</hi> friends and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants make speedy search for the Murtherer, and finding a horse tyed to this little Taverne doore, they find the Man, Wife, and Servants thereof in out-cryes and amazement: So they ascend the staires, find <hi>Alphonso</hi> in bed, with his Carabine by him on the bench, and his clothes on the Table, and examining the people of the house, they report to them this suddaine accident of his swooning, and therein of his confession of the murthering of <hi>Cassino;</hi> so they all praise and glorifie God, in that they have so soone, and so readily found out the inhumane Authour, and Actor of this bloody Murther.</p>
                     <p>But here before I proceed farther, I (in the name and feare of God) doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest and invite the Reader to take notice of another remarkeable (I may say mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous) circumstance of Gods mercy and glory, which likewise appeares in this detection and confession of <hi>Alphonso,</hi> to be the cruell Murtherer of this innocent, harmelesse Gentleman <hi>Cassino;</hi> for he being no better then distracted of his wits, before God had caused and brought him to confesse it, which else hee had never done, but that in the agonie and anxiety of his stupified spirits hee (as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly said) thought himselfe on the point and brinke of death, and no shaddow of hope left him, either of this life or this world: Then I say, as soone as hee had confessed it, God in his good pleasure and providence presently restored him againe to his perfect health, strength, and memory; so that being put in mind, and againe remembring his confession, and seeing the eminencie of his danger by the presence of <hi>Cassino's</hi> friends and servants, who were there present about his bed, to apprehend and carry him away to prison for the same; he now with teares, and bitter oaths, and curses, declines and recants what he hath formerly spoken thereof, and, rather as a Devill then a Christian, in lofty and proud speeches stands upon the termes of his Iustification, alleadging and affirming to them far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:16653:266"/>
that what he had formerly confessed, or said to them, concerning the Murther of <hi>Cassino,</hi> proceeded from the destemperature of his heart and braines, in that of his distraction, or else from the delusions and temptations of the Devill, and no otherwise. But his owne confession, the testimony of those of the house who heard it, and the rest of the presumptions and circumstances are so pregnant and apparant, that he is the undoubted Murtherer of <hi>Cassino,</hi> as they beleeve not what he now sayes in his owne behalfe and Apologie, or that it is any way the delusions of the Devill, but the good pleasure of God, which brought him to this detection and conviction of himselfe for the same: So they being deafe to his requests and oathes, they enforce him to draw on his apparell, and then by order of the criminall Iudges, they that night commit him to prison, where the Devill having brought him, he now leaves him to himselfe, and to his owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and confusion, which it is to be beleeved, that the Lord hath ordained shall speedily befall him.</p>
                     <p>The next morning this Monster of nature <hi>Alphonso,</hi> is called to his araignment, where being by his Iudges, charged with this foule Murther, the Devill hath as yet so obdurated his heart, as hee not onely denies it, but contests against it with vehemencie and execrations. So the Vintner and his wife, and servants are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced against him as witnesses, who acknowledge and confesse his owne confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, as also the report of his Carabine, and the vicinitie of their house, and prospect from the Chamber wherein hee was, to <hi>Cassino's</hi> Garden, wherein as he was walking he was shot to death. When the mournefull and sorrowfull young Lady <hi>Eleanora,</hi> is likewise brought forth as a witnesse against him, who informes his Iudges, that <hi>Alphonso</hi> was a most importunate Suter to her, both in his Mothers house at <hi>Cassall,</hi> as also at her deceased Vncles house, here in <hi>Vercelie;</hi> adding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that (in her heart and soule) shee verely beleeves him to bee the Murtherer of her said Vncle. But still he denies it with choler and indignation: whereupon, the presumptions and circumstances hereof, being more apparant to his Iudges, then the knowledge of this truth, they adjudge him to the Racke, where at his very first torments thereof, he with teares confesseth it; and God is now so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to his soule, as hee seemes to be very sorrowfull and repentant thereof: so they seeing him guilty, pronounce sentence against him, the next day to have his head cut off for the same; and that night the Iudges (out of their honourable zeale to charitie and pietie) send him some Friers to Prison to him, to direct his soule to Heaven; who willing him to disburthen his conscience and soule of any other capitall crime, which hee mought have committed in all the course of his life, to the end that it mought not hinder her passage and transmigration from Earth to Heaven; Hee then and there reveales them, how hee had also formerly poysoned his owne Mother, the Lady <hi>Sophia,</hi> at <hi>Cassall,</hi> for the which he likewise craved absolution both of them and of God. Whereat his Iudges are exceedingly amaz'd and astonished, to see a Gentleman so degenerate, inhumane and bloody, as to be the death of his owne Mother, of whom formerly hee had received his life.</p>
                     <p>The day following (according to his sentence) <hi>Alphonso</hi> is brought to the place of execution, clad in a blacke sute of silke Grograine, and a falling band, where ascending the scaffold, and drawne to much humility and contrition, by his secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Priests and Friers, hee in presenee of a great concourse of people, there made this short speech. That these two murthers of his, and especially that of his owne Mother, the Lady <hi>Sophia,</hi> were so odious in the sight of God and man, that he acknowledged, hee no longer deserved to tread on the face of the earth, or to

                     <p>To which end, he (more like a Tutor then a Pupill, in the Art and Schoole of love) is so farre from neglecting any, as he curiously and carefully seekes all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and occasions to enjoy the felicity of her company, and so (for the most part) hee conducts her to and from the dauncings, sits and talkes with her in her lodgings, meets her at Church, where as well at Vespers as Masse, he accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and prayes with her, and (briefly) shee can difficultly be present any where, where he is long absent from her; For by this time (which is scarce a moneth since he first saw her) her peerelesse beauty, and unparalell'd vertues and discourse, have acted such amorous wonders in his heart, as hee vowes, hee must either live her Husband, or die her Martyr. But see the providence and pleasure of God, for if <hi>Valfontaine</hi> tenderly love our sweet and faire <hi>La Pratiere,</hi> no lesse doth shee him; for knowing him to be the Sonne of his Father, and therefore a Gentleman of noble extraction and worth; and seeing him to bee wise, discreet, and proper, as also remembring and marking, that he fervently and infinitly affects her, shee is so delighted with his neat feature and personage, and ravished with the melodie of his discourse, as albeit at first, her tongue bee so civill and modest to conceale her affection from him, yet her eyes (the Ambassadors of her heart) cannot but in dumbe Eloquence, and silent Rhetorike bewray it him. So as (to omit the gifts, presents, and especially the letters, which interchangeably past betweene them) and which indeed powerfully assisted to the sympathising and cimenting of their youthfull affections, it sufficeth that we take notice and knowledge, that <hi>Valfon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> presence was <hi>La Pratiere's</hi> delight, and the enjoying of her company, his felicity and glory, and that she in life and death would remaine his obedient and faithfull Wife, and he her faithfull and loving Husband; Onely she prayes him, carefully and respectfully to conceale her affection to him, and so likewise to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve her Father in seeking his consent to their marriage, the which hee promiseth her shortly to performe; For as soone as <hi>La Pratiere</hi> hath left <hi>Nantes,</hi> and purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retired her selfe home to her Fathers house, at Saint <hi>Aignaw, Valfontaine</hi> is not many dayes behind her, where hee acquaints her Father <hi>Pennelle,</hi> with his affection to his daughter, seekes her in marriage, requesteth his consent, and with many
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:16653:271"/>
reasons, fairely and discreetly endeavoreth to induce him thereunto, where for three or foure dayes, hee takes up his lodging and residence, under pretence to court the Daughter, whom we know he hath already won, but his sute is no way pleasing, but distastfull to <hi>Pennelle,</hi> who although he know, that <hi>Monsieur de Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stainge</hi> his Father (as well for lands as blood) is every way rather his Superiour then his Equall, yet because his Daughter <hi>La Pratiere</hi> is his only child and heire, and <hi>Valfontaine</hi> but a Cadet (or younger Brother) therefore covetousnesse makes him assume this resolution, that hee will have none of him for his Sonne in Law: but this reason, and conclusion hee conceales to himselfe, and so (in generall termes) gives <hi>Valfontaine</hi> a cold and averse answere, little better in effect then a flat deniall; and thus for his first Iourney, <hi>Valfontaine</hi> takes leave of his sweet <hi>La Pratiere,</hi> no way doubting but that his second to her, will prove lesse distastfull and more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, he leaves <hi>Nantes</hi> and rides home to <hi>Vannes.</hi>

                     <p>Being arrived at <hi>Vannes,</hi> he acquaints his Father and Mother, with his affection and sute to <hi>Madamoyselle La Pratiere,</hi> the onely daughter and heire (as we have heard) of <hi>Monsieur de Pennelle,</hi> of <hi>Saint Aignaw,</hi> whereunto (because they know him to bee rich and noble, and his Daughter faire and vertuous) they give good approbation and allowance, when <hi>Valfontaine</hi> praying his Father to ride over to <hi>Monsieur de Pennelle,</hi> to conferre with him about this busines, whose presence hee hopeth will effect that with him, which hee feares and knowes his poore power cannot: But his Father although he be very glad, to procure his Sonnes advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and content by this match, yet being at that time much troubled with the Gout, he excuseth himselfe upon his indisposition, and so defers off that Iourney to another time. <hi>Valfontaine</hi> missing of his Father, deemes it rather expedient then impertinent, to entreat his brother <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> herein, to whom hee fully relates what hath past betweene <hi>Pennelle</hi> and himselfe, but withall conceales upon what termes he stands with <hi>La Pratiere,</hi> or that she is any way his, or hee hers, either by contract or promise, to the end that he may have no just cause, either to taxe her immodesty, or condemne her indiscretion, in so suddainely giving her selfe to him. <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> very willingly yeelds to his brothers request; when (followed with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

blushing to see her blush, when enquiring of her, if she pleased to take the aire of the Garden (where her Father and his Brother were already gone and attended them) and she replying, that his pleasure therein should be hers, hee taking her by her hand conducts her thither; where <hi>Valfontaine</hi> in civilitie purposely walking aloofe off, because he hoped and assured himselfe, that his brother <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> now meant effectually to speake with his Mistresse in his behalfe, there being then no wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to their conference, but only the sweet Quiresters of the woods (the Thrushes and Nightingales) who purposely and pleasantly sate on every bush and tree, to delight them with their melifluous melodie; the very first words he admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred and directed to her was; That if shee pleased to sweare her tongue to secrecie, to what hee should now say and deliver to her, hee would reveale her a secret which should infinitly import her good. <hi>La Pratiere</hi> (wondring at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Quatbrissons</hi> first speech and request, and what it mought meane or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne) stood a little while mute and silent, not knowing what to conceive thereof, much lesse what to answer thereto: But at last considering that <hi>Valfontaine</hi> was her Lover, and <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> his brother, shee imagined there was some plot secretly compacted betweene them, that if her Father would not condiscend to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, that they had then resolved to steale her away from him, and so to make it a Clandestine marriage: Whereupon (her affection being desirous to know the certaintie hereof, and her curiositie ambitious to see this abstruse mysterie unloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) she grants him his request, vowing to impose secrecie to her tongue in what he should deliver, or intrust her with: When he kissing her, and evaporating ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny farre fetch'd sighes (as the Herauld to proclaime his affection) he tels her; that her incomparable beauty hath captivated his thoughts, and made his heart both her Tributary, and her Prisoner; that hee envies his brothers happinesse, in having the honour to see her before himselfe. That as he is his Superiour in yeares so he is in affection to her, and that he knowes his brother is as unworthy of her, as himselfe worthily bestowed on her: <hi>La Pratiere</hi> (whose affection and thoughts ran a direct contrary Cariere, lest dreaming of that which she is now enforced to understand) is so afflicted, and withall so incensed at these unexpected speeches of <hi>Quatbrissons,</hi> that (her passion giving a law to her civilitie) casting a snow-white vaile over her crimson cheeks, and bending her brow (in whose furrowes it seemed that discontent and choller sate now triumphant) her affection is so sincere and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to <hi>Valfontaine,</hi> as she returnes his discourteous Brother <hi>Quatbrisson,</hi> this short and sharpe answer: <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> (quoth shee) to have offered this unkindnesse of yours to your friend, had beene ignoble ingratitude, but to doe it to your owne brother, can be no lesse then treachery; and therefore this know from me, that I esteeme your Primogenitorship as inferiour to <hi>Valfontaines</hi> vertues, as they are in all respects superiour to yours, and had you not tied and wedded my tongue to silence, I would now presently publish it to the world, to the admiration and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of all good men, and so (with a looke ingendered of choller, and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from disdaine) shee hastily and suddainly trips away from him, leaving him alone in the Garden to his Muses; <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> biting his lip at this sharpe repulse of <hi>La Pratiere,</hi> is yet resolute not thus to leave her, when hoping to find her Father more tractable and propitious to his sute then his Daughter, hee seekes him out, and in faire termes informes him of his affection and love to her, and that (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his brothers research of her) hee himselfe infinitly desireth her to be his owne wife. Old <hi>Pennelle</hi> (being more covetous of his Daughters preferment, then any way carefull of her content) gives an attentive and pleasing eare to this motion of <hi>Quatbrisson,</hi> and is so delighted with the melody of his speeches, as

over all the inventions of his art and affection, how to make her forsake he coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and so how to obtaine her for his wife, hee at last resolves to faine himselfe sicke, and so then to reveale to his brother <hi>Valfontaine,</hi> that it is his deare and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent affection to <hi>La Pratiere;</hi> which is the cause thereof. To which purpose hee keepes his bed, and in his perfect health is twice let blood, thereby to looke ill; when sending for his brother to his Chamber, and exempting all other compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thence, he acquaints and informes him, That since he first saw <hi>La Pratiere,</hi> hee still most tenderly loved her, and that hee must now die, because she will not affect and love him; He prayes and conjures him (by vertue of all the same blood which equally streames in both their bodies) for the saving and preserving of his life, that hee will now abandon his affection from her, and so yeeld him up all the power and interest that hee hath, or pretends to have in her, and that in requitall thereof (if occasion require) hee shall still find him ready, not onely to expose all his meanes, but his dearest blood and life at his command: A request so unjust, and a proposition so devoid of common sense and reason, as <hi>Valfontaine</hi> observing it, and therein seeing his brothers impudencie, now growne to the height of basenesse and folly, hee exceedingly incensed thereat (with a disdainefull looke) returnes him this sharpe and bitter, yet deserved reply.

hurt, <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> in the right arme, and <hi>Valfontaine</hi> of a scarre in the necke, and here they make a stand to take breath, <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> not as yet despairing, nor <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fontaine</hi> triumphing or assuring himselfe of the victory, and the sight and effusion of their blood is so farre from rebating or quenching, as it rather revives their courages with more spleene and animositie, so they will againe try their fortunes; They now traverse their ground, and approach each other, and although they are not lesse vallorous then before, yet (to the eyes of their Seconds and Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) they are now more cautious in their plea, and more advised in choosing and refusing their ground, when <hi>Valfontaine</hi> breaking a thrust (which his brother pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him) he then calling to mind the sweetnesse of his <hi>La Pratieres</hi> beauty, and the foulnesse of his brothers malice and treachery towards him, drives home a thrust at him, which entereth betwixt his short ribs, and making the blood to gush and streame forth, doth soone quaile his courage; so as he who right now thought himselfe master of his brothers life, now feares his owne, so that hee thinkes hee hath given enough, if not received too much in counter-exchange, as well to secure his reputation from the scandall of his friends, as to warrant his generositie from the detraction of his enemies, and therefore throwing away his Rapier, he (with more wisedome then honour) begs his life of his brother, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing henceforth wholly to forsake and leave him <hi>La Pratiere,</hi> and to love him as dearely as formerly hee hated him deadly: Which cowardise of his, is so farre from being relished, or approved of the Spectators, as it proves the wonder of <hi>Valfontaine,</hi> the laughture of <hi>Pont Chausey,</hi> the disdaine of his owne Second <hi>La Roche,</hi> and the contempt of both their Chirurgions; but <hi>Valfontaine</hi> was as benigne as <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> was base and envious, and as noble as he was treacherous, and so upon his submission, hee sheathes up his sword, gives him his life, and with his hat in his hand embraceth him, and thus with many fraternall words and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, these two brothers (in all outward shew) are againe reconciled, and become perfect friends: But the end proves all things.</p>
                     <p>Now to follow the streame of our History, and the ceremonies of Duels, wee must passe from <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> and <hi>Valfontaine</hi> the Principals, to <hi>La Roche</hi> and <hi>Pont Chausey,</hi> their Seconds, to see in what shape they will come forth, and how they resolve to beare themselves in the conclusion, and knitting up of this reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; As for <hi>Pont Chausey,</hi> hee thinkes it no disparagement or shame to him now to refuse to fight, sith his Principall hath given his Enemy the foyle, in giving him his life; but contrariwise, <hi>La Roche</hi> being Second to the Challenger, not the Challenged, hee therefore holds it no lawfull plea or excuse for him to exempt himselfe from fighting. <hi>Pont Chauseys</hi> modesty seemes to over-vaile his valour with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>lence and indifferencie, which the insulting vanity of <hi>La Roche</hi> doth so farre misconstrue, as he erroniously attributes it, rather to feare and cowardise, then to reason or judgement. The worst of <hi>Pont Chauseys</hi> malice venteth no other spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and language, but that he will follow and abide the censure of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals, whether they being their Seconds ought to fight or no, and accordingly hee is ready either to retire or advance; But <hi>La Roches</hi> intemperate passions (flying a higher pitch) with much vehemencie and choller protesteth, that he came into the field purposely to fight, and not to keepe sheepe, or to catch flies with his Rapier. The two brothers interpose and consult hereon, and doe joyntly affirme, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they themselves are reconciled, and become good friends, they hold it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to reason and contradictory to the right and nature of Duels, that their Seconds should once draw their weapons, much lesse fight; But this neither doth nor can as yet satisfie <hi>La Roche,</hi> whose choller is now become so boundlesse, as he
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:16653:276"/>

When <hi>Pont Chausey</hi> (to retort and wipe off the least taint or blemish, which either <hi>La Roche,</hi> or the two brothers might conceive, lay on his reputation) thinkes it now high time to speake, because as yet he had spoken so little, and prayes <hi>La Roche</hi> to find out some expedient, either that they might returne as loving Friends, or fight it out as Honourable Enemies, and that for his part hee is so farre from the least shaddow of feare, or conceit of cowardise, as hee tels him plainely, hee shall find his Rapier of an excellent temper, and his heart of a better: Whereupon vaine and miserable <hi>La Roche,</hi> consulting with nature, and not with grace; he to give end to this difference, resolves on an expedient as wretched as execrable, the which he proposeth to <hi>Pont Chausey</hi> and the two brothers in these termes; That the onely way, and his last resolution is, that a faire paire of dice shall be the Iudge and Vmpier betweene them, and that who throwes most at one cast, it shall bee in his choice either to fight or not to fight, whereunto <hi>Pont Chausey</hi> willingly consenteth, although <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> and <hi>Valfontaine</hi> doe in vaine contradict and oppose it. But the decree is past, and <hi>La Roche</hi> (very officious in his wickednesse, and forward in his impiety) spreads his Cloake on the ground, drawes a paire of dice forth his pocket, and because he was of the Challengers side, he will throw first, which he doth, and the fortune of the dice gives him seven; <hi>Pont Chausey</hi> followes him and likewise taking the dice throwes onely five: Whereat <hi>La Roche</hi> gracelesly insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and triumphing, with an open throat cryes out, fight, fight, fight; and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently drawes his Rapier. <hi>Pont Chausey</hi> seeing his enemy armed, thinkes it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, either safe or honourable for him to be unarmed, when (yet with a kind of religious reluctancie, and unwilling willingnesse) hee likewise unsheathes his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, and so without any farther expostulation, they here approach each other: But because (for brevities sake) I resolve to passe over the circumstances, and only to mention the issue of their single combat, let mee (before I proceed farther) in the name and feare of God conjure the Christian Reader, here to admire with wonder and admiration, at his sacred Providence, and divine Iustice which in the issue of this Duell is made conspicuous and apparant to these two rash and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate Gentlemen, the Combattants, and in them to all others of the whole world; For loe, just as many picks as each of them threw on the Dice, so many wounds they severally received each from other, as <hi>Pont Chausey</hi> five, and <hi>La Roche</hi> seven, and he who so extremely desired to fight, and so insatiably thirsted after <hi>Pont Chauseyes</hi> blood, is now here by him nayled dead to the ground, and his breathlesse corpes all gored and washed in his owne blood.

<pb n="505" facs="tcp:16653:279"/>
Whereof <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> being advertised, he (with much secrecie and haste) about midnight, causeth <hi>Pierot</hi> his Fathers Miller, to fetch <hi>Marieta</hi> away from his Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses house to his Mill, which is some quarter of a League from his Fathers house, the which accordingly <hi>Pierot</hi> effecteth. The very next morning <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> goes secretly to the Mill and visits her; he informes her how her parents have incensd his against him, and against her-selfe likewise: he bids her be of good comfort, that shee shall want nothing, that hee will very shortly procure her a better lodging, and provide both for her safety and reputation, and so continually frollickes it out, and there takes his pleasure of her; yea, he lyes so often with her many whole nights and some dayes at this Mill, that at last her belly swells, and both of them appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly perceive that shee is with child by him: when poore soule, seeing her selfe as it we repent up in a prison, that she had no new Apparell, nor was towards any Husband; yea looking backe into the foulnesse of her fault, and seeing that she had made her selfe the griefe of her Father and Mother, the laughter of the world, and almost the contempt and disdaine of <hi>Quatbrisson,</hi> who (surfetting in his pleasures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>As for <hi>Quatbrisson,</hi> hee supposing he had his Fathers Miller <hi>Pierot</hi> at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, profereth him two hundred French Crownes to marry her; whereat this Meal-cap Miller (being a lusty young fellow of some five and twenty yeares old) could not at first refraine from blushing and laughing; when seeing <hi>Marieta</hi> to be young and faire, hee is so farre in love with her, as at first hee wisheth her to his wife; but then againe considering that shee hath a great belly by his young Master, that hee still lyes with her, and that if he should marry her, he would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee more Master and owner of her then himselfe, hee prayes him therefore to excuse him, for that hee is fully resolved not to marry her. When <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> yet farther desirous to draw him to take her to his wife, profereth <hi>Pierot</hi> a new Lease and Estate of his Mill from his Father for seven yeares, at his owne cost and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But this Miller (being a pleasant joviall wag) tells his young Master that hee had rather never heare the clacking of his Mill, then to live to see himselfe cornu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and so upon no tearmes will marry <hi>Marieta,</hi> but for any other service, hee sweares to him, that he is, and ever will bee wholly at his command. Poore <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieta</hi> now seeing her hopes grow small, and her belly great, and consequently her joyes decline, and her sorrowes increase, finding that she is now rather <hi>Quatbrissons</hi> prisoner then his prize, and the Miller rather her Goaler then her Landlord, shee (with many farre fetcht sighs and brinish teares) very passionatly beseecheth <hi>Quat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brisson</hi> on her knees, that he will speedily either provide her a husband, or permit her with her shamefull and sorrowfull burthen to returne home to her afflicted and angry parents. Two requests, and both so reasonable (quoth she to him) as if it be not in your power to grant me the first, yet I hope it will be your pleasure not to deny me the second. But <hi>Quatbrisson,</hi> notwithstanding all these teares and prayers of <hi>Marieta,</hi> he is still so vexed, as well with her importunity, as with the sharp com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of his own parents, and the bitter lamentations and outcries of hers, that (in the heat of sottish choller and ingratefull disdaine) he flies from her, absents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe longer then accustomed, and thenceforth (by degrees) beginnes as much to loath her, as hee formerly loved her. <hi>Marieta</hi> perceiving this his unexpected and ingratefull unkindnesse towards her, it pierceth her very heart with griefe, and her soule with despaire; Shee requests the Miller to tell <hi>Monsieur de Quatbrisson</hi> that she prayes him to see her, or to permit her to see him; but hee perceiving that his
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:16653:280"/>
young Master slighted her, and that his hot affection was by this time waxed cold and frozen to her, hee refuseth to goe himselfe, and so sends his boy: But what doth this importunity of hers procure or effect with <hi>Quatbrisson,</hi> but onely the more inflame his choller, and therein the more increase her owne sorrowes, and accelerate and hasten on her miseries? For he bids the boy tell her, that he is gone to <hi>Rennes,</hi> and will not returne in a moneth; and withall, he wills him to bid his Master to come secretly to him in the morning, at his Fathers Orchard. So if <hi>Quatbrissons</hi> unkindnesse to <hi>Marieta</hi> formerly made her seeme to bee the picture of sorrow, Ahlas, now this his discourteous departure, and disdayning either to see her, or once bid her farewell, makes her really to bee sorrow her selfe; for shee teares her haire, and (with a mournfull and sorrowfull Ambition) indeavoureth to drowne her selfe in the Ocean of her teares; yea, her griefes are so infinite, and her discontents so insupportable (in that she hath so deeply disobeyed her parents, and offended God with her Fornication) as the remembrance of these sinnes and crimes of hers make her not dare to looke up to heaven for assistance; a thousand times shee repents her selfe of her folly, and as often sayth and dictateth to her, that shee should be as happy as now she is miserable, if she againe were a child, and not with child, and that she were againe as living in her Mothers belly, as now by this time she findes her owne poore unfortunate innocent b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Shee as high as heaven exclaimeth on <hi>Quatbrissons</hi> ingratitude, and curseth the name and memory of Fryer <hi>Simplician</hi> as low as hell, for thus betraying and seducing her to sinne, which hath now brought her to misery and disconsolation; yea, her unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunacie is so great, as she cannot write for assistance from any where, or if she could, shee knowes not from whom once to expect, much lesse to receive it: but rather sees her selfe reduced to such extreme affliction and misery, that she is every way farre more capable to weep or sigh forth her sorrowes to her selfe, then to speake, or make them knowne to the world.</p>
                     <p>Whiles thus <hi>Marieta</hi> is pensively and pittifully ecchoing forth her complaints to the bare walls of her poore Chamber, <hi>Pierot</hi> the Miller findes out his young Master <hi>Quatbrisson,</hi> in the Orchard behinde his Fathers house, according to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment, where betwixt this wretched and execrable couple the Reader must prepare to see them consult and conclude a most bloudy and mournfull businesse, which will both exact pitty, and command lamentation from the most flinty and barbarous heart, yea in a word, from any living mortall man, whose prophane life and impiety hath not absolutely made him a meere devill. For <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus satiated and surfetted himselfe in reaping his beastly pleasures of poore <hi>Marieta,</hi> and (as before) exchanged his familiarity into malice, and his affection into envie towards her, knowing that shee will bee a perpetuall eye-sore to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and a continuall shame and scandall to himselfe, as long as shee lives in this world, hee therefore most ingratefully and cruelly resolves speedily to send her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another; and no consideration whatsoever, either of her youth or beauty, of her great belly, or of his quicke childe within her, or of his owne soule, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with him to the contrary: but the Devill is so strong with him, that hee is miserably resolute not to retire, but to advance in this bloudy businesse. To which effect, hee breakes with <hi>Pierot</hi> the Miller to attempt and finish it, and againe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth him the Fee-simple (or at least a Leafe of seven yeares) of his Mill, to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it; which this bloudy miscreant (out of his hellish covetousnesse, and itching desire to please his young Master) promiseth to accomplish. They now consult of the manner how to murther <hi>Marieta:</hi> The Miller affirmes it to be the surest way (under some pretext) to take her into the next Wood by night, and there to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:16653:280"/>
her, which <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> contradicteth, because (saith he) her dead body being found so neere his Fathers house, this her murther will reflect on him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make sure worke, hee bids the Miller to strangle her by night in her bed, and so to bury her in his outer yard, and there to clap a Wood-vine over her: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they both agree. When swearing perpetuall secrecie each to other, this exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Miller here promiseth <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> to dispatch her within three dayes at far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest.</p>
                     <p>This bloody bargaine and compact being thus concluded between them, <hi>Pierot</hi> the Miller returnes to his Mill, where poore <hi>Marieta</hi> (litle suspecting or dreaming, what a dismall stratagem was plotted and resolved against her life) shee (finding comfort from no where, and therefore seeking it every where) enquires of him if he came from <hi>Monsieu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now this second action and demeanor of the Spaniels, confirmes the first jealousie and apprehension of <hi>Pont Chausey</hi> and his associats, who (to vindicate this truth) are now resolute in their former proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and desire of letting out the water of the Pond, the which they attempt to effect: But then this wretched Miller seeing himselfe now so narrowly put to his trumps and shifts, and therefore knowing it high time to prevent them, at least if he meane to provide for his owne safety and life; hee with many humble and sugred speeches (not seeming any way to take notice of their apprehension) tels them, that he is a poore young man, that this is his first yeare of setting up his Trade of a Miller for himselfe, that it being now in the midst of a hot and dry Summer, his Pond will not receive in water againe for his Mill to goe in a weeke or two after, which will infallibly begger him, and therefore (almost with teares)
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:16653:281"/>
he beseecheth them to desist from their purpose, and not to turne out the water of his Pond, yea he speakes so passionatly and pittifully to them, as his reasons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with the three other Gentlemen, but with <hi>Pont Chausey</hi> they cannot, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the more confirme his former apprehension and beliefe, that sure there was some one or other drowned, and withall God doth afresh distill and infuse into his imaginations, that this very Miller himselfe might have some hand therein, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all his humble prayers and smooth speeches to the contrary: To which end <hi>Pont Chausey</hi> the better to effect his desire and resolution, hee (as a wise and discreet Gentleman) grants the Miller his request, when purposely sending away his Servants, Ducke and Dogs, hee enquires of the Miller if he have any dice or cards in his Mill, who answereth him that he hath cards, but no dice: So into the Mill they all fower goe, and play at Lansknight for Cartdescus, and the Miller (now ravished with Ioy to see how his faire tongue hath kept the water in his Pond) is wonderfull diligent to waite, and officious to attend them and their commands.</p>
                     <p>But they having played an houre, <hi>Pont Chausey</hi> now thinkes it high time for him to effect his designe and resolution, and then tels <hi>Pierot</hi> the Miller, that he is very dry and thirsty, demanding of him if there bee any wine to sell neere his Mill, who tels him there is none neerer then the Towne, where hee willingly profereth to goe and fetch some speedily, which indeed is that very part and point whereat <hi>Pont Chausey</hi> only aimed: So hee gives him money to fetch two grand pots of wine; when this inconsiderate and secure Miller (without either feare or wit) seemes rather to fly then to run to the Towne with Ioy for it, thinking and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the storme of his danger was now already quite past and blowen over; but he is no sooner out of sight, but <hi>Pont Chausey</hi> presently throwes up the Cards, and prayes the rest of the Gentlemen to assist him in drawing up the sluce and emptying the Pond, for that his heart still prompts him there is some one drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, whereunto they all give free consent; so by that time the water is halfe out, Loe (with much admiration and pitie) they behold a dead body floating therein, and yet fastned with a rope to the bottome of the Pond. And prying more narrowly to discerne it, they (by the coats it wore) perceived it to be a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom they cause to be taken up in the Mill-boat, but her flesh is so riveld and withered with the water, and eaten and disfigured by the fish, as it was impossible to know what she was, and she st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

shut him up close in his own Mill, till it be found out what this drowned murdered woman is.</p>
                     <p>The report of this mournfull accident being speedily divulged in <hi>Vannes,</hi> and bruted in the neighbour parishes, there are a world of people, who from all parts flocke to the Pond, to bee spectators of this dead woman; and among the rest, <hi>Yvon Malliot</hi> and his wife <hi>Iane Chaumet,</hi> no sooner understand hereof, but knowing it to be a woman, and drowned in <hi>Monsieur de Caerstaings</hi> Pond, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly feare it is their Daughter <hi>Marieta,</hi> and to see the issue and truth hereof she runs before, and hee limpes after as fast as he can, as if they should not come time enough to make themselves miserable, with the fight and object of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. Now they are no sooner arrived to the Pond, but they see all the people stand aloofe from this murthered corpes, because of the stinch thereof; but they (hardned by their feare, and encouraged by their affection) doe willingly rush to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, but cannot as yet discerne what she was, by reason the fishes had almost eaten away all the flesh from her bones, which therefore no way satisfying their curiosity and enquirie, they then fall to wash away the mud and oze from her clothes, hoping to draw some information and light from them, as alas they now instantly doe, for they find the Wast-coat and two Petty-coats, that of ash colour serge, and these of greene and red bayes to be the very same which their Daughter <hi>Marieta</hi> wore, when she either fled, or was stolen from them; whereat crossing their armes, and sending their sighes to heaven, and their teares to earth, this poore afflicted Father and Mother cry out that it was the dead body of their faire and unfortunate Daughter <hi>Marieta,</hi> and doubtlesse, that either <hi>Monsieur Quatbrisson</hi> or <hi>Pierot</hi> the Miller, or both of them were her Murtherers; whereat all the people admire and wonder, every one speaking thereof as their severall fancies led them, and as they stood affected, or disaffected to <hi>Quatbrisson,</hi> and the Miller.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Pont Chausey</hi> rides presently to <hi>Vannes</hi> (leaving the other three Gentlemen his friends to guard the Miller in his mill) and advertiseth the Seneshall, and the other two Iudges of this deplorable fact; so they send for this Miller to <hi>Vannes,</hi> and the next day being brought before them, they examine and accuse him for thus murthering of <hi>Marieta,</hi> but (having learnt his answer and resolution of the Devill) hee with many bitter oathes and curses denies it, deposing and swearing that he never knew her nor saw her; but this false answer and counterfeit coine of his will no way passe current with his Iudges, but they forthwith ordaine him to the Racke. Our wretched Miller <hi>Pierot</hi> is amazed and terrified at the sight here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yea now his courage begins to faile him, as fearing it to be the true Prologue, and fatall Harbinger to his death; so he endures the single torment reasonable well, but feeling the pinches and tortures of the second, and well knowing that his heart, Ioints, and patience can never endure it, hee then and there confesseth to his Iudges, that he was the only Author and Actor of this murther, and that he stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled her in his Mill, and then suncke her in his Pond, because she would never consent or yeeld to be his wife, but speakes not a word of <hi>Qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Monsieur Quatbrisson,</hi> or any other were accessary with him in this murther, when they cause his left foote to be burnt so soundly, as hee will not endure to have his right touched, and so confesseth that his young master <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> seduced and hired him to strangle <hi>Marieta</hi> in her bed in his Mill, and promised him the Fee Simple or Lease thereof to performe it, that he it was who likewise threw her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pond, and that he also beleeves she was quick with child by his said master.</p>

So the very next morning <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> (apparalled in a sute of blacke Sattin, trimmed with gold Lace) is brought to the Scaffold (at the common place of execution, which is in the midst of the Citie) where a very great concourse of people of all sorts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort and flocke to see him take his last farewell of this world, of whom the greatest part and number, lamented and pittied, that so proper and noble a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, should first deserve, and then receive so untimely a death: When after the Priests and Friers have here prepared and directed his soule, hee aseending the
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:16653:283"/>
Scaffold, with some what a low voice, and dejected and sorrowfull countenance, he delivered this short speech.</p>
                     <p>That in regard hee knowes, that (now when he is to take his last leave of this life) to charge his conscience with the concealing of any capitall crime, is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and true way to send his soule to hell in stead of heaven, hee will now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reveale, that hee is yet more execrable and bloudy, then his Iudges thinke or know, or his spectatours imagine, for that he not only hired <hi>Pierot</hi> his Fathers Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to murther <hi>Marieta,</hi> but also the Apothecary <hi>Moncallier</hi> to poyson his owne brother <hi>Valfontaine;</hi> of both which foule and bloudy crimes of his, he now free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confesseth himselfe guilty, and now from his heart and soule sorrowfully la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth and repenteth them; that his filthy lust and inordinate affection to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men was the first cause, and his neglect of prayer to God the second, which hath justly brought him to this shamefull end and confusion; that therefore he besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth all who are present to bee seriously forewarned of the like by his wofull Example, and that (in Christian charity) they will now joyne their devout pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with his to God for his soule: When on the Scaffold praying a little whiles silently to himselfe kneeling, and then putting off his Doublet, hee commits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the Executioner; who at one blow severed his head from his shoulders. But this punishment and death of <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> suffiseth not now to give full content and satisfaction to his Iudges, who (by his owne confession) considering his inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and deplorable poysoning of his owne brother <hi>Valfontaine,</hi> they as soone as hee is dead, and before he be cold, adjudge his body to bee taken downe, and there burnt to Ashes at the foot of the Gibbet, which accordingly is performed.</p>
                     <p>And here our thoughts and curiosity must now returne poast from <hi>Rennes</hi> to <hi>Vannes,</hi> and from wretched <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> to the base and bloudy Miller <hi>Pierot,</hi> whom God and his Iudges have now ordayned shall likewise smart for this his lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble murther on poore and harmelesse <hi>Marieta.</hi> Hee is brought to the Gallowes in his old dusty mealy Suite of Canvas, where a Priest preparing him to dye, hee (either out of impiety, or ignorance, or both) delivereth this idle speech to the people, That because <hi>Marieta</hi> was young and faire, hee is now heartily sorry that he had not married her, and that if he had beene as wise as covetous, the two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crownes, or the Lease of his Mill, which his yong master <hi>Monsieur Quatbrisson</hi> profered him, might have made him winke at her dishonesty, and that although she were not a true Mayd to her selfe, yet that she might have proved a true and honest wife to him, with many other frivolous words and lewd speeches tending that way; which I purposely omit, and resolve to passe over in silence, as holding them unworthy either of my relation, or the Readers knowledge: when not having the grace once to name God, to speake of his soule, to desire heaven, or to seeme to bee any way repentant and sorrowfull for this his bloody offence, hee is stripped naked, having onely his shirt fastned about his waste, and with an Iron barre hath his legs, thighes, armes, and brest, broken alive, and there his miserable body is left naked and bloudy on the Wheele, for the space of two dayes, thereby to terrifie and deterre the beholders from attempting the like wretched crime. And the Iudges of <hi>Vannes</hi> being certifyed from the Court of Parliament at <hi>Rennes,</hi> that <hi>Quatbrisson</hi> at his death charged the Apothecary <hi>Moncallier</hi> to have (at his hiring and instigation) poysoned his brother <hi>Valfontaine,</hi> they hold the Church to be too holy a place for the body and buriall of so prophane and bloudy a Villaine: When after well neere a whole yeares time that he was buried in Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Church in that Towne, they cause his Coffin to be taken up, and both his body and it to bee burnt by the common Hang-man, and his Ashes to bee throwne into the aire; Which to the Ioy of all the Spectators is accordingly performed.</p>

those Vertues in the course and conduction of his life, hee had not then defiled this History with the profusion of so many sinnes, nor besprinckled it with the effusion of so much innocent bloud, nor consequently have administred so much sorrow to the Reader, in perusing and knowing it: but as contrary Causes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce contrary Effects, so he (by this time) polluting himselfe with filthy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Company, it is no marvell if he leave his temperancie to follow drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, his chastity to commit fornication and adultery; yea, it is no marvell I say, if these foule sins (as Bawds to rage and revenge) exact such power in his heart, and predominancie in his soul, as in the end to draw him to murther: for goodmen can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive a greater plague, nor the Devill afford or give them a worse pestilence, then bad company. It is the fatall Shelves, and dismall Rocks, whereon a world of people have, and doe daily suffer shipwracke; yea, it is the griefe of a Kingdome and Countrey, the bane of our Age, and the corruption and poyson of our Times; for it turnes those who professe and pursue it, out of their estates and homes, which they are then inforced either to sell, or rather to give away to Vsurers and Cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and consequently which makes themselves, and their poore wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ready to starve and dye in our streets.

Hee loves neither his house nor his wife, but stayes abroad every day with his whores, and then at night returnes home to her starke drunke, and in lamentable sort reviles and beats her, whereas heretofore he would rather have lost his life then have strucken her, and whereas heretofore he affected and loved her so dearely, as he thought he could not be kinde enough to her, now (in the extravagancie of these his deboshed humours) he hates her so deadly as he deemes and supposeth hee cannot be sufficiently cruell to her, although her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be still so fervent to him, and her care so vigilent and respectfull of him, as shee gives him nothing but either sweet words, teares, sighs, silence, or prayers; yea, shee proves her selfe so good a woman to so bad a man, and so courteous and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous a wife to so unkinde and vitious a husband, as to the eyes and judgements of all their kinsfolkes and neighbours, they know it is now her praise and glory, and feare it will hereafter prove his shame and misery.

                        <hi>Abraham Tifflin,</hi> a very famous and religious Preacher there, when God and his ulcerated soule and conscience know the contrary, and that this pretended excuse of his is but only a false cloak to overvail his true Adultery, and prophane Impiety: for he needed not to have formerly added Whordom to his
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:16653:284"/>
Drunkennesse, and now Ingratitude, Cruelty, and Impiety to his Whordome, in regard the least of these enormous crimes and sinnes assuredly have the power, and will infallibly finde the meanes to make him futurely as miserable, as now he foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly thinkes himselfe happy; for these his journeyes to <hi>Cleraux</hi> are onely the Pilgrimage of his wanton Lust. <hi>Salyna</hi> is the Saint of his voluptuous devotion, her House the Temple of his obscene wishes, and Adultery the Oblation and Sacrifice of his lascivious desires.</p>
                     <p>Wee can difficultly make our selves guilty of a fouler sinne on earth, then to seeme sanctifyed in our devotions towards God, when we are prophane, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to appeare sound without, when we are rotten within in our Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: For as Man is the best and noblest of all Gods creatures, so an Hypocrite towards God is the worst of men, yea or rather a Devill and no man; for our hearts and actions, and our most retired thoughts, and secret darling sinnes, are as conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and transparant to Gods eyes, as his decrees and resolutions are invisible to ours, sith he sees all things, and we see nothing when we doe not see him. A mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable hight of impiety, in making of our selves foolishly sinners, and wilfully Hypocrites, and yet it is a more fatall and fearefull degree thereof, when we so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in sinne and glory in hypocrisie, as to make Apologies for the same.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Vasti</hi> not thinking either of Religion or God, frolicks it out with <hi>Salyna</hi> his strumpet in <hi>Cleraux,</hi> whiles his owne vertuous wife <hi>Hester</hi> weepes at home at <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> and when he returnes thence, hee is still so hard hearted and cruell to her, as he continually beates her. Now by this time <hi>George</hi> their Sonne is sixteene yeares of age, of a mans courage and stature, and of a very pregnant wit; so that as young as he is, hee hath beene long enough a sorrowfull eye-witnesse of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cruelty, in beating of his Mother; Hee hath formerly seene the lamentable effects, and now he falls on his knees to her, and (with teares and prayers) beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her to acquaint him with the true cause thereof, and from whence it proceeds; when his Mother (adding more confidence to his wisedome then to his youth) from point to point fully relates it to him, accordingly as we have formerly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, <hi>George</hi> bursts forth into sorrowfull passions at her repetition, and his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hereof, as not able to refraine from sighing to see her sigh, nor from wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to see her weepe; Hee as much grieves to be the Sonne of so vicious a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he rejoyceth and gloryeth to be that of so vertuous a Mother, so he makes her sorrowes his, and here weds himselfe to her quarrell (with promise and oath) either to right it with his Father, or to revenge it on <hi>Salyna,</hi> whom he knowes to be the originall cause of all these stormes and tempests, of all these afflictions and miseries which befall his Mother, and in her himselfe. He will no longer bee a child, because God and nature hath now made him a man, so the very next time hee sees his Father beate his Mother hee steps to her assistance, and defends her from the tyrannie of his blowes, and then advanceth so farre, as hee performes it with an unwilling willing resistance of him, the which his Father takes extremely ill and chollerickly from him, gives him sharpe words, and menaceth him with bitter blowes. <hi>George</hi> his Sonne, first returnes him a briefe rehearsall of the wrongs and indignities he still offereth to his Mother, when protesting of his obedience to him, he yet tels him, that he is willing to entertaine his words, but no longer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to digest and receive his blowes, adding withall (as a passionate Corolary) that ere long he will visit his Strumpet <hi>Salyna</hi> in <hi>Cleraux,</hi> and make her feele a part of her base carriage, and ill deservings, both towards his Mother and himselfe: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="516" facs="tcp:16653:285"/>
speeches grates him to his heart, and grieves him to his soule, so he puts water in his wine, holds it for that time a vertue, to be no longer stormy but calme, and then (chollerickly threatning him with his finger) he departs to his Chamber, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Wife and his Sonne consulting in the Parlour, how (with most assurance, and least scandall) they may provide for their affaires.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, <hi>Vasti</hi> his Father keepes his bed, and gives order, that neither his Wife or Sonne have admittance to him, the which discourtesie of his, gives his Sonne a fresh and strong motive, to revive his last nights discontent against his Father, and his choller against <hi>Salyna,</hi> when bidding his Mother the good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and craving her blessing, he (purposely) frames an excuse to leave her till she be ready, and so very privately takes horse, and that morning acts a busines, every way worthy of himselfe, and indeed farre more worthy of laughture, then of our pitty. For it is not so much his malice to <hi>Salyna,</hi> as his affection to his Mother <hi>Hester,</hi> which carries him and his resolution to <hi>Cleraux;</hi> where entring <hi>Salyna's</hi> house; he (with fire in his lookes and thunder in his speeches) cals her whore and strumpet, chargeth her for abusing his Father, and in him his Mother and himselfe. His choller cannot retaine his patience, to heare her false answers and apologies to the contrary, but disdaining as much to use his sword on a woman, as to foule it on a strumpet, hee takes his mans short cudgell, and gives her at least a dosen blowes on her backe, armes and shoulders therewith, seriously vowing and swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her; That if she forsake not his Fathers company, and use the meanes that henceforth he doe utterly abandon hers, hee will shortly give her so bitter a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and requitall, as hee will hardly leave her either the will or power to thanke him for his courtesie, and so remounts his horse, and presently gallops home to his Mother, whom hee acquaints therewith, but yet conceales it from his Father, whereat she seemes not to be a little joyfull, and yet heartily prayeth to God; that this breed no bad blood in her husband, or prove either an incitation to his chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler against her selfe, or a propension of revenge against their Sonne.</p>
                     <p>But this joy of <hi>Hester</hi> and her Son <hi>George,</hi> proves the sighes and teares of <hi>Salyna,</hi> who not accustomed to receive such sharpe payment, and usage from any mans hands whosoever, it makes her extreme chollericke and vindictive, so that her sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke is so great, and her heart so highly and imperiously lodged, that she will not suffer this cruell affront offered her by <hi>George Vasti,</hi> to goe unrequited; but yet she will be as advised and secret in her revenge towards him, as hee was rash and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke in his towards her. To which end and purpose, seeing that <hi>Vasti</hi> his Father came not to her that day (whereby she judged hee was wholly ignorant what had befallen her from his Sonne) she that night writes him a short Letter, and the next morning sends it home to <hi>Fribourg</hi> to him, by a confident messenger of hers, who arriving there and finding him pensively walking in his Garden, hee respectfully delivered it to him, who breaking up the seales thereof, found it spake thus.</p>

she was so zealous and religious as shee spent the greatest part of her time. Here <hi>George</hi> informes his Mother <hi>Hester</hi> at full, what conference had now past in the open fields betwixt him and his Father: And (in a word) he here acts his part and duty so well and discreetly, as hee leaves no art nor perswasions unattempted to draw her to this attonement with his Father. When shee at first considering the nature and quality of her husbands unkind and cruell usage to her, shee found an opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof in her mind, a resistance in her will, and a reluctancy in her nature and judgement; But at last giving now her former discontent to charity, her passions to peace, her sorrowes to silence, her resolutions to religion, her anger to affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, her malice to oblivion, and her griefe unto God, she (after a briefe consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and a short expostulation hereof betweene them) with a cheerefull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thankes her Sonne for his care of her, and his affection to her herein; and so informes him, That shee (having never justly offended her husband in thought word or deed) is as willing of peace and reconciliation with him, as he can possibly desire or wish, and here to testifie it to her Sonne as well in action as words, shee would then have gone downe with him to her husband, there privately to have concluded this Christian busines betwixt them, had her Sonne not diverred her from it; For being exceeding carefull to preserve his Mothers right and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he prayes her to stay, alleadging that he would presently fetch and conduct his Father to her Chamber to her, as holding it more requisite and just, that the delinquent should first see and seeke the party wronged, before the party seeke the delinquent, whereat she cannot refraine from smiling, and then bids him goe: So <hi>George</hi> descends to the Garden, and acquaints his Father with his Mothers free disposition, and cheerefull resolution to a perpetuall peace with him, whereat he seemes infinitly glad and joyfull, and so ascends her Chamber, and having saluted her, tells her, that hee is very sorrowfull and repentant for his former ill carriage and unkindnesse towards her, whereof he prayes her pardon, and constantly vowes reformation; so this his vertuous and kinde wife <hi>Hester</hi> freely forgets and forgives <hi>Vasti</hi> her husband; and then hee gives her many kisses in requitall, and bids his sonne <hi>George</hi> to provide good cheere for Supper; and the better to seale and solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize this their reconciliation and atonement, hee bids him to invite some of their Kinsfolkes and Neighbours to bee present thereat, who were formerly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <hi>Vasti</hi> having thus settled his affection and affaires with <hi>Salyna,</hi> he sees with griefe that it is now almost impossible for him to see her in <hi>Cleraux,</hi> because of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and watchfull eye of his Sonne <hi>George,</hi> over himselfe and his actions here in <hi>Fribourg;</hi> wherefore notwithstanding her wholsome and religious advice to him to beware of bloud, yet his lustfull affection to her doth so outbrave and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his naturall love to him, that to satisfie his inordinat concupisence, and to give content to his obscene and beastly desires, he vowes he will shortly send him to heaven in a bloudy Coffin. Now the sooner and better for him to compasse and finish this his deplorable stratagem, and unnaturall resolution against his sonne, his counsellour the Devill adviseth him that hee must for a short time make wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full faire weather with him, and gild over all his speeches and actions to his wife <hi>Hester,</hi> with much respect and courtesie; the which <hi>Vasti</hi> doth speedily put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: So for a moneth or sixe weekes time, hee sees not <hi>Salyna,</hi> but all things (to the eye of the world) goe in great peace, affection, and tranquillity betwixt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother, and Sonne. But this false sunshine will be too soone o'retaken with a dismall storme and tempest; for what religious or Christian shew soever <hi>Vasti</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally makes unto them, yet although he have God in his tongue, he neverthelesse internally carries the Devill about him in his heart; so againe and againe he defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively vowes &amp; swears to himself, that his son <hi>George</hi> shal not live but die. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing resolute in his bloody purpose, he likewise resolves to adde policie to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice against him, as thinking and hoping thereby, with more facility to draw him to the lure and snare which (in his diabolicall invention) he hath ordained for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, hee fills his head with the fumes and honour of military actions, inflames his courage with the generosity and dignity of a souldier, whereunto as also to travell into other Countries, he knew that this his Sonne of himselfe was already ambitiously inclined and affected. At other times hee representeth to him, to how many dammages and dangers Idlenesse is exposed and subject, and what a noble part and ornament it is in young men to learne Vertues abroad, thereby to bee the more capable to know how to practise them at home, and with what renowne and glory their Auncestors have heretofore beaten and ruined the Dukes of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> their professed enemies, and now made themselves and their country famous to the greatest Princes and Potentates of <hi>Europe,</hi> especially to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> &amp; <hi>Spain,</hi> who these many yeares, and now likewise at present (qd. he) doe equally court our affections &amp; service, though not with the same or like integrity. And these, and such treacherous Lectures, doth <hi>Vasti</hi> still reade unto his sonne <hi>George,</hi> as often as he calls him into his company and presence, untill at last the fame and name of a souldier, and the honour of travell, have so surprised his youthfull affection, and seizd on his
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:16653:288"/>
ambitious resolutions, that at last hee beseecheth his Father to send him abroad, in some martiall service, or generous imployment. But the Father being as cunning as his sonne is rash and inconsiderate, suffereth himselfe of purpose to bee earnestly and frequently importuned by him to that effect; the which hee doth: When at last his Father promiseth to send him to <hi>Rome,</hi> to his Vncle <hi>Andrew Vasti,</hi> who (he saith) is a chiefe Captaine of one of the Companies of this present Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> VIII. his Guard, who was an old man, very rich, and without wife, child, or kinsman with him. <hi>George</hi> thankes his Father for this his courtesie and honour, and importuneth him againe and againe to hasten this his departure and journey to <hi>Rome</hi> to his Vncle; the which hee then firmely promiseth him: but yet the greatest difficulty hereof is, how hee may obtaine his Wifes consent to this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of her Sonne; who at first opposeth it very strongly and passionately, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Sonne to bee her onely childe, her right arme, a great part of her selfe, the delight and joy of her life, and the prop and stay of her age. But the Father leaves his Sonne to draw and obtaine his Mothers consent, as politickely knowing and foreseeing, that the lesse himselfe, and the more his Sonne importun'd her, the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner she would graunt it; the which indeed fell out as he expected. Onely where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Sonne requested to stay foure yeares abroad, his Father gave him but three, and his Mother would graunt him but two, whereunto at last both Father and Sonne were inforced to condescend; and now this cruell hearted Father provides his courteous-natur'd sonne <hi>George</hi> a new Sute of apparell, a Horse, and Money, and resolves to accompany and bring him as farre as <hi>Turin</hi> in his journey; which courtesie of his, his Wife and Sonne take most lovingly and thankefully. The morne of <hi>George</hi> his departure comes, and because his Mother the precedent night dreamt that her Sonne should dye in this journey, she was now exceeding sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to let him goe and depart from her; but being againe fortifyed and rectifyed by the advice of her husband, and likewise vanquished by the importunate requests and praiers of her son, she bedews his cheeks with her teares, gives him much good counsell, some gold, and her blessing; and so they take leave each of other, God put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting apprehension into her heart, and the Devill assurance into her husbands reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions that shee should never see her sonne againe: And indeed I write with grief, that we shall progresse very little farther in this History, before we see her dreame verifyed, and her apprehension confirmed. The manner thus:</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Vasti</hi> (being privately as resolute in his malice and revenge to his sonne, as this his sonne is innocent in not deserving it of his Father) is so farre from bringing him to <hi>Turin,</hi> as hee will not bring him as farre as <hi>Geneva,</hi> but a mile before hee comes to <hi>Losanna</hi> (where he tels his son he would lye that night) the night approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and in a long narrow Lane, where he saw that no earthly eye could see him (being wholly deprived of the grace and feare of God, and absolutely abandoned to Satan and Hell) as his sonne rides close before him, hee shoots him thorow the backe with his Pistoll, charged with a brace of bullets, who immediately falling dead to the ground, hee there descends his horse, and (without any remorse or pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as no Father, but rather as a Devill incarnate) cuts off his nose, most lamentably scarres and mangles his face, that he might not be knowne, and so takes him on his shoulders, and there throwes him into a deepe ditch or precipice, as also the saddle and bridle of his horse, and turning the horse to seek his fortune in the wide fields, hee (to provide for his safety) rides swiftly to <hi>Morges,</hi> and there very secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly husheth himselfe up, pretending to bee sicke, and eight dayes being expired (which was the prefixed time and day hee gave his wife for his returne) hee by a contrary Rode way of <hi>Rolle,</hi> and <hi>Saint Claude,</hi> arrives home to <hi>Fribourg</hi> to her, brings her word of the health of her sonne, and of the remembrance of his duty
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:16653:288"/>
to her, and that he left him well in <hi>Turin,</hi> expecting the benefit of good company to travell up to <hi>Rome;</hi> whereat, harmlesse loving Mother, she weepes for joy, and yet rejoyceth in weeping.</p>
                     <p>And now for some ten dayes after his returne from acting this wofull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable tragedy on his sonne, hee keepes a good correspondencie and decorum with his wife <hi>Hester;</hi> but at the end thereof (soly forgetting his heart and soule, his God and his conscience, his promises and oaths, and his attonement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation) hee againe falls into the dangerous relapse of his former old Vice; Whordome and Drunkennesse; and yet counselled by a better Angell then his owne, hee forbeares to beate her, as well seeing, and now knowing, that thereby nothing redounded to him, but scandall and scorne from all his Neighbours, Friends, and Kinsfolkes. But now his lust is againe so great, and his desires so fervently lascivious towards <hi>Salyna,</hi> that in staying lesse then eight weekes, hee thinkes hee hath stayed more then seven yeares from her; when pretending ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther journey to his Wife, hee rides over to <hi>Cleraux</hi> to her. <hi>Salyna</hi> gives him many kisses for his welcome, and as many more for relating her that hee hath sent away his sonne <hi>George</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to reside and live there: for shee being his Fathers Strumpet, her guilty and sinfull conscience made her stand in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame feare of him; but yet amidst her kisses and pleasures with him (remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the tenour and contents of his last Letter to her, and her answer thereof to him) her thoughts are something touched with doubt, and her minde assaulted and perplexed with feare, that the Father had played no faire play with his Sonne, but that in regard of his inveterate malice to him for beating her, hee might have sent him to heaven, and not to <hi>Rome.</hi> To which purpose, shee feeles and sounds him every way, but he is as constant to denye it, as shee curious to inquire after it. So shee believing that hee had assumed no bloudy thoughts against his Sonne, she is not yet so devoyd of grace, or exempt of goodnesse, but shee gives him this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious caveat for a <hi>Memento,</hi> which she delivers to him accentively and passionatly, That if shee knew hee had made away his Sonne by any untimely end, or unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall accident, or that hee were any way accessary to any prodigious disaster which had befalne him, shee vowd to God, and swore unto him, that shee would spit in his face, disdaine his company, and reject his affection and himselfe for ever; for that shee was most assured and confident that God (in his due time) would po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But <hi>Vasti</hi> is past grace, and therefore slightly passeth over these vertuous speeches of his vicious <hi>Salyna,</hi> with a denyall and a kisse; and then againe they fall to their mirth and familiarity, and hee stayes there all that day, and lyes with her the whole night foll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For now <hi>Vasti</hi> her husband (to make her sorrowes the more infinite, her hopes the more desperate, and her afflictions the more remedilesse) fals againe to his old practice of beating her, notwithstanding all his late oathes and new promises to the contrary; but he the more especially playes the Tyrant with her in this kind, when he comes home to her from his cups and whores, for she knowes with griefe, that he retaines and entertaines more then <hi>Salyna,</hi> onely she is too sure that <hi>Salyna</hi> hath his purse, his company, his affection, and his heart at her command, farre more then her selfe; she sends her sighes to heaven, and her prayers to God, that (out of the profunditie of his mercie and goodnesse) hee would bee pleased, either to amend her Husband or to end her selfe; for griefes, sorrowes, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are so heaped on her, and (like the waves of the Sea) fall so fast one upon the necke of the other to her, that she is weary of her life, and of her selfe. When on a time after hee had cruelly beaten her, torne off her head attire, given her a blacke eye and swollen face, and desheveled and disparpled her haire about her eares and shoulders (making God her Protector, and her Chamber her Sanctuary, exempting her servants who came to assist and comfort her, and fast bolting her doore) she to her selfe very pensively and mournfully breathes forth these speeches.</p>

in the mire of his former vices and voluptuousnesse. For now her husband <hi>Vasti</hi> is oftner at <hi>Cleraux</hi> with his <hi>Salyna,</hi> then at home at <hi>Fribourg</hi> with his wife, who (as formerly we have understood) still makes him pay deare for his pleasures, and as a subtle rooking strumpet, emptieth his purse of his gold, as fast as he foolishly fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, he being not contented to waste his body, to shipwracke his reputation; to cast away his time, but also to cast away his estate, and himselfe on her; the which his vertuous wife cannot but observe with sorrow, and remember with griefe and vexation, but she sees it impossible for her how to redresse it: For she is not capable to dissemble her discontent to him so privately, as he publickely makes knowen his cruelty to her, wherefore her thoughts suggest her, and her judgement prompts her, to proove another experiment and triall on him. To which end she tels him, that if hee will not henceforth abandon beating of her, forsake his old vices, and become a new man, and a reformed husband, that then all delayes set apart, she will speedily (by some one of her neerest kins folkes) send poast to <hi>Rome</hi> to his brother Captaine <hi>Andrew Vasti,</hi> that her Sonne <hi>George</hi> returne home to her to <hi>Fribourg,</hi> the which shee is more then confident, upon the receipt of her first Letter, he will speedily and joyfully performe.</p>
                     <p>Her husband <hi>Vasti</hi> is extremely galled with this speech, and netled with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of his wife <hi>Hester,</hi> because (wretched villaine as he is) he (but too well) knowes hee hath already sent his Sonne to heaven in a bloody winding sheet, and therefore both feares and knowes, that by this his wifes sending poast to <hi>Rome,</hi> his deplorable and damned fact will infallibly burst forth and come to light, the which therefore to prevent, hee (as bad, and cruell hearted as the Devill himselfe) is execrably resolved to heape <hi>Ossa</hi> upon <hi>

O <hi>Hester,</hi> it had beene a singular happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for thee, that thou hadst not thus threatned thy husband <hi>Vasti,</hi> to send to <hi>Rome</hi> forthy son <hi>George,</hi> but that thou hadst either bin dumbe when thou spakest it, or he deaf when he heard it: for hereby thinking to preserve, thou hast extremely indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered thy selfe, and hoping to make thy Son thy refuge and champion, I feare with griefe, and grieve with feare, that thou hast made thy selfe the ruine of thy selfe.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Vasti</hi> is so strong with the Devill, and so weak with God, in this his bloody designe, to murther his wife <hi>Hester,</hi> as neither Grace or Nature, Religion or God, the feare of his bodies tortures in this life, or of his soules torments in that to come are able to divert him from it, he having no other reason for this his damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rage, nor no other cause for this his infernall and hellish cruelty, but this triviall and yet pittifull poore one, that his wife <hi>Hester</hi> is an eye-sore to him, because his <hi>Salyna</hi> is so to her. A wretched excuse, and execrable Apologie, and no lesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable and wretched is he that makes it. So he (turning his backe to God, and his face and heart to the Devill) provides himselfe of strong poyson, and cunningly infusing it into a muske Mellon, which he knew she loved well, and resolved to eate that day at dinner, shee greedily eating a great part of it, before night dies thereof. When very subtlely he gives out to his servants and neighbours, that she died of a surfet, in then and there eating too much of the muske Mellon; and so all of them confidently beleeve and report.</p>

thereof. He seemes wonderfull sorrowfull for his wifes death, dights himselfe and his servants all in blacke, provides a great dinner, and performes her funerall with extraordinary solemnity. But notwithstanding God lookes on him with his eye of Iustice, for both these his cruell and inhuman barbarous murthers of his son and wife, and therfore now (in his Providence) resolves to punish him sharply and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely for the same; As marke the sequell, and it will instantly informe us how.</p>
                     <p>Our debauched and bloody <hi>Vasti,</hi> immediatly upon his wifes death and buriall, doth without intermission haunt the house and company of his lascivious strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet <hi>Salyna</hi> at <hi>Cleraux,</hi> as if the enjoying of her sight, presence, and selfe, were his chiefest delight, and most soveraigne earthly felicity. Hee spends a great part of his estate on her, and to satisfie her covetous and his lustfull desires, hee is at last enforced to morgage and sell away all his Lands. For as long as hee had money, she was his, but when that failed him, then she (as a right strumpet, acted a true part of her selfe) failed in her accustomed kindnesse and familiarity towards him, and casts him off.</p>
                     <p>The judgements of God, and the decrees of Heaven, are as secret as sacred, and as miraculous as just, which we shall see will now by degrees be apparantly made good and verified in this Monster of men, and Devill of Fathers and Husbands, <hi>Vasti.</hi> For his mansion house, and all his utensills and moveables in <hi>Fribourg,</hi> are consumed with a sudden fire, proceeding from a flash of lightning from heaven; as also all his granges of corne, and stacks of hay, and yet those of all his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours round about him are untouched and safe. His corne also which growes in the field brings forth little or no encrease, his vines wither and die away, all his horses are stolen from him, and most of his cattle, sheepe and goats, dye of a new and a strange disease; For being (as it were mad) they wilfully and outragiously run themselves to death one against the other; hee is amazed at all these his (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected) wonderfull losses and crosses, and yet this vild Miscreant and inhumane Murtherer, hath his conscience still so seared up, and his heart and soule so stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and obdurated by the Devill, that he hath neither the will, power, or grace to looke up to Heaven and God, and so to see and acknowledge, from whom and for what all these afflictions and calamities befall him: He growes into great poverty, and againe to raise him and his fortunes, hee now knowes no other art or meanes left him then to marry his strumpet <hi>Salyna,</hi> to whom hee hath given great store of gold, and on whom (as wee have formerly heard) he hath spent the greatest part of his lands and estate. Hee seekes her in marriage, but (hearing of his great losses, and seeing of his extreme poverty) shee will not derogate from her selfe, but very ingratefully denies and disdaines him, and will not henceforth permit him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into her house, much lesse to see or speake with him: hee is wonderfull bitten and galled with this her unkind repulse, and then is driven to such extreme wants and necessity, as he is enforced to sell and pawne away, all those small trifles and things which are left him, thereby to give himselfe a very poore maintenance. So (as a wretched Vagabond whom God had justly abandoned for the enormity of his delicts and crimes) he now roames and straggleth up and downe the streets of <hi>Fribourg,</hi> and the countrey parishes and houses thereabouts, without meate, money, or friends, and which is infinitly worse then all, without God. But all these his calamities and disasters, are but the Harbingers and Fore-runners of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miseries and punishments, which are now suddenly and condignly prepared to surprize and befall him; whereof the Christian Reader is religiously prayed to take deep notice, and full observation; because the glory of God, and the Triumphs of his Revenge, in these his Iudgements, doe most divinely appeare, and shine forth to the whole world therein.</p>

descended from no meaner house than the famous Dukes of <hi>Tremouille</hi> by her Father, and the Victorious <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Orenge</hi> by her Mother, and who being transplanted from <hi>France,</hi> and (in the Sacred Bonds of Mariage) here matched and incorporated to your Lordship, hath (by the <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of God) in a few yoares brought you many sweet <hi>Olive Plants</hi> and <hi>Branches</hi> to perpetuate your ancient <hi>Name,</hi> and most Honourable <hi>Family</hi> of the <hi>Stanleyes.</hi>

pretended pietie of this holy Chappell of <hi>Loretto,</hi> which the Romanists say was the very Chamber wherein the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> brought up her Sonne, our Saviour Iesus Christ; or of her Picture which they likewise alleadge was drawne by the hand and pensill of the Apostle Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> and both the one and the other, as they affirme miraculously brought over the Seas from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine</hi> by Angells, and first placed by them on the Hills of <hi>Recagnati</hi> (three lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle miles thence) and long since by the said Angels translated and placed here in this small Towne of <hi>Loretto.</hi> But as for my selfe, this legend is to weake to passe current with my faith, much lesse to esteeme it as an Article of my Creed. Only this I will confesse and say. That as it was devotion not curiosity which carried our <hi>Morisini, Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Donato</hi> thither: so it was my curiosity not my Devotion which made me to take the sight thereof in my Travells. Where in the rich and sumptuous Quire of a stately Cathedrall Church, I saw this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle old Bricke Chamber (now termed the Holy Chappell, verie richly adorned with great variety of massie Gold and Silver Lampes, and this Picture of the blessed Virgin in a Shrine of Silver, most richly decked with Chaines and Robes, imbroidered with Gold and Silver, and set with pretious Stones of inestimable valew, which (to expresse the truth in one word) bred much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration in my thoughts, but no veneration at all in my heart. So I leaue <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto,</hi> and returne againe to our History, which was the onely Relique that I brought thence.</p>
                     <p>The two first dayes, our three <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallants visit this holy Chappell with much solemnity and devotion, where not to Iesus the Sonne, but to <hi>Marie</hi> the Mother they offer up their prayers, and pay their vowes of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse for their deliverance from the late storme which put them and their Ship in safety at <hi>Ancona.</hi> But the third day there betides an unexpected acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to <hi>Morisini,</hi> which will administer matter and life to this History. Hee leaves his two friends and companions in bed, and steales away to the holy Chappell, where being on his knees to his devotion, hee neere to him, sees a sweet young Gentlewoman likewise on her knees at her devotion and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons very rich in apparell, but incomparably faire and beautifull. He curiously markes her Roseat Lilly Cheekes, her piercing Eye, the Amber Tresses of her Haire, her Alablaster Necke and Paps, and her streight and slender wast, all which made her to bee the Pride and Glory of Nature; At whose sight and contemplation, his minde is so sodainely inflamed with affection to her, that hee who heretofore could not possibly bee drawne to love any Gentlewoman, or Mayden, now despight of himselfe, (and of his contrary inclination and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution) hee at first sight is inforced to love her and only her. For the more hee sees her, the more hee affects her, which engendereth such strange moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and sodaine passions in his heart that the sweetnesse of this sweet object, enforced his eyes incessantly to gaze on her both with affection and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Our <hi>Morosini</hi> would faine have boarded and saluted her there, but that hee would not make Heaven so much stoope to Earth, nor prophane the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his affection and of this place with such impietie. But at last seeing her to rise from her prayers, and so to depart the Chappell, hee could not, hee would not so leave her, nor forsake the benefit of this sweet opportunity to make himselfe knowne to her; When withdrawing his Devotion from the old Lady of <hi>Loretto</hi> to give it to this his young Lady (and pretended Mistris) in <hi>Loretto,</hi> hee trippes away after her, into the body of the Church where seeing her only attended, by a well clad Boy and her young waiting Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:16653:297"/>
(after salutes on both sides performed,) hee there profereth her his service in these generall Tearmes.</p>

                        <hi>Moros.</hi> I know not sweet young Lady, whether I may terme my selfe happy or unfortunate, in being this morning honoured with the sight of so beautifull a Nymph, and Virgin as your selfe, because in thinking to gaine my soule, I feare I have lost my heart in the amorous extasies of that delitious Object and Contemplation; therefore I beseech you thinke it not strange, that having received my wound from your Beautie, I flie to your Courtesie for my cure and remedy thereof; and that seeing you so weakely guarded, I presume to request the favour of you that you will please to accept of my Company to reconduct you to your home.</p>
                     <p>This young Lady, seeing her selfe so much gazed on by this unknowne Gentleman in the holy Chappell, and now so courteously saluted by him in the Church, shee could not refraine from dying her Lilly Cheekes with a Vermillian blush, when having too much beautie to bee too unkinde, and yet too much coynesse and modestie at first to prove too courteous to him, shee (brooking her name well) returnes him this answer.</p>

                        <hi>Imp.</hi> Sir you being so happie to have given up your Soule this morning in your devotion to the blessed Lady of this place, I doe not a little wonder, that you so soone prophane it, by endevoring to make mee believe, that you have lost your heart in the contemplation of so poore, and so unworthie a beautie as mine; For herein as you prophane your zeale to her, so doe you your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to me, sith that should bee more sacred, and this not so much faigned or hypocriticall. But such wounds still carry their cures with them, and therefore as my beauty was not capable to occasion the one, so shall not my courtesie be guilty in granting the other: If my weake guard bee not strong enough to conduct mee to my home, my <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Chastity</hi> are, as also to defend mee from the snares and lures of those Gentlemen, whose best Vertue consists more in their tongues then their soules, and more in their complements then their actions; Of which number fearing and taking you to be one, and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house being so nigh, I shall not want your company, because as I deserve so I desire it not, and therefore I will leave you, and yet not without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my thankes with you, for this your proffered favour, and unexpected courtesie.</p>
                     <p>Although <hi>Morosini</hi> could not refraine from smiling at this her sharpe and wittie answer, yet hee seeing his complement retorted, and his courtesie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with a refusall, hee could not yet refraine from biting his Lip thereat. But againe considering her to bee exceeding faire and vertuous, and hoping withall that her father might likewise prove rich, hee would not disgrace his breeding nor make himselfe a Novice in Love to bee put off with this her first repulse, but againe sounds her in these tearmes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moros.</hi> My devotion to the Mother of our Saviour doth not prophane but I hope blesse and sanctifie my affection to you and therefore if it bee not the custome of the young Ladies and Gentlewomen of <hi>Loretto</hi> to use strangers with this discourtesie, I cannot believe that you would purposly thus exercise your wit in my patience, by inflicting on mee this your unjust refusall. As for your feigned shewes of Hipocrisie: I am as innocent of them as you suspect and tearme mee guiltie and have no more snares or lures in proferring you my affection and service, than that which your pure beautie and chast vertues give mee. Neither am I of the number of those Gentlemen, whom you please
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:16653:297"/>
to traduce and disparage because their hearts and tongues agree not, or for that their actions prove not their speeches, and complements reall; because I as much disdaine as you condemne them; Therefore if you cannot give me the courtesie, I pray at least lend me the favour that I may waite on you to your Fathers house; whom I shall ever bee readie to serve with as much humility for your sake, as to cherish and obey your selfe with affection for mine owne.</p>
                     <p>This answer of <hi>Morosini</hi> makes this young Gentlewoman (whose name he and wee shall anon know) as sweetly calme, as right now shee was unkindlie passionate, so that looking stedfastly on him, and composing her countenance rather to smiles than frownes, she rejoynes with him thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Imp.</hi> It is the custome of the Ladies and Gentlewoman of <hi>Loretto,</hi> to use Strangers rather with too much respect than too little favour, especially those Gent. who savor more of honor than vanity. If therfore I have any way wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged mine owne judgment, in suspecting or not acknowledging your merits, I know I am yet as worthy of your excuse as of your reprehension. And because I understand by you that you are a stranger to this place though not to this Country, as also that you seeme to be so importunatly desirous and willing to conduct me to my Fathers house; I will therefore give a contrarie Law to my owne will, and now make civillitie dispence with my discretion by accepting of this your kinde proffer, and you shall not accompany mee thither to him, with so much respect and zeale as I will you with observance and thankes.</p>
                     <p>Which kind speech she had no sooner delivered and <hi>Morosini</hi> received, but he againe closed with her thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moros.</hi> Sweet Lady, this courtesie of yours seconding your beautie, shall eternally oblige mee to your service; and in requitall thereof, I will ever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme it my best happinesse to receive your Fathers commands, and my chiefest felicity and glory to execute yours: When reciprocally exchanging salutes, hee takes her by the hand and arme, and very gracefully conducts her to her Fathers house, not farre off from this sumptuous Church, and by the wayth ther (among other speeches and complements he gathers from herthat her Fathers name is <hi>Signior Hierome Bondino,</hi> and hers <hi>Donna Imperia</hi> his only Daughter. Wherein hee for the former fame of his wealth and the present sight of her Beautie doth both delight and glory, as dreaming of a future feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which hee shall enioy in her sight and company; whereof for the time present hee hath farre more reason to flatter than to assure himselfe.</p>
                     <p>Now wee must heere understand that this <hi>Seignior Bondino</hi> her Father, is a Gentleman of an ancient house and noble descent; and of a verie great estate both in lands and meanes, and withall he was exceeding covetous, as glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more in his wealth than in his generositie, and more in his faire and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Daughter <hi>Imperia,</hi> then in any other of his Children. Heere <hi>Morisini</hi> brings <hi>Imperia</hi> home, and shee presents him and his courtesie to her Father, who receives him respectfully and kindly thankes him for this his observance and honour to his daughter: who led by the lustre of her eyes and the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of her beautie, was so extreamly inflamed with affection towards her, as at that very instant he proclaimed himselfe her Servant, and shee the Lady Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of his heart and desires, and then it was that hee first acquainted her with his name and quality, with his intended voyage to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but chiefely with his constant desire and resolution to seeke her in marriage both of her selfe and her father. Wherefore to contract this History into a narrow Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:16653:298"/>
I will passe over his often courtings and visits of her, as also those sweet speeches, and amorous discourses and conferences which past betweene them during the space of three weekes; wherein the winde proving contrary to his voyage, proved therefore propitious to this his sute and affection. In which time hee proved himselfe so expert a Scholler (or rather a Master) in the Art of Love that hee exchanged hearts with her, obtained her affection and consent to bee his Wife upon his first returne from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but yet it was wholly impossible either for he or her to draw her fathers consent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, although many times hee sought it of him with prayers, and shee with teares. For hee making wealth to bee the verie image and idol of his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gathering that <hi>Morosini's</hi> birth farre exceeded his estate and meanes, as also that in his opinion, that his estate was yet farre greater than his capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or judgement, hee would never hearken to him, much lesse give way that hee should bee his Sonne in Law: but with much obstinacie and resolution, vowed that hee would first rather see his Daughter married to her grave than to him, the which froward and harsh resolution of his, makes our two lovers exceedingly to grieve and lament thereat. But how to remedie it they know not. <hi>Morosini</hi> now acquaints his two consorts <hi>Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For by this time their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and hearts are so strongly and firmely united, that <hi>Imperia</hi> loves <hi>Morosini</hi> a thousand times deerer than her owne life, and hee her no lesse. So when they thinke of their seperation and departure each from other, the verie conceit and thought there of drawes even droppes of blood from their hearts, and an Ocean of teares from their eyes. But because they are more amorous then su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious in their devotion and affection each to other and that (in their thoughts and desires) they sacrifice more to the Altars of <hi>Venus</hi> then to that of the Virgin <hi>Marie.</hi> Therefore Fortune more envying then pittying them, and therefore resolving to separate their bodies as farre assunder, as their hearts are neerely linked and combined together: the winde comes faire, and the Master of their Shippe sends speedily from <hi>Ancona</hi> to them to <hi>Loretto</hi> to come away, for that he is resolute to omit no time but with all expedition to weigh Anchor, and set saile for <hi>Corfu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Morosini</hi> receives this newes with infinite sorrow, and <hi>Imperia</hi> with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame griefe and amazement, so as if grace had not prevailed with nature, and her obedience to her Father vanquished and given a law to her affection towards <hi>Morosini,</hi> shee could then and there have found in her heart to have left <hi>Italy,</hi> and to accompanyed him in his voyage to <hi>Turkie</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> so sweet was his sight and presence, and so bitter was the verie thought of his abscence to her heart and minde; Here <hi>Morosini</hi> comes againe with his hat in his hand and <hi>Imperia</hi> on her knees with teares to her father, that hee will
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:16653:298"/>
grant they may contract themselves each to other before his departure, but he is deare to his requests, and inexorable to her teares and prayers. For hee vowes hee cannot, and sweares hee will not consent thereunto; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heere the Reader must conceive, for it is impossible for mee to expresse the thousand part of the sighes which hee, and the teares which shee expends at this their sorrowfull departure in so much as I cannot truly define whether hee then gave her more kisses, or shee him teares. So here shee vowes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine unmarried till his returne, and hee both promiseth and sweares, that he will returne within one yeare to her and marrie her, the which the more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So <hi>Morosini</hi> being againe and againe called away by <hi>Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Donato,</hi> hee then takes leave of <hi>Bondino,</hi> and then of his deere and sweet Daughter <hi>Imperia</hi> in whose heart and brest hee imparadiseth all his most religious prayers, and treasureth up all his amarous desires and wishes, and from thence (with his two faithfull friends and companions takes horse for <hi>Ancona,</hi> where as soone as they come their long boate is a shoare and takes them in, when the Winde continuing still exceeding faire, they presently for <hi>Corfu</hi> and <hi>Constanti ople.</hi> Where wee will leave them floating on the Seas, exposed to the favour and mercy of the windes, and according to the order of our History come wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to speake of <hi>Bondino,</hi> and of his sweet and faire daughter <hi>Imperia,</hi> to see what matter they will administer us, and what Actions and Accidents they will produce.</p>
                     <p>Whiles our faire <hi>Imperia</hi> day and night weepes and sighes for the absence of her dearest and second selfe <hi>Morosini,</hi> and with her eies and hands elected to Heaven continually praies for his pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Hee is not ignorant of her teares and pensivenesse for his absence, and knowes full well, that her solitarie walkes and palle thinne cheekes, lookes still constantly to him and never from him. But hee is resolute that his old covetousnesse shall prevent and deceive this her young affection, and that to worke on the advantage of <hi>Morosini's</hi> absence, his best and shortest course is to heave him out of her heart and minde, and contrariwise to propound and place another Husband in his stead. To which end his said daughters beautie and his owne wealth having already procured her two or three other Sutors, who earnestly seeke her in marriage, hee likes none of them so well, as old Seignior <hi>Palmerius</hi> a rich Marchant of <hi>Ancona,</hi> aged of at least sixtie yeares; whereas his faire Daughter <hi>Imperia</hi> was not above twentie foure, who was of so deformed and decrepit a personage and constitution, that hee seemed but as a withered Ianuary to this fresh Lady May, and his age but a frozen Winter to the fragrant flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:16653:299"/>
Sommer of her youth and beautie. But this old dotard <hi>Palmerius</hi> (who is every way fitter for his owne grave than for <hi>Imperia's</hi> bed) is so taken with the daintinesse of her personage, as he hopes that her youth and her fathers age will stoope and strike saile to his wealth, and therefore hee trickes and prides himselfe up both in his apparell and beard, as if Love had taken away much of his Age, now purposly to adde it to his vanity and indiscretion, so hee comes to <hi>Bondino's</hi> house at <hi>Loretto,</hi> and seekes this his faire daughter in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, where the consideration of his great estate and wealth act such wonders with her fathers heart and resolution, that her father and hee have already swapt a bargaine that hee, and none but hee shall marry his daughter, before as yet hee have the happinesse to see her. But at last her father brings her to him, chargeth her with his commands to dispose her selfe to affect and marry him, and speakes to her not onely in the language of a father, but of a King, for such is his pleasure. These speeches of her father, and the sight of this her old lover yet new sutor <hi>Palmerius,</hi> doth much amaze and terrifie his young Daughter <hi>Imperia:</hi> so shee receives and heares those with infinit affliction and sorrow, and him with much contempt and disdaine; For she rejects his suteand himselfe, and boldly tells both her father and him, that <hi>Morosini</hi> is too deeply lodged in her heart, for any other of the world to have entrance or admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and therefore (with sighes and teares) casts her selfe at her fathers feet, and prayes him that hee will not force her to marry Signior <hi>Palmerius</hi> whom shee affirmes shee cannot possibly affect; much lesse obey. But her father is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute to have it so, and therefore (passing over all other respects and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations) hee addes threates, to his commands, and vehemently chargeth her againe and againe to consent thereto. But her absent <hi>Morosini</hi> is still so present in her heart and minde, and so fresh and pleasing to her eye and memorie, that shee cannot, shee will not forget him. So that for this time her father can no more enforce her to speake with <hi>Palmerius,</hi> or draw her to see him, and thus shee puts him off for his first comming to <hi>Loretto</hi> to her. <hi>Imperia</hi> being now infinitly glad to have thus given her father the foile, and old <hi>Palmerius</hi> the repulse, shee raiseth a thousand new Trophees of joy, and victories of delight in her heart for the same, as if that outragious storme and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest (so contrary and displeasing to her heart) had received end almost as soone as beginning. Thus now ruminating on nothing lesse then on <hi>Palmerius,</hi> nor on nothing more than on her sweet and deere <hi>Morosini,</hi> (to whom in his absence shee sacrificeth all the flames of her heart, and all the vowes, desires and wishes of her soule) shee passeth away her time in perpetuall praying for his returne, for the which shee leaves not the Lady, no nor any other Saint of <hi>Loretto</hi> unadored, or unprayed to. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her hopes and desires herein, this her old sutor <hi>Palmerius,</hi> (having wholly lost the soliditie of his judgement in the excellency of her beautie) hee still keepes good correspondence, and curious intelligence with her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and continually his heart runnes as much on her youth as her fathers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse doth on his wealth and gold; so within two moneths hee returnes againe to <hi>Loretto,</hi> where he is received with as much joy of <hi>Bondino,</hi> as with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame discontent and sorrow of his Daughter <hi>Imperia,</hi> who now poore soule can receive no peace nor truce from either of them, but they incessantly haunt her as her ghosts, and faile not day and night to importune her for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of this contract and marriage, but her heart is so close united and wedded to <hi>Morosini,</hi> that it is as yet impossible for either, or both of them to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:16653:299"/>
divorce or withdraw her from him. <hi>Palmerius</hi> thinkes to gaine her by ric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> gifts and presents, but shee refuseth them all for the sake of the giver, and her father now tempts her with sweet speeches and perswasions, and then againe, terrifies her with bitter commands and threats, hoping thereby in the end to make her flexible to his desires and wishes; But his daughter <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> notwithstanding all this (with a constancie worthie of her beautie, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way equall to her selfe) resolves to frustrate the hopes of the first, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate and make vaine the expectation of the second, and so to deceive the desires and wishes of them both, and to keepe her heart wholly for <hi>Morosini</hi> as shee hath formerly promised and obliged her selfe to doe.</p>
                     <p>But although <hi>Palmerius</hi> were heretofore the first time so easily beaten off with <hi>Imperias</hi> refusall, hee will not bee so the second, and therefore his heart and mind telling him that the sweetnesse of her youth, and the delicacy of her beauty deserve a stronger, and longer siege of his affection. Hee (by the free advise and consent of her Father) resolves to stay and burne all that Sommer in <hi>Loretto,</hi> hoping that time would change her resolutions and make that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable in his Daughters affection, which now in a manner seemed to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. Thus if <hi>Palmerius</hi> use his best endevours to beare and conquer <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> one way, no lesse doth her Father another way, for the first gives her a world of sugred words and promises, and the second of sharpe and bitter threates to effect it; Poore <hi>Imperia</hi> seeing her selfe thus streightly and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly begirt on both sides, shee hath againe recourse to her sighes and teares, the only weapons left her in the absence of her <hi>Morosini</hi> to defend her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and constancie against the lust of <hi>Palmerius,</hi> and the power and tyrranny of her father <hi>Bondino.</hi> A thousand times a day shee wisheth that <hi>Constantinople</hi> were <hi>Loretto,</hi> or <hi>Loretto Constantinople,</hi> and as often prayes that either she were in <hi>Morosini's</hi> armes, or hee heere in hers. But <hi>Palmerius</hi> being as obstinate as her father was resolute and furious in this sute and motion towards her, shee shuts her selfe up in her Chamber, where seeming to drowne her selfe in her teares, shee consults with her affection, how shee should beare her selfe in a matter of this weight and importance, and what invention shee should finde out and practise, to abandon <hi>Palmerius,</hi> and to call home her <hi>Morisini</hi> to marry her, then which under Heaven shee desired nothing more, or to write truer nothing else. So at last shee resolves to send one purposely to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to hasten his returne (which now wanted but a little of his prefixed time of a yeare) when making choice of a deere friend of his of <hi>Ancona</hi> named Seignior <hi>Mercario,</hi> and furnishing him with gold for so long a journey, as to saile from <hi>Brundisium,</hi> to <hi>Ragusa,</hi> and so from thence by poast to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> she takes pen and paper, and thereon (as much with teares as incke) traceth her <hi>Morosini</hi> these lines where with shee dispatcheth him away.</p>

                     <p>Our <hi>Imperia</hi> kisseth this Letter a thousand times for her <hi>Morisini's</hi> sake who wrote and sent it her, and againe as often weepes to see, that hee loved Honor and profit better then her selfe, and <hi>Turkie</hi> better than <hi>Italy,</hi> so whereas shee formerly hoped, now shee begins to despaire of his speedy returne, and esteemes herselfe as miserable without him, as shee thought to have beene happy with him. Shee reades over his Letter againe and againe, and then weepes as fast as shee reades, at the very perusall and consideration thereof; shee would faine draw comfort from any part or branch of it, but then his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended stay affords her nothing but disconsolation and sorrow in stead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Shee blames her owne misfortune, as much as his unkindnesse, and then againe imputes this impatiencie of hers, more to her fathers crueltie, than to <hi>Morosini's</hi> discourtesie; shee loves him as much as shee hates <hi>Palmerius,</hi> and hates her selfe because <hi>Morosini</hi> will not love her more, and <hi>Palmerius</hi> lesse. But <hi>Morosini</hi> is so firmly seated and enthronized in her heart that she is constantly resolved to stay his returne, and rather to dy his victim and martyr than to live <hi>Palmerius</hi> his wife. And here her affection acts a great part in passion, as this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion doth in Love, she cannot refraine from enquiring of <hi>Mercario</hi> how <hi>Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sini</hi> lives, and how he looks, who performes the part of a friend, to his friend and tells her that hee lives in great pompe and reputation, and is the properest and bravest young Gallant either of <hi>Venice</hi> or <hi>Ital<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </hi> which hee saw in <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> at the report whereof, shee could not refraine from blushing and smiling as if her delight and ioy thereof were such, as shee could not receive or heare it, without these publike expressions and testimonies of her private zeale and interiour affection to him; But all this notwithstanding, wheresoever shee goes or turnes her selfe, her Father as her shadow, and <hi>Palmerius</hi> as her spirit, are never from her, but still follow her in all times and places without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. It is a wonder to see and consider their obstinacy to make it a match, and her resolution and refusall against it, as if they were wholly composed and made of commands and shee of denialls. In which interchangeable comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and different carriage of theirs. Wee must allow sixe moneths time more past and slidden away, where in despight of <hi>Palmerius</hi> his importunities and her fathers power shee still remaines inflexible to them constant to her <hi>Morosini,</hi> and true to her promise. But at last this old lustfull Lover <hi>Palmerius</hi> (who was fitter to kisse an image in the Church, then so sweet and faire a yong Lady as <hi>Imperia</hi> in her bed) seeing that hee had consumed and spent so long time in vaine by courting her, and that shee sleighted him and his sute as much if not more now, than when hee first meant and intended it to her, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes himselfe of a new po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Which great and unexpected proffer of his doth solely and fully weigh downe her covetous father to <hi>Palmerius</hi> his will and desire, as hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly tells him; that in lieu of this his great affection and bounty to his daughter: hee will speedily use all his power and authority with her full<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Hee lyes before her how infinitly it will import his content, and her owne good and reputation, and that few Gentlewoman of <hi>Loretto,</hi> or Ladies of the whole <hi>Marca</hi> of <hi>Anconitana,</hi> doe enioy such rich Fortunes, that his wisdome and wealth is farre to be preferred to the vanitie and prodigallity of <hi>Morosini,</hi> and that the first will assuredly bring her much content and prosperitie, but the second nothing else but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, ruine and misery, and therefore hee most importunately conjures and commands her to cut and cast off all delayes and so forthwith to dispose her selfe to love and marry <hi>Palmerius,</hi> or else hee vowes for ever to renounce her for his Daughter, and no more to acknowledge him selfe for her Father. A crueltie which (in my opinion and judgement) ought to bee admired with pittie and pittied with admiration, and not to serve for a precedent and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to other Parents, because this of <hi>Bondino's</hi> was grounded on farre more passion than reason, and covetousnesse than vertue; and which Nature hath all the reasons of the world rather than to tearme tyranny then Providence or fatherly affection in him.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Imperia</hi> is, as it were, strucke dead with griefe and sorrow, at the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt of these her Fathers cruell speeches towards her, so that shee cannot speake, nor yet weepe for sighing and sobbing but at last encouraged by her owne Vertue, as much as shee was daunted and dismayed by her fathers seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and crueltie towards her, shee (casting her selfe at his feete) with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling heart and faltering voice, returnes her heart and minde to him in these tearmes.</p>
                     <p>Honoured Sir, although my afflictions and sorrowes are such, and so infinit that I am farre more capable to weepe and sigh, then to breathe or speake them forth to you, yet I hold it my dutie, not my disobedience to acquaint you, that because marriages are first made in heaven, before contracted or consummated in Earth, therefore being so happie first to love <hi>Morosini</hi> before I was so unfortunate as to see Seignior <hi>Palmerius,</hi> I hope it is the pleasure of God, that hee hath ordained the first to bee my Husband, and consequently my selfe never to bee Wife to the second; I am proud in nothing but in my humility and obedience and therein I hope I shall still both triumph and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and yet I farre more undervallew <hi>Palmerius</hi> wealth than you doe <hi>Morosini's</hi> vertues.

His Age is to old for her Youth, and her youth farre to young for his Age; Disparity of yeares seldome (or never) breedes any true content or felicitie in marriage. Hee cannot sufficiently estimate, much lesse deserve or requite the dainties of her youth, so that truth must heere needs implore this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation for mee of modesty, to affirme that his chiefest power was desire; and his best performance but lust towards her, for whiles every night, as soone as he comes to bed to her, he falls to his sleepe; so poore young Gentlewoman shee turnes to her repentance, wishing (from her very heart and soule) that her husbands bed were her grave, and that her Nuptialls had beene her fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. A thousand times every day and night shee accuseth her Fathers crueltie and (with bitter sighes and teares) as often condemneth her owne levity and inconstancy for consenting thereunto. Shee can neither honour or love her husband, or rather not love him because shee so tenderly loves the person, and honoureth the memory of <hi>Morosini.</hi> Thus whiles <hi>Palmerius</hi> retaineth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth our <hi>Imperia</hi> in his bed, no lesse doth shee her <hi>Morosini</hi> in her heart, so that the first hath only her body, but the second wholy her minde and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the sorrowfull consideration and remembrance whereof, doth so torment her heart and perplexe her minde, that shee protesteth publikely to her selfe, and privatly to all the world, that there is no calamity equall to hers, nor no misery comparable to that of a discontented bed. Thus being as much a maid as a wife, and yet more a Nunne than a maid, shee makes spirituall bookes her exercise, solitarinesse her pastime, her chamber her chappell, and her closset her Oratory to pray to God to forgive her Fathers cruelty, and her husbands indiscretion towards her, as also her owne inconstancy and treachery towards <hi>Morosini,</hi> which foule ingratitude and crime of hers shee cannot remember but with extreame griefe, nor once thinke of, but with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite shame sorrow, and repentance.

He is stricken at the heart at this sorrowfull newes, and (too too soone for him) believes it with as much affliction as admiration. By this time likewise is <hi>Imperia</hi> advertised of his and their arrivall, whereat she seemes to drowne her selfe in a whole deluge of teares; yet not for sorrow but for joy of his arrivall. He imployes <hi>Mercario</hi> to her to grant him a private visit, the which most joyfully the next night shee doth in her owne house, her old husband being in bed and snoring fast a sleepe. At <hi>Morisini's</hi> first sight and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into her chamber (where shee all alone privately stayes for him) shee throwes her selfe on her knees at his feet, and with sighes, teares, and blushes begges his pardon for her unconstancy in marrying <hi>Palmerius,</hi> the which shee no way attributes to his long stay, but rather to her fathers cruelty and her owne misfortune. <hi>Morosini</hi> is as joyfull of her sight as sorrowfull of this her errour, and so will not permit her to kneele, because hee sees and knowes, and also assureth her, that she is still the Goddesse of his heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Hee takes her up in his armes, and there embraceth and freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons her, and so they reciprocally speake each to other in the sweet language of love, I meane of kisses, sighes, and teares, with the last whereof, they againe and againe, bedew and wash each others cheekes, as if love had made them far more capable to sigh than speake, and to weepe than sigh: Here their old af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections revive, and flame forth a new with more violence and impetuositie. Shee hath no power to deny him any thing, no not her selfe. For as he sweares to live her servant, so she constantly vowes to live and dye his handmaid, and that his will shall ever bee her Law, and his requests in all things her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.

They all see the young Wife with love and pity, but looke on her old Husband with contempt and envie; yet <hi>Morosini</hi> then and there in stealth sees <hi>Imperia's</hi> heart in her eyes, when in counterchange, she knowes his heart by his enamoured lookes and countenance: So <hi>Palmerius</hi> (being as innocent as aged) having discoursed with them about their voyage, and about <hi>Turkie</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and courteously prayed them to be no strangers to him and his house, whiles the contrary winds kept them here in <hi>Ancona,</hi> which they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and thankfully promise him, they for this time take leave each of other, <hi>Astonichus</hi> and <hi>Donato</hi> highly applauding the beauty of <hi>Imperia,</hi> and <hi>Morosini</hi> infinitely condemning and contemning the simplicity and age of her old Husband <hi>Palmerius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this is not all, for that very after-noone <hi>Morosini</hi> (out of the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat and passion of his love) by a confident messenger sends to pray <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peria</hi> to meet him at three of the clocke in her Garden, which was a pretty way distant from her house, the which shee joyfully grants him; and here it is where they meet, and where I am enforced to say, that in the pavillion or banquetting house of this Garden, these our two youthfull lovers (after a thousand sweet kisses and embraces) first received each of other those amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous delights and pleasures, which modesty will not, and chastity and honesty cannot permit mee to mention, as also for that these pils of sugar are most commonly candide in bitter wormwood and gall, and but too frequently prove honey to the palate, but poyson to the heart and soule.</p>
                     <p>And here in this her Garden (I say againe) was the very first time and place where our faire <hi>Imperia,</hi> who was so famous in <hi>Loretto</hi> and <hi>Ancona</hi> for her piety and chastity, forgetting the first, made shipwracke of the last, and where of a Gentlewoman of honour, shee lost her honour, by committing this her beastly sinne of sensuality and Adultery. When the winds, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Morosini's</hi> voyage, proved so favourable and propitious to his lustfull desires, that he thinks of nothing lesse than of his returne to <hi>Venice,</hi> nor of any thing so much as of his stay here in <hi>Ancona,</hi> with his faire and sweet love <hi>Imperia;</hi> who likewise finds lesse content and pleasure in the company of her Husband <hi>Palmerius</hi> than she hoped for, and now farre more in her deare friend <hi>Morosini</hi> than she either dreamt or expected: In which triviall regard, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full consideration, shee (in a manner) abandons the first, and gives her selfe wholly over to the will and pleasure of the second, and so turning the custome of these their lascivious daliances into a habit, and that into a second nature, both in her Garden, and her owne house, shee very often (both by day and night) commits this bitter-sweet sinne of Adultery with <hi>Morosini,</hi> whereof a subtill young Nephew of <hi>Palmerius,</hi> of some eighteene yeares old, who was his sisters sonne, and termed <hi>Richardo,</hi> takes exact and curious notice, and once among the rest hee peeps in at the key-hole of his Aunts chamber doore, and there sees her and Seignior <hi>Morosini</hi> on the bed together, and in no lesse familiarity than was requisite, or could be expected betwixt his Unkle her Husband <hi>Palmerius</hi> and her selfe; whereupon secretly envying and hating her, because he was afraid shee should beare away all, or at least the greatest part of his said Unkles Estate and wealth from him, (who for want of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:16653:304"/>
hoped that he therefore should be his adopted heire) he therefore mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously beares the remembrance of this object &amp; accident in his mind, with an intent that when occasion should hereafter present the report and knowledge thereof to his said Unkle, might justly cause him wholly to heave and raze her out of his good opinion &amp; affection. As for <hi>Morosini</hi> and <hi>Imperia,</hi> they (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this) doe still strongly endeavour to bleare the eyes of her Husband <hi>Palmerius,</hi> who (thinking his wife to be as chaste as faire, and rather a <hi>Diana</hi> than a <hi>Lais)</hi> out of his good nature doth sometimes in his house feast <hi>Morosini,</hi> and his two Consorts <hi>Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Donato:</hi> But they will prove pernitious and fatall guests to him, for ere long we shall see them require this hospitality and courtesie of his, with a prodigious and treacherous ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. In which meane time all <hi>Ancona</hi> resounds of the great expence and profuse prodigality of <hi>Morosini,</hi> and his two associates, for they here revell it out in the best Tavernes and companies of the City, and not onely exceed others, but also themselves, in the richnesse and bravery of their apparell, but most especially <hi>Morisini,</hi> whose apparell is every way fitter for an Italian No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, than a Venetian Merchant. Our lustfull and lascivious <hi>Imperia</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well contented or pleased but in his presence, and her Husbands absence; and here to relate the truth of her heart, <hi>Morosini</hi> is more her Husband than <hi>Palmerius,</hi> or rather <hi>Palmerius</hi> is but the shadow, and <hi>Morosini</hi> the essentiall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of her Husband, and therefore (I desire the Reader to know and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) that in that regard and consideration I have purposely entituled this History not to be of <hi>Palmerius</hi> and <hi>Imperia</hi> but of <hi>Morosini</hi> and <hi>Imperia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Morosini, Astonicus,</hi> and <hi>Donato</hi> (in their lodging and chambers) have many times many private speeches and conferences, what pity it is that so sweet and faire a young Gentlewoman as <hi>Imperia,</hi> should (by the constraint of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde and cruell father) thus bee clogged and chained in mariage to so old a dotard as <hi>Palmerius,</hi> (for a more favourable Epithite their vanity and folly could not afford to give him) and <hi>Morosini</hi> (in the dumbe eloquence and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke of <hi>Imperia's</hi> sighs and teares) apparantly beleeves that (in her heart and soule) she infinitely desireth and wisheth that <hi>Palmerius</hi> were in Heaven, and himselfe now her Husband here on earth in his place: He reads as much in her looks and countenance, and is therefore confident that her heart and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aspire to no sweeter earthly felicity. Hee hath not lost his wit in his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor wholly drowned his judgement, either in the fresh Roses and Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of her beauty, or in the resplendent lustre of those sparkling Diamonds and starres, her eyes. He knowes that his Estate is farre inferiour to his birth and extraction, and yet that his prodigalities and expences (both in <hi>Turkie</hi> and <hi>Italy)</hi> are farre superiour and above his Estate: He would faigne (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) finde out the meanes to beare up his port, and consequently to preserve his reputation with the whole world, the which he esteemes equall to his life, if not above it. Hee knowes that <hi>Imperia</hi> is already more his Wife than her Husbands, and is very confident that he can make her apt for any impression, and capable of any designe, which may advance his owne fortunes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme both their contents, whereunto conjoyning the sweetnesse of her beauty the excellencie of her feature, and the exceeding great wealth of her old Husband, hee adding all these considerations together, they here weigh him downe to Hell &amp; Satan, by terminating his thoughts and fixing his heart upon this hellish resolution, to send him speedily to Heaven in a bloudy winding sheet; and no other charitable thought, or Christian consideration
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:16653:305"/>
can divert him from this inhumane and bloudy project, neither can hee pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly reape any truce of his thoughts, or peace of his heart, before hee have attempted and finished it.</p>
                     <p>To which end, the very next night that he lay and wantonized in bed with his <hi>Imperia</hi> (for God knowes her old Husband lay but seldome with her) and finding her extraordinarily to sigh, hee layes hold of this advantage, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, and very earnestly demands of her what ayles her, where at her tongue then fled to her heart, because her heart was then flying from God to the Divell, so shee continues her sighing, but is still mute and returnes him no answer. Till at last <hi>Morosini</hi> suspecting that in her which his hopes desired, and his desires hoped for, then I say what his demands could not obtaine of her his kisses doe, when swearing him to secresie, shee) after many farre fetcht fighes) tells him; that shee loves him so deerly and tenderly, as for his sake shee either wisheth her selfe in her grave or her husband <hi>Palmerius</hi> in Heaven which is the sweet musique and melody that <hi>Morosini</hi> expects, and which to his unexpressable joy hee now receives from her, when paying her the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and interest of this her deerest Love and affection towards him, with many kisses; he passionately intreates her, that shee will imploy him to finish this pleasing tragedy, but shee is againe mute hereat, and therefore hee againe more earnestly entreates her to conferre this favour on him; Who then taking counsell of her Lust, and of Hell, shee grants his first request here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with silence, but his second with a free and cheerefull consent. When as two wretched and bloody miscreants) they reciprocally sweare secresie herein each to other, as also that they wil speedily dispatch him, and so in a very short time after marry each other &amp; no longer live in <hi>Ancona</hi> but in <hi>Venice.</hi> But what a fatall, what a hellish contract was this, which they equally confirme as well with oathes as kisses, and how at one time do I pitty both their youth &amp; folly, and hate their obscence affections each to other; and their foule crimes unto God herein. They cannot content themselves with lust but with blood, for they are so resolutely inhumane and impious, as they will needs adde murther to adultery, as if one of these two foule sinnes were not enough sufficient to make both of them wretched in this life, if not miserable in that to come; but the Devill is so strong with them as they vow to advance, and disdaine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in the perpetration of this deplorable businesse; So from the matter they proceed to the manner hereof. <hi>Morosini</hi> proposeth poyson, but <hi>Imperia</hi> rejects this his opinion, as being dangerous both in the procuring, and administring When she propoundeth to have him stifled by night in his bed, to the which after two or three pauses and consideratious, hee will and freely consenteth. So heereon they both doe finally agree and resolve. But because <hi>Morosini</hi> knowes his <hi>Imperia</hi> to be a wife and weake woman, and therefore fitter for counsell than execution, and himselfe alone peradventure not strong enough (with safetie) to performe it without some other mens assistance, he therefore tells her that hee will likewise engage his faithfull friends and companions <hi>Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Donato</hi> herein. But <hi>Imperia</hi> is extreamely against it, as grounding her apprehension and feare upon this Maxime. That as one is more capable and proper to keepe counsell then two, so consequently are two than foure. But when (in answere hereof) he vowes and sweares to her that they they are no lesse his faithfull friends and servants than hee hers; then (with much alacrity and joy) shee yeelds thereunto, so they confirming this their agreement with many oathes, and sealing it with a world of kisses
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:16653:305"/>
hee leaves this his faire sweet-heart in bed, and at breake of day departs from her, and so hies him home to his owne Lodging to his two companions <hi>Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> and <hi>Donato,</hi> who (the premises considered) doe perfectly know, at what midnight Masse he hath beene, what shrine he hath visited, and what Saint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored and prayed to.</p>
                     <p>Some three houres after they all call for their breakfasts, the which as soone as they have taken and ended, (for still as yet the winde is contrary for them to set saile for <hi>Venice) Morosini</hi> prayes them forthwith to walke with him up to the <hi>Domo</hi> (or Cathedrall Church) of that Cittie which stands over it on a high rockie Hill, and there proudly lookes up toward, the Mountaines of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto,</hi> and <hi>Recagnati,</hi> and downe to the azurd plaines and valleyes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driatique Sea (whereon <hi>Boreas</hi> rings his Northerne peales, and <hi>Neptune</hi> danceth his Southerne Lavolta's.) So here in this famous Church, (which was built for offering up religious prayers to God, and not for making up bloody conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and contracts to, and with the Devill) <hi>Morosini</hi> first acquaints them with this businesse, and with his, and his <hi>Imperia's</hi> most earnest prayers, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate requests for their assistance therein; Sith the life of her old doating Husband was no lesse their affliction and misery, then this his death would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly prove their prosperity, triumph and glory, because shee was formerly contracted to himselfe, long before hee marryed her: which shee was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and constrained to doe through the cruelty and tyrannie of her Father. Now as their needs not many good words and perswasions to base hearts, and polluted and prophane soules, who of themselves are already disposed to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, and prepared to sinfull actions. So (because of <hi>Morosini's</hi> old friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and familiarity, of <hi>Imperias</hi> beauty, and her old Husband <hi>Palmerius</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great wealth and riches) these two gracelesse wretches <hi>Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Donato</hi> doe cheerefully promise <hi>Morosini,</hi> the very utmost of their possible powers for the accomplishment heereof, whereon they all three doe there solemnly and interchangeably give their hands and oathes as also for eternall secresie. Which done they returne to their Lodging; and at dinner (when they had purposly sent away their Servants, as also those of the house) they in very great glasses of <hi>Albania</hi> wine, doe on their knees drinke healths to the prosperitie of this their intended great busines: The which after dinner <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosini</hi> (with much ioy) fully relates to his <hi>Imperia,</hi> and shee (for her part) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands and receives it from him with no lesse delight and exhileration. When being (as strongly seduced &amp; provoked by their lacivious desires, as they were meerely propagated and engendered by the Devill who was the first and sole Author thereof, impatient of all delayes they conclude to finish this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the second night after, which (as I have beene credibly informed in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona)</hi> was the very Eve of the purification of the blessed Uirgin <hi>Mary</hi> so famous and famoused in <hi>Loretto,</hi> and hereon these our two lustfull and lewd Lovers <hi>Morosini</hi> and <hi>Imperia</hi> doe give and take exact and curious directions each from other, both of the houre and the manner thereby the better to dispatch it, with lesse danger, and more assurance and facilitie; And they are so lascivious in their wishes, so vaine and prophane in their hopes, so cruell and in humane in their desires, and so fierce and bloody in their resolutions, as they thinke every houre an age before they see it effected.</p>
                     <p>All this while our innocent and harmelesse old <hi>Palmerius,</hi> albeit hee have the will but not the power to please his young wife <hi>Imperia</hi> by night, yet by day (yea and almost every day) hee hath hoth the power and will to bestow
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:16653:306"/>
some rich gifts and presents on her, and to raine downe showers of Gold into her lap, as <hi>Iove</hi> did to his faire <hi>Danae,</hi> and as one way hee held it his felicity to gaze &amp; contemplate on the excellency of her pure beautie, so againe he made it his delight and glory to see her flant it out in rich and brave apparell, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to provide her the most rarest Viands and dantiest dyet that gold or silver could procure. But poore <hi>Palmerius</hi> (all this cost and courtesie of thine to thy Wife notwithstanding) I am enforced to write with equall pitty to thee, and shame to her, little dost thou conceive or thinke, what a dangerous Cockatrice or pernitious Viper thou harbourest in harbouring her in thy House, thy Bed, thy Bosome.</p>
                     <p>The dismall night being now come, which these foure execrable person; have designed and destined for the finishing of this deplorable businesse. It is no sooner twelve of the Clocke by <hi>Morosini's</hi> watch, but hee with <hi>Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Donato</hi> (with their Rapiers and Pistols without any light) iffue forth their Lodging, and presently trip away to <hi>Palmerius</hi> house, where (according to promise) they find the street doore a little open and <hi>Imperia</hi> (as a fury of hell) there readie to receive them, when although it were a time and place farmore fitter for them to tremble than kisse; yet so fervent is the fire of <hi>Morosini</hi> &amp; <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perias</hi> lascivious and furious affection; as they cannot yet refraine from giving each other one, or two at least. When leaving <hi>Donato</hi> (with his Rapier drawn) closewithin the doore, to guard and make it good against all opposing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening accidents, <hi>Morosini</hi> leades <hi>Imperia</hi> by her right arme, and <hi>Astonicus</hi> by the left, and so for the more securitie (purposely) leaving their shoes below with <hi>Donato,</hi> and drawing on wollen pumpes, they all three ascend the staires when shee with wonderfull silence) first conducts them to her owne Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (which was some two distant from her (Husbands) where the windowes being close shut, and a small waxe candle burning on her table, and her prayer booke by it wherein (still expecting the houre of midnight) shee silently read whiles the Divell held the candle to her, shee there gives each of them a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to worke this damnable fact, having silently given such order, that her Husbands Nephew <hi>Richardo,</hi> and all the Servants of the house, were gone to bed above three houres before: Thus this treacherous Shee-Devill <hi>Imperia</hi> (for I can no more tearme her a woman, much lesse a wife, and least of all a Christian) is the fatall guide to bloody <hi>Morosini</hi> and <hi>Astonicus,</hi> who brings them first to the doore of her old Husband <hi>Palmerius</hi> his Chamber, which shee had purposly left a little open, and then to his bed, who is deeply and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sleeping in his innocency towards them, as they were but too too wide wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in their inveterate malice against him, shee keeping the doore, and <hi>Moro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sini</hi> standing by one side of the bed and <hi>Astonicus</hi> by the other, they there in regard of his impotency and weakenesse) doe easily stifle him to death, not so much as suffering him either once to cry or screech, and then to make sure worke, they speedily and violently thrust a small Orenge into his mouth, thereby the better to cover and colour out this their villany to the world in making all men beleeve, that it was <hi>Palmerius</hi> himselfe, who had put that Orenge into his owne mouth thereby purposely to destroy himselfe, when leaving his breathlesse body in his bed, they secretly issue forth the Chamber and shee drawes fast the door after her, and so descends with them down the staires to the street doore, where with much triumphs ioy, and thankes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them all; <hi>Morosini</hi> giving his <hi>Imperia</hi> many kisses, and shee desiring them all three immediately to repaire to their Lodgings, and not to stirre
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:16653:306"/>
thence till they heare from her, which she promiseth <hi>Morosini</hi> shall be as soone as conveniently and possibly shee can, they depart home. When she first softly bolting the street doore, and then her owne chamber doore, shee presently (with much security and no repentance) betakes her selfe to her bed, where (vilde wretch that shee is) shee no more wakes for griefe at the life, but now sleepes for joy at the death of her old doating Husband <hi>Palmerius.</hi> But wee shall not goe farre before we see God convert these her triumphes into teares and this her false joy into true misery and confusion for the same, The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thus.</p>
                     <p>Whiles <hi>Morosini, Astonicus,</hi> and <hi>Donato,</hi> doe in their lodging for joy of this their bloudy fact, carowse the remainder of the night, and the next morning keepe their beds till nine of the cloke, without once thinking of God or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or of fearing either Hell or Satan. <hi>Imperia</hi> putting an Angells face on her divellish heart, goes (according to her accustomed manner) about sixe of the clocke in the morning away with her waiting maid, and her prayer booke and beades in hand to heare Masse at Saint <hi>Francis</hi> (which is the gray Fryers) Church neere to the Iewes Street, with an intent to stay there in her Orai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons till past eight. But let the reader judge with what a prophane zeale, and prodigious and impious devotion shee doth it, as also farther know, that God who is the great Iudge of Heaven and Earth (in his sacred Iustice) is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to bring this lamentable murthering of <hi>Palmerius</hi> to detection and light and to proclaime and publish it to the sight and knowledge of the world by a way no lesse strange than remarkeable.</p>
                     <p>Within lesse than halfe an houre that <hi>Imperia</hi> went away to Masse to Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Church, an Innekeeper of <hi>Loretto</hi> who dwelt there at the signe of the Crowne named <hi>Antonio Herbas,</hi> arrives there in <hi>Ancona</hi> to <hi>Palmerius</hi> house with a letter for him from his Father <hi>Bondino,</hi> who speaking with his Nephew <hi>Richardo,</hi> hee delivereth and sendeth up the Letter to his Vnckle, who then opening the lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>h of his chamber doore, he no sooner entereth but with his foote hee stumbles at a paire of rich gloves, which taking up and knowing them to belong to <hi>Seignior Morosini,</hi> because some two or three daies together he had seene him weare them, he with a smile claps them into his pocket, and so giving his Uncle the good morow, he advanceth up to his bed to deliver him this Letter; When withdrawing the curtaines he (contrary to his expectation) findes him dead, and well neere cold in his bed with a whole small Orenge in his mouth, wherat he makes so lamentable and sorrowfull an outcry, that the noise thereof brings up two Servants of the house to enquire and know what the cause thereof might be. Who being likewise sad specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this their masters sodaine and unfortunate death, they conceieve and beleeve, that hee had voluntarily stopped his owne breath, and destroyed himselfe by putting this Orenge in his mouth, and that his face being blacke and swollen, was only his owne strugling for life against death; which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of theirs in common sence and reason was probable enough, if God had not here resolved to disprove it, in verifying and making apparant the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For <hi>Richardo</hi> (who was of a pregnant wit, and of a sharpe and quicke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension) considering that these were <hi>Morosini's</hi> gloves which hee found there in his Vncles chamber; And his memory now telling his heart, what la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scivious daliances and obscene embraces and familiarity his eyes had lately seene and known between him, and his Aunt <hi>Imperia,</hi> as also that God hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prompted and informed his soule, that they both had an equall share and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:16653:307"/>
hand in this lamentable murther of his Uncle, and that it was farre better for him justly to ruine her now, then she unjustly to begger him hereafter. Hee therefore (with teares in his eyes) prayes the Servants to stay a little while in the Chamber with his dead Vncle till his returne; and then with those gloves in his pocket, and this letter in his hand) hee speedes away to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destate (or criminall Iudge) of this Cittie named Seignior <hi>Loudovicus Ceranno</hi> and in a passionate and sorrowfull speech makes him know as much as himself knowes of this lamentable murther of his Vncle <hi>Palmerius,</hi> for the which hee strongly chargeth <hi>Morosini</hi> and his said Aunt <hi>Imperia</hi> to bee the Author and Actor, and so craves Iustice on them both for the same. This grave personage is very sorrowfull at this lamentable accident, and likewise at this relation and accusation of <hi>Richardo,</hi> aswell for the manner thereof, as for the qualitie of the persons who he heares, and feares are interested herein, when walking a turne or twodeeply contemplating hereon in his chamber, he sits himselfe down in his Chaire, and then (bidding <hi>Richardo</hi> approach neerer to him) he seriously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of him these foure Questions.

If he depart speedily to <hi>Venice,</hi> then burne this Letter in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona</hi> (which I now send the there by my Neighbour <hi>Antonio Herbas)</hi> But if he farther protract his stay there, then speedily bring thy selfe, and thy wife away to me here in <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto;</hi> where my House shall be a Sanctuary for her, and a Castle and Cittadel for thy self: sleight not this my carefull, and tender advise to thee, but rather resolve with considence, that as God gave it first to my heart, so from my Heart I most affectionately now send it to thee.</p>

in his bed by his Wife <hi>Imperia</hi> and her lover <hi>Morosini,</hi> yet (as a wise Iudge and a prudent magistrate) hee will informe his knowledge of one important point more, for the better disquisition and vindication of the truth of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable businesse. Hee will not send any subordinate Officer, but a private friend of his to the Hoast of the Ship upon the Key, where <hi>Morosini</hi> lodged, whose name hee now knowes to bee <hi>Stephano Fundi,</hi> and that (in favour of a cup of Wine) hee should courteously allure him home to his house and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the which that friend of his performes, where the Podestate then told him, that hee hath beene informed by divers, that hee is an honest man, and therefore in friendly sort hee prayes him to answer him the truth of three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which he shall make unto him. First if <hi>Morosini</hi> and his friends <hi>Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Donato</hi> lay in his house all the last night, or if not, when they went abroad, and at what houre returned. When <hi>Fundi</hi> (performing his duty &amp; reverence to the Podestate) tells him, that they all three, went forth of his house together the last night with their Rapiers without any lights, a little after twelve of the clocke and returned home againe a little before two as neere as hee could guesse. Secondly, the Podestate shewes him the gloves, and askes of him if he thought these were <hi>Morosini's</hi> to the which he answered, he did assure himselfe they were, for that he had many times seene him weare them. Thirdly he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of him if he knew where <hi>Morosini, Astonicus,</hi> and <hi>Donato</hi> now were; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he made answer, that after they came home to his house the last night, they merrily carowsed and dranke in their Chamber till sixe of the clocke in the morning; that they then went to their beds, and there as yet, they all lay soundly sleeping. The Podestate having thus happily cleered all these rubs he makes no doubt they were the murtherers of <hi>Palmerius,</hi> and therfore resolves speedily to lay sure hold of them all. But hee is so solid and wise in his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of justice, as he will adde subtiltie to his power, and discretion to his authority. First therefore in friendly manner he confines <hi>Fundi</hi> to a chamber here in his owne House to prevent that hee should not returne home to tell tales to <hi>Morosini</hi> and his associates. Then hee presently sends away two of his owne Sonnes who were gallant young Gentlemen, named <hi>Seignior Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> and <hi>Thomaso Ceranno</hi> (who were ignorant of all this matter) with his coach to Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Church, and when they there see the faire Gentlewoman <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peria</hi> to issue forth, then in courteous manner not to faile to bring her away in coach with them to his House, under pretext and coulour that the Lady <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> their mother doth desire to see and speak with her, and that she will please to passe one houre with her in her garden, with whom, and where she (by the way of visits) had formerly sometimes beene. These two young Gentlemen (in obedience to their fathers commands) drive away to that Church, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently espie <hi>Imperia</hi> on her knees who now riseth and goes forth, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her, and in the street with their hats in their hands do present their Lady Mothers request and errand to her, as wee have formerly heard. <hi>Imperia</hi> knowing them to bee the Podestates two Sonnes, shee at first is so infinitly perplexed, grieved and amazed hereat. Yea shee is hereupon vexed and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in so strange a manner, that with much perturbation of mind, she now (through her foule and guilty conscience) looks pale for sorrow, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly red againe for shame, so that in the turning of a hand, and twinckling of an eye shee exchangeth the Lillies of her cheekes into Roses, and those Roses as soone againe into Lillies. But then (fearing her danger least when shee had all the reasons of the world both to doubt and feare it most) considering that
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:16653:308"/>
the Podestate and the Lady his wife were her kinde and honourable good friends, and had now sent their coach for her, as also observing the faire carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and courteous language of these two her young sonnes towards her. Shee then (being blinded by the Devill) doth so wholly forget both her crime and her danger, her judgement and her selfe, that rejecting her feare, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing her countenance to a modest cheerefullnesse, she willingly obeyes the mothers commands, and accepts of the Sonnes courtesie and so goes along home with them in their Coach, where being arrived. These two young Gentlemen, doe usher and conduct her up to the gallery, where not the Lady their Mother, but the Podestate their father, (accompanied with two other grave Officers of Iustice attend her comming. Their very first sight is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently capable to daunt her courage with feare, and to transpierce her heart and soule with sorrow; When the Podestate calling her to him, hee with a sterne countenance gives her this thundering peale for her goodmorrow and breakefast. That hee is sorry to see that so faire a Gentlewoman as her selfe, should harbour and enshrine so foule a heart. That her good old Husband <hi>Seignior Palmerius</hi> is this morning found stifled to death in his bed with an Orenge in his mouth, and that he both thinkes and assures himselfe, it is done by her, and by her bloody Ruffian and Enamourato <hi>Morosini,</hi> for the which he saith he is constrained (in honour to justice) to make her Prisoner to the Pope his holinesse, his Soverainge Lord and Master, wherat this false Hipocrite <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peria</hi> (with a world of sighes and teares cries out and tells him, that she left her old Husband <hi>Palmerius</hi> in perfect health in his bed this morning, that therfore shee hopeth and trusteth in God hee is not murthered, or if hee bee, that it must needs bee done by his wretched Nephew <hi>Richardo,</hi> who impatiently ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and hoped for his great wealth and riches, or else by some Devill in his shape, of his seducing and hiring him therunto. That <hi>Morosini</hi> is not her Ruffian or Enamourato, but a brave marchant by his profession, &amp; an Honorable Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Venice</hi> by birth and extraction, and that shee dares pawne her life for his that they are both of them as innocent of this foule crime, as the infants who were borne but the last night, and that shee hath farre more reason to weepe for the death of her husband, than any way to feare her owne life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause shee knowes that God is the defender of innocents, and the protector of the righteous, with many other passionate and sorrowfull speeches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting and looking that way; but these her speeches and teares cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with the Podestate, for both hee and his two collegues doe yet firmely beleeve that shee is guilty of this inhumane murther; So he imprisoneth her in a chamber of his owne house for that day, and intends at night to send her to the common Goale of that Citty. Now as shee is led along betwene two Ushers (or Serjeants) through a lower roome, where all the Podestates Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and some few others of the Citty were flocked thither to see her passe by, shee infinitly more caring for her <hi>Morosini's</hi> life, and fearing his death than her own, it is her chance to espy <hi>Mercario</hi> (whom we have formerly understood shee sent with her Letters to him to <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and knowing that the Serjeants would then difficultly permit her to speake with any of the company, shee amidst her teares be thinkes herselfe of a pretty policy; for as shee past close by <hi>Mercario</hi> shee purposly lets fall her gloves and wet hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefe for him to take up, the which he doth; and as hee was stooping to effect it, shee secretly and swiftly rounds him in his eare thus. I pray goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly upon the Kaye to <hi>Morosini's</hi> lodging, and tell him that I am a prisoner
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:16653:308"/>
in the Podestates house, for the businesse hee knowes of, and herefore that he (and <hi>Astanicus</hi> and <hi>Donato)</hi> doe speedily provide for their safety; as also that if I had a thousand lives I would willingly lose and sacrifice them all for to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his, and that I will live and dye his most loving friend and faithfull hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide, the which as soone as shee had uttered, shee is imprisoned in a darke Chamber: where shee hath none but her guilty conscience, the bare walles, and the two Serieants for her miserable comforters; and yet here (thinking to breath and draw some hope among all her dispaire and sorrowes she praies one of the Serjeants to report her humble service to the Lady <hi>Honoria</hi> the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destates Wife, and to pray her to oblige and honour her so much as to see and speake a word with her. But she having beene informed by the Iudge her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that he absolutly held and beleeved her to be the murtherer of her own Husband <hi>Seignior Palmerius,</hi> shee was too Honourable to grant <hi>Imperia</hi> this courtesie, and therefore (in detestation of her foule fact) highly disdained to afford her this charitie and consolation, and so slatly denies either to see or speake with her.</p>
                     <p>And now doe the Podestate, and his two Colleagues sit and debate in councell with themselves, how and in what manner to surprise <hi>Morosini, Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> and <hi>Donato,</hi> for although they are not sure, yet by their absence the last night from their lodging with <hi>Morosini</hi> they thinke that they two are Acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries with him herein; First, they are of opinion to seize on their ship, which is at anchor in the Roade, termed the Realto of Venice (a name I thinke deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and taken from the marchants Exchange of that ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But upon more mature deliberation, they resolve to abandon this their opinion, and so to seize on their persons, but not to arrest or make stay of their Ship and although their reale to justice, and hast for their apprehension be very great, yet <hi>Mercario</hi> out of his respects to <hi>Imperia</hi> and affection to <hi>Marosini</hi> tripped on through the by Streetes and neerest way to the Key so swiftly, as hee had allready secretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated him and his two consorts the sorrowfull newes which <hi>Imperia</hi> sent them by him. Whereat with feare in their hearts and courages, and amazement in their lookes and countenances, they all three leape from their beds to their swords, discharge their Inne, packe up their Truncks and bagage and resolve with all possible speed to flie to their ship, and then if not with, yet against the windes to put into Sea, and for their safetie to leave <hi>Ancona,</hi> and saile for <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> But yet here <hi>Morosini's</hi> heart is perplexed with a thousand Torments to understand of his <hi>Imperia's</hi> eminent and apparant danger, and with many Hels in stead of one to see that hee must now thus sodainly leave her deere sight and company, which hee every way esteemes no lesse then either his earthly felicity, or his Heaven upon earth. But here againe violently called away by the importunate cries of <hi>Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Donato,</hi> and yet farre more by the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his owne proper feare and danger; <hi>Mercario</hi> is no sooner stollen away from them, but they all three with their swords drawne rush downe the stayres with equall intents and resolution to exchange their Inne for their Ship, and thereby to metamorphose their danger into security; But they shall see that these weake and reeling hopes of theirs will now deceive them. For they finde all doores of their Inne lockt within <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

without, with many armed Serjeants Soldiours, and Citizens for their apprehension: And although <hi>Morosini, Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Donato,</hi> were so inflamed with their youthful bloud and courage, as they were once generously resolved to sell their lives deerely, and with their Pistolls, and Swords to prefer an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to an infamous death, yet being farre overmastered with numbers and therefore enforced to take a Law of the stronger; Whereunto they the sooner hearken and consent, in regard the Serjeants and officers doe politick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cry out to them, and pray them to yeeld, as affirming that to their knowledg their resolution and feare doth far exceed the danger of their offences. They make a vertue of necessity, and unlocking the doores of their In and chambers do cheerfully yeeld up their persons, pistolls and swords to the Popes Officers of Iustice, who as soone conveigh them all three to the common prison of that Citty, which was the same wherein our not so sorrowfull as unfortunate <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> was already entred, and where to her unexpressible griefe, and <hi>Morosini's</hi> unparalel'd affliction &amp; disconsolation, such exact charge was given of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destate, and such curiousheed observed and taken of the Goaler, that he could not possibly be permitted either to see or speak with her, or she with him, the which indeed they conceived to be farre more sharp than their crime, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly more bitter than the consideration either of their feare or danger.</p>
                     <p>Now the newes of these lamentable Accidents being speedily posted from <hi>Ancona</hi> to <hi>Loretto,</hi> our <hi>Imperia's</hi> cruell Father <hi>Bondino</hi> no sooner is ascertained thereof. But seeing his sonne in law <hi>Palmerius</hi> murthered in his bed, and his wife and his own only daughter <hi>Imperia</hi> (with her Ruffian <hi>Morosini</hi> and his two consorts) to be imprisoned as the Authors, and actors thereof, hee for the love hee bore to her life and the tender pitty and sorrow hee felt of the infamy of her approaching death, sodainly falls sicke, and dies; Wherof his imprisoned Daughter <hi>Imperia</hi> understanding, shee (in regard of his former severity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her) is so much passionate, and so little compassionate as shee rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth than lamenteth at it; Onely shee prayes God to forgive his soule of that crueltie of his in enforcing her to marry <hi>Palmerius,</hi> which shee knowes to bee the the originall cause, and fatall cloud from whence have proceeded al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But these two grave and prudent Iudges, yet strongly suspecting the contrary, they will not be deluded with the airy words, and sugred speeches and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations of their pretended innocency, but consult between themselves what here to resolve on for the vindication of this truth; So at last they hold it expedient and requisite first to expose <hi>Astonicus</hi> to the torments of the Racke, the which (hee being a strong and robustuous man) hee endureth, with a firme resolution and constancy every way above himselfe, and almost beyond beliefe, and still confesseth nothing, but his innocency and ignorance of this deplorable fact, whereof the Judges resting not yet satisfied, they within an houre after adjudge <hi>Donato</hi> to the tortures of the Scarpines, who being a little timbred man, of a pale complexion and weake constitution of body, his right foote no sooner feeles the unsufferable fury of the fire, and his tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors then confidently promising him all desired favour from his Iudges if hee will confesse the truth, but after some sorrowfull teares, and pittifull cries hee fully and amply doth, and in the same manner and forme, as in all its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances we have formerly understood. The which when the Iudges heare of, they cannot refraine, first from admiring and wondering there at, and then from lamenting that personages of their ranke and quality should bee the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and Actors of so foule and lamentable a murther especially of this faire Gentlewoman <hi>Imperia</hi> to her owne good old husband <hi>Palmerius.</hi> Now by this time also are <hi>Morosini, Imperia</hi> and <hi>Astonicus</hi> acquainted with this fatall confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and accusation of <hi>Donato</hi> against them for this murther, wherat they do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely lament &amp; grieve, because they are therby perfectly assured that it hath infallibly made them all three liable, and obnoxious to death, as also for that their supposed firme friend <hi>Donato</hi> proved himself so false a man, and so true a coward to be the cause therof, wherin they so much forget themselves, as they doe not once thinke, and they will not therefore remember, that the detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this their foule murther proceeded immediatly from Heaven, and originally from the providence and justice of the Lord of Hostes.</p>

If therefore I doe not content the curiositie, I yet hope I shall satisfie the judgement of my Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, here briefly to signifie this their limited houre is no sooner past, but to the sharpe affliction of <hi>Morosini,</hi> the bitter anxiety of <hi>Imperia,</hi> they by their Goalers are separated and confined to their severall chambers, where (by the charity of their Iudges) they finde two Friers and two Nuns attending them, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their soules for Heaven, and in a lesse vaine, and a more serious and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conference to entertaine both their time, and themselves, from an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the speculation and contemplation of a divine and heavenly love, as also from them to <hi>Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Donato.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But before I proceed farther, Wee must understand, that the two Fryers have not been with <hi>Morosini</hi> and the two Nuns with <hi>Imperia</hi> above an houre, But by the two Iudges there is a cheife subordinate Officers of theirs sent to prison to tel <hi>Imperia,</hi> that her Uncle <hi>Seignior Alexandro Bondino,</hi> a great Senator and famous Iudge of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath obtained her pardon of this present Pope <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> the eighth. But shee is not of glad of this newes, as shee is then curious to enquire if her <hi>Morosini</hi> bee likewise pardoned, so the Officer tells her no, and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:16653:310"/>
that hee absolutely must suffer death, then shee weepes farre faster than shee rejoyceth, and affirmes that shee will not live but dye. The Iudges send for her, and perswade her to live, but she begges them as importunarely to give <hi>Morosini</hi> his life, as they doe her to accept and receive her owne. They tell her they have not the power to grant her the first, and she replies, that shee then hath not the will to embrace and entertaine the second. They acquaint <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosini</hi> herewith, who by their order and by their selves doe strongly perswade her hereunto, but her first answer and resolution is her last, that shee willac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of no life if he must dye, neither will hee refuse any death conditionally that shee may live to survive him. The two Friers and two Nunnes use their best Art and Oratory to perswade her hereunto, but they meet with impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to make her affection to <hi>Morosini,</hi> and her resolution to her selfe flexible hereunto. Her life is not halfe so pretious to her as is his, for if shee had many as shee hath but one, shee is both ready and resolute to lose and sacrifice them all for his sake, and would esteeme it her felicity that her death might redeem and ransome his life. The Judges (out of their goodnesse and charity;) afford a whole day to invite and perswade her hereunto, but shee is still deafe to their requests, and still one and the same woman, desirous to live with him, or constant and resolute to dye for him. Therefore when n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>thing can prevaile with her, because dye he must, so dye shee will; to the which shee cheerefully prepares her selfe, with an equall affection and resolution, which I rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire than commend in her.</p>
                     <p>So the next morning theyare all foure brought to the place of common exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution to suffer death. Where <hi>Donato</hi> is first liftedup to the Ladder, who being fuller of paine than words said little in effect, but that he wished he had either died in <hi>Constantinople</hi> or <hi>Aleppo,</hi> or else sunke in the sea before he came to <hi>Anco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and not to have here ended his daies in misery and infamy. The next who was ordered to follow him was <hi>Astonicus,</hi> who told the world boldly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hee cared lesse for his death than for the cause thereof, and that hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Morosini</hi> so perfectly and dearely, that he rather reioyced than grieved to dye for him, only he repented himselfe for assisting to murther <hi>Palmerius,</hi> and from his heart and soule beseeched God to forgive it him, and so he was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned over. Then <hi>Morosini</hi> ascends the Ladder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ad in a haire coulour sattin sute and a paire of crimson silke stockings, with garters and roses edged with silver lace, being so vaine in his carriage, action, and speeches, as before hee once thought of God, hee (with a world of sighes) takes a solemneleave of his sweet heart <hi>Imperia,</hi> and with all the powers of his heart and soule prayes her to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his life, and so to survive him; He makes an exact and godly confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his sinnes to God and the world, and yet neverthelesse hee is so vaine in his affection toward <hi>Imperia,</hi> as hee takes both to witnesse, that had hee a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand lives he would cheerefully lose them all to save and preserve hers. As for <hi>Imperia</hi> such was her deere and tender affection to him, as she would faine look on him, as long as he lives, and yet she equally desires and resolves rather to dy than to see him die, and because she hath not the power, therefore she turnes her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Now although our <hi>Imperia</hi> bee here againe and againe solicited by the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Friers and Nuns to accept of her life, yet she seeing her other selfe <hi>Morosini</hi> dead, shee therefore disdaines to survive him; shee hath so much love in her

heart, as she now hath little life, and lesse joy in her lookes and countenance. Shee ascends the Ladder in a plaine blacke Taffeta Gowne, a plaine thicke set Ruffe, a white Lawne Quayfe, and a long blacke Cypresse vayle over her head with a white paire of gloves, and her prayer booke in her hands. When bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farre more capable to weepe than speake, shee casting a wonderfull sad and sorrowfull looke on her dead lover <hi>Morosini,</hi> after many volleyes of farre fetchd sighes shee delivers this short speech to that great concourse of people who from Citty and Country flocked thither to see her and them dye,</p>
                     <p>Good People: I had lived more happy and not dyed so miserable if my Father <hi>Bondino</hi> had not so cruelly enforced mee to marry <hi>Palmerius</hi> whom I could not love, and to leave <hi>Morosini,</hi> whom in heart and soule I ever affected a thousand times deerer than mine owne life, and may all fathers who now see my death, or shall hereafter heare or reade this my History bee more pittifull and lesse cruell to their daughters by his Example. I doe here now suffer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deaths in one to see that my deere <hi>Morosini</hi> is dead for my sake, for had hee not loved mee deerly and I him tenderly he had never died for mee, nor I for him, with such cheerefullnesse and alacrity as now we doe. And here to deale truly with God and the world, although I could never affect or fancy my old husband <hi>Palmerius,</hi> yet no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> from my heart and soule I lament and repent that ever I was guilty of his innocent and untimely death, the which God forgive me, and I likewise request you all to pray unto God to forgive it me. And not to conceale or dissemble the truth of my heart, I grieve not to dye, but rather because I have no more lives to lose for my <hi>Morosini's</hi> affection and sake. I have and doe devoutly pray unto God for his soule, and so I heartily request and conjure you all to doe for mine. Thus I commend you all to happy and prosperous lives, my selfe to a pious and patient death in earth, and a joyfull and glorious resurrection in Heaven, when signing her selfe often with the signe of the crosse, she pulls her vaile downe over her face, and so praying that she might be buried in one and the same grave with <hi>Morosini,</hi> she bad the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner performe his office, who immediatly turnes her over.</p>
                     <p>And if reports be true. Never three young men, and one faire young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman died more lamented and pittied then they. For <hi>Morosini</hi> died with more resolution than repentance, and <hi>Imperia</hi> with more repentance than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution; thus was their lives, and thus their deaths. May wee extract wisdome out of their folly, and charity out of their cruelty, so shall wee live as happy as they died miserably and finish our daies and lives in as much content and tranquillity as they ended theirs in shame, infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and confusion.</p>

The sight and knowledg whereof drownes all the pleasures of her life, insomuch as shee could sacrifice to nothing but to Sorrow and Repentance, and that which grieved her most and worst of all was to see that hee disdained her advise and counsell, and that hee was so far from reformation, as his vices grew and encreased with his yeares: and had now not only taken up a habit but a second nature in the perversity of his lewd actione and affections.

entred, for the end of his sicknesse, and the recovery of his health; and I write rather with teares than inke, that it was impossible for him to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a worse; but such was his fate, such his misfortune. He likes the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Isabella</hi> his Hostesse, farre better than the countenance or condition of <hi>Adrian</hi> her Husband; but as his disease gives him no truce, so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he can give no peace to his patience. He grieves to be sicke in an unknowne place, and among strangers, but farre more to be so farre off from his owne house, and from his onely childe and sonne <hi>Leonardo,</hi> whom hee loves farre dearer than himselfe. It is another affliction to him, that his money and some jewels are here, and not at his home, and if his judgement faile him not, he sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesteth to himselfe, that the sight and knowledge thereof may engender him farre more danger than security; but hee conceales and dissembles that, farre better than he can his sicknesse, for he puts his little Casket wherein it is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his head and bolster. Hee causeth <hi>Adrian</hi> his Hoast to bring him a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, named <hi>La Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As for <hi>Isabella,</hi> according to the lawes of hospitality (which ought to be unviolable to all the world) shee tends him with much respect and diligence, and in a word, performes the part and duty, both of a good Hostesse, and of a good woman: But for her Husband <hi>Adrian,</hi> his thoughts and resolutions runne another contrary course and Carriere; for hee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining <hi>De Laurier</hi> to bee rich doth therefore verily hope and pray that hee may speedily die in his house, or else hee hath already swapt a bargaine with the Devill, to murther him, thereby to make up the breaches and tuines of his poore and totteri gestate. He finds it a worke not onely of difficulty, but of impossibility, to know what rich stuffe hee hath in his Casket and Cloak-bagge, because hee still keeps it under his pillow; and yet gathering and wresting from him, that hee is a Goldsmith of <hi>Dijon,</hi> and that hee came now from <hi>Franckford</hi> Mart, he therefore beleeves that he hath store of Gold and Jewels about him. His poverty and his covetousnesse gives the switch to the Devill, and the Devill gives the spur to him, to raise his uncharitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation into bloudy actions, and his thoughts and resolutions as so many lines, runne to terminate in this one onely Centre, which is that of <hi>De Lauriers</hi> death. He sets his wits and invention on the Tenter-hooks, to discover this imagined <hi>Indies</hi> but he finds him to be as cautious and secret in concealing, as hee himselfe is curious to bewray it. Hee purposly keeps all company from him, and will not so much as permit his Physitian or Apothecary to speake a word with him, but hee will still bee present to heare and understand it. Hee with oylie words and silken speeches, pryes into his deepest secrets, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posly endevoureth to insinuate and screw himselfe into his familiarity. But <hi>De Laurier</hi> doth rather feare than love him, and so esteemes the revealing of his Cold to be the accelerating of his danger, to which end, with many colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable excuses and evasions, he puts him off the knowledge thereof. But hee is so miserable to see his miseries approach, because the violence and impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of his Feaver doth every way advance, no way retire; and now it is that his hopes of the recovery of his health doe fade, not flourish, and rather quaile than prosper. Hee resolves to bee as Religious as hee is sicke, and therefore
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:16653:313"/>
prayes his Hoast <hi>Adrian</hi> to bring him a Priest to give him the Sacrament; <hi>Adrian</hi> performes his request, but brings him a Priest named father <hi>Iustini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

His continuall vanities and prodigalities hath likewise made him poore, so being equall with <hi>Adrian</hi> both in Vice and Poverty, he is likewise equall, and sympathizeth with him in hope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to repaire his Indigence, and to enrich himselfe by the supposed treasure and death of <hi>De Laurier.</hi> But as this deboshed Priest is malitious in this his policy, so he is also polititike in this his malice, for imagining that <hi>Adrian</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and aimes with him at the same Butt and marke; he dares, but yet will not acquaint him with his bloudy purpose, to contract a hellish league and confederation with him, for the violent dispatch, and inhumane and untimely dispeeding of him away from Earth to Heaven. Whiles thus <hi>De Lauriers</hi> sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and weaknes encreaseth, and his Priest and <hi>Adrians</hi> covetousnesse begins wholly to weigh downe their soules and resolutions to hasten his deplorable death; as the Priest is ready to breake his minde to <hi>Adrian,</hi> how and in what manner they should finish and compasse this bloudy businesse, <hi>Adrian</hi> contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, yea, and directly contrary to the rules of Nature, and Lawes of Grace, breaks his minde hereof to his vertuous and Religious wife <hi>Isabella,</hi> whom he seeks to draw in as an Actor in this mournfull, and as an Agent in this cruell Tragedy. He is as gracelesse, as impudent in this foule and fatall attempt of his; for he sets upon her with the sweetest speech, and smoothest perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that either Art could suggest, or the malice of the Devill invent or dictate to him, and therein ever and anon, leaves not to conveigh and distill in her minde, yea, and to imprint in her memory their fore-past wealth, their present poverty and misery, and the undoubted great riches of Gold and Jewels which <hi>De Laurier</hi> had with him, in that (as formerly we have observed) he very carefully day and night kept his Casket under his pillow, and in a hellish eloquence represents unto her the facility of this fact, either by Pony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard or poyson, adding withall, that the danger thereof would infallibly die with him, with a thousand other damnable alluring speeches, conducing and looking that way, which I am farre more inclinable to silence than expresse: But wretched Villaine, and execrable miscreant that hee is, hee speaks not a word, no not a syllable of God or his Justice, of Heaven or Hell, or of the foulnesse of that fact, or the just revenge and punishment incident and due thereunto.</p>
                     <p>His vertuous wife <hi>Isabella</hi> is amazed and astonished at this bloudy and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane proposition of her Husband, and all trembling, with sighs and teares, receives it from him with no lesse true affliction and sorrow, than he delivered it her with cruelty and impiety. Her cheeks were as red for shame, as his were pale with envie thereat; when God infusing as much goodnesse into her heart and tongue, as Satan had cruelty into his soule and resolutions, she fell on her knees to his feet, and with her eyes and hands erected towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, delivered him this vertuous and Religious speech; That it was with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite griefe and amazement that shee understood this his bloudy position to her, which he knew she could derive from none but Hel and Satan: She repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to him (with much griefe and passion) that as punishment is ever the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of sinne, so that of all sinnes murther was the foulest, and the most perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

She tels him farther, that covetousnesse is the root of all mischiefe, that for her part she is as thankfull to God, as he is displeased with himselfe for their povertie, and that shee would ever choose rather to live in want, than to dye in shame and misery, and which is worst of all either to live or dye in the horrours and terrours of a guilty and ulcerated Conscience. That it is a prophane and prodigious impiety to violate the lawes of Hospitality, but a fearefull, yea a horrible crime, to kill any one under our owne roofe, and who (in the right of humanity and christianity) comes to us for shelter and protection. When rising againe from her knees, shee takes him about the neck and (bedewing his cheekes with her teares) conjures and prayes him, by the remembrance of her youth and beautie, which had formerly beene so deere and pretious to him, by the memory of their sixteene yeares sweet cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conversation together in the holy Estate of Wedlocke, yea for his owne sake, for his soules sake, and for Gods sake, that hee would defie this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, which thus with his two bitter sweet pills of Covetousnesse and Murther mocked and sought to betray him: and that therefore (in the name and feare of God) hee would henceforth resume, and put on a constant and religious resolution, no more to seduce her, or to suffer himselfe to bee seduced by the Devill in imbruing their guilty hands in the innocent blood of this honest and harmelesse Goldsmith <hi>De Laurier,</hi> whom God hath now made their guest and Lodger; In doing whereof (quoth shee) the same our sacred Lord and God, (in his due time) will bee gratiously pleased to encrease our estate and means and to blesse our povertie with plenty. But her Husband <hi>Adrian</hi> (as a most wretched Villane takes this godly refusall and deniall of his Wife in ill part, and in requitall and consideration thereof, henceforth lookes on her with a squint eye, I meane with an eye rather of contempt and envie than of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But at board, and bed, yea day and night he haunts her as a ghost, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaves pursuing of her with his prophane and importunate solicitations to draw her consent to the acting and perpetrating of this bloody businesse; But God so well assisted her minde and thoughts, with the grace of his holy Spirit, and so divinely fortified her heart and soule with his sacred feare, that her Husbands sweet perswasions could not gaine, nor his threats or menaces ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any thing of her but still shee answered this murtherous request of his, sometimes with religious refusalls, and then againe with passionate and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory denialls, and therefore the more that shee sees her Husband bent to maligne and hate <hi>De Laurier,</hi> the more devoted and resolute shee is to respect and tend him, still bearing a curious, a carefull, and a vigilant eye over him du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the time of his sicknesse to see that no disaster whatsoever might befall him in her house</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adrian</hi> missing of this his purpose and desire in his Wife hee is yet so hastie and violent in this his bloody malice towards <hi>De Laurier,</hi> that measuring of Fa ther <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Priest, by himselfe, and finding a conformity in their debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed vices and inclinations, hee the sooner hopes to finde a sympathy in their affections and resolutions, and therefore although hee bee a Priest, yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to bee extreame poore, hee therefore the more easily beleeves, that the hope of Gold and Silver will act wonders with him, and make him act wonders for the obtaining thereof.</p>
                     <p>Upon these hopes, and this confidence, hee delayes no time, but on a Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning repaires to his house, and after their morning cups, telling him he hath a secret of great importance to reveale him, he takes him into a little
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:16653:314"/>
Grove of Walnut Trees, behinde his house and there (swearing him to secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie) reveales him this his bloody businesse, where this vitious Priest <hi>Iustinian,</hi> in hope of <hi>De Lauriers</hi> wealth needed no great labour or industrie to be drawn to make one in this deplorable Tragedy. For had not <hi>Adrian</hi> now opened it to him, such was his insatiable thirst and desire of gold though with bloud, that the next day he was fullie resolved to doe it to him, so he freely consents to him herein, and sweares to assist and second him in murthering of <hi>De Laurier</hi> and the tye and condition of this their hellish bargaine is, that what gold, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or jewells they shall finde him to have, they will instantly after his death equally divide and share betweene them; and hereunto like two bloody hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, they enterchangeably give hands, and solemnly sweare each to other. Now from the matter of this their bloody designe and resolution, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the manner and time thereof, but they then are prevented therein, For Father <hi>Iustinians</hi> little Boy which was accustomed to answer him at Masse comes thither hastily and with his little wine pot on his finger tells him, that there were many persons who stayed for him before the Altar on their knees and earnestly enquired for him to say Masse, whereupon they both referre the conclusion hereof to the very next morning, and in the very same place and Grove, but at least an houre sooner; So away goes <hi>Adrian</hi> home to his house, and away likewise trips Father <hi>Iustinian</hi> with his Surplesse under his arme and his Breviary (or Matines booke) in his hand to the Church, where every one may imagine what a prophane sacrifice, his bloody heart and hands offereth up to the Lord.</p>
                     <p>They this night thinking of nothing but of gold and blood, in the morning they (impatient of all delayes) come at the aforesaid time and place of their rendezvous where they presently fall to their former consultation of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and time of murthering <hi>De Laurier,</hi> first, they propose to stabbe him in his bed to death, but this they reject, because the blood would appeare in the sheets, bed, and chamber; So they resolve to poyson him, and to this end <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> buies the poyson and Father <hi>Iustinian</hi> will give and administer it to him in a wafer or <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> the which hee is sometimes accustomed to give him in his sicknesse; But here father <hi>Iustinian</hi> suggesteth another doubt; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth another designe, which is that <hi>Adrian</hi> must likewise draw in his wife <hi>Isabella</hi> to make one in this bloody conspiracy and murther, or else hee allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that it can never bee safe for them to attempt or effect it; <hi>Adrian</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him that hee hath heretofore with his best power and art sought to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his wife hereunto, but that hee finds it wholly impossible to draw her to this consent: But father <hi>Iustinian</hi> will yet make another tryall and experiment on her himselfe, so hee and her Husband <hi>Adrian</hi> set afresh on her, to allure her to bring at least her consent, if not her hand to the murthering of <hi>De Laurier.</hi> But our sweet and vertuous <hi>Isabella</hi> is still one and the same woman, for shee heares these bloody speeches and perswasions of theirs, with infinite discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and detestation. Shee is too much a Christian to bee so much a Devill to consent to the murtherof this honest man; and therfore (with a world ofteares and prayers) shee seekes to divert them from it, but especially her Husband, because (quoth shee) the issue thereof will infallibly prove ruinous to them both. They are both much grieved at this her resolute repulse and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and yet to make a vertue of necessity, and to cast the better glosse and varnish on their villany, they now falsly seeme to bee diswaded from this murther, by the sight of her teares and the consideration of her requests and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:16653:314"/>
prayers; Wherfore with a prophane &amp; hellish dissimulation) they tell her, that God by her religious speeches and disswasions hath now made them wholly to abandon that bloody attempt of theirs against <hi>De Laurier,</hi> as also the very thought thereof, and therefore they conjure her to keepe and sweare secresie herein from all the world, the which she willingly doth. But yet her feare prompts her heart, that this humane conversion, and religious resolution of theirs is only false and faigned, as every way savouring more of dissimulation than truth. In which regard shee feares with suspition, and suspects with doubt, that no lesse than honest and innocent <hi>De Lauriers</hi> life, lies now at the stake of their bloudy malice and envie</p>
                     <p>Here Father <hi>Instinian,</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> (to make smooth and cleere work) do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and resolve that <hi>Isabella</hi> must bee speedily removed from <hi>Salines</hi> to some place in the countrey without once seeing or speaking with <hi>De Laurier</hi> when a favourable occasion seconds their damnable intents, and desires herin: for now there is unexpectedly brought them word, that her owne old Father who dwelt some foure leagues off from <hi>Salines</hi> is very sicke and not like to live; Whereupon <hi>Adrian</hi> presently dispatcheth away his wife <hi>Isabella</hi> to him, and with her their Servant maide <hi>Graceta.</hi> But before hir departure shee is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to see <hi>De Laurier,</hi> and to take her leave of him; but her Husband will by no meanes permit her; So shee goes from her home, and from him into the Country, with a sorrowfull and a trembling heart, as farre more fearing <hi>De Lauriers</hi> unnaturall death, then doubting of her fathers naturall case. For her heart frames her so many apprehensions, feares, and terrours; that her husband and father <hi>Iustimian</hi> are fully resolved to murther and make away <hi>De Laurier,</hi> as shee absolutely and sorrowfully beleeves, that hee shall never see her more nor she him. Poore <hi>De Laurier</hi> takes his Hostesse <hi>Isabellas</hi> sodaine and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted departure from him very pensively and heavily, and far the more in that shee could not bee permitted to see him before shee went. He holds it for a bad presage, and fatall Omen to him, in regard she was as diligent as her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band distrustfull to him, for that her care and carriage towards him, pleased him as much as his harsh lookes and soure countenance discontented him; and now it is that God first imprints in his heart and thoughts, a fearefull suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and a suspitious feare, that his Hoast <hi>Adrian,</hi> and father <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Priest have assuredly some dangerous and execrable plot, both against his gold and his life. For hee now sees himselfe reduced to this misery and despaire, that hee can bee permitted to see no body, nor no body to see him, except onely they two. Hee prayes them both, that his Phisition <hi>La Motte</hi> may come to him to conferre with him about the state of his sicknesse, but they malitiously and willfully deny it him, and tell him hee is gone into <hi>France;</hi> This refusing answer of theirs doth now very much appale and daunt our fieke and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <hi>De Laurier,</hi> so that his feare encreaseth with his sicknesse, and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

him that all is not well. And although they yet give him some sweet words and sugred speeches, yet hee notwithstanding the more beleeves that they are candide in wormewood and confected in gall; and that they are no other but false and flattering Sune shines, which portend some ensewing cruel storms and dismall tempests towards him. Once he was minded to write and send to <hi>Dijon</hi> for his Son, but then hee as soone resolves the contrary, as finding it to relish more of danger than discretion, aswell for the matter which his letter might contain, as also for the party who should carry it thither to him. But leave we him a little to his weaknes, and sicknes to his doubts and feares, and to his sorrowes, calamities and perplexities, and come wee againe to speake of wretched <hi>Adrian</hi> his Hoast, and of prophane <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>They are both of them so inhumane and cruell in their resolution to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poore sicke <hi>De Laurier,</hi> that neither the consideration of Heaven nor Hell is capable to reclaime or divert them from this their bloody attempt. As fos his hellish hoast <hi>Adrian,</hi> hee is so willfull and hastie in his malice, as hee tels father <hi>Iustinian,</hi> that they delay too long from murthering <hi>De Laurier,</hi> and that it is high time yea more than time for them to dispatch him. But for father <hi>Iustinian</hi> who was no lesse malitious in his subtilty, but yet farre more subtill in his malice towards <hi>De Laurier.</hi> Hee I say maturely considering that it were both a folly and a madnesse for them to murther him before they first knew hee were rich, and that hee had some store of gold about him, hee therefore in sweet tearmes and phrases pathetically adviseth him to write and send for his Sonne <hi>Du Pont,</hi> to come over to visit and comfort him, when likewise the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to guild over his speeches with the more pleasing and palpable shew of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection hee proffereth to ride to <hi>Dijon</hi> himselfe to deliver it him with his own hands. Our poore sicke <hi>De Laurier</hi> taking this Priests kinde advise to him in good part, hee thereupon first thankes him for this his courtesie, but then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine deeming and fearing that it proceeded more from false treachery, than from any true or reall affection to him hee begins to grow cold therein, and so rather to reject, than embrace and follow that resolution; But at last weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and considering his sicknesse by his danger, and his gold and jewells by both, as also if he should chance to dye or miscarry there, that his Sonne were then consequently ruined in the losse thereof; Hee thereupon changeth his resolution; and presently resolves to write and send over to <hi>Dijon</hi> for his Son and to that end requesteth Father <hi>Iustinian</hi> to excuse him, and so prayes his Hoast <hi>Adrian</hi> to undertake that journey and businesse, the which hee willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cheerefully granteth. Now the rest of that day and the greatest part of the next night <hi>De Laurier</hi> lies ruminating and musing in his bed what he should write to his Sonne, and no lesse doth father <hi>Iustinian</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> to thinke and know what hee would write him. The next morning, sixe of the clocke ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving strucken, <hi>De Laurier</hi> takes his pen and paper, and with a weake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hand writes his Letter to his Sonne: An houre after, <hi>Adrian</hi> comes into his Chamber booted and spurred to receive his commands, whom hee had to take and ride his owne horse, then gives him foure double pist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>As soone as <hi>De Laurier</hi> had delivered his Hoast <hi>Adrian</hi> this Letter, and he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken leave of him, father <hi>Iustinian</hi> begs leave of <hi>De Laurier</hi> to see <hi>Adrian</hi> take horse. But alas these two lewd Villaines doe deceive his honest hopes, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their own treacherous Intents and purposes; For they fly to a low par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and then locke and bolt the doore to them; where (as if the devill had throwne them on covetousnesse, or covetousnesse on the devill) they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily breake up the seales of <hi>De Lauriers</hi> letter to his Sonne (which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready seene and understood) wherein they glut and surfet their hopes with joy of this new desired treasure and discovered <hi>Indyes,</hi> and so they presently sacrifice it to the fire, and wretchedly resolve to make that very same ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night to bee the very last of <hi>De Lauriers</hi> time and the first of his eternity. To which end <hi>Adrian</hi> husheth himselfe up privately in his house from the sight of all the world, and especially from <hi>De Lauriers</hi> knowledge and so here he ends his pretended, but not his intended journy to <hi>Dijon,</hi> before he begin it: And hee having procured exceeding strong poyson therewith that night to send <hi>De Laurier</hi> to Heaven whereof giving a little to his great old mastive dog in a peece of bread for a triall he therewith presently fell dead to the ground; he likewise sends away <hi>Thomas</hi> his Ostler a dayes journey into the Country upon some feigned businesse, to the end hee should bee no witnesse of this foule and cruell fact of theirs and then all things being first by the devill, and then by these his two execrable agents prepared in a readinesse; Father <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> goes up to <hi>De Lauriers</hi> chamber, and treacherously entertaines him with the hope of his recovery of his health, the hast of <hi>Adrians</hi> Iourney, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with the speedy returne of his Sonne <hi>Du Pont</hi> to him from <hi>Dijon.</hi> But I write it with truth and griefe, that <hi>De Lauriers</hi> heart and mind is preoccupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with too many obnoxious apprehensions and feares, and taken up with too much doubt and dispaire to the contrary; For as most sicknesses and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases are most commonly devanced and preceeded by their symptomes so all that day and all that evening he found a swimming in his head, and his sight obscured and darkened, as if some blacke scarfe, or fatall cloud had been drawn and extended before his eyes. His heart likewise pants, beats and trembles within him, as if it and his senses were in a factious mutinie each with other at this their direfull departure and fatall sequestration. For still his feares and doubts informe him, and his apprehensions and dispaire prompt him that either father <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Priest, or his Hoast <hi>Adrian,</hi> or both of them, had conspired to murther him, the which hee once thought to have revealed to
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:16653:316"/>
Father <hi>Iustinian,</hi> but yet againe he dares not, as holding it more folly than dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and that it might therefore produce him more danger than safety; he neither can nor will eat any thing that day, and his heart and minde is so incessantly perplexed with feare, that he feares he shall not out-live the next ensuing night: And now indeed comes that sorrowfull and dismall night, wherin these two bloudy Villaines have fully resolved to poyson him, <hi>Adrian</hi> having in a lower roome the poyson ready, and Father <hi>Iustinian</hi> above, almost ready to call for it: Whiles thus the candle in <hi>De Lauriers</hi> chamber burnt dimme and obscure, as disdaining to see, or bee accessary to so cruell a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; neare about twelve of the clocke of that night hee awakes out of his sorrowfull distracted slumbers, and prayes Father <hi>Iustinian</hi> to give him a little spoonfull or two of warme wine, in a small earthen pot wherein he was used to drinke; when this monster of men rejoycing for this fit opportunity, hee steps forth to his bloudy companion <hi>Adrian,</hi> takes the poysoned wafer from him, and powres the poyson from it into this small blacke pot of wine, and so warmes it a little by the fire in <hi>De Lauriers</hi> chamber, and then gives it to him to drinke, the which he as greedily as innocently doth, whereof, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny strong convulsions and struglings, he within one houre after dieth, having neither the meanes to utter one word, or the power to scritch or cry, and yet for feare and doubt hereof, like two furies, or Devils incarnate of Hell they with thebed-staves ramme in a great holland towell into his mouth, that he may tell no tales, when God knowes that deadly strong poyson had wrought its operation before, made a full conquest of his life, and given up his soule into the hands of his Redeemer, of whom he had formerly received it.</p>
                     <p>As soone as these two wretched miscreants have dispatched this lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table businesse, then they teare off his secret leather girdle full of gold from his waste, and then breake open his Casket which was under his pillow, wherein (before his breathlesse body was halfe cold) they finde this aforesaid great summe of Gold and Iewels, the which they presently divide, and equally share betweene them, when having curiously searched his purse, poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, doublet and hose, they make a great fire, and immediately burne it all, as also his riding Coat, Casket, and leather Girdle, yea, and his hat, band and cuffes, that no marks might remaine either of it or him, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise turne his horse into the open field and hye-wayes, to seeke for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of a new Master; so wise (as they thought) were they in their villany, and so industrious and cautious in this their devillish cruelty and in humanity. By this time, as the murthered corps of <hi>De Laurier</hi> growes cold, these two Factors of Hell likewise beginne to provide for his buriall; so a little after two of the clocke, they digge a pit in <hi>Adrians</hi> Orchard, next adjoyning to his house, and so giving him no other winding sheet or coffin but his shirt, they secretly and silently carry downe his body betweene them, and there bury him, and to make all things sure, they cover over the pit, or his grave with greene turffes, that no mortall eye might take suspition or notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This bloudy businesse being thus acted and perpetrated by these two exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable wretches, Father <hi>Iustinian</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> who now surfet in Gold, and wallow in Iewels, they presently dight themselves into new apparell, and cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suits, and then day and night haunt and frequent the Tavernes and Stewes, as if they wilfully meant to drowne themselves in all sorts of ungodly riots, prodigalities and voluptuousnesse, whereof their neighbours, yea, all <hi>Salynes</hi> take exact observation and knowledge, as wondring at the manner, but farre

                     <p>Some three weeks being past over, <hi>Adrian</hi> now holds it fit to send home for his wife <hi>Isabella</hi> to <hi>Salynes,</hi> the which hee doth, who much wondring at her Husbands unaccustomed bravery, she presently enquires of him for <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur De Laurier,</hi> as if she had farre more cause to doubt and feare of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than any way to assure her selfe of his safety and welfare: When, he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a brazen face, and steeling and tempering his tongue with equall false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and impiety, tels her that hee departed thence safe and well some ten dayes since; that he gave him fifty crowns for the charges of his entertainment and lodging, and for a token of his love, had likewise left her and Father <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> to each of them twenty other Crownes in Gold: But his wife <hi>Isabella</hi> out of her goodnesse and piety) deeming these speeches of her Husbands to be as false as fatall, and verily suspecting and fearing, that he (with the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Father <hi>Iustinian)</hi> had sent that harmlesse good old man to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death and grave; shee bursts forth into immoderate sighs and teares, as suspecting all was not well, yea, fearing nothing more, and beleeving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse, than that which hee affirmed to her herein. He proffers her the twenty Crownes in Gold, but (good vertuous woman) she fearing it to bee the hire and price of innocent bloud, her tender conscience is too prevalent, and her harmlesse heart and soule too powerful with God to accept therof, and therfore she refuseth it with as much disdaine and discontent, as he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to give it her with affection and desire. And that the Reader may the more fully be informed of her integrity and charity herein, I mean to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent memory and well wishes of absent <hi>De Laurier,</hi> whom she silently feares is for ever absent, both from this life &amp; this world; she never goes into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where he lay sicke, but she sacrificeth some sighs to sorrow in his behalfe, and her imaginary apprehension of his death, makes her mournfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that either shee still sees his living picture, or his dead ghost and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, such was her charitable care of him, such her Christian feare for him.</p>
                     <p>We have seene this deplorable and cruell murther committed on the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse person of old <hi>De Laurier,</hi> by these two members of Satan, <hi>Adrian,</hi> and Father <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Priest, and if the truth deceive not my hopes, wee shall not proceed much farther in this their Historie, but we shall see Gods just Iudgements miraculously to resplend and shine forth in his punishments on them for the same: For I may properly tearme murther and punishment to be Individuals and Companions, in regard the one followes the other, as the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow doth the body, as the first derives its originall from Satan, so doth the second from God, to whom (in a language of bloud) it stil cries for restauration and satisfaction. But neverthelesse God is as secret as sacred in disposing of the manner and time thereof, and in ordaining by whom, when and how he will afflict and execute it: It is no false axiome in Philosophy, but a true tenent and maxime in Divinity; <hi>That God who made all things, sees and governes all things, and that nothing can be concealed from the eyes of his sacred Power and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence:</hi> All the foure Elements are the ministers of his justice, yea, Men and Angels, the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, the fowles of the aire, and the beasts of the field prove many times the Agents of his Revenge; of which last sort and nature, the Reader (to Gods glory, and his owne infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and admiration) may here obserue a lively example, and receive a most powerfull president; but whether more strange for the truth, or rare for the

For the same day moneth next after, that <hi>Adrian</hi> and father <hi>Instinian</hi> had buried the dead body of <hi>De Laurier,</hi> behold a huge and ravening Wolfe (being lately arrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the the adjacent vast woods) seeking up and downe for his prey, came into <hi>Adrians</hi> Orchard next adjoyning to his house (purposly sent thither by God as a minister of his sacred justice and revenge) who senting some dead carrion (which indeed was the dead Corpes of <hi>De Laurier,</hi> that was but shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowly buried there in the ground) hee fiercely with his pawes and nose tares up the Earth, and at last pulls and dragges it up, and there till an houre after the breake of day remaines devouring and eating up of the flesh of his armes legges, thighes, and buttocks. But (as God would have it) hee never touched any part of his face, but leaves it fully undissigured; When instantly some Gentlemen hunters of <hi>Salynes,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Here they cease to pursue the Wolfe, and because neither of them knew this poore and miserable dead carkase, they therefore step to the other end of the Orchard, and there consult what is fit to bee done in this lamentable businesse and accident. But their opinions as so many lines concur and terminate in this centre, that absolutely this dead body was cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and there by the murtherers privately and silently buried. They far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vehemently suspect and beleeve, that because it was buried in <hi>Adrians</hi> Orchard, that therefore it was apparantly probable, it was hee with his wife and Servants who had murthered and buried him there, wherefore to keepe these suspected bloody birdes in their Cages, they (as wise and juditious Gentlemen) place a strong guard of their Servants and Peasants to watch the doores and windowes of <hi>Adrians</hi> house, that none issue forth thence, and they themselves goe presently to the Criminall judges of the Towne, and acquaint them with this lamentable object and accident.</p>

In the mean our harmelesse and vertuous <hi>Isabella,</hi> hearing these loud shouts and outcries at her doores so soone in the morning, shee in the absence of her Husband; (who lay forth of his house that night deboshing and revelling with his cups and Queanes) fearing that all was not well, and therefore her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed and sorrowfull heart; not willing to know that whereof shee was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely desirous to bee ignorant, shee lay still bitterly sighing and weeping in her bed, because her thoughts and mind, her suspitions and feares told her, that this unseasonable alarum and noise might descend and reflect from some fatal newes which had betided <hi>De Laurie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As for <hi>Thomas</hi> her Ostler, and <hi>Gracetta</hi> her maid, although this unaccustomed noise made them sodainly forsake their beds and apparell themselves to receive their mistris commands how they should beare themselves in this hurly burly, yet because they were white with innocency, yea so innocent as they knew no hurt, or thought of danger they only deemed, that it was either some unlawfull assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Peasants, or else some cast and disbanded souldiers from Flanders who came to rob their masters house or poultry in his absence, wherfore meere feare hereof, kept them from either opening the doores, or looking out at windowes. By this time the Gentlemen hunters bring the criminall Iudges on the place to view this dead body, and with them come a great number of the Neighbours and Inhabitants of <hi>Salynes</hi> to doe the like, and amongst the rest, the Physitian <hi>La Motte</hi> (of whom this History hath already made mention and he of all the rest knowes the dead body, and therefore with much passion and sorrow cries out: that it was a Gold-smith of <hi>Dijon</hi> named <hi>Monsieur De Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,</hi> who lay long sicke in <hi>Adrians</hi> house, and that hee had formerly given him Physicke there, and so hee said and affirmed that hee perfectly knew him to be the same, and verily imagined that he was brought to some untimely end, and so buried there, but by whom he knew not.</p>
                     <p>The Iudges therefore beleeving the report of this honest Physitian <hi>La Motte;</hi> they cause the remainders of the flesh of this dead body to be searched and visited, the which they finde without any wounds. And yet neverthelesse deeming both <hi>Adrian,</hi> his wife <hi>Isabella,</hi> and their Servants to bee the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of this honest man; they breake open the doores, and missing <hi>Adrian</hi> they seize on his wife <hi>Isabella,</hi> as also on her Ostler <hi>Thomas,</hi> and his maide <hi>Graceta</hi> and then bring them to the sight of this dead body with whose murther they flatly charge them, and enquire what is become of <hi>Adrian</hi> himselfe. At this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected sorrowfull newes and object, <hi>Isabella</hi> is all in Teares, yea shee is so extreamly perplexed and afflicted, as wanting all other assistance and comfort shee implores that of God. Shee tells them that her Husband <hi>Adrian</hi> lay not at home with her the last night, and freely and plainely affirmes to them; that that dead body was <hi>Monsieur De Laurier</hi> a Gold-smith of <hi>Dijon,</hi> who lay long sicke in her house as he came from <hi>Frankford</hi> Mart, but how he came to his end or by whom, shee takes heaven and earth to witnesse shee knowes not, and with this her deposition doe her Ostler and maid concurre and agree in all proofes and circumstances. The Iudges likewise causing a curious search to be made in <hi>Salynes</hi> for <hi>Adrian,</hi> it was found out that that night he lay in father <hi>Iustinians</hi> house the Priest, and two whores in their Company drinking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling all night, and upon the very first report they heard of <hi>De Lauriers</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buriall

by a Wolfe, they both (galled with guilty consciences) betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their heeles, and left both their two Strumpets to their repentance. Their flight proclaimes their guiltinesse of this murther to all the world espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Iudges. Who upon knowledge thereof to finde out the truth of this deplorable disaster, they adjudge <hi>Isabella, Thomas</hi> and <hi>Graceta</hi> to the racke: As for <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Graceta,</hi> their innocency makes them brooke their torments with admirable patience and constancy, for they can never bee drawne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale that of which they are ignorant not to accuse themselves of that wherof they are not guilty. But for <hi>Isabella</hi> the incessant prayers and importunate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests and solicitations of many of her honest neighbours doth ingrave such deep impressions of her vertues and piety, and of her sweet inclination and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in the hearts of the iudges, as they change their resolutions against her and so dispence with her for that torture. When sending every way abroad to pursue <hi>Adrian</hi> and father <hi>Iustinian</hi> they content themselves to keepe the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris, the man and the maid close prisoners. They are so advised in their iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and so juditious in their advise, as they speedily send away Poast to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jon</hi> to acquaint <hi>Du Pont</hi> the Sonne, with this disasterous accident which had betided his father <hi>De Laurier</hi> here in <hi>Salynes,</hi> who at the first alarum of this sad unexpected newes, seemes now to drowne himselfe in his teares thereat, and so thereupon rather to flye than poast away from <hi>Dijon</hi> to <hi>Salynes</hi> where hee confers with the criminall Iudges of that Town, who report to him the flight of father <hi>Iustinian</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> as also of their imprisoning of his wife <hi>Isabella,</hi> of her maid <hi>Graceta,</hi> and her Ostler <hi>Thomas,</hi> in whose house his father lay sick. So <hi>Du Pont</hi> visits the dead, stinking, mangled body, and findes it to be that of his father, wherat nature and duty prescribe him so powerful a Law, as at the sight thereof, he bursts forth into many bitter teares and lamentable cries and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. When giving him a decent and solemn burial in the next Church, he then informes the Iudges, that to his knowledge his father had good store of gold and jewells about him, so hee entreats them, that <hi>Adrian</hi> and father <hi>Iustinians</hi> houses maybe curiously searched for the same, which is performed, but finding no part thereof, and both of them fled, he is confident in his heart, that their flight proclaimes them guilty of his fathers murther, and consequently that <hi>Isabella</hi> her Ostler and maid infallibly were accessaries thereunto: Whereupon he repaires againe to the Iudges, and with many importunities prayes them that all three of them may be put to the rack for the same, thereby to bolt and find out the truth of this lamentable accident, the judges approve of <hi>Du Ponts</hi> living affection and zeale to his dead father, but (as impartiall Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Officers of Iustice) they tell him that they have already caused <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Graceta</hi> to be racked, and that they both have strongly justified their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of his fathers Murther, by suffering their torments with incredible for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and patience. And as for their Mistris <hi>Isabella.</hi> They tell him they are fully resolved and assured, that shee was absolutely innocent, as well for that shee was many daies absent with her father in the Country, when by all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood and circumstance, his father was murthered, as also because the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall votes and voices of all her neighbours reported her to bee a very vertuous and religious woman, and that therefore in their hearts and consciences, they must needs exempt and free her from those torments. But they told him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in honour to justice, and to see what God and time might produce, they would detaine them all three in Prison for the space of three or foure moneths, in which meane time concurring with him in opinion that father

                        <hi>Instinian</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> undoubtedly were the murtherers of his father <hi>De Laurier,</hi> they therefore perswade him with all possible speed and diligence to pursue them up and downe the Countrey, untill hee had detected, apprehended, and brought them to justice; the which <hi>Du Pont</hi> doth, but with such extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zeale and hast, that he forgat a singular circumstance, of no meane impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the omission where of might very well have made his research of them vaine. For hee forgate at <hi>Salynes</hi> to take with him their Pictures and Effigies whereby to finde them out in the Country, with farre the more ease and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, whereof hee afterwards much repented himselfe.</p>
                     <p>As for our two execrable wretches, father <hi>Instinian</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> their guilty thoughts and consciences (like so many Ghosts and bloodhounds) so inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly pursued them and stupified their judgements, that resolving to flye and save themselves from the free Countie, into Switzerland, they hush themselves up the day for shelter in some thicke grove or Wood, and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all night from <hi>Salynes,</hi> they notwithstanding, the next morning (to their unspeakeable feare and vexation) saw themselves againe within a little league thereof, and in this manner they for some eight nights following, travelled a foore through unknowne waies and woods, and yet here let the Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and observe the wonderfull Iustice of God towards them, for at the end thereof, they are not as yet fully gone seven leagues off from <hi>Salynes,</hi> and they could not ascend the least Hill or Hillocke, but they looking backe behind them, the Towers and Turrets of <hi>Salynes</hi> were still apparent and conspicuous to them, as if they pursued and followed them, the which indeed stroke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame feare to their guiltie hearts and, and infinite terrour and amazement to their foule and trembling consciences. But this circumstance of Gods wrath and revenge towards them, is forthwith seconded and followed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, wherein his divine Providence and justice miraculously appeares and shines forth (with infinite lustre and glory) to all those who shall reade, or heare this History. For the tenth evening after their flight from <hi>Salynes,</hi> they being extreamely wearied and tired with their foote Travells (for horses they dared not buy any) and within a mile off entering into a great wood, they in afaire plaine, seeing no body present, they at last espyed an Erring Horse, without Rider, Saddle, or Bridle: which resolving to seize on thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create their wearied limbes and bodies they approach and surprize him. And then <hi>Adrian</hi> knowing him well to be <hi>De Lauriers</hi> horse, which (we have heard they had formerly turned off in <hi>Salynes</hi> the same night wherein they murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Master. They extreame joyfull of this unlooked for good fortue, make a halter of their girdles and garters, and so casting their cloakes under them, they both ride away on him, and night drawing on, they hope to recover the Towne of <hi>Pontarlin</hi> before break of day; But God is here strongly bent against them, so that this Horse which they tooke for the cause of their joy, will verie shortly prove the matter of their misery, &amp; that which they thought would be the matter of their safetie will fall out to produce their inevitable danger and confusion. For God (in his revenging Iustice) carring their horse, and he them a straying and masking that night through contrary waies and Lanes, they the next morning at break of day to their unspeakeable griefe, doe see themselves three great leagnes off from <hi>Pontarlin,</hi> when their soule facts and consciences make them still so tremblingly fearefull, that every Bush they beheld, every bird they heare, and everie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>But here their horse (orecharged with this foule and monstrous burthen) beginnes to faile them, so the more hee l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>sseneth his pace the more it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth their apprehension and feare: And here they consult what to doe, whether to retire with their horse into the next Wood till night, or else to advance towards <hi>Pontarlin.</hi> But their Bread and Meat failing them, and they seeing the coast cleare, they therefore resolve to ride thither, and far the sooner doe they assume and embrace this resolution; because as yet they knew it was timely in the morning, and consequently few or no people stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Now to dispatch their journey the sooner, <hi>Adrian</hi> is content to walke on foote, and father <hi>Iustinian</hi> to ride, and both of them are equally resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to put cheerefull faces on their perplexed and trembling hearts. And here as I will not say it was their bad, but their just fortune, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them within lesse than one league of <hi>Pontarlin,</hi> without being espy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or seene of any. So it was likewise the providence and Iustice of God, at that very houre and place first to bring <hi>Du Pont</hi> in sight of them, who in two dayes was parted from <hi>Salynes,</hi> and in all that time had left no Hamlet Village, or Towne unsought to finde out and apprehend these murtherers of his father; Now as hee drawes neere them, his eye tells him that the Horse whereon one of these two men rid, was of the very same haire and shape as was that of his fathers, which strucke some suspition and apprehension in his heart, that sure these were father <hi>Iustintan</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> and farre the more because by his habit hee knew that hee who rid was a Priest. The better therefore to bee fully assured hereof, hee resolves to outride them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the more narrowly to observe both the horse and them, the which hee doth. Hee passeth by them and viewes them with his countenance purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly composed more of neglect than of observation towards them. When perfectly knowing the horse (by his two white feete, and white Starre in his forehead) to bee his Fathers, and therefore they by all consequence and apparance they to bee his murtherers, then I say Nature and Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused a secret reluctation into his heart and soule, whether hee should more grieve or rejoyce to see them; Now as hee is loth to leave them behinde him, so hee bethinkes himselfe of a prettie policie. For riding some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces before them, hee descends from his horse, ties him up to the branch of a Tree, casts downe his sword and riding coate in the high way untrusseth his points, and steps within the hedge, as if hee purposly meant to ease himselfe; but indeed it was to have them passe before him, that so hee might incompasse them as two murthering Wolves in a Toyle; At his descent from his horse (as guilty consciences are still afraid of all things) father <hi>Iustinian</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> first beginne to feare this Stranger, as being sent to apprehend them, and so resolve to trust to their heeles and the woods for their safety, but when they see his sword, and coate in the way, and himselfe within the hedge with his hose downe, then they againe take courage and heart at grace and so proceed on in the way towards the Towne, but still they looke backe on him as if the foulenesse of their fact continually made their feares and dangers the more eminent. This is carefully and curiously observed of <hi>Du Pont.</hi> who (now comes after them a soft <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and swifter than theirs, and that therefore he might fetch them up at his pleasure. By this time they two arrive at <hi>Pontarlin,</hi> which they enter; where (being hungrie and fearefull, and their horse wearie and hungry) they take up one of the next Ins, which is at the sign of the <hi>Tygre</hi> where thinking themselves free of him who followed them, they recommend their horse to the Ostler, and calling for some Mutton, Bread and Wine, they there privately hush themselves up in their Chamber. But the vigilant eye and care of <hi>Du Pont</hi> sees where they are entered, so hee puts up his Horse to another Inne close by, and presently with much silence and celerity, trippes away to the <hi>Tygre</hi> Inne where they are; and knowing them to bee above the staires in their chamber to breakfast, he calles for the Hoast thereof, takes him into a close low roome next the doore; tells him that the Priest and the other man which entred his house right now, had cruelly murthered his father in <hi>Salynes,</hi> and therefore most courteously and earnestly prayes him, to step presently and fetch the Criminall officers of that Towne to apprehend them for the same, and till his and their returne, that he will give him two of his servants to guard the doors that they escape not away; The Host of this house in detestation of this foule fact of theirs, and to the honour and reputation of himself and his house, speedes away to the Officers who presently arrive with him, to whom <hi>Du Pont</hi> sorrowfully and passionately relate, that this Priest named <hi>Iustinian</hi> and this <hi>Adrian</hi> who was an Innekeeper of <hi>Salynes</hi> and now above, had very lately in his owne house, murthered his father <hi>De Laurier,</hi> who was a Goldsmith of <hi>Dijon,</hi> stript and robbed him of much gold and Jewells, and then buried him in his Orchard, and therefore (with teares in his eyes) conjures them to doe him justice by speedily apprehending them for the same, the which they as soone grant him. So they all ascend to their Chamber where they find them deeply tippling in their cups, asmuch devoid and insensible of danger as of grace. Here <hi>Du Pont</hi> (with equall passion and sorrow) strongly chargeth them both with the murther of his father <hi>De Laurier,</hi> as also for robbing of his gold and jewells and for burying of him in the Orchard. But these two bloody fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of Hell, with a world of stout lookes, impious oathes and fearefull asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, vow and sweare the contrary. So the Officers take them aside and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them severally hereon. But they can receive nothing from them but peremptory denialls and prophane execrations. The which <hi>Du Pont</hi> hearing and understanding hee (with much affection to his father, and discretion to himselfe) to vindicate and know the truth hereof with the more facility and the lesse time; entreats the Officers to search them both narrowly for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gold and Iewells, which by Gods direction they doe, the one after the other, when they finde quilted up in their dublets and hose, store of gold, and some rich jewells and rings, and yet these two bloody villaines deny this murther of theirs with much audacity and impudency, swearing that they found this treasure in a Casket in the high way a little league beyond <hi>Salynes.</hi> But this lye of theirs is as false, as their murther and robbery of honest old <hi>De Laurier</hi> was too true, which God (in his mercy and Justice) will briefly bring to light and punishment far sooner than these bloody Miscreants either think, or feare of.</p>

                        <hi>Du Pont</hi> (all this notwithstanding) constantly assures these Officers, that all this gold and jewells, and much and many more were his Fathers, and therefore ate now his both by right and propriety, as being his only Sonne and child and so demands possession thereof.

So for that night they commit father <hi>Iustinian</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> to two severall prisons, where they shall finde leisure though not enough to repent this foule and lamentable fact of theirs. Which was no sooner done, but <hi>Du Pont</hi> (having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>The very next morning the criminall Iudges send for them to one of their houses, and first severally private, and then publikely by confrontation, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them on this cruell murther and robbery, but the Divell is still so strong with them, that with much courage and vehemency, they continue and stand firme in their negative resolution and deniall; But <hi>De Laurier</hi> being now found and knowne to have layen some seven weekes sicke in <hi>Adrians</hi> house, aswel by the confession of <hi>Isabella</hi> his wife of <hi>Graceta</hi> her maid and of <hi>Thomas</hi> their Ost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, as also of the Apothecary <hi>La Motte,</hi> then his body found buried in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, and <hi>Adrian</hi> and father <hi>Iustinian</hi> their sudden flight upon the same, and now lastly his horse, gold, and jewels found upon them in <hi>Pontarlin</hi> by the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of that Towne, and his Sonne <hi>Du Pont,</hi> were evidences as bright and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant as the Sunne that (in honour to justice and in glory to God from whom all true justice is derived) these wise and grave Iudges of <hi>Salynes,</hi> doe reject these denials of <hi>Adrian</hi> and father <hi>Iustinian</hi> as false, prophane, and impious, and therefore that very instant adjudge them both to the racke, at the hearing of which sentence they seeme to be nothing apalled and daunted, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advertised that <hi>Isabella</hi> his Wife was likewise imprisoned for this fact, she for her part, by some friends of hers makes sute to the Iudges, that she may be permitted to speake with her Husband, and so doth father <hi>Iustinian</hi> that hee likewise may speake wirh her. But the Iudges hold both of these their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests to bee vaine and impertinent and therefore flatly contradict and deny them.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Adrian</hi> is first brought to the racke, who though hee bee weake of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution yet hee is still so strong in his villany, as hee will not bee perswaded or drawne to confesse it, but with much courage of body, and animosity of minde, suffers himselfe to bee fastned thereto, whereof the Judges being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised, they in their discretion, hold it expedient to delay his torments for a time, and so first to make triall of father <hi>Iustinian,</hi> to see if these his torments will make him lesse stout, and more flexible in the confession thereof. Wherein (I write it with joy) their judgements nothing deceive them, for at the very first wrench of the racke, God is so mercifull to his soule, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to his new conversion and repentance, that hee then and there confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth this lamentable murther, in all its branches and circumstances (as wee have formerly understood; Affirmes only himselfe and <hi>Adrian</hi> to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and Actors thereof; Sweares that <hi>Isabella, Graceta</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way innocent thereof, and had no hand or knowledge therein whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Whereupon the Iudges send againe for <hi>Adrian,</hi> and cause him a new to bee brought to the racke, but first they hold it fit to confront him with his bloody companion father <hi>Iustinian,</hi> who boldly affirming, and constantly

Hee prayes God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him this foule fact, and beseecheth all that are present to pray to God for him, and for his wretched and miserable soule, the which he knoweth hath great need and want of their prayers, when casting his handkerchiefe over his face, and privately ending some few prayers to himselfe hee is turned over. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly after him rather <hi>Iustinian</hi> mounts the Ladder, who (in his lookes and countenance) seemes to bee very repentant and penitent for this his soule and hainous fact, the which hee praves God to absolve and forgive him, hee here againe cleeres <hi>Isabella, Graceta,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> of this murther. Hee much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that hee hath so highly scandalized the sacred order of Priesthood in his crime and person; and therefore beseecheth all Priests and Churchmen ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther present or absent to forgive it him; when repeating some <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> and often making the signe of the crosse, hee was likewise turned over.</p>
                     <p>And thus was the miserable life and death of this impious Priest, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bloody Host, and in this sharpe manner did God justly revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and punish them with shame and confusion for this cruell and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble murther.

with the meanest of their Servants and so to returne without seeing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mother, Sonne, or Daughter.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Dominica,</hi> holding her beautie and yeares, now to bee worthie of a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, shee is so incivill and incontinent as shee prayes her mother to procure and provide her one. For (to use her owne words) shee saith <hi>shee is weary to lye alone, and live single, and fully resolved no longer either to triflle away her time, or to cast away her youth and beautie;</hi> Her Lady Mother (in most vertuous tearmes) checks her impudency, blames her impudicity, and concludes that if shee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake those immodest humours and inclinations, and so serve and feare God religiously then there is no doubt but in good time, hee (of his propitious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and goodnesse towards her) will provide her one, when turning from her Daughter, the verie teares of sorrow fall aboundantly from her old eyes, to see her thus immodest, thus irregular and wanton, as doubting and fearing that in the end it will prove ominous and fatall to her.</p>
                     <p>But her lascivious Daughter <hi>Dominica</hi> is not contented with this generall answer of her Mother, for shee is yet so vainly impudent, and so vitiously im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, as shee importunately prayes her brother <hi>Don Garcia,</hi> effectually and speedily to solicite her Mother to provide her a husband, whereat hee rather laughes than gives eare. But when againe hee ruminates and considers with himselfe this her foolish levity and wantonnesse, fearing the worst, and to the end shee might not hereafter prove a disgrace to her selfe, a scandall to their house, and a dishonour to their blood, hee (taking time at advantage) breakes and treates with his mother hereon; who concurring in opinion with him, returnes him rather her consent than her deniall, the which hee reports to his immodest sister <hi>Dominica,</hi> who is thereat as joyfull as before shee was discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>
                     <p>Not long after it fell out that <hi>Dominica</hi> with her Mother going on a great Holyday in the morning to the Church of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monkes, and being behinde her on her knees to her Beades and Oraisons, her devotion was so cold and her zeale so frozen towards God, as seeing a very proper young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman (richly apparreled) likewise there on his knees to his prayers not farre from her; shee as a poore (I may say as a prophane) Christian beckons her mothers man to come to her, and whispers him in the eare, that he discreetly goe and enquire what that young Cavallier is, whom she describes to him by his apparell and especially by a rich Diamond Ring which hee weares on his finger; Her mothers man demanding of the Gentlemans servants returnes speedily to his young Lady, and tells her in her eare, that it is <hi>Don Roderigo,</hi> Sonne and heire to <hi>Don Emmanuell de Cortez,</hi> whereat her lustfull affection makes her heart leape and dance within her forjoy, for so incivilly unchast is shee in her desires and wishes, that at his very first sight shee desires him for her Husband before any other man of the world, yea before any other earthly felicity. Whereupon shee vowes that her Mother shall have no truce, nor her Brother any peace of her before they powerfully make this motion of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age for her to <hi>Don Roderigo,</hi> who being often solicited and provoked by her importunate requests, they consult hereon, and both of them approve and desire it, as holding it a match equally honourable to them both. The Sonne will have his mother first to breake the ice of this motion to <hi>Don Roderigo,</hi> but the mother will have her Sonne first to performe that office to him, and so to take a faire occasion to invite him home to her house to speake with her, the which <hi>Don Garcia</hi> performes, and deales herein so effectually with <hi>Don Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigo</hi>
                        <pb n="392" facs="tcp:16653:323"/>
that home hee comes with him. The Lady <hi>Cervantella</hi> (after many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements and speeches) presents this motion to him. Hee sees the young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Dominica</hi> her daughter, and finding her to bee exceeding faire and wittie, hee likes and loves her and so takes time to advise hereon with his father, for the Lady his Mother was formerly gone to heaven. <hi>Roderigo</hi> breakes this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Don Emanuell</hi> his father, who not pleased therewith seekes to divert his Sonne from it, in regard he knowes that her Mother <hi>Dona Cervantella</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poore. and of a weake estate, as being much incumbred with the great depts of her deceased Husband. <hi>Roderigo</hi> alleageth to his Father, his true affection to the true beautie and vertues of <hi>Dominica,</hi> and that her descent and blood is no way inferiour to his. But his father being of an exceeding covetous dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, will have wealth to oversway beauty, and not beauty wealth, and so is resolute to heare no more of this motion, whereat his sonne <hi>Roderigo</hi> bites the lippe, and is much discontented. Yet neverthelesse hee hath cast his affection so deepely and firmely on the fresh and delicate beauty of <hi>Dominica,</hi> that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it to bee the Gold of Nature, and shee the Queene and Phoenix of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hee cannot, hee will not refraine, but very often frequents <hi>Dona Cervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tella's</hi> house, and her daughters company. To whom (notwithstanding his Fathers distast of her) hee yet gives farre more hope than dispaire that hee wil bee her Husband, which ravisheth her with delight, her Mother <hi>Dona Cervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tella,</hi> and her brother <hi>Don Garcia</hi> with content.</p>
                     <p>But the order of our History envites us for a while to leave <hi>Don Roderigo</hi> to feast his eyes and surfet his thoughts and contemplations on the Roses and Lillies of his Mistris beauty, and againe to returne to speake of our old Dotard <hi>Hippolito.</hi> Who now (led by his lust and voluptuous desires, as they are by the instigation of the Devill) comes to performe and act a bloody and deplorable part on the stage of this History. Hee sees with griefe and grieves to see that hee is refused of the Lady <hi>Dominica</hi> whom hee loves farre deerer and tenderer then his life, and understanding that <hi>Don Roderigo de Cortez,</hi> doth still frequent her company, hath gained her affection and shall shortly marry her, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon turnes his reason into rage, converts his judgement into revenge, and so resolves to murther him by night, as soone as hee findes him to issue forth of the Lady <hi>Cervantella's</hi> house, the Devill making him strong in the vanity of this beliefe and confidence, that hee being once dead, undoubtedly the faire <hi>Dominica</hi> will fall for his share and wife. So hee is resolute in this his bloody and damnable designe: and consults with himselfe whether hee should doe it by himselfe, or by some second instrument, but finding it dangerous to effect it by another, beeause he must then commit his life to his courtesie, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Gout had now forsaken him, hee therefore resolves to doe it by himselfe. But first hee thinkes it not improper, rather pertinent for him to write <hi>Roderigo</hi> a letter, the which hee doth in these tearmes and sends it him by one of his owne confident Servants.</p>

He bewailes his hard fortune in marying her, but yet loves her so tenderly and deerely, as hee will not speake ill of her himselfe, nor suffer any other to doe it either in his presence, or her absence. Yea, her love is so frozen to him, though his bee still constantly and fervently inflamed to her, as shee difficulty sees him once in three daies, nor yet speake two words with him when shee sees him, and yet when hee is so happy to obtaine her sight and company, hee so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly reioyceth thereat, that it seemes to him, his paine for that time gives him peace, his sorrowes truce, his sickenesse ease, his heart comfort; and his thoughts consolation.

They find a sweet young Infant boy, whose body was as white as the snow, with a flaxen coloured haire, a cheerefull looke, a cherrie lip, and some blacknesse about his throate and necke, wherby they guessed it to be newly borne and strangled of some Strumpet his mother, whom to detect and finde out, they search all the adjacent houses, and at last finde out <hi>Denisa</hi> in her Inne, when the Officers of Iustice, setting a Midwife and some three or foure elderly women to search her, they (dispight of her resistance or prayers to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) give in evidence against her that shee was that day delivered of a child, so shee is imprisoned, and the next day brought to her arraignement, where (threatned with the racke) shee confesseth the strangling of her child, and the throwing of it into this pond, for the which soule and in humane fact of hers, shee is the next day condemned to bee hanged: When desirous to save her soule though through the instigation of Satan) she hath miserably cast away her body; she entreateth that father <hi>Eustace</hi> a Priest of her acquaintance may be sent to her in Prison, to prepare her soule for her spiritual journy to heaven, who is accordingly sent her. Who after a long and a religious exhortation to her, falling on this point, that she should do well to disburthen her conscience of any other capitall crime which she in all the whole course of her life might have committed, as affirming that the revealing thereof, exceedingly tended to Gods glory, and the felicity of her owne foule, she (with teares and sighes) deepely thinkes thereof that night in prison. Now the next morning shee is brought to the place of execution, where a great number of people flocke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to see her end, and there on the Ladder after shee had againe confessed the strangling of her infant and her throwing of it into the Pond, shee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then and there confessed, That she was accessary and consented with her Lady <hi>Dominica</hi> to poyson her Master <hi>Roderigo,</hi> which shee affirmed they both effected in the same manner as wee have formerly understood. The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this her otherfoule murther, as also of her Lady <hi>Dominica,</hi> doth much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze her Auditors and astonish her Judges, who to cleere and vindicate the truth hereof, they cause her to descend the Ladder, and to be confronted with her said Lady <hi>Dominica</hi> who by this time in the middest of her security is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise apprehended and brought before the Criminall Judges, where contrary to her expectation being enforced to understand the effect and tenour of her Chamber maid <hi>Denisa's</hi> confession and accusation against her for the poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of her Husband <hi>Roderigo,</hi> shee with much passion and choller tearmes her witch and devill, and curseth the houre that ever shee fostered up so pestilent a Viper in her house to eate out her own heart and life when with more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and boldnes than contrition and repentance (being first by her judges threatned with the torments of the racke) she confesseth her selfe likewise to be guilty of murthering her first Husband <hi>Roderigo.</hi> So <hi>Denisa's</hi> sentence is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, for shee is condemned to be hanged for her first murther, and her dead body after to be burnt to ashes for her second, and the Lady <hi>Dominica</hi> to bee hanged for poysoning her husband which newes so resounds and rattles

through all the streets and corners of <hi>Granado,</hi> that almost all the people of that Citie flocke the next morning to the place of execution, to see this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell Mistresse and her bloudy Chamber-maid, take their last farewell of this world; for the Lady <hi>Dominica</hi> must likewise die, notwithstanding her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cervantella's</hi> teares, and her Husband <hi>Andrada's</hi> importunate requests and passionate praiers to her Judges to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>And first <hi>Denisa</hi> is caused to ascend the Ladder, (who was a tall and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly young woman) to whom God was so mercifull to her soule, that there with many bitter sighs and teares, she was wonderfull sorrowfull for these her two foule murthers, especially for that of her poore Infant babe, whom she had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as so one dispatched out, as she brought into the world: She earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought all her auditors and spectators to pray unto God to forgive her, and to bee mercifull to her soule; shee affirmed that her Lady <hi>Dominica's</hi> entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Gold first drew her to be accessary to the poysoning of her Master <hi>Roderigo,</hi> the which againe and againe from her heart and soule, shee prayed God to pardon her; when entreating all young people, especially all young women, to be more wise and religious, and lesse prophane and bloudy min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by her example; and now recommending her soule into the hands of her Saviour and Redeemer, she is turned over. When immediately after this our wretched Lady <hi>Dominica</hi> is likewise brought to her execution, whom the vanity of her heart, and the impurity and prophanenesse of her soule, had purposely dighted in her best dresse, and richest apparell; which was a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wrought Velvet Gowne, and a curious great laced Ruffe, with all things else sutable to it; but which is lamentable to see, and fearefull to consider, she was as carelesse of her soule, as curious of her body; for the Priests and Friers in her prison could not abate or beat down her impiety, but as there, so here on the Ladder, she enters into many deepe execrations and curses, as well against her second Husband <hi>Andrada,</hi> as against her Chamber-maid <hi>Denisa,</hi> who she said was now rather gone to the Devill than to God; but no spark of grace, no shew of sorrow, or signe of repentance could appeare in her looks, or bee heard in her speeches, for poysoning of her first Husband <hi>Roderigo,</hi> but with much choller and vehemencie, shee there uttered many other lewd and lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious speeches, the which grieved her Christian Auditours to heare, and therefore I will not defile my pen, or offend the Readers religious and chast hearts with the knowledg thereof; so this miserable and wretched Lady was turned over the Ladder, who made her death answerable to the foulnesse and enormity of her life, being not so happy in her death as her bloudy Chamber-maid <hi>Denisa,</hi> and I feare me as exempt of grace and goodnesse as the Devill could wish her. But God is the Lord of Justice, and father of mercy, to whom I leave her.</p>
                     <p>They youth and beauty of this cruell and inhumane Lady <hi>Dominica,</hi> was pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied of many, but her foule fact abhorred and detested of all who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at her death; may we who reade her History, cherish our Vertues by the sight and knowledge of her Vices, and fortifie our soules with Religion and Piety, as she ruined hers by the neglect and want thereof.</p>

                           <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> (upon promise of mariage) gets <hi>Ursina</hi> with child, and then afterwards very ingratefully and treacherously rejecteth her, and marieth <hi>Bertranna.

                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a poore profit, a wretched pleasure, for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of choler and revenge, to imbrue our hands in the innocent blood of our neere kindred, sith in seeking to wound him, wee more properly kill our selves in soule and body; striking him (who is the figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative image of God) wee presumptuously stab at the Majesty of God himselfe, by whom our soules must, without whom they can never bee saved. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if wee will not know as wee are men, yet wee ought firmly both to know and beleeve as wee are Christians, that revenge and murther are the two prodigious twins of <hi>Sathan,</hi> the last being engendered and propagated of the first, and both from Hell: For revenge is nothalfe so sweet in the beginning as bitter in the end, nor murther by many degrees so pleasing as it proves pernitious to her Authors; as this ensuing History will verifie, and make apparant unto us.</p>
                     <p>LEt your thoughts be carried over those high hills of Europe, the Alpes, and Appenins, to the noble and famous citie of Naples, the head and capitall of that flourishing kingdome (and from whence it receives and derives its denomination) a city exceeding rich, populous and faire, and graced and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:16653:330"/>
adorned with more Nobilitie and Gentrie of both sexes than any other of <hi>Italy</hi> whatsoever. Wherein of very late yeares (when the Duke of <hi>Ossuna</hi> was Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy thereof) there dwelt two rich and beautifull young gentlewomen, the one named <hi>Dona Vrsina Placedo,</hi> the onely daughter and child of <hi>Seignior Agustino Placedo,</hi> &amp; the other <hi>Dona Bertranna de Tores</hi> likewise the only child and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Seignior Thomaso de Tores,</hi> the first native of <hi>Ferenzolo,</hi> in <hi>Pulia,</hi> and the second of <hi>Materana</hi> in <hi>Calabria,</hi> both of them being exceeding rich and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended Gentlemen, who with their wives and daughters for the most part built up their residence in <hi>Naples,</hi> but especially all the winter time. Now because these two young gentlewomen (whom henceforth wee will tearme by their Christian and not by their Surnames) are two of the chiefest personages, which give life to this History, therefore I hold it not impertinent for mee, superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to give the Reader their different caracters and delineations; <hi>Vrsina</hi> was past the twentieth yeare of her age, and <hi>Bertranna</hi> entring into her eighteenth, <hi>Vrsina</hi> was tall and slender, <hi>Bertranna</hi> short and somewhat crook-backed: <hi>Vrsina</hi> was the fairer of the two, but <hi>Bertranna</hi> by far the subtiller and wiser. <hi>Vrsina</hi> was of a deepe Amber hayre, but <hi>Bertranna</hi> of a coale blacke: &amp; to conclude this point, <hi>Vrsina</hi> was affable and courteous, but <hi>Bertranna</hi> coy, proud, and malitious.</p>
                     <p>The truth and order of this History must here informe us, that although these two rich young Gentlewomen had divers brave Gallants, who were sutors to them for marriage, yet none of them so dearely and passionatly loved <hi>Vrsina,</hi> as the Baron of <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> of <hi>Capua,</hi> a verie rich young Nobleman; but far more proper than wise, and withall far more lascivious than rich, nor did or could <hi>Bertranna</hi> in her heart and mind affect any other but the said Baron: neither was it possible for her father <hi>De Tores</hi> to perswade or draw her to desire any other Nobleman or Gentleman for her husband than him. Thus wee see <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> deeply to love <hi>Vrsina,</hi> and <hi>Bertranna</hi> him, but not hee her; and wee shall not goe far till we likewise see what effects these their different affections will produce.</p>
                     <p>Whiles <hi>Vrsina</hi> is assured of <hi>Sanctifiores</hi> love to her, <hi>Bertranna</hi> contrariwise by her selfe and her friends makes it her chiefest care and ambition to perswade and draw him to forsake <hi>Vrsina,</hi> and to love and marry herselfe, but shee will find more opposition and difficulty therein than shee expects. True it is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Baron of <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> doe continually frequent <hi>Placedos</hi> house, and his daughter <hi>Bertrannas</hi> company, yet understanding and considering with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that <hi>Vrsina</hi> honoured him with her constant love and affection, hee therefore held himselfe in a manner bound sometimes to see and visit her, although indeed it was every way more to content and please her, than himselfe, where albeit that her policy to her selfe, and her affection to him, gives him many quips and jerkes of his Mistris <hi>Vrsina,</hi> yet his reputation and discretion makes him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his actions and speeches so equally towards <hi>Bertranna,</hi> that although hee give her little cause to hope, yet he gives her none to despaier of his love and affection to her, in requitall of hers to him, and upon these and no other tearmes stand <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> and <hi>Bertranna.</hi> But as for <hi>Vrsina,</hi> her hopes and heart of <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores</hi> affection to her, sayls on with a more pleasing and joyfull gale of wind, for shee loving him as deeply as hee doth her dearly, she accounts her selfe his, and he hers: as we may the more particularly and perfectly perceive by foure love-letters of theirs, which secretly and interchangeably past betweene them; the which for the Readers better satisfaction I thought good here to insert and publish, whereof his first to her spake thus.</p>

                     <p>By the perusall and consideration of these foure precedent Letters, wee may plainly perceive, what a firme promise, and secret contract there was past betweene the Baron of <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> and the Lady <hi>Vrsina,</hi> and how servently and sweetly they had given themselves each to other in the promise and assurance of mariage, so not contented to have gotten the Daughters good will, hee in very honourable fashion and tearmes likewise seekes her Father <hi>Seignior Placedos</hi> consent thereto; whom though for some few Monethes hee found to bee averse and opposit to his desires therein, yet upon <hi>Sanctifiores</hi> importunate intreaties and his Daughter <hi>Vrsinas</hi> frequent teares, hee at last consenteth to this their mariage, only he delayed the consummation thereof for some secret reasons, and considerations best knowne to himselfe, the which I cannot publish, because I could never gather or understand them. Whiles thus the Baron of <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> remaines in <hi>Naples,</hi> his long stay, great trayne, prodigall expenses there, and his absence from <hi>Capua</hi> where his lands and meanes lay, made him bee in some distresse and want of mony, and not knowing how to procure it there, thereby to support his fame and reputation with his pretended Father in law, and also with his intended wife his Daughter, it greatly perplexed and troubled him; But at last hee saw himselfe reduced to this extremity, that hee was enforced to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of one Nobleman and Gentleman of his Friends to pay another; a Course which hee well saw could not long endure and subsist, without clamorously calling his reputation in question; The which to prevent, knowing <hi>Seignior Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedo</hi> to bee a hide bound, and close fisted old Gentleman, who loved his gold far better than his God, and that if hee offered to borrow any of him, hee would absolutely refuse and deny to lend it him, and that it was not impossible, but rather very probable, that hereby the prodigality of the one, and the covetousnes of the other might prove a great blot and hinderance to this his marriage, hee therefore as a deboshed and vicious young Nobleman, despayring of the fathers love, resolves to make sure worke with the daughters affection, who with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand amorous speeches, and lascivious lures, daliances and temptations, he seekes to draw her to his lustfull desires, and so by usurping on her chastity (which is the honour of Ladyes, &amp; the glory of Gentlewomen) to have carnali knowledge of her before he were married to her. <hi>Vrsina</hi> (who loved her sweet heart <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> farre dearer than the whole world, and yet her honour and chastity a thousand times more deare and pretious than her owne life) infinitly grieves and wonders
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:16653:331"/>
at this his intemperancy and obscenitie; when (as a chaste and vertuous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman) shee with sighes and teares layes before his eyes and consideration, and represents to his heart and soule, the lewdnesse of his desire, the impiety of his request, the foulnes and odiousnes of this fact both to God and man, the losse of her reputation and honour, both with her father and with all the world, and that in the end it would assuredly prove the breake-necke of their mariage, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the ruine of both their contents and fortunes, as also that she is ready to be his wife, but disdaineth to prove his strumpet, with many other wise and godly reasons tending that way, and therefore utterly refuseth to blemish or shipwracke her chastity, by participating with him in the share of this lascivious and impious sinne of fornication; and indeed it had been a happines and glory, very worthy both of her selfe, and of her honourable old Father, if she had lived in the purity, and continued in the piety of this chaste and vertuous resolution.</p>
                     <p>But this lascivious Baron <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> seeing his lust so strongly opposed by he chastity, hee is so far from grace and from God, as hee redoubleth his violence and impetuositie thereof, as also of his lures and prayers, of his art and policy, to inrich himselfe with her losse of that inestimable and irrecoverable Jewell her Virginity; so that day and night she cannot be in quiet for him, nor hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her; but still he followes her as her ghost and shadow, and with many false oathes and feigned sighes and teares doth bewitch or rather minstralize into her eares and heart, that his desire of this sweet pleasure which hee requesteth from her, proceeds wholly from his tender affection to her, &amp; so with a thousand lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious words hee makes so large and so impious an Apology to her for this his obscene request, that because modesty cannot, discretion will not permit mee to relate it; as well knowing that the expression and publishing thereof, will every way prove unprofitable to the Reader, &amp; no way pleasing but displeasing to God, when this weake and inconsiderate Gentlewoman, loving him far dearer than her owne life, and confidently relying on his sworne affection and fidelity to her, which hee so passionatly, and so often had reiterated to her, shee so rashly and foolishly permitted her selfe to be weighed downe, overcome and vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the importunacy of his requests and oathes, that it was neither in her power or will to deny him any thing, no not her selfe, but as she formerly had given him the full command of her heart, now she likewise gives him the free use and possession of her body. Thus <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> bereaves and unparadiseth his Mistris <hi>Vrsina</hi> of the most pretious Jewell which ever Lady Nature gave her, I meane her chastity and honour, but both of them shall shortly pay deare for these their bitter sweet pleasures (or rather sinnes) of sensuality and fornication; and shall redeeme and ransome them with no lesse than shame and repentance: The manner whereof is thus.</p>
                     <p>After hee had thus deflowred, and taken his obscene pleasure of his young and beautifull Mistris, and stayed an houre or two complementing with her, he then takes his leave of her, when triumphing more in the conquest of her shame, and his folly, than in his owne repentance for occasioning the one and committing the other, hee within a weeke or two after againe makes her so flexible and tractable to his desires, as hee three or foure times more familiarly wantonizeth with her in this lascivious manner, and she with him, as not contented to staine and blemish, but wholly to defile and pollute themselves in this their beastly sin of concupiscence and fornication. But here now begins his infamie, and her griefe and misery: For (as a base Nobleman) hee forgetting his oathes and promises to her, and her extraordinary love and affection to him, and which is more, his
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:16653:332"/>
honour, and himselfe, and his soule, and his God, hee (by degrees) now begins to freez in his affection to her, visiteth her seldome, and then but faintly and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and when (with equall blushes and teares) shee motioneth him to marry her, hee is either deafe to her requests, or else answereth her so impertinently and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguously, as (with much perturbation of mind and affliction of heart) shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to suspect and doubt with her selfe, that she hath more reason to feare, than cause to hope of his future affection and fidelity towards her. Neither is her feare vaine, or her judgement and apprehension deceived of him herein: for as men love nosegayes in the morne, and throw them away ere night, so this ignoble Nobleman <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> after hee had surfetted and satiated his desire of this his intended and contracted wife <hi>Vrsina,</hi> hee in lesse than three moneths after, is so ingratefull and treacherous towards her, as in a manner hee abandoneth her fathers house, and forsakes her sight and companie, leaving her nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her, but her sighes, teares, and repentance, and which is worse, a growing great belly, as the true seale of her present griefe and sorrow, and the undoubted pledge and presager of her future shame and misery, which torments and terrifies her heart and soule, but how to remedie it she knowes not. And now (with as much speed as vanity and infidelity) away goes <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> to his other second sweet heart <hi>Bertranna,</hi> who not for her beautie, but for her fathers great wealth, and his owne pressing wants, hee now seemes to affect and court a thousand times more familiarly and tenderly than before, whereof shee is infinitly glad &amp; joyfull. For having a long time loved him in her heart and mind, and therefore desiring nothing so much under heaven, as to see him her Husband here on earth, and having to that end her secret eyes and spies every where abroad upon his life and actions, she is at last advertised, that there is some great distaste and difference fallen out betweene him and the Lady <hi>Vrsina,</hi> as also that being farre from his home, hee wanteth monyes to defray his Port and expences in <hi>Naples;</hi> shee being of a sharp wit, and deepe judgement, thinkes that the last of his defects was the cause of the first, and that peradventure <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to borrow some money of her father <hi>Seignior Placedo,</hi> and received the repulse, hee therefore was fallen out, and become displeased and discontented with his daughter: And although her conceit and judgement missed of the truth herein, yet the better to estrange <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> from <hi>Vrsina,</hi> and consequently the more powerfully and strongly to unite and tye him to her selfe, shee well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that her owne father <hi>De Tores</hi> exceedingly loved him, and desired him for his sonne in law, as much as shee did for her Husband: shee therefore as much in love to him, as in disdaine and malice to <hi>Vrsina,</hi> doth under hand deale so politickly, and yet so secretly with her Father to lend <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> some monyes, that hee meeting him the very next day in his house, hee takes him aside in his study and told him, that in regard of his absence from <hi>Capua,</hi> and his long stay and great expences here in <hi>Naples,</hi> it was rather likely than impossible that hee might want some monyes, and therefore hee freely lent, and then and there laid him downe 500 double pistolls: adding withall, that if hee needed more, hee should have what hee pleased, and repay it him againe when hee pleased, and that if hee would honour him so much as to marry his daughter, hee would give him all the lands and wealth hee had.</p>
                     <p>This great courtesie of <hi>De Tores</hi> to the Baron of <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> hee held was redoubled to him in the value, in that hee lent it to him so freely and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as also for that it came so opportunely and fitly to pay his debts, and satisfie his wants, as after a long and respective complement betweene them.
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:16653:332"/>
                        <hi>Sanctifiores</hi> necessitie so easily prevailes with his modesty, that hee most thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully takes this gold of <hi>De Tores,</hi> and likewise gives him more hope than despaire to his motion of marrying his daughter the Lady <hi>Bertranna;</hi> wherewith the one rests well satisfied, and the other exceeding well contented. This point of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie being thus performed betweene them, <hi>Sanctifiores</hi> joy thereof was so great; I may say so boundlesse, as he presently finds out his new Mistris <hi>Bertranna;</hi> and with a frolick countenance and cheerfull voice, relates her, how much her father had obliged him, and from point to point what had past betweene them, and immediately after no lesse doth her father, the musick of which newes was so pleasing to her mind, and so sweet to her heart and thoughts, that she hereupon flatters her selfe with a confident hope that hee will shortly marry her, and in this hope doth hee still feed and entertaine her, being seldome or never from her, but ever and anon both together billing and kissing, drowning his judgement so wholly in her company, and his heart ranging and dreaming so fully on her youth and beauty, and on her fathers great wealth and estate, that hee hath not the grace, no nor which is lesse, the will or good nature, once to thinke of his poore desolate and forsaken <hi>Vrsina,</hi> of whom in her turne I come now to speake.</p>
                     <p>Wee have formerly understood with sorrow, and our sorrowfull and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Vrsina</hi> hath to her griefe too too soone seene, how unkindly <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> hath used, and how basely and treacherously abused her in the points of her honour, and his infidelity; and yet all this notwithstanding, her love and affection is still so deare and constant to him, and her hopes so confident of him, that all this discourtesie of his to her, is only but to try her patience, and that considering what familiarity hath past betweene them, it is impossible for him to bee so cruell hearted towards her, as in the end not to marry her. She hath likewise acquainted him, that she is with child by him, and when all other reasons and persuasions faile, shee hopes this will prevaile to reclaime his affection to her, and to induce him to take pitty of her, and compassion of his unborne babe within her. But to resell and dissipate all these her flattering and deceitfull hopes, and which is worse to make her lose all hopes of this her desired happines and good fortune from him, his new contracted and incessant familiarity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and the Lady <hi>Bertranna,</hi> is not so privatly carried and hushed up in silence betweene them, but shee hath secret and sorrowfull notice thereof; which so inflames her mind with hot jelousie, and likewise afflicts her heart with cold feare and apprehension, that shee hath seduced and drawen his affection from her to himselfe, as also that hee will utterly forsake her to marry <hi>Bertranna,</hi> that shee fully beleeves that the wind of his discourteous absence from her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes from this point of the compasse. Wherefore fearing that which shee already knowes, but far more that which shee knowes not of this their famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity betweene them, all her hopes of <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> are almost vanished and banished, and her heart is as it were wholly depressed and weighed downe with bitter griefe and sorrow thereof. She dares acquaint no body with her disgrace, much lesse her Father, and her looking on her great belly doth but infinitely augment her sorrowes and increase her afflictions, in regard that that which should have beene the cause of her joy and glory, shee now knowes will shortly prove the argument of her shame and misery. A thousand times a day, yea I may truly say as many times an houre, shee wisheth shee had beene more chaste and lesse faire, and not so easily to have hearkned to <hi>Sanctifiores</hi> sugred oathes and temptations, as to have lost her honour and fortunes in seeking to preserve them in her affe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And yet againe, because the excesse of her sorrowes hath more eclipsed her joyes than her judgement, and more dulled and obscured her heart than her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, therefore judging it a master peece of her policy if shee can se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quester and reclaime her <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> from <hi>Bertranna,</hi> and so retaine him to her selfe in marriage, shee to that end, that very morning sends for <hi>Sebastiano</hi> her fathers coachman (whom shee knew to be faithfull to her) and taking off a rich Diamond ring from her finger which <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> well knew, she bade him find out the Baron of <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> at his lodging, or elsewhere, to deliver that ring as a token of her love to him, and to tell him that shee infinitly desires him to honour her with his presence at her Fathers house sometimes the forenoone. <hi>Sebastiano</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly findes out the Baron, and delivers him his young mistris ring and message, by whom hee returnes this answer; Commend me to the Lady <hi>Vrsina,</hi> and tell her I will be with her immediatly after dinner. Whiles thus our sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Vrsina</hi> (betwixt hope and feare, griefe and consolation) prepares to receive him, hee arrives to her in his owne coach, and her Fathers servants attending for him, doe conduct him up to her chamber, where composing her countenance to affection, and yet to sorrow, shee meets him at the doore, and conducts him to the window which answereth and lookes into the garden, where hee giving her onely one slight kisse, and shee absenting her Fathers servants, shee bursts forth into teares and sighes.</p>
                     <p>Shee complaines of the coldnesse of his affection, of his long absence from her, of the violation of his oathes and vowes to her, and of her great belly by him, which shee tells him hee may better see than shee conceale, but especially of his deepe promise to marry her, praying him to set downe the time and place when hee will performe and consummate it, and that it would infallibly prove his shame and infamy, if hee forgat himselfe, his honour and conscience, to forsake her, and marry the Lady <hi>Bertranna,</hi> whom shee affirmes to him with teares, that shee understands is the mistris of his thoughts and heart, and the Queene Regent of his desires and affections. When this base Baron is so cruell hearted to her, as (preferring his fury to his affection, and his passion to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion) hee replyes not a word to all the former parts and branches of her speeches and complaints, but only to the two last hee gives her this thundering and heart-killing answer: Know <hi>Vrsina</hi> that I have used all lawfull and possible meanes with my parents to draw their consents that I might marry thee, but it is out of my power ever to obtaine it of them, and without it I will never marry: as for <hi>Bertranna,</hi> shee is not so much thy inferiour in beauty, as shee is thy superiour in vertues, therefore provide thou for thy fortunes, and so will I for mine, when with a looke (which savored no way of love, but wholly of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and indignation) hee hastily throwes her her Diamond ring, and without once kissing her or bidding her farewell, suddenly rusheth forth her chamber, wherein hee leaves her to her selfe and her muses, and so takes coach and away, vowing to himselfe as hee went forth the doores, that hee will not bee Father to a bastard, nor Husband to a whore.</p>

                     <p>And now it is, that at the sight and consideration of this his barbarous cruelty towards her; her very heart and soule is wounded and pierced thorow with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and now it is that she looks backe on her former folly &amp; errour, on her present affliction and griefe, &amp; on her future shame &amp; miserie, and now it is that deeming him lost to her for ever, and her selfe consequently ruined without him; that her sorrowes and miseries are so great, so infinite, that shee is ready to drowne her selfe in her teares, and most willingly desirous to forsake this life and this world to flie up to heaven and to God upon the wings of her sighes, and prayers. But ahlas poore soule, thou art too unfortunate to be yet so happie, because these thy afflictions and sorrowes doe as it were but now begin; therefore thou must prepare and arme thy selfe to suffer them with patience and to end them in lesse passion, and more repentance and piety.</p>

Who having thus received the repulse and refusall from her treacherous lover <hi>Sanctifiore,</hi> she (within a moneth after) with a sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart &amp; courage, resolves (as well as she may) to dispence for a time with her teares, and to provide for her reputation, shee hath as yet acquainted none but <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> with her disgrace of her great belly, for neither her kinsfolkes, friends, neighbours, father, or his servants doe as yet know it; shee is of a weake body and feeble constitution, and therefore to conceale this scandall from her father, as also from all the world, and to provide for the lying downe of her great belly, she holds it requisite to discover this great and important secret but only to one, and so to crave the aid &amp; assistance of this confident bosom friend. To which end, she thinkes none so fit for her purpose, &amp; therefore makes choice of no other, but of an old aunt of hers, who was her mothers sister named <hi>Dona Mellefanta,</hi> who being a wise and rich widdow woman, dwelt at Putzeole some 10 small miles distant from Naples, a place so famous for its sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And although I am thy wife before God, yet I will now in all humility make my selfe thy handmaid and with a world of sighes and teares throw my selfe at thy feet (and lower if I could) to conjure and begge thee; By my poore beauty which once thou didest so much admire and adore, by the memory of my lost virginity, which thou wrested'st from mee with so many amarous sighes and teares, by all thy deepe oathes, vowes and promises which thou so religiously gavest mee to remaine still loving to mee, by thine honour which should bee dearer to thee than thy life, by thy conscience, and soule which ought to bee far more pretious to thee than all the lives and honours of the world, yea for thy poore infants sake, and lastly for Gods sake, abandon thy unjust displeasure and immerited discontent conceived against mee, and my deare <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> come away to mee to Putzeole, and there make mee thy wife in the sight of his Church and people, as I am already in
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:16653:335"/>
that of heaven and his Angells, I say againe, come away to mee my sweet <hi>Sanctifiore,</hi> for thy sight will delight my heart, and thy presence and company ravish my soule with joy. It is impossible for <hi>Bertranna,</hi> either to love or honour thee the thousand part so dearly as thy <hi>Vrsina</hi> doth, and till death resolves to doe; I will freely forget all thy former escapes and discourtesies towards mee, and doe attribute them more to her foolish vanity, than any way to thy unkind disposition or inclination, yea I will not knit my browes when thou comest to mee, but will cheerfully and joyfully prepare my selfe to feast thee with smiles, and to surfet thee with kisses: But if contrariwise thou wilt not hearken unto mee, or this my letter, or regard these my just requests and sorrowes, nor obey and follow God and thy conscience herein, in speedily repairing to mee to make mee thy joyfull wife, then what shall I doe or say, but according as I am bound in affection and duty to thee, I will notwithstanding still resolve to love thee dearly, though thou, hate mee deadly, and to pray for thee though thou curse mee; yea I will then leave thee to God, and religiously beseech his divine majestie, to bee a just judge betweene both of us, of my firme affection and constancy to thee, and of thy cruell ingratitude and treacherie to mee. Live thou as happie, as thy constant <hi>Vrsina</hi> knowes that without thee, shee shall assuredly live sorrowfully and die miserablie.</p>

O let mee (with respect and repentance) revoke that noble title from <hi>Sanctifiore,</hi> and to give him his due, let me tearme him as hee is a monster of men, or if hee will, a noble deboshed villaine, or whether hee will or no, a meere tyrant, or else a devill in the shape of a man, to use such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull cruelties, and hellish actions and speeches against these two innocent persons, who contrariwise in the highest degree, deserved from him all manner of affection, respect, charity, pitty and compassion; but let him looke to him selfe as well as he can, yet (God being as just as mercifull) it is not impossible for him in the end to pay deare for these his foule infidelities and cruelties.</p>

                        <hi>Vrsina</hi> hath no sooner read this letter, but every member of her body trembles for griefe and vexation thereat, yea her sorrowes are so great, as shee cannot speake a word, when being ready to fall to the ground, her aunt <hi>Mellefanta</hi> steps to her assistance and so doe the two men, but they have all of them much adoe to support her up, when at last wringing her hands, and looking up stedfastly to heaven, she throwing her letter to her aunt to reade, utters forth this bitter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation against <hi>Sanctifiore;</hi> and hath this base Nobleman at last requited all my love, with this monstrous ingratitude and treachery! O why doe I live to suffer it? and O wherefore should hee live for offering it to mee? her aunt reads her letter and in detestation of <hi>Sanctifiores</hi> basenes, shee addes fuell to the flame of her neeces choler against him, but shee needs not, for this very last act of his marriage with <hi>Bertranna,</hi> sets her all in fire and revenge against him, yea her heart is so absolutely diverted, and taken away from him, as heretofore she never loved him so much as now shee hates him; shee sweares to her selfe, that shee will make him pay deare for this his ingratitude and treachery towards her, and limits her revenge with no lesse than his death for so basely abusing and deceiving her, shee but now threw away his letter for sorrow, but now shee againe takes it up for joy, because it calls her home to Naples, where as soone as shee arives shee againe and againe resolves and vowes with her selfe that shee will murther him her selfe, or cause him to bee murthered by some others, her aunt <hi>Mellefan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> by all sweet meanes and perswasions, seeks to pacifie her discontent and fury, and so to appease and coole the raging tempests of her heart; but shee speakes to a deafe woman, who is not capable, either of councell consolation or reason, for her mallice and revenge against <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> have so sully taken up her heart and soule, and so absolutly surprised her thoughts and possessed her resolutions, that shee neither resolves nor thinkes of any thing else, but how and in what manner shee may murther him; to which end shee takes coach for Putzeole, there packes up her baggage, conceales her bloody intents and resolutions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> from her aunt <hi>Mellefanta,</hi> thankes her most lovingly and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously for all her care of her, and affection to her, the remembrance whereof she affirmes she will beare to her grave, and from thence to heaven, and so within three daies takes leave of her, and returnes to Naples to her father, who receives her with much content and joy, and is very glad of the recovery of her health, and yet perceives some secret discontent lie lurking in the furrowes of her browes; but shee dissembleth it both to him and the world, and so beares her selfe fairely, modestly, and temperatly towards him in her speeches and actions, who all this whiles is every way ignorant of her disgracefull great belly, as also of the birth &amp; buriall of her infant child. She is no sooner come to Naples, but her deadly malice and revenge to <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> will give no truce to her thoughts, nor peace to her resolutions, for her heart having conspired with the devill, and both of them against God to dispatch him to heaven; so now from the matter shee falles to the manner, and from her consultation to the practise thereof. She first thinkes it best to get him poysoned, to which end within ten dayes after her arivall to Naples shee sends for her owne Apothecary named <hi>Antonio Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy,</hi> and having sworne him to secrecy profers him two hundred duckatons to poyson her mortall enemy the Baron of <hi>Sanctifiore,</hi> but <hi>Romancy</hi> is too honest a man and too religious a christian to undertake it, and so utterly refuseth her, and rejecteth her profer; and then and there with many godly reasons and pious speeches, endevoureth to disswade her from this foule and bloody fact, but hee speakes either to the wind or to a deafe woman, for shee is resolute not to retire
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:16653:338"/>
but to advance in this her cruell and inhumane designe, only shee here againe strongly conjures this honest Apothecary to secrecie, the which hee solemnly promiseth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vrsina</hi> is still implacable in her malice and revenge against <hi>Sanctifiore,</hi> the which revives with more violence, and flames forth with the greater impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, when shee (by her secret spies) is given to understand that hee triumpheth in her affliction and scandall, and reputes it his chiefest content and felicity to have erected the trophees of his joy upon the ruines of her honour and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molitions of her reputation and fame, as also that shee and this her disgrace is now become the publike laughter and private scorne and glory of his proud and ambitious wife <hi>Bertranna:</hi> so shee cannot endure the thought, much lesse digest the remembrance and consideration hereof, and therefore shee speedily resolves to reduce her malitious contemplation into bloody action towards him, and to try another experiment and conclusion thereof. She in a pleasant morning somewhat sooner than accustomed, walkes alone with her waiting maid, in her fathers curious and dainty garden, but not to please her eyes with the delicious sight and fragrant smell of the great variety of rare and faire flowers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was richly adorned and diapred; or to recreate and delight her eares with the mellifluous ditties and madrigalls of those sweet quiristers of the aire, the nightingalls, thrushes, and lennots, who sate chaunting of some sweet division on some trees of this garden, and on some branches of these trees; or to preserve her selfe from the intemperate heat of the scorching sunne beames; and therefore either to passe her time, either in some shaddowed walkes and arbours, or to sit her selfe downe by some curious chrystall fountaine, with all which delights and rarities this her fathers garden was deliciously inriched and embelished; O no, nothing lesse, for shee was resolute to make her selfe more miserable, and not so happie, because her thoughts were wholly bent on blood, and her resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the murther of <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> at what price or rate soever. Having therefore formerly mist of her Apothecary <hi>Romancy</hi> to poyson him, shee else knowes not any so fit or proper to dispatch him as her trusty coachman <hi>Sebastiano,</hi> who (as wee have formerly understood) was both an eye and an eare witnesse of this his base and ignoble crueltie towards her: wherefore shee by her waiting maid, sends for him into the garden to her, and with many ruthfull lookes, and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sighes, having first commended and applauded his fidelity to her, and then sworne him to secrecy to what shee should now relate and deliver unto him, shee tells him, that shee cannot live except that base Lord <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> dye, and therefore shee profereth him an hundred Spanish double pistolls of gold, if hee will either murther him by night in the streets with his rapier, or pistoll him to death abroad in the fields, at his first seeing, and meeting of him, to the which shee very earnestly prayes and requests him. <hi>Sebastiano</hi> as amazed at this bloody proposition and entreaty of his young Lady <hi>Vrsina,</hi> whom hee ever held to bee more charitable, and not so cruell hearted to any one of the world, and although hee be poore, yet hee is so honest, vertuous and religious, as hee highly refuseth to distaine his heart, or dip his hands in innocent blood for any silver or gold whatsoever. So in humble (and yet in absolute) tearmes, hee gives her the deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and (with teares in his eyes) prayes her to desist from this her cruell purpose, because hee affirmes to her, that the end of murther proves most commonly but the beginning of shame, repentance, misery, and confusion to their authors; so shee bites her lip, and hangs her head for sorrow, at this his repulse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

swear secrecy to her in all thinges, which now doth, othereafter may concerne this businesse, the which hee faithfully promiseth her, provided, that her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and his seruice bee every way exempt of the effusion of innocent blood, and the perpetration of murther, to the which hee constantly vowes to her, it is impossible for him ever to bee seduced or drawen, and so hee takes leave of her, and leaves her solitarily alone in the garden to her muses; but yet as hee was issuing forth shee againe calls him to her, and strictly chargeth him first care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and curiously to informe himselfe, and then hee her, of <hi>Sanctifiores</hi> most frequent haunts, and walkes without the cittie, the which hee likewise promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her to performe.</p>
                     <p>Our malitious and revengefull <hi>Vrsina</hi> is not contented to receive the deniall from her Apothecary <hi>Romancy,</hi> and the repulse from her coachman <hi>Sebastiano,</hi> about the finishing of this deplorable busines, but without making any good use of their honest and religious disswasions of her from it, or without once looking up to God, or thinking of heaven or hell, shee as a fatall member, and prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous agent of <hi>Sathan,</hi> is still resolute to proceed therein; for he is still so strong with her heart, because her faith and soule are so weake with God, that shee sees not her selfe so often in her looking glasse with delight, as shee both sees, and finds <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> in her heart and mind with detestation; for her mallice to him hath quite expelled all reason, and banished all charity and piety in her selfe, and consequently now made her memorative and capable of nothing but of revenge and blood towards him; which takes up every part, and usurpes every point both of her time, and of her selfe, yea and workes so strang (I may rather truly say so miserable) a metamorphosis in her, as if shee were now wholly composed of one, or both of these two impious and diabolicall vices, so that every moment seemes a yeare, and every day an age to her, before shee hath dispatched him for heaven; she now sees that shee cannot (with safety) employ any other herein but her selfe, and therefore day by day calling upon <hi>Sebastiano</hi> to know of him, where <hi>Sanctifiores</hi> usuall haunts and walkes were without the cittie, hee at last tells her that hee is fullie assured, that most mornings and evenings he takes his coach and some times his page, but many times alone, and so goes a mile out of the cittie beyond the gate which lookes towards Saint Germaines and there in a dainty grove of olives and orenge trees (neere a small rivers side) hee with his booke in his hand, and his spaniell dogge at his heeles passeth an houre or two alone in his private contemplations, his coach being sometimes out of sight from him, and sometimes returnes to the cittie, and so comes and fetcheth him backe againe; which report is no sooner heard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of <hi>Vrsina</hi> from her coachman, but shee receives it with much joy, and entertaines it with infinite content and delectation; shee is therefore so cruell in her thoughts, and so determinate and bloody in her resolutions, as shee will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract no time, but shee speedily bethinkes her selfe of a hellish stratagem and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy (no lesse strange than cruell) which the devill him selfe suggested and found out for her, to wreake her inveterate malice and infernall revenge in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of <hi>Sanctifiore,</hi> the manner whereof is thus.</p>

They are here both of them so amazed with griefe and astonished with sorrow at this lamentable spectacle and accident, as they (for a quarter of an houres time) know not what to thinke or say hereof, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this their Lord and master had here kild himselfe, or were murthered and robbed by theeves, but at last this sorrowfull page <hi>Hieronymo,</hi> will stay alone weeping by the breathlesse body of his Lord, and master, and so sends away the coachman, in his coach speedily to Naples, to acquaint their Lady <hi>Dona Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranna,</hi> and her father <hi>Seignior de Tores</hi> with this sad and sorrowfull newes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at shee almost drownes her selfe in her teares, and hee very bitterly laments and sorroweth for it; so (being incapable of any hope comfort or consolation) they doe both of them take coach and drive away into the fields, where shee almost murthereth her eyes with her teares, to see her deare Lord and husband lie thus murthered in his blood. They here see none in sight of him, neither doe they know any body but them selves that hath seene him; so by whom, or how hee is kild they cannot as yet either conceive or imagin, when the father leaving his daughter to wash and bedew her dead husbands cheekes with her teares, hee himselfe gallops away in his coach to Naples and brings thence along with him the crimynall officers of justice, first to know and then to bee eye witnesses of this sad and deplorable accident; at the hearing and sight whereof, (in nature and justice) they cannot refraine from equally woondering and grieving at it, when (to act the part and duty of themselves) they cause the coachman to spread his cloake on the ground, then to remove the dead corps from his blood, and to lay him thereon, and so they make a chirurgion (whom they had purposely brought with them) to unapparell and search his body for wounds, who finds and shewes them, that hee was shot with two pistoll bullets in his backe, and other two in his brest, (when missing likewise of his purse) they all of them doe confidently beleeve, that undoubtedly hee was murthered and robbed by theeves. The which the better to discover, the judges send their sergeants, and servants, and <hi>De Tores</hi> likewise sends the page and his coachman searching and scouring all over the adjacent fields to apprehend and bring before them all those whom they finde there; who are so far from meeting of many persons, as they all of them bring in but one poore ragged boy (of some twelve or fourteene yeares old) who some two hundred paces off, kept a few cowes (which yeelded milke to the cittie) and him they find sitting within a hedge in a ditch whom they bring along with them to the judges, where hee sees this dead body lying on the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, where at poore silly boy hee shakes and trembles for feare.</p>

Then they enquire of him if hee saw any one to come neere and kill this gentleman, to whom in plaine and rusticke tearmes he

They aske of him why hee had not cryed out against the frier, when hee saw hee had kild this gentleman, to whom hee makes answer that he dared not doe it, for feare lest hee would then likewise have killed him with his pistolls. The judges further demaund of him, whether this were a white, a blacke or a gray frier, to whom hee answers that hee was neither of them, but that hee wore a minime, or sad russet gowne and hood. Thereupon they thought it fit, againe to demand of him how many horses this coach had, and of what collour they were, to whom hee affirmes that they were two blacke coach-horses, when the judges to conclude this their quaere and his examination, they demand of him what colloured cloake this coachman wore, who tells them hee wore a red cloake, and as he thought some white laces upon it, the which this pregnant poore little boy <hi>Bartholomeo</hi> had no sooner pronounced and spoken, but <hi>Sanctifiores</hi> page <hi>Hieronymo</hi> cries out and relates to the judges, to his Lady <hi>Bertranna,</hi> and her father <hi>Seignior de Tores,</hi> where and in what manner and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he some two houres since found the Lady <hi>Vrsina,</hi> and her coachman <hi>Sebasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano,</hi> whom hee seriously affirmed wore a red cloake with white laces, and that her two coach-horses which they saw straying below in the valley were coale blacke, right as <hi>Bartholomeo</hi> had described them; adding further that her coach was broken with a fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Whiles thus all Naples generally resound and talke of this mournfull fact, and deplorable accident, and <hi>Seignior Placedo</hi> particularly grieves at these his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unexpected crosses and calamities, as also of those of his coachman <hi>Sebastia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> the which hee feares, hee can far sooner lament than remedy; our sorrowfull widdow <hi>Bertranna</hi> (with the assistance of her father <hi>De Tores)</hi> gives her husband the Baron of <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> a solemne and stately buriall in the Fueillantes Church of Naples, correspondant to his noble degree and qualitie. And then within two daies after, at her earnest and passionate solicitation to the judges; <hi>Vrsina</hi> and her coachman <hi>Sebastiano</hi> are severally convented before them, in their chiefe Forum, (or tribunall) of justice, and there strongly accused by her and charged to bee the authors and actors of this cruell murther, committed on the person of the Baron of <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> her husband, the which both of them doe stoutly deny with much vehemency and confidence, and when the little boy <hi>Bartholomeo,</hi> is face to face called into the court to give in evidence against them, hee there main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to the judges what hee had formerly deposed to them in the fields, but saies hee thinks not, that this Lady was that frier, nor can hee truly say that this was the coachman who carried him, although when his cloake was shewed him hee could not deny but it was verie like it; but <hi>Bertranna</hi> having now secretly intimated and made knowen to the judges, all the passages that had formerly past betweene <hi>Vrsina</hi> and her husband <hi>Sanctifiore,</hi> as his getting of her with child, and then (contrarie to his promise) refusing to marry her, they doe therefore more than halfe beleeve, that it was her discontent which drew her to this choler, her choler to this revenge, and her revenge to this murthering of him, as also (that in favour of some gold) shee had likewise seduced and drawen her coachman <hi>Sebastiano</hi> to bee consenting and accessary herein with her: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the next day they will begin with him, and so they adjudge him to the racke, the torments whereof hee endures with a wonderfull fortitude and patience, so that (remembring his oath of secrecy to his Lady <hi>Vrsina)</hi> hee cannot thereby bee drawen to confesse any thing, but denies all, whereof shee having secret notice, doth not a little rejoyce and insult thereat, now the very next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueing morning <hi>Vrsina</hi> her selfe, is likewise adjudged and exposed to the racke, the wrenches and torments whereof, as soone as shee sensibly feeles, God proves then so propitious and mercifull to her soule, that her dainty body, and tender limbes cannot possibly endure or suffer it, but then and there shee to her judges and tormentors, confesseth herselfe to bee the sole author and actor of pistolling to death the Baron of <hi>Sanctifiore,</hi> in the same manner and forme, as wee have already understood in all its circumstances, but in her heart and soule shee strongly affirmes to them that her coachman <hi>Sebastiano</hi> was not accessary with her herein, upon which apparent and palpable confession of hers, her judges (in honour to sacred justice, and for expiation of this her foule crime) doe pronounce sentence of death against her, that shee shall the next morning bee hanged at the place of common execution, notwithstanding all the power and teares of her father, and kinsfolkes to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>So she is returned to her prison where her father (not being permitted to see her that night) sends her two Nuns, and two friers to prepare and direct her soule for heaven, whom in a little time (through Gods great mercy, and their owne pious perswasions) they found to bee wounderfull humble, repentant, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull. She privately sends word to her coachman <hi>Sebastiano,</hi> that shee is
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:16653:342"/>
thankfull to him for his respect and fidelity to her on the racke, and wills him to bee assured and confident, that shee being to die to morow, her speech at her death, shall no way prejudice, but strongly confirme the safety and preservation of his life. Thus grieving far more at the foulnes of her crime than at the infamy and severity of her punishment, shee spends most part of the night, and the first part of the morning in godly praiers and religious meditations, and ejaculations, when, although her sorrowfull old father <hi>Seignior Placedo</hi> (by his noble kinsman the Prince of Salerno) made offer to the Viceroy (the Duke of ossuna) the free gift of all his lands to save this his daughters life, yet the strong solicitation of the first; and the great proffer of the last proved vaine, and fruitlesse, for they found it wholly impossible to obtaine it.</p>
                     <p>So about ten of the clocke in the morning, our sorrowfull <hi>Vrsina,</hi> is (betweene two Nuns) brought to her execution; clad in a blacke wrought velvet gowne, a greene sattin petticoate, agreat laced ruffe, her head dressed up with tuffes and roses of greene ribbon, with some artificiall flowers, all covered over with a white ciffres vaile, and a paire of plaine white gloves on her hands: when ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ladder, shee, to the great confluence of people who came thither to see her take her last farwell of this life, and this world, (with a mournfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and low voice) delivered them this sorrowfull and religious speech.</p>
                     <p>Good people, I want words to expresse the griefe of my heart, and the anxiety and sorrow of my soule, for imbruing my hands in the innocent blood and death of the Baron of <hi>Sanctifiore,</hi> although not to dissemble but to confesse the pure truth, hee betraied his promise to mee of marriage, and mee of my honour and chastity without it, whereof I beseech Almighty God, that all men (of what degree or qualitie soever) may hereafter bee warned by his example, and all Ladies and gentlewomen deterred and terrified by mine. I doe likewise here confesse to heaven and earth, to God and his Angells, and to you all who are here present, that I alone was both the author and actor of this foule murther, and that my coachman <hi>Sebastiano,</hi> is no way consenting or accessary with mee herein, and that albeit I once promised and proffered him a hundred double pistolls of Spanish gold to performe it, yet hee honestly and religiously refused both me and it, and strongly and pathetically disswaded me from it, whose good, and wholesome councell I now wish to God (from the depth and center of my soule) I had then followed, for then I had lived as happie, as now I die misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And because it is now no time, but bootlesse for mee either to paliate the truth, or to flatter with God, or man, the worst of his crime he being my servant was the least courtesie hee owed to mee I being his mistris, which (after with mine owne hands I had committed that deplorable fact) was to bring mee home from the fields to my fathers house, and for assisting mee to cast the friers frocke, the false beard and haire, the almes box, breviary, and two pistolls, into the next deepe pit, or precipice thereunto adjoining, where (as yet) they still lie: for this my heinous offence, (the very remembrance whereof is now grievous and odious unto mee) I aske pardon first of God, then of mine owne deare father, and next of the Lady <hi>Bertranna,</hi> and if the words and prayers, of a poore dying gentlewoman have any power with the living, then I beseech you all in generall, and every one of you in particular, to pray unto God, that hee will now forgive my sinnes in his favour, and hereafter save my soule in his mercy, the which as soone as shee had said, and uttered some few short prayers to her selfe, shee (often making the signe of the crosse) takes leave of all the world when pulling downe her vaile (in comly sort) over her eies and face, and erecting her hands
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:16653:343"/>
towards heaven shee was turned over, now as some of her spectators rejoyced at the death of so cruell and bloody or female monster, so the greatest part of them (in favour of her birth youth and beautie) did with aworld of teares exceedingly lament and pittie her, but all of them doe highly detest and execrate the base ingratitude infidelity and treachery of this ignoble Baron of <hi>Sanctifiore</hi> towards her, which no doubt was the prime cause, and cheifest motive which drew her to these deplorable and bloody resolutions.</p>
                     <p>As for her honest coachman <hi>Sebastiano;</hi> although his owne torments on the racke, and now this solemne confession of his Lady <hi>Vrsina</hi> at her death had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proclaimed and vindicated his innocency in this murther of <hi>Sanctifiore;</hi> yet such was his widdow <hi>Bertrannas</hi> living affection to her dead husband and her deadly malice to living <hi>Sebastiano,</hi> for thinking him to bee guiltie, and accessary hereunto with his Lady <hi>Vrsina,</hi> that her power and malice so far prevailed with the integrity of the judges, for the further disquisition of this truth, as they now againe sentence him to the double torments of the racke, the which hee againe likewise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> endureth with a most unparalleld patience and constancy, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing any thing, the which his judges wondering to see, and admiring to understand, and having no substantiall proofes or reall and valable evidences against him, they now fully absolve and acquit him of this his suspected crime, when being moved in charity justice and conscience to yeeld him some reward, and satisfaction, for thus enfeebling his body, and impairing of his health by these his sharpe and bitter torments, they therefore adjudge the plaintiffe wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow <hi>Bertranna</hi> to give him three hundred duckatons, whereof shee cannot possibly exempt or excuse her selfe.</p>
                     <p>And thus lived and died our unkind Baron <hi>Sanctifiore,</hi> and our cruell hearted young Lady <hi>Vrsina,</hi> and in this manner did the sacred justice of God requite the one and condignly revenge and punish the other. Now by reading this their histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, may God (of his best favour and mercy) teach us all, from our hearts to hate this Barons levitie, and from our soules to abhorre and detest this Ladies cruelty and impiety.</p>

of whom the histories of Spaine and Portugall make so often, and so honourable mention, and although hee were by his ancestors and parents, left very rich in lands and possessions; yet his ambition and generosity caried him to serve his king Phillip third of Spaine, in his warres of Africa and Flanders, wherein hee spent the greatest part of his time, and of himselfe, wonne many renowned laurells, and martiall trophees of honour, and as an excellent cavalier left behinde him many approved markes and testimonies of his true valour, and magnanimity. But (as all men are naturally constant in unconstancy; and subject and co-incident to mutations, and that the world still delights to please us with changes, and to feed our fancies and affections with different enterprises and resolutions) so our <hi>De Mora</hi> at last, calls home his thoughts and himselfe from warre to peace, and resolves to spend the remainder of his age in as much ease &amp; pleasure as formerly hee had done the heate and strength of his youth, in tumults and combustions; hee now sees that there is no life nor pleasure comparable to that of the country, for here the sweetnesse of the imbalmed aire, the delicacy of the perfumed and enamelled fields, the unparalleld pastime of hauking and hunting, and the free and uninterrupted accesse which wee have to arts in our study, and to God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious praiers and meditations, makes it to bee, no lesse than either an earthly paradise, or a heaven upon earth.

Now the Alarums of warre no longer take up his thoughts and time; neither doe the drums and trumpets, or the ratling peales of thunder of muskets and cannons, distract his day pleasures, or cut his nights sweet sleepes and slumbers in peeces. Hee is not addicted to women, but hates them as much as they love men, hee spurnes at love, and (in a disdainfull contempt thereof) tearms venus a whore, and her sonne cupid a boy, and which is worse a bastard, in a word, hee professeth himselfe to be as great, and as mortall an enemy to beauty, as beauty is many times to chastity, and never thinks himselfe happie, but either when hee is out of womens company or they not in his. Hee is so far from any affecting marriage, as hee pittieth it in others, and foreuer abjures and detests it in himselfe. Hee compares single life to roses and lilies, and wedlocke to briars and thistles, and therefore in the highest and sublimest degree, scornes to have any wife or mistris in his house to over master him.</p>
                     <p>But it is not for men to presume to point out their owne destinies and fortunes, sith wee are but the slaves of time, as time is the servant of God; and therefore (in this regard) our actions are subject to heaven not to earth, &amp; to Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rather than our purposes; or to presupose or think the contrary; is a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion every way unworthy of a man, but far more of a christian, sith nature is subject to grace, and our earthly passions and resolutions must still stoope to a sacred power, and ever submit and prostrate themselves to a divine providence, and supernaturall predominancy, it is therefore follie not wisdome, and simplicitie; not discretion in <hi>De Mora</hi> generally to proclaime hate to women, for that hee is the sonne of a woman; or to maligne and disdaine marriage in regard hee is the fruit and off-spring of marriage for thus to violate and pull downe the temples

and alters of love, is obstinatlie to oppose nature, and prophanely to subvert the institution of God himselfe in paradice; but hee shall not continue long in the clouds of this errour.</p>
                     <p>In a cleere and sweete morning (as soone as Aurora lept from the watry bed of <hi>Thetis,</hi> and purposely retired her selfe to give way to approaching <hi>Phoebus,</hi> (who in his fiery chariot, with his glistering beams began to salute &amp; guild the tops of the highest woods &amp; mountaines) <hi>De Mora</hi> attended by halfe a dozen of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticke servants goes into the fields to hauke and hunt, where having kild one hare, and set up another, all his servants left him alone, and with the hounds pursue the hare, who tripping through the launes and thickets, the hills and valleies, at last leads them such a dance, that in lesse than an houre his servants and his doggs were a little league out of his sight, whereat being exceedingly offended and angrie, and far the more for that hee was left all alone, hee not knowing how to passe or delude away the tediousnes of the time, sate himselfe downe on the side of a faire hill, at the foot of a pleasant grove of beech and chesnut trees, whose curled tops sheltred him from the scorching raies of the sunne, and there takes delight to behold how many frequent windings, and turning meanders, the neighbouring chrystall river made in that pleasant valley, as also to see how sweetly the troops of snow-white feathered swans, proudly ruffled their plumes, and disported themselves therein, in their majesticall and stately bravery, &amp; how many malitious Fowlers, both in boates and on the banks of that sweet river were curiously watching with their fierie peeces to murther these innocent watry guests who frequented there, and also how the patient Anglers (with their treacherous hookes and baits) betraied many harmelesse fishes to their undeserved deaths. When <hi>De Mora</hi> (impatient of his solitarines) listning with his eare, if hee might either heare the loud crie and voices of his hounds, or else the shrill rebounding ecchoes of his servants hunting hornes, hee looking up towards the skie, beheld a heron softlie soaring, and proudly hoover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over his head, as if she came purposely to bid defiance to <hi>De Mora,</hi> and his goshauke which hee held on his fist, and consequently to dare, and challenge it to an airie combat; whereat <hi>De Mora</hi> being exceeding glad, and disdaining that his hauke and himselfe, should be thus outbraved by so ill shaped and unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly a sea fowle; hee speedily riseth up, and (betwixt choler and pleasure) lets flie his hauke at her; but the heron stretcheth her pinnions, and packs on her feathered sailes so nimbly and proudly, that sometimes soaring aloft in the aire, sometimes descending, and still looking backe with scorne on the goshauke, as if shee puposely tooke delight and sport, to see what infinite toile and paine this malitious and ravenous hauke tooke to surprise and devour her, so the swifter the heron flew from the hauke, the swifter the hauke redoubled her flight, and tugged away after her, when it being impossible for <hi>De Mora</hi> to reclaime his hauke, either with his hola's or lure, at last both hauke and heron flew quite out of his sight, and which is worse hee was so unfortunate, as never after hee could see either of them againe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>De Mora</hi> being first highly displeased and offended for the absence of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and hounds, hee is now doubly inraged with griefe and choler for the losse of his goshauke, and therefore curseth the heron for thus seducing and betraying her away from him; when wearying himselfe to run from hill to vale to have newes of her, and in the end seeing both his labour and his hauke lost, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himselfe to the aforesaid grove, and (with much discontent and choler) first casting his hat and lure to the ground, hee then likewise casts himselfe
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:16653:345"/>
thereon to repose him; still attending and expecting his hunters.</p>
                     <p>Hee hath not remained there above halfe an houre, but close by him passeth an aged country gentleman, indifferently well apparalled, with a very beautifull young gentlewoman following him, clad in a crimson taffeta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

She had her waiting maid attending on her, and hee a serving-man bearing his cloake and rapier after him, who that morning were come some three leagues from his owne house to take the fresh aire in that pleasant and delitious grove, without the hedge whereof hee had left his coach, this countrie gentleman I say, passing by <hi>De Mora,</hi> and well and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knowing him, hee according to his dutie and the others merrits, respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully saluted him by his name, and the young gentlewoman who followed him likewise gives him a very lowe and gracefull courtesie. <hi>De Mora,</hi> surprised with the suddainesse of their arrivall, and the sweetnes of these their salutations, riseth up, and having first saluted him, and kissed her, hee praies his name, who tells him that hee is a gentleman that dwelt some three leagues off, tearmed <hi>Emanuell de Cursoro: De Mora</hi> demaunds of him if this young gentlewoman bee his kinswoman or his daughter, who tells him shee is his daughter; when <hi>De Mora</hi> againe inquires of him, if she bee married or no, and what age and name shee is of, <hi>Cursoro</hi> replies that shee is unmaried of some twentie yeares of age, and her name <hi>Bellinda. De Mora</hi> againe tells him, that hee is verie happie in having so sweet and faire a young gentlewoman to his daughter, whereat the father smileth for joy, and the daughter blusheth for bashfullnes and modestie. <hi>De mora</hi> againe questioneth <hi>Cursoro,</hi> if any busines brought him thither that morning, who tells him hee had no busines, but only came thither with his daughter to take the aire, and that hee had left his coach without the hedge, so they walke together some turnes in this pleasant grove, and from thenceforth <hi>De Mora</hi> could not possibly refraine, from gadding and gazing his inamoured eyes on the roses and lilies of <hi>Bellindas</hi> sweet and delicate beautie, when <hi>De Mora</hi> acquaints <hi>Cursors</hi> with his misfortunes, how that morning hee came forth a hunting, that hee had lost his men, his hounds, and his hauke, and that this three houres hee was there left alone and had no newes of them, they together make many walkes, turnes, and returnes, when <hi>De Mora</hi> led by the lustre of <hi>Bellindas</hi> lovely atractive, and rolling eye, hee ever and anon proffereth to lead and conduct her by the arme, the which <hi>Cursoro</hi> modestly, and respectfully excuseth, as holding it too great an honour for <hi>De Mora</hi> to give, and his daughter to receive: here <hi>Cursoro</hi> proferreth <hi>De Mora</hi> to lend him his coach to carry him home to his house, but <hi>De Mora</hi> freely and thankfully refuseth it, and in counterexchange of this courtesie proferreth <hi>Cursoro</hi> and his daughter to accompany and conduct them to their coach, the which undeserved kindnes, <hi>Cursoro</hi> modestly refuseth of him. Thus (in point of honour, and courtesie) they along time stand striving and complementing, till at last <hi>De Mora</hi> heareing the crie of his hounds, his importunitie vanquisheth <hi>Cursoro's</hi> modestie, and so will, or nill, hee conducts him to his coach, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise leads his daughter <hi>Bellinda</hi> by the arme and hand, and by the way doth at least usurpe, &amp; steale many amorous kisses from the cheries of her sweet lips, and damaske roses of her pure and delicate cheekes, wherat shee is more admired

then pleased. As they are thus going towards <hi>Cursoro's</hi> coach, <hi>De Mora's</hi> hounds and servants arive all sweating and blowing, who (in redemption and requitall of their long stay) doe present their Lord and master with a brace of hares, and a wild white fawne which they had kild, whereof hee being exceeding glad, hee very joyfully bestowes the hares on <hi>Cursoro,</hi> and the white fawne on his faire daughter <hi>Bellinda,</hi> who from thenceforth, hee swears shall bee his mistris, and his love; <hi>Cursoro,</hi> is too modest, and his daughter too bashfull to accept hereof, so they along time refuse these his presents with many dilatory and complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall excuses. But at last <hi>De Mora</hi> finds out a means and medium to reconcile this difference, according to his owne will and desire; for hee peremptorily swears to <hi>Cursoro,</hi> and his daughter <hi>Bellinda,</hi> that they shall receive these poore presents from him, and that in requitall hereof, hee will to morrow come over to his house, and eat his part of them to dinner with them; upon which condition and tearms, <hi>Cursoro</hi> thankfully receives the hares, and likewise causeth his daughter to doe the same by the fawne, the which (with a verie low and observant courtesie) she doth: so he conducts them on to their coach, and by the way wrings her by her lilie white hand, plaies with the loose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Thus in a little time wee see an extraordinary alteration, yea a wonderfull change and metamorphosis in <hi>De Mora,</hi> but whether more strange or suddaine I know not, for in the morning hee went forth a free man, and now before night comes home a slave, and a captive. Heretofore hee spurned at love, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained beauty, and now the verie first sight of our faire <hi>Bellinda</hi> sets fire to his blood, and flames to his heart: so that his old blood is passionatly and amorously inflamed with this new beautie; formerly hee (in derision) tearmed <hi>Cupid,</hi> alittle boy, now hee holds him to bee a great God; then hee called <hi>Venus</hi> a whore, but now hee recants that Athiesme, and repents himselfe of that blasphemy vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited forth against her diety; and tearmes her a Celestiall and facred Goddesse: yea now in his heart and thoughts hee erects altars to the first, and consecrates all his vowes to the second. The small and streight wast of his honoured <hi>Bellinda,</hi> together with her sparkling eyes, and sweet cheekes and blushes, doe amaze his mind, act wonders in his heart, and cast his thoughts into a confusion of many amorous raptures and extasies, yea the consideration of her sweet youth, and the remembrance of her fresh and delicate beauty, doe (in his conceit) seeme to make his age young, and to give the lye to those infinite number of white haires, which time hath snowed on his head, and showred on his beard. Hee a thousand times repen's himselfe of his former errour and crime in living so long single, and is now assured and confident, that there is no earthly pleasure or heavenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, comparable to the heart-ravishing kisses and embraces of his sweet <hi>Bellin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da:</hi> hee is readie to lay downe all his lands, and life at the feet of her commands and service, and esteemes both of them too poore, for the purchasing of so inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable a jewell; whom (in his determinations and resolutions) hee hath alreadie adopted the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Hee will not consider what a poore simpathie and a palpable antipathy there is betweene such a Ianuarie and such a May, but disdaines to enter into consideration with himselfe, that hee is every way fitter for his grave than for her bed, and for death than marriage; yea hee flatters himselfe so far in his affection to her, as heehopes hee shall bee the joyfull father of many prettie children by her, so that hee is so deeply enamoured with the sweet youth of our <hi>Bellinda,</hi> and his heart so fast chained and intangled in the tresses of her haire, and the lures of her alluring beautie, that hee upon his first sight of her incessantly thinkes of her by day, dreams of her by night, and neither thinks nor dreams of any thing but of her, and of his love to her: so now he advanceth &amp; raiseth the standards of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid,</hi> as high as ever he formerly dejected them, and delights in nothing more, yea Imay truly say in nothing els, but in feasting his eyes and surfeting his heart upon the heavenly <hi>Idoea</hi> of her Angelicall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>But before I proceed further in the narration and progresse of this history, I must here unlocke and reveale a secret mystery to the reader of no small conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and importance, for he must understand, that our <hi>Bellinda</hi> is not so chaste as faire, nor so honest, as her education, youth &amp; beautie presuppose and promise her to bee; for her mother being dead, and her father giving her too much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and too little vertuous counsell and exhortation, shee for two whole yeares hath beene in love with a poore, yet with a verie proper and resolute young Gentleman of some twentie five yeares of age, being a neighbour of her fathers, named <hi>Don Fernando Palura,</hi> who being deeply enamoured of her, had laine so close, so constant and so strong a siege to her chastitie, as (not to conceale the truth) first unknowne to her father, then to <hi>De Mora,</hi> and next to all the world, hee had unparadised her of her maiden-head, and under colour and hope of marriage had verie often tane his lustfull use and pleasure of her body; but his means being verie small, and her belly not growing great, shee was not yet fully resolved, but therefore still delaied to marrie him; true it is, that her father <hi>Cursoro</hi> was formerly acquainted with <hi>Palura's</hi> affection and desire to marry his daughter, but as heretofore his poverty made him reject him for his sonne in law, so now the consideration of <hi>De Mora's</hi> great wealth and nobilitie makes him fully to disdaine him, and commands his daughter likewise to doe the same. But shee not considering the premises, and loving <hi>Palura's</hi> youth, as much as shee hated <hi>De Mora's</hi> age, shee was neverthelesse so inconstant by nature, and so proud and ambitious by sex, as she could find in her heart and resolution, rather to bee a rich Lady, than a poore Gentlewoman, and so to leave <hi>Palura</hi> to espouse and marrie <hi>De Mora:</hi> but first her crime &amp; her conscience makes her send for <hi>Palura,</hi> and seriously to consider and debate hereon with him, which they doe; so <hi>Palura</hi> perceiving by <hi>Bellindas</hi> lookes, and observing by her s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>The perusall of this letter and the affection of <hi>Palura</hi> demonstrated in this his resolution, makes <hi>Bellinda</hi> as glad, as the jealousie of her Lord and husband <hi>De Mora</hi> sorrowfull; and now seeing his rage so reasonlesse, and his malice and obstinacie so implacable towards her, she abandoneth her sighes and teares, resolves to make triall of a contrary experiment, &amp; so under a femall face assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a masculine courage and resolution, shee sleights him and his jealousie, as much as hee doth her and her levity, and beares her selfe more highly and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously towards him than ever shee did heretofore, but this animosity of <hi>Bellinda</hi> produceth not that good effect which hee expects from her husband <hi>De Mora,</hi> for hee attributing this pride of hers to proceed from some bad counsell given her by <hi>minion Palura,</hi> it doth the more inflame his jealousie, and exasperate and set fire to his indignation, both towards her and him.</p>
                     <p>Whiles <hi>Bellinda</hi> stands upon these tearms with her husband <hi>De Mora,</hi> his braines (as so many wheeles and spheares) are incessantly rolling and wheeling about the Orbe of jealousie, to find out the marrow and mystery of this lascivious league betweene his wife and <hi>Palura,</hi> in the agitation and conduction whereof, hee is as secret, as shee simple and inconsiderate, his policie is to find ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So on a munday morning, as his Lady <hi>Bellinda</hi> is gon to the parish Church to heare masse, hee purposely staies at home to effect this his secret intent and purpose, and then very privately enters her chamber, and his jealousie makes him so industrious of lock-smithes hookes, and instruments to open any locke. So hee first resolves to try and open that of her closet, which when he was on the very point to doe, casting aside his eye, hee sees the tawny Damaske gowne which his wife wore the day before, wherefore hee flies to it to search and rifle the pockets thereof for her keyes. Now <hi>Bellinda's</hi> hast and devotion to the Church was so great, as both shee and her waiting Gentlewoman, had forgotten the keyes of her closet and cabinet,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:16653:349"/>
and left them in one of the pockets of her said gowne, where her husband <hi>De Mora</hi> finds them, whereat being exceeding joyfull, hee claps up his hooks and instruments, and (with equall jealousie and haste) opens first her closet then her cabinet, wherein leaving nothing unsearched, hee at last finds the very same letter of <hi>Palura</hi> to his wife <hi>Bellinda,</hi> which wee have fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Hee reads it over againe and againe, but for that which said, I shall thinke every moment a moneth, and every houre a yeare before wee againe kisse and embrace, this line, I say, his extreme jealousie makes him to read over at least as often as it hath sillables, for this letter and this branch of this letter confirmes his jealousie, and now makes him fully assured and confident, that his wife and <hi>Palura</hi> have defiled his honour, and his bed, by committing adultery together; when vowing a sharp and speedy revenge hereof, hee (with a panting heart, and trembling hand) laies the velvet purse againe in the cabynet, then lockes it, as also her closet and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doore, having first left the keyes againe in the pocket of his Ladies gowne, and so comes downe into the Hall among his servants, as if hee were happie to know that, which it is his misery, because hee cannot be ignorant thereof.</p>
                     <p>By this time his wife the Lady <hi>Bellinda</hi> is returned from Church; hee dines with her, and yet hee cannot dissemble his discontent and malice against her so artificially, but that shee observes some distemper in his lookes, and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie in his speeches; but such is her pride, as shee is no way either curious o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Dinner being ended, as soone as she betakes her selfe to walke in the allies, and arbours of her delicate garden, her husband <hi>De Mora,</hi> and his jealous and bloody resolutions are walking a contrary way; he is so netled with jealousie, and stung to the heart with malice and revenge; as he ascends to his armoury, takes downe an excellent sword and belt, a case of pocket pistols, each whereof hee chargeth with two bullets, cals for <hi>Emmanuell de Ferallo</hi> his Ladies Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-usher, who was a very proper young man both of his person and hands, bids him to cause two of his best great sadle horses speedily to be made ready, &amp; wils him to accompany him to the towne of Arraiallos. <hi>Ferallo</hi> performes this order of his Lord, and then tels him that hee will goe into the garden, and acquaint his Lady and mistris with his absence, and to receive her commands before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, but his Lord commands him to the contrary, and neither to see or speake with her; so they take horse, and away.

                     <p>The youth and beauty of his young wife and Lady <hi>Bellinda,</hi> arming him with jealousie, and this jealousie with irreconcilable malice and revenge against <hi>Palu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> hee cruelly resolving to make his body and life pay deare for it, rides away towards his house neere Arraiallos, and staying some halfe aquarter of a league from it in a faire greene meddow, sends him man <hi>Ferallo</hi> to him, and praies him speedily to take his horse, and come speake with him there, about a busines which

A peevish custome, which the husbands of Spaine, Portugall, and Italy tirannically use towards their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whereas contrariwise the Ladies and Gentlewomen of England and France, are far more happie, because more chaste and honourable towards their husbands in using, and not abusing this their liberty and freedome.</p>

For it galles him to the heart, first to remember her dishonour, and

dishonesty with <hi>Palura,</hi> &amp; now far more to know that she is doubly guilty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with her owne domesticke servant and Gentleman-usher <hi>Ferallo;</hi> wherefore he againe restraines her of her liberty, and his jealousie so far exceeds the bounds of judgement, and the limmits of reason, as hee will difficultly permit her to see any man, or any man to see her, but as rivers stopped doe still degorge with more violence, and overflow with more imperuositie, so <hi>Bellinda</hi> takes this new jealousie of her old husband, and this suddaine exile and banishment of <hi>Ferollo</hi> her lover and Gentleman-usher in extreme ill part, and (after shee hath wept and sighed her fill thereat, shee then beleeves the prime and originall cause therof, to proceed from the malice and jealousie of her waiting Gentlewoman <hi>Herodia:</hi> wherefore being infinitly despighted and incensed against her; shee (in her deare love and affection to <hi>Ferallo)</hi> to requite her husbands courtesie, very discourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously turnes her away, and for ever banisheth her, her house and service, and to write the truth, <hi>Ferallo</hi> likewise inhatred &amp; malice to <hi>Herodia,</hi> will from thence forth neither see nor speake with her more. But to verifie the English proverb, that love will creepe where it cannot goe, although <hi>De Mora</hi> banisheth <hi>Ferallo</hi> from his house; and restraineth his Lady <hi>Bellinda</hi> of her liberty in his house, yet sometimes by day &amp; many times by night, they (by the assistance of some secret agents or Ambassadours of love) doe in the arbours of the gardens, and in some other out romes of the house very amorously meet, and most lasciviously kisse and embrace together. They hold many private conferences on their unlawfull affections, and many secret consultations upon their unjust discontents: so at last both of them joining in one wicked heart and mind, and (as matters are still best distinguished by their contraries) finding each others company sweet, and their sequestration and seperation bitter, they so much forget their selves and their soules, and so much fly from heaven and God, to follow <hi>Sathan</hi> and hell, as both of them beleeve and resolve, they can have no true or perfect content on earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>De Mora</hi> be first sent to heaven; now, upon this bloody designe they agree, and upon this hellish plot they fully resolve, only the gordian knot which must combine and linke fast this foule busines is, that <hi>De Mora</hi> being dead, <hi>Bellinda</hi> must shortly after marry her Gentleman-usher <hi>Ferallo,</hi> whereunto with as much joy as vanity shee cheerfully consenteth, when they are so prophane as they seale this their ungodly contract with many oathes, and ratifie and confirme it with a world of kisses, and then of all violent deaths, they resolve on that drugge of the devill, poyson, so without either the feare or grace of God, they of Christians me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphose and make themselves devils, and <hi>Ferallo</hi> buying the poyson, <hi>Bellinda</hi> very secretly and subtilly in diet drink and broath admmistereth it unto her Lord and husband <hi>De Mora,</hi> which being of a languishing vertue and oppera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee within lesse then foure moneths dies thereof; when with much cost and a wonderfull exteriour shew of griefe and sorrow, shee gives him a stately funerall, every answerable to the lustre of his name, and the quality of his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and hono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

new wife <hi>Bellinda,</hi> and although they are unequall in birth and ranke, yet mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage having now made them equall, they mutually kisse and imbrace with as much content as desire; but at the end of this small parcell of time; satiety of his uxorious delights and pleasures makes him neglectfull, and which is worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible thereof, (a base ingratitude, but to often subject to men of his inferiour ranke and quality, and which the indiscretion of Ladies of honour, very often paies deare for, as buying it many times with infamy but still which repentance) so that for ten nights, and sometimes for fifteene together hee never kissed or imbraced her; which unkind ungratitude of his, and respectlesse unvaluation of her youth and beauty, as also of her ranke &amp; meanes makes the Lady <hi>Bellinda</hi> his wife to be as hot in choler towards him, as he is cold in affection &amp; love towards her. But to ascend to the head-spring of this his discourtesie towards her, and so to fetch and derive it from its owne proper originall, wee must know that <hi>Ferallo</hi> was so vitious, inconstant, and base, as now hee is deeply in love with a new waiting Gentlewoman of his Ladies named <hi>Christalina,</hi> a sweet young maiden, of some eighteene yeares of age, tall of stature and slender of body, and whose beauty was every way as cleere and pure as her name, and yet whose maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head (with a few rich presents and many poore flattering oaths and false promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) hee had secretly purchased and gotten from her; yea his affection was so fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent to her, that part of the day could not content his lustfull desires, but hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets himselfe so far, as before his Ladies nose, and almost in her sight, hee must lye with her whole nights, and which is worse, almost every night without so much as once thinking of his owne wife the Lady <hi>Bellinda,</hi> or either loving what shee cared for, or caring for what shee loved.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Bellinda</hi> esteemes her selfe too good a Gentlewoman, and too great a Lady to be thus outbraved and disgraced, by a Taylors sonne, (for so was <hi>Ferallo)</hi> and therefore consequently her heart is too well lodged, and too high fixed and seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the degree of her high discent thus to receive &amp; suffer an affront, by a man of so low a beginning &amp; so ignoble a quality and extraction as he was, and whom she had raised from nothing, and conferred and honoured him with her affection, and bed, and of her servant made him her husband; when for the space of six moneths together having continually used the best of her art, and the chiefest of her power, her sweetest perswasions, and her most sugred prayers and solicitations to make him abandon her maid <hi>Christalina,</hi> and so againe to reclaime him and his affection from her to her selfe; but seeing all her care vaine, and her prayers and intreaties towards him to prove frivoulous, shee at last (consulting with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and not with God) begins to assume bad thoughts and revengefull malice against him, for this hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> foule disloyalty, and base ingratitude and infidelity towards her: but first before shee attempts it, her turbulent and restlesse jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, makes her resolve to trie another conclusion, which is to put off this her waiting Gentlewoman <hi>Christalina</hi> from her service and attendance, in hope that <hi>Ferallo</hi> her husband would then thereby likewise put off himselfe and his affection from her, but this project and resolution of hers reapes no succesfull issue according to her desires, but receives end, as soone as beginning. For hee is still so deeply enamoured and so constantly affected to <hi>Christalina,</hi> as hee will neither permit nor suffer it, but in despite of his Lady <hi>Bellinda,</hi> and of all her sighes, teares, and prayers to the contrary, hee kisseth her in her sight, and (custome now making him licenciously bold and impudent) hee in this his sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish familiarity with her, sets her at table with himselfe and his wife; and in her presence, and before her face, tearms her his deare, his love, &amp; his sweet-heart: a
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:16653:352"/>
disgrace of so unkind a nature, and discourteous a quality, as she highly disdaines long to suffer or digest it at his hands. So that seeing no hope of amendment, and therefore dispairing of any reformation thereof in him, shee resumes her former bad and bloody thoughts against him, and so peremptorily and definitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to murther him. Her jealousie makes her thus malicious, her malice thus revengefull, and her revenge thus bloody hearted and handed towards him. She cannot be content to pace, but shee will ride poast to her confusion by heapeing crime upon crime, and murther to murther; shee hath formerly poysoned her first husband <hi>De Mora,</hi> and now shee resolves to poinyeard to death <hi>Ferallo</hi> her second, as if one of these two blood sinnes and crimes were not enough capable, to make her as truly miserable, as she falsly thinkes her selfe happie, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance and execution thereof. But these are the bitter fruits of jealousie and the sharp effects of choler, malice, and revenge which most commonly streame and proceed from it,</p>
                     <p>Whiles thus her quondam Gentleman-usher, &amp; now her unkind and disloyall husband <hi>Ferallo</hi> (without feare or care) is wallowing in his beastly pleasures and sensuality with his strumpet <hi>Christalina,</hi> this his ungodly wife, and revengefull Lady <hi>Bellinda</hi> (with as much secresie as treachery) is in requitall thereof prepare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him a bloody banquet; yea so hastie is shee in her rage, and so outragious in this her revenge towards him, as shee will no longer bee abused or defrauded by him, but thinks every houre an age, before she have dispatched him for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. She will no more bee controuled and over mastred by him who was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly her servant, and who first reputed it his greatest happines to kisse her hand, before shee vouchsafed him the honour to kisse her lips, or which is more, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity to imbrace her in her bed. She now sees with griefe, that hee hath betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in betraying, and conveying his affection from her to her maid <hi>Christalina,</hi> and therefore although shee hath cast away her favours on him, yet of the two, shee vowes rather to cast away him than her selfe. No grace, no religion, not her conscience, not her soule, nor the consideration of heaven or hell can disswade or keepe her from this her bloody purpose, or divert her from the perpetration of this inhumane and cruell murther: but the very first night that he leaves her maid <hi>Christalina,</hi> and lies with her selfe, she (being purposely provided of a very sharp and keene razor, which she put in one of her gloves, and clapt it under her pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) at breake of day as hee lay in bed soundly sleeping and snoring by her, she as a devill incarnate cuts his throat, and leaves him struggling in the bed, and weltering in his blood, without once having the power to think, to speake of God.</p>
                     <p>Thus wee have seene the bloody malice, and infernall fury and revenge of this execrable young Lady <hi>Bellinda,</hi> in so lamentable and cruelly murthering her first and old husband <hi>De Mora,</hi> and now her young one <hi>Ferallo,</hi> and because the prepetration of these her inhumane crimes and facts are so odious to God, that their knowledge hath already pierced the clouds, and their sight ascended to the sacred presence and tribunall of God, therefore his all-seeing, and all-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent glorious Majestie, being as impartiall in his judgements, as divine in his decrees, hath already sharpned his sword of justice, and made ready his arrowes of revenge, speedily to inflict and give her condigne punishment for the fame, yea and far sooner than either shee thinks or dreames thereof.</p>

She is not a furlong off, but the more closely to finish her designe, shee there purposely sends away her maid <hi>Hellena</hi> to the parish-Church before her with this invented and colourable errand to seeke out her owne Priest father <hi>Sebastian,</hi> and to prepare him then to say masse to her, the which <hi>Hellena</hi> doth. Now the midway betweene her house and the Church is a great deepe pond, by the which shee is to passe; but a little before shee drawes neere it, a poore old maimed Souldiour, being cashiered from the Garison of the castle of Castcayes (named <hi>Roderigo)</hi> travelling towards his home, and seeing this Lady all alone, and observing the sweetnes of her beauty, and the richnesse of her apparell, and attire, his poverty inforceth and incourageth him to request and begge an almes of her, the which with much humility hee doth. But the Lady <hi>Bellinda's</hi> heart and thoughts, were so much surprised and taken up with cruelty, as shee knew not what belonged to charitie, and therefore having other busines and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mils in her head, shee is so offended with <hi>Roderigo's</hi> begging importunity, as flatly refusing to give him any almes, shee forgets her selfe so far, as in steed thereof, shee gives him many harsh words and at last sends him away with some unkind and foule speeches; the which poore <hi>Roderigo,</hi> tooke so ill at her hands, that (in the fumes of a Souldiour) hee once thought to have requited it either on her person, or her apparell; but then againe (by her port and bravery) deeming her to bee some great neighbouring Lady, who that morning had purposely left her followers to take the sweetnes of the aire, and therefore fearing his danger more than hee loved his profit, hee abandoneth that cholericke and insolent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of his, when taking his leave of her, hee some two buts lengths from her betakes him to sit downe at the foot of a great Pine apple tree, where he might see her, but not shee him; and there looking after her with an eye of discontent
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:16653:353"/>
and indignation, hee bewailes his wants and hard fortune, and also condemneth the obduratenesse of this unknowen Ladies uncharitable heart towards him, and inquiring afterwards of a mike-maid which passed by what shee was, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that shee is the Lady <hi>Bellinda,</hi> widdow to the dead Lord <hi>Alonso de Mora,</hi> and now wife to <hi>Don Emanuell de Ferallo,</hi> who hereat doth not a little both grieve and wonder, that so rich and great a Lady was guilty of so much unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablnes. By this time shee being arived to the pond, looking about her, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving that no mortall eye had seene her, she therein throwes her bloody smocke and razor (which as formerly I have said shee had tyed fast together with one of her blew silke gatters) and the ponderosity of the brasse weight made it instantly to sinke to the bottome, whereof shee being infinitly joyfull, away shee trip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So heare before I proceed further, let mee in the name and feare of God, request the Christian reader here to admire and wonder with mee, at the mercy and goodnes, and at the providence and pleasure of God in his miraculous detection, and condigne revenge and punishment thereof; for hee must know and understand, that it seemes God had purposely brought, placed and seated this poore old, weary maimed Souldiour <hi>Roderigo</hi> at the foot of this Pine tree, to to be a happie instrument of his praise, and a true Sentinell, and discoverer both for his sacred justice and divine honour: for here although <hi>Bellinda</hi> carried away her heart and charity from him, yet (as if guided by some heavenly power, and celestiall influence) <hi>Roderigo</hi> could not possibly carry away his eye from her, but as closely as shee threw this bloody cloth into the pond, hee espies it, and which is more, very plainely and palpably discernes the whitnes and rednes thereof; when considering and thinking with himselfe that this gallant proud Lady <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi> might bee as unchaste and lascivious as shee was faire, and as vitious as she was young; God (with his immediate finger) imprinted in his thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved in his heart and mind, that either her selfe, or some one of her waiting Gentlewomen had had some bastard, and that shee had murthered it, and now throwen it into the pond, and was so strongly possessed of this conceit and beleife, that neither day, or night, nor nothing under heaven could possibly beate him from it, but for a whiles hee resolves to conceale this conceit to himselfe, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the truth thereof to time, and the issue to God.</p>

returne and report to their Lady <hi>Bellinda,</hi> who seeming exceedingly to doubt and grieve thereat, shee (far more perplexed in countenance than heart) ascends with them againe to her husbands chamber, where they all call and knock aloud at the doore to him, and shee far louder than them all, but in vaine, for still they heare no newes either of him or from him, whereat shee begins (outwardly) to tremble with apprehension and feare, and so commands them to force open the doore of his chamber, which they instantly doe, where they see their Lord, and shee her husband <hi>Ferallo</hi> to lie breathlesse in his bed, all begored and reeking in his hot and warme blood, with his throat cut, whereat his servants for true griefe, and his Lady <hi>Bellinda</hi> for false sorrow, make a lamentable crie, and a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full out-cry in his chamber which is over heard in all the house, but especially the Lady <hi>Bellinda</hi> her selfe, who so artificially dissembleth her joy, and so passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes demonstration of extreme griefe and affliction, for this deplorable death of her Lord and husband, both to her servants and to God, that shee is all in teares, and cannot because shee will not bee comforted thereat: they find the chamber doore locked, the key within side, and his owne bloody knife on his pillow and therefore they easily resolve and conclude that this their Lord and master <hi>Ferallo</hi> hath willfully made himselfe away, and is undoubtedly the author of his owne death; which opinion and resolution of the servants, their Lady and mistris <hi>Bellinda</hi> (secretly to her selfe) relisheth with much applause, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and to make her afflictions and sorrowes the more apparant to them, and in them consequently to the world, shee doth not refraine from excessive weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sighing.

                     <p>But as the justice, and judgements of God (conducted by his divine pleasure, and inscrutable providence) doth many times goe on slowly, but still soundly and surely, so wee must here againe produce and bring forth our lame old Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Roderigo</hi> to act another part on the stage and Theatre of this history.

When secretly &amp; effectually informing himselfe from others, that <hi>Don Gaspar de Mora,</hi> who was nephew, and generall heire to her first Lord and husband <hi>Don Alonso de Mora,</hi> was at great variance and bitter contention in suit of law with his aunt <hi>Bellinda</hi> about some lands, and much rich moveables and Utensils which shee unjustly detained from him, and therefore that hee would bee exceeding glad to entertaine any invention or proposition whatsoever, which might heave her out of the quiet enjoying and possession thereof, and thereby procure her utter disgrace and ruine. Hee repaires to him, and secretly (yet constantly) acqaints him; that some three weekes since, and the verie morning, that <hi>Don Ferallo</hi> was found murthered in his bed, hee saw the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Bellinda</hi> his wife to throw a white and bloody linnen cloth into the pond, which was some halfe quarter of a league from her house: wherein God and his conscience told him, shee had wrapt and drowned some bastard infant either of hers, or of one of her waiting Gentlewomans, adding withall that hee could not possibly have any peace of his thoughts before hee had imparted it to him, to the end, that hee might reveale it to the criminall judges (or Corigidores) of Stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos to hunt out and examine the truth thereof.</p>

The Corigidores, <hi>Gaspar De Mora,</hi> and all the rest, are amazed and astonished at the sight of these bloody evidences: when <hi>Roderigo</hi> againe constantly swearing to them, that hee saw the Lady <hi>Bellinda</hi> (with her owne hands) throw this little linnen fardell into that pond, the verie same morning that her husband <hi>Don Ferallo</hi> was found murthered in his bed; and the malitious curiosity of <hi>Gaspar De Mora</hi> here finding the very two first and last let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of her name in the cambricke smocke; the Corigidores then concurre in one opinion (as so many lines which terminate in one Centre) that yet infalibly it was shee and no other, who had so cruelly murthered her husband <hi>Ferallo</hi> in his bed. Whereupon taking this bloody smocke, razor, and garter with them, they with much zeale and speed poast away to the Lady <hi>Bellinda's</hi> house, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend her for this her foule and lamentable murther, where cruell hearted and lascivious Lady, shee is so far from the consideration of grace, or the thought and apprehension of any feare, as shee feares none, and which is worst of all, not the power and justice of God himselfe; for shee is so immodest in her heart, so lustfull in her conversation, as (notwithstanding her blacke mourning attire and apparell) that her first husband was but lately dead, and now her second not as yet cold in his grave, yet (with great variety of musicke) shee is here now in her house singing, dancing and revelling with divers young Cavalliers, and Gallants both of the cittie &amp; country, as if she had no other care, thought or busines, but how to make choyce of a third husband, who might amorously please her lustfull eye and heart, and of no lesse than a paire of Paramours and favorites who should lasciviously content her wanton desires and affections.</p>
                     <p>But these wanton vanities, and vaine and lascivious hopes of the Lady <hi>Bellin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> will now deceive her: for now the Lords appointed due time is come, wherein for these her two horrible murthers committed on the persons of her two hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, his divine &amp; sacred Majestie is resolved to powre downe his punishments, and to thunder forth his judgements upon her, to her utter shame and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

When as soone as their clamorous sobs and speeches were past, and blowen over, and that both the Frier and Nun had tane their last leave of her, then (after she had shed many teares on earth, and sent and evaporated many sighes to heaven) shee wringing her hands (whereon shee had a paire of snow white gloves) and casting up her eyes towards God, at last with a faltring, and fainting voice spake thus.</p>
                     <p>It is my crime and your charity good people, which hath conducted you hither to see mee a miserable Gentlewoman here to dye miserably. And because it is now no longer time for me, to dissemble either with God or the world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to save my soule in heaven, though my body perish here in earth, I (with much griefe, and infinite sorrow) doe truly and freely confesse both to God and you, that I am not only guilty of one murther, but of two: for as I now lately cut my second husband <hi>Ferallo's</hi> throat, so I was so vild &amp; wretched heretofore, as to poyson my first Lord and husband <hi>De Mora.</hi> At which report and confession of this execrable Lady <hi>Bellinda</hi> (in regard of the greatnes of her Lord <hi>De Mora's</hi> descent &amp; Nobility) all this huge concourse of people (who are sensibly touched with griefe and sorrow) make a wonderfull noise and out-cry thereat, and now in regard of this soule and double crime of hers, they looke on her with far more contempt, and far lesse pittie than before. But shee being as patient as they are clamorous hereat, and seeing their cries, now againe cried downe, and wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I well know, and indeed I heartily grieve to remember, that these two foule and cruell murthers of mine, make mee unworthy either to tread on the face of earth, or to looke up to that of heaven, and yet in the middest of these my miseries I have this consolation left mee, that in favour of my true confession, and religious repentance thereof to God, that God can bee as indulgent and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to mee, as I have beene impious and sinfull to him; the which that I may obtaine, I beseech you all who are here present, to joyne your prayers with mee, and to God for mee, and this is the last charity which I will begge and implore of you. Now because example is powerfull, &amp; no example so strong and prevalent, as the words of the dying to the living, therefore (to Gods glory, and mine owne shame) give mee leave to tell you that two things especially brought and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced mee to commit these foule <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The neglect of the first proved the bane of my soule, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance and practice of the last, the contagion and poyson of my life, and both these two sins conjoined and lincked together, enforce mee now here to dye, with as much misery and infamie, as without them I m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
