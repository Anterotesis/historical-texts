            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Peace of God</hi> which passeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
See how God himselfe estimates
his word and truth, <hi>Psal. 138. 2. Thou
hast magnified thy word above all thy
Name.</hi> Whatsoever God is knowne by
besides his <hi>word,</hi> is heneath his <hi>word.</hi>
Take the whole Creation which is <hi>Gods
Name</hi> in the greatest letters, it's nothing
to his word and truth. Therefore Christ
tells the Pharisees, it is easier for heaven
and earth to passe, then one tittle of the
<pb facs="tcp:98772:5"/>
Law to faile. If the least <hi>Jod</hi> or <hi>Tittle</hi>
of the <hi>Law,</hi> be prized by God above all
the world, let us take heed of undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great and glorious Truths of the
<hi>Gospell,</hi> and settle it as a Law upon our
hearts, that wee can never overprize or
yeeld sufficient praise for any truth.</p>
            <p>Men can praise God for the blessings of
the field, the seas, the wombe, and of their
shops; but where is the man that praises
God for this blessing of blessings, for
<hi>Truth,</hi> for good <hi>Bookes,</hi> and heavenly
Treatises. Men seldome purposely lift up
their hearts &amp; voices to heaven to praise
God for the riches of knowledge bestowed
upon them. In good Bookes you have mans
labour, and Gods truths. The tribute of
thankes is due for both, that God inables
men to so great labours, and that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes
such precious treasure through ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
vessels. <hi>David</hi> thought it his duty
to praise God for <hi>Truth, Psal.</hi> 143. 2.
and hath left it upon record for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
He saw such excellency, and found
so much sweet gaine by <hi>Truth,</hi> that hee
must breake out into praises for it.</p>
            <p>Reader, give over thy old wont of sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:98772:5"/>
and censuring mens labors. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hath long since told thee, that no good
comes that way. Now learne to turne thy

God for Truths dispensed by his faithfull

Peace may faile thee, but let not Truth.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He knowledge of Divinity is
necessary for all sorts of men,
both to settle and establish the
good, and to convert and fetch
in the bad. Gods principles
pull downe Satans false Principles set up in
mens heads, loved and beleeved with mens
hearts, and defended by their Tongues;
whilest strong holds remaine unshaken, the
Lord JESVS is kept off from conquering of
the soule.</p>
            <p>Now Spirituall Truths are either such, as
tend to enlarge the understanding, or such
as may worke chiefly upon the affections.
I passe by (in this knowing age) the first of
these, and (being among a people whose
hearts are hard enough) I being with the
latter sort: For the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> although

had a severall God. Some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
the <hi>Sunne,</hi> some the <hi>Moone,</hi>
called by <hi>Ezechiel, the Queene of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
which some made Cakes unto:
Some <hi>the whole Heavens,</hi> as some
worshipped the <hi>Fire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plin. lib. 1. Nat. Hist.</note> some the bruit

                     </gap>l,</hi> some <hi>Moloch.</hi> The
Romans (saith <hi>Varro</hi>) had 6000 gods:
who imprisoning the life of nature,
<hi>were given up to sinnes against nature,</hi>
either to worship <hi>Idolls</hi> of mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note>
as the ignorant: or <hi>GOD
and Angels</hi> in those Idols, as the
learned did: but these are all false
Gods.</p>
               <p>I am now to prove that <hi>there is one
true God,</hi> the being of beings, or the first
being. Although the proving of this
point seemes needlesse, because every
man runs with the cry, and saith <hi>there
is a God;</hi> yet few throughly beleeve
this point. Many of the children of
God, who are best able to know mens
hearts, because they <hi>onely</hi> study their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98772:11"/>
hearts, feele this temptation, <hi>Is there a
God?</hi> bitterly assaulting them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.
The Devill will sometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine,
and seeke to blow up the
strongest walls and bulwarks. The
light of nature indeed shewes, that
there <hi>is</hi> a God; but how many are
there, that, by foule sinnes against their
conscience, blow out and extinguish
almost all the light of Nature? and
hence though they dare not conclude,
because they have some light, though
dimme; yet if they saw their heart,
they might see it secretly suspect, and
question <hi>whether there bee a God:</hi> but
grant that none questions this truth,
yet we that are builders, must not fall
to a worke, without our maine props
and pillars: It may appeare there
fore that there is a God, from these
grounds.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Groundes to prove a God.</note> 
                  <hi>From the works of God, Rom. 1.
20.</hi> when wee see a stately house, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we see not the man that built <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
it, although also we know not the time
when it was built, yet wil we conclude,
thus, Surely some wise Artificer hath
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98772:12"/>
beene working here: can wee when
we behold the stately theater of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, conclude other, but that
the finger, armes, and wisedome of
God hath beene here, although we see
not him that is invisible, and although
we know not the time when he began
to build. Every creature in heaven
and earth is a loud preacher of this
Truth: who set those candles, those
torches of heaven on the Table? who
hung out those lanthornes in heaven
to enlighten a darke world? who can
make the stature of a man, but one wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
than the stone out of which it
is hewne? could any frame a man, but
one wiser and greater than man? who
taught the bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds to build their neasts,
and the bees to set up and order their
common-wealth? who sends the Sun
post from one end of heaven to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
carrying so many thousand bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
to so many thousands of people
and Kingdomes? what power of man
or Angels can make the least pile of
grasse, or put life into the least fly,
if once dead? There is therefore a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98772:12"/>
power above all created power, which
is <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Word of God,</hi>
There is such a Majesty st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ing, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
such secrets revealed in the word, that
if men will not be wilfully blind, they
cannot but cry out, <hi>the voice of God, and
not the voice of man.</hi> Hence <hi>Calvin</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
to prove the Scripture to bee
the word of God, by reason, against
all Atheists under heaven. Hast thou
not thought sometimes at a sermon,
the Minister hath spoken to none but
thee, and that some or other hath told
the Minister what thou hast said, what
thou hast done, what thou hast
thought? now that word which tells
thee the thoughts of thy heart, can be
nothing else but the word of an alsee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God that searcheth the heart.</p>
               <p>Againe, that word which quickneth
the dead is certainely Gods word, but
the word of God ordinarily preached
<hi>quickneth the dead;</hi> it maketh the blind
to see, the dumbe to speake, the deafe
to heare, the lame to walke, those that
never felt their sinnes to loade them,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98772:13"/>
to mourn, those that never could pray
to breath out unutterable grones and
sighes for their sinnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>From the Children begotten
of God:</hi> For wee may reade in mens
foreheads, as soone as ever they are
borne, the sentence of death; and we
may see by mens lives what hellish
hearts they have. Now there is a time
that some of this monstrous broode
of men, are quite changed and made
all new; they have new mindes, new
opinions,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> new desires, new joyes, new
sorrowes, new speeches, new prayers,
new lives: and such a difference there
is betwixt these and others, that they
are hated by others, who loved them
well while they loved their sinnes:
and whence came this strange change?
Is it from themselves? No; For they
hated this new life, and these new
men once themselves. Is it because
they would be credited thereby? no,
It is to be hated of Father, Mother,
Friends, and maligned every where.
Is it out of simplicity, or are their
braines growne crazie? they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98772:13"/>
once fooles, and I can prove
them all to bee <hi>Solomons fooles:</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
even simple men have beene known to
be more wise for the world, after they
have beene made new. But lastly, is it
now from a slavish feare of hell, which
workes this alteration? Nothing
lesse; they abhorre to live like slaves
in Bridewell, to do all for feare of the
whip.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>From Gods Register or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
which is in every man; I meane the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Conscience of man;</hi> which telleth them
there is a GOD: and although they
silence it sometimes, yet in thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
or great plague, as <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> or
at the day of Death, then they are
neere Gods Tribunall, when they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him clearely. The feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
terrors of Conscience prove this,
which like a Bayliffe arrests men for
their debts; <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is some Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
to set it on; sometimes like a
hangman it torments men, <hi>ergo,</hi> there
is some strange Iudge that gave it that
command: whence arise these dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
terrors in men? of <hi>themselves?</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98772:14"/>
No surely, all desire to be in peace, and
so to live and sleepe in a whole skin:
Comes it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Melancholy?</hi> no, for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
comes on by degrees: these
terrors of conscience surprise the soule
sodainely at a sermon, sodainely after
the commission of some secret foule
sinne. Againe, Melancholy sadnesse
may be cured by Physicke; but many
Physitians have given such men over
to other Physitians. Melancholy sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
may bee borne, but a wounded
Spirit who can beare? Thus you see
that <hi>there is a God.</hi> But, <hi>who ever
saw God,</hi> that every one is bold to
affirme that there is a God? Indeed
his face never was seene by mortall
man, but his back-parts have beene

Christ was then an horrible lyer, and

As God saw himselfe, and beheld his

               <p>

through which Holinesse like a

was Gods Image; by means of which
(as it is said in the description) hee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98772:32"/>
plesed GOD; similitude being the
ground of love: and hence God did
most dearely love him, and highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him to be Lord over all creatures;
hence no evill could hurt him; here
was no sorrow, no sicknesse, no teares,
no feares, no death, no hell, nor ever

to us and accounted ours; for <hi>Adam</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
our Stocke or Patrimony to
keepe it for us, and to convey it to us.
Hence hee proving Banquerupt, wee
lost it. But we had it in his hands, as an

him, though he never receive one pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

               <p>Here see the horrible nature of Sin,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note>
that pluckes man downe by the eares
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98772:33"/>
from his Throne, from his Perfection,
though never so great. <hi>Adam</hi> might
have pleaded for himselfe, and have
said: Although I have sinned, yet it is
but one, and the first fault. Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I am thy first borne: Oh pitie my

if thou forgivest not. Yet see,
one sinne weighs him downe, and all
his posterity (as wee shall heare) into
eternall ruine.</p>
               <p>Hence learne,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> how justly God may
require perfect Obedience to all the
Law, of every man, and curse him if he
cannot performe it: because man was
at first made in such a glorious estate,
wherein hee had power given him to
please God perfectly: God may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
require this debt of perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
Now man is broke and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
in Hell must he lie for ever, if hee
cannot pay justice every farthing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God trusted him with a stocke,
which if hee had well improved, hee
might have payd all.</p>
               <p>See what cause every man hath to

fallen into. For beggars children to

as for a great Princes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to become such. One never in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

doth, that was once in favour, but
now cast out. Man is now rejected of
God, that was beloved of God: he is
now a runagate up and down the earth,
that was once a Prince, and Lord of all
the world. This is one aggravation of
the damneds sorrowes; oh the hopes,
the meanes, the mercies that once I
had! Can these, doe these lament for
the losse of their bare hopes and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>

have men that cannot, doe not, that
will not lament the losse of such <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall</hi>
high favours, now gone, which
once they had. It is said, that those
that saw the glory of the first Temple,
wept when they saw the glory of the

Oh thinke of the Temple burnt, the

LORD, what times are wee
fallen into now. The Image of <hi>GOD,</hi>
which was once mens glory, is now
their shame; and sinne, which is mens
shame, is now their glory. The world
hath raised up many false reports of
holy courses, calling it folly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisenesse,
pride, hypocrisie, and that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98772:34"/>
whatsoever shews men may make they
are as bad as the worst, if their sinnes
were writ in their foreheads. Hence it
commeth to passe that many a man,
who is almost perswaded to bee <hi>a new
man</hi> and to turn over a new lease, dares
not, will not, for shame of the world,
enter upon religious courses. What
will they think of me then (saith he?)
men are ashamed to refuse to drinke
healths, &amp; hence maintain them lawful.
Our gallants are asham'd to stay a mile
behind the fashion: hence they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
open and naked breasts and strang
apparell as things comely; O time-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers!
that have some <hi>conscience</hi> to desire
to be honest and to be reputed so, yet
conforme themselves to all <hi>companies;</hi>
if they heare others sweare, they are
ashamed to reprove them; they are
ashamed to enter the lists of holy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in bad company, and they will
pretend discretion, and wee must not
cast pearles before swine; but the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the businesse is, they are asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to bee holy. O fearefull! Is it a
shame to bee like God? O sinnefull

                  </gap>hes. It's a credit to be any thing
but Religious, and with <hi>many</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is a shame. I wonder with what
face thou darest pray, or with what
looke thou wilt behold the Lord of
glory at the last day, who art ashamed
of him now, that will be admired of
all men, Angels and devils then? Dost
thou looke for wages from Christ, that
art ashamed to own Christ, or to weare
his livery?</p>
               <p>2. It reproves them that hate holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which is more than to bee asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of it.</p>
               <p>3. It reproves them that content
themselves with a certaine measure
of holinesse. Perfect holinesse was
ADAMS Image whereby he pleased
<hi>God,</hi> and shall a little holinesse content
thee?<note place="margin">Men that content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure of holinesse and go no further.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now there are these three sorts of
them.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Formalist,</hi> who contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with some holinesse, as much as
will credit him.</p>
               <p>The forme and name of Religion is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>honos,</hi> honour sometimes; but the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98772:35"/>
power and practice of it, is <hi>onus,</hi> a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
hence men take up the first, and
shake off the second. And indeed
the greatest part take up this course, if
they have no goodnesse, they should
bee the shame, scorne, and table-talke
of the times; therefore every man
will for his honours sake, have his
<hi>forme.</hi> Now this forme is according
to the mould wherein hee is cast: if
his acquaintance bee but civill, hee
will be like them; if they be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act,
as <hi>to pray, reade, conferre,</hi> he will
not stay one inch behinde them. If
to bee better than his companions, to
beare the bell before them will credit
him, hee will be so what ever it cost
him; but yet he never will be so exact
in his course as to bee hated for it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
hee perceives the hatred hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
from some men shall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
with the more love and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
by other men. He disguiseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
according to the places, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
hee comes into. King <hi>Ioash</hi> was
a good man so long as <hi>Iehoiada</hi> the
Priest lived. If a little Religion will
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98772:36"/>
serve to credit men, that shall serve for
that time, if more in another place, you
shal then have them commending good
men, good sermons, good bookes, and
drop forth 2. or 3. good sentences;
what will they think of him then? They
cover themselves over with these Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves
of common honesty to cover
their nakednesse; they baite all their
courses over with <hi>honesty,</hi> that they
may catch, for they fish only for credit.</p>
               <p>One may trap these people thus: Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them in their private houses, there
is <hi>worldlinesse, passion, loosenes,</hi> and to their
private chambers, there they ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neglect or shuffle over duties to their
private vaine thoughts. In this Tyring
house you shall then see these <hi>stage play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
their shop-windowes are shut, here
no honesty is to be seene scarce, because
their gaine, their respect comes not in
at this door where none beholds them:
Let either Minister or any faithfull
friend search, try, discover, accuse and
condemne these men, as rotten (though
gilded) posts, as unsound, hollow-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
wretches, their hearts will swell
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98772:36"/>
like toads, and hisse like snakes, and bark
like dogs against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that thus censure
them, because they rob them of their
God they served, their gaine is gone.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The guilty selfe condemned sinner,</hi>
that goes further than the Formalist,
and contents himselfe with so much
holinesse as will quit him, and hence all
the Heathen have had some Religion,
because they had some Conscience to
trouble them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> This man, if he hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in foule sinnes,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 12</note> and beginnes to be
wrackt and troubled for them, he will
then confesse and forsake those roaring
sinnes; but how? as a dogge doth his
meate, not because he hates his carrion,
but because he feares the cudgell; he
performes holy duties, not because he
will use them, but because hee must
use them, there is no quiet else. If
Conscience be still, he omits duties: if
Conscience cry and stirre, he falls to
duties; and so hath his good moode
as conscience hath his sits. They boast
and crow over hypocrites, because the
holinesse they have is not a bare shew;
No, but it is to stop thy conscience,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98772:37"/>
and only to quiet the clamors of that.
Thou dost bribe, and so quiet (the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe,)
thy conscience, by thy <hi>praying,
hearing,</hi> and <hi>sorrowing,</hi> but <hi>GOD</hi> thy
Judge hath heavie things to lay to thy
charge, before whom thou shalt shortly
with dread appeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> 3. <hi>The pinching devont hypocrite,</hi> that
being pursued with the feare of Hell,
goes further, and labours for just so
much holinesse as will save him onely,
and carry him to heaven at last. Hence
the young man in the <hi>Gospell</hi> came with
that great question to Christ, which
many unsound hearts come with to
Ministers now, <hi>what he should doe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
eternall life.</hi> These people set up
such a man in their thoughts to bee a
very honest man, and one doubtlesse
that shall be saved, and hence they will
take him to bee their Copy and Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler,
and labour to doe as he doth, and
to live just as hee lives, and to hold o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
as he holds, and so hope to be
saved. They will aske very inquisitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>what is the least measure of grace,</hi> and
<hi>the least graine of faith,</hi> and the best
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98772:37"/>
Sermons are not such as humble them
most, but such as slatter them, best;
wherein they may heare how well
good desires are accepted of by <hi>God;</hi>
which if they heare to be of that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to save them, <hi>God</hi> shall bee served
<hi>only</hi> with good desires, and the Devill
<hi>in deed</hi> all their life time.</p>
               <p>Thus they pinch God; they labour
not after so much holinesse as will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
Christ, but after just so much as
will beare their charges to heaven, and
save themselves. For this is one of
the greatest differences betwixt a child
of <hi>God</hi> and an Hypocrite. In their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
the one takes up duties out of
love to Christ, to have him, and hence
he mournes daily, because Christ is no
greater gainer by him: the other o it of
love to himselfe, meerely to save his
owne soule; and hence he mournes for
his sins, because they may damne him;
Remember that place therefore, 1 <hi>Cor.
15. ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, labour to get this Image of
<hi>GOD</hi> ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wed againe.<note place="margin">Vse 6.</note> Honest men
will labour to pay their debts; this is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98772:38"/>
Gods debt. How doe men labour to
be in the fashion; better to bee out of
the world, then out of the fashion. To
be like God is heavens fashion, Angels
fashion, and it will bee in fashion one
day, when the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> shall appeare.
Then if thou hast the superscription
and Image of the devill, and not the
Image of GOD upon thee, GOD and
Christ will never own thee at that day.
Labour therefore to have <hi>Gods</hi> image
restored againe, and Satans washt out,
seeke not, as many do, to purchase such
and such a grace first: but.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">How to gaine the Image of God.</note> Labour to mortifie and subdue
that sinne, which is opposite in thine

               </p>
               <p>2. Labour, for a melting tender heart
for the least sin. Gold is then only fit to

               <p>3. Labour to see the Lord Iesus in
his glory. For as wicked men looking
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98772:38"/>
upon the evill example of great ones in
the world, that will beare them out,
grow like them in villany: so the very
beholding the glorious grace in <hi>Christ,</hi>
this great Lord of glory, transformeth
men into his Image, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17, 18.
As the Glasse set full against the sunne
receives not onely the beames, as all
other darke bodies doe, but the image
of the sunne: So the understanding
with open face beholding Christ, is
turned into the Image and likenesse of
<hi>Christ.</hi> Men now adayes looke only to
the best mens lives, and see how they
walk, and rest here; ô looke higher to
this blessed face of God in Christ, as
thine owne; As the application of the
seale to the waxe imprints the Image,
so to view the grace of Christ, as <hi>all</hi>
thine, imprints the same image strongly
on the soule. I come now to the third
Principall Head, in order, which I shall
insist upon, out of <hi>Rom. 3. 23. All have

               <p>

as a whole countrey in a Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

good will to man, than he can or could
beare to himselfe; and being wisdome

took the wisest course for the good of

feare of loosing our happy estate had

beene left to stand or fall for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
a man would ever have beene in

               <p>And again, this was the sure way to

hee was the more pressed to looke the

he feares them not.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A dead man cannot bee

Let Christ come out of Heaven and

no wrath of the Almighty, no glory of
Heaven. He heares the voyce of a man,
but he heares not the voyce of God in
a Sermon; hee savoureth not the
things of Gods Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, A dead man is senselesse, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
seeles nothing: so, cast mountaines of
sinne upon a wicked man, he feeles no

               <p>Sixtly, A dead man is a speechlesse

A naturall man may say a Prayer, or

not to see so many families without

               <p>Eightly. A dead man hath lost all
beautie: So a meere naturall man hath
lost all glorie: Hee is an ugly creature

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Lastly. Dead men want nothing but

God may let some fearefull judgement

               <p>Never tell me therefore, that God

no greater signe of Gods wrath, then

whereas thou hast lost God all thy

have lost God, and know it, and so the

they did looke to die every day.
But these times where in we live, are so

that it is a rare thing to see the man

The generall judgement is at the end

particular judgement that every man

at the end of his life, where the

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. That every man should dye the

but a Saviour of temporall reservation

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. That this space of time thus beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

this cut of time, when Death hath
dispatched them, judgement onely
remaines for them; that is, when their
doome is read, their date of repentance
is out, then their sentence of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
death is passed upon them, that
never can be recalled againe. And this
is judgement after death. Hee that

fresh to thy minde; as when the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner

secret hidden sinne in thine heart,
which thou livest in, as all unsound

thee, as soone as ever thou art dead

the knot did bind thee, where thy sin

For as soone as ever a wicked man is
dead, he is either in heaven or in hell.
Not in heaven, for no uncleane thing

There shall be a generall Iudgement

bee proved that there will be such a

               <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> Gods justice calls for it,
this world is the stage where Gods <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi>

because he feeles it, that God
is mercifull; But Gods <hi>justice</hi> is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned,
men thinke God to be all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and no justice; all honey and no
sting; now the wicked prosper in all
their waies, are never punished, but live
and die in peace, whereas the godly are
daily afficted and reviled. Therefore
because this <hi>Attribute</hi> suffers a totall

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98772:60"/>
day wherin it must shine out before all
the world in the glory of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
               <p>The second reason is from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Christ: he was accused, arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
condemned by men, therefore he
shall be the Iudge of men, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 27.
for this is an ordinary piece of Gods

to make <hi>Ioseph</hi> Ruler over all Egypt,

This is the execution of a sinner after

               <p>Now this wrath of God consists in<note place="margin">Wherein consists the wrath of God.</note> these things.</p>
               <p>1. Thy soule shall be banished from
the face and blessed sweet presence of
God and Christ, and thou shalt never
see the face of God more. It is said,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20. that <hi>they wept sore, because they
should see Pauls face no more.</hi> Oh, thou
shalt never see the face of God, Christ,
Saints, and Angels more. O heavie
doome to famish and pine away for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
without one bit of bread to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
thee, one smile of God to refresh
thee. Men that have their sores run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon them must be shut up from
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98772:65"/>
the presence of men sound and whole.
Oh, thy sinnes like plague-sores runne
on thee, therefore thou must be shut
out like a dogge from the presence of
God, and all his people, 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>

infinite fire against thee, and
tread thee under his feet, who hast by
sinne trod him and his glory under
foot all thy life. A man may devise
exquisite torments for another, and
great power, may make a little sticke
to lay on heavie strokes: but great
power stirred up to strike from great
fury and wrath, makes the stroke dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
I tell thee, all the wisedome of
God shall then be set against thee to
devise torments for thee, <hi>Mich.</hi> 1. 3.
there was never such wrath felt or

to come, 1 Thes. 1. ult.</hi> The torment
which wisedome shall devise, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
power of God shall inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee, so as there was never such
power seene in making the world, as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98772:65"/>
in holding a poore creature under the
wrath, that holds up the soule in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with one hand, and beats it with
the other, ever burning like fire against
a creature, and yet that creature never
burnt up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. Thinke not this
cruelty, it's justice; what cares God
for a vile wretch whom nothing can
make good while it lives. If wee have
been long in hewing a block, and we
can make no meet vessell of it, put it to
no good use for our selves, wee cast it
into the fire: God heweth thee by <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
sicknesse, losses,</hi> and <hi>crosses,</hi> sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<hi>death, mercies,</hi> and <hi>miseries,</hi> yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
makes thee better; what should
God doe with thee, but cast thee
hence? Oh consider of this wrath
before you feele it. I had rather have
all the world burning about mine
eares, than to have one blasting frowne
from the blessed face of an infinite and
dreadfull God. Thou canst not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the torment of a little kitchin fire
on the tip of thy finger, not one halfe
houre together: how wilt thou beare
the fury of this infinite endlesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98772:66"/>
fire in body and soule through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The never-dying worme of a
guilty conscience shall torment thee,
as if thou hadst swallowed downe a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
poysonfull snake, which shall lie
gnawing and biting thine heart for sin
past, day &amp; night. And this worm shall
torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by shewing the cause of thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
that is, that thou didst never care
for him that should have saved thee.
By shewing thee also thy sins against
the Law, by shewing thee thy sloth,
whereby thy happinesse is lost. Then
shall thy conscience gnaw to thinke, so
many nights I went to bed without
prayer, and so many dayes and houres
I spent in feasting and foolish sporting.
Oh if I had spent halfe that time now
mis-spent, in praying, in mourning, in
meditation, yonder in heaven had I
beene. By shewing thee also the means
that thou once hadst to avoid this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
such a Minister I heard once, that
told me of my particular sinnes, as if he
had been told of me: such a friend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
me once to turne over a new

leafe: I remember so many knocks God
gave at this iron heart of mine, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mercies the Lord sent, but oh no
meanes could prevaile with me. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by shewing thee how easily thou
mightest have avoided all these mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Oh, once I was almost perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be a Christian, but I suffered
my heart to grow dead, &amp; fell to loose
company, and so lost all. The Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
came unto my doore and knocked,
and if I had done that for Christ, which
I did for the Devill many a time, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
at his knocks, I had beene saved.
A thousand such bites will this worme
give at thine heart, which shall make
thee cry out, O time, time, O sermons,
sermons; O my hopes and my helpes
are now lost, that once I had to save
my lost soule.</p>
               <p>4. Thou shalt take up thy lodging <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
for ever with Devills, and they shall
be thy companions: Him thou hast
served here, with him must thou dwell
there. It scares men out of their wits
almost to see the Devill, as they think,
when they be alone; but what horrour
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98772:67"/>
shall fill thy soule when thou shalt be

thou art no neerer thy end of bearing
thy misery, then at the first comming
in; Oh I might once have had mercy
and Christ, but no hope now ever to

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. Thou shalt vomit out blaspemous
oathes &amp; curses in the face of God the

elected thee, and curse the Lord Iesus
that never shed one drop of blood to
redeeme thee, and curse God the holy

shalt lie and weepe and gnash thy teeth
in spight against God and thy selfe,
and roare and stamp and grow madde,
that there thou must lie under the curse
of God for ever. Thus I say thou shalt
lie blaspheming, with Gods wrath like
a pile of fire on thy soule burning, and
flouds, nay seas, nay more, seas of
teares (for thou shalt for ever lie wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping)
shall never quench it. And here
which way so ever thou lookest thou
shalt see matter of everlasting griefe.
Look up to heaven, &amp; there thou shalt
see (oh) that God is for ever gone.
Looke about thee, thou shalt see De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
quaking, cursing God; and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
nay millions of sinfull damned
creatures crying and roaring out with
dolefull shrikings: Oh the day that
ever I was borne. Looke within thee,
there is a guilty conscience gnawing.
Looke to time past, oh those golden
dayes of grace, and sweet seasons of
mercy are quite lost and gone. Looke
to time to come, there thou shalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

no Spirit to comfort thee, no Minister
to preach unto thee, no friend to wipe
away thy continuall teares, no Sunne

not one drop of water to coole thy

               <p>This is the misery of every naturall
man. Now doe not thou shift it from
thy selfe, and say; <hi>God is mercifull.</hi>
True, But it is <hi>to very few,</hi> as shall be
proved. Tis a thousand to one if ever
thou bee one of that small number
whom God hath picked out to escape
this wrath to come. If thou doe not
get the Lord Jesus to beare this wrath,
farewell God, Christ and Gods mercy
for ever. And I am sure that it's no
common evill which God gives to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
wicked man; if Christ had shed
seas of bloud, set thine heart at rest,

there is not one drop of it for thee, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

tell thee, Christ is so farre from saving

were here and should say, here is my

downe and mourne under the burden
of thy misery, and yet for all his spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
thy dry eyes weepe not, thy

mournes not, as to say; oh! I am a

and yet thou wilt not groane, sigh, and

these are not the blood of Christ. Nay
if all the Angels and Saints in heaven

cannot deliver thee, for they are not
the blood of Christ. Nay, God as a<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 2.</note>
Creator having made a law, will not
forgive one sinne without the blood
of Christ; Nay, Christs blood will
not doe it neither, if thou doest joyne

Christs love to thee, that he hath given

his. A Father lookes not so much at the

God the Father shall strike the Devils for

Redemption. The Devils might never
have had mercy, but thou shalt think with
anguish, and vexation, and madnesse of
heart, I might have had a Christ, he was
offered unto me; mercy wooed this stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
proud heart to yeeld. But, O Rocke
of Adamant that I was, it did not affect
me. Oh fly speedily to this Citie of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,

               <p>Away then out of your selves to the Lord
Jesus.<note place="margin">Vse 5.</note> Heaven and earth leave thee, and
have forsaken thee; now there is but one
more that can doe thee good, and deliver
thy soule from endlesse sorrow: goe to him,
and take hold on him, not with the hand

thy selfe, but with the hand of faith, and
love to him to honour him.</p>
               <p>I am well enough already,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> what tell you
me of Christ?</p>
               <p>This is the damning sinne of these times,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
when men have Christ offered unto them,
foretelling them else of wrath to come,
they say they are well; hence feeling no
judgement here, they feare no wrath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
hence being well, they feele no need
of Christ; hence till they dye, they never
seeke out for a Saviour. Men will not come
into the Arke already made for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the floud arise. The world makes so
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98772:80"/>
much of those it nurseth up, that they are
unwilling to come to heaven, when they
are called to come home.</p>
               <p>But it may be Christ hath not redeemed
me,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> nor shed his bloud for me, therefore
why should I goe to him?</p>
               <p>It may be it is true,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> may be not, yet doe
thou venture as those, <hi>Ioel 2. who knowes
but the Lord may returne?</hi> It is true, God
hath elected but few, and so the Sonne hath
shed his bloud, and dyed but for a few, yet
this is no excuse for thee, to lie downe and
say, what should I seeke out of my selfe for
succour? Thou must in this case venture
and try, as many men amongst us do now,
who hearing of one good living fallen,
twenty of them will goe and seeke for it,
although they know onely one shall have
it. Therefore say as those Lepers in <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi>
if I stay here in my sinnes, I die: if I
goe out to the Campe of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> wee
may live, wee can but die however: if I goe
out of Christ, I may get mercy, how ever
I can but dye, and it is better to dye at
Christs feete, than in thine owne puddle.
Content not your selves therefore with
your bare reformation and amending your
lives, this is but to crosse the debt in thine
owne booke, it remaineth uncancelled in
the Creditors booke still: but goe, take,
offer up this eternall sacrifice before the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98772:80"/>
eyes of God the Father, and cry guilty at
his barre, and looke for mercy from him;
sigh under thy bondage, that as <hi>Moses</hi> was
sent unto the <hi>Israelites,</hi> so may Christ be
sent into thy soule. Rest not therefore in
the sight or sense of a helplesse condition;
saying, I cannot helpe my selfe unlesse
Christ doth: sigh unto the Lord Jesus in
Heaven for succour, and admire the Lord
for ever, that when there was no helpe,
and when he might have raised out of the
stones children to praise him; yet he should
send his Sonne out of his bosome to save
thee. So much for this particular; The

Hence arise two Doctrines.<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. That the number of them that shall
be saved is very small, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 24. the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
hath his drove and <hi>swarmes</hi> that goe to
hell, as fast as bees to their hive; Christ
hath his <hi>flock,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 32.</note> and that is but <hi>a little</hi> flock;
hence Gods children are called <hi>Iewells,

in respect of the other lumber in the

pilgrims, which are very few in respect of

which they passe: hence they are called
Sonnes of God, 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 2. of the bloud roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi>
which are few in respect of common

               <p>But see the truth of this point in these
two things.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Few saved in all ages</note> Looke to all ages and times of the

were saved.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Looke to all ages, and we shall finde
but a handfull saved. Assoone as ever the
Lord began to keepe house, and there were
but two familyes in it, there was a bloudy
<hi>Cain</hi> living, and a good <hi>Abel</hi> slaine. And
as the world increased in number, so in
wickednesse, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 12. it is said, <hi>All flesh
had corrupted their wayes,</hi> and amongst so
many thousand men, not one righteous
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98772:81"/>
but <hi>Noah,</hi> and his family; and yet in the
Arke there crept in a cursed <hi>Cham.</hi>
               </p>

                     </gap>ahams</hi> posteritie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
so we see their sinne abounded.
When his posteritie was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where
one would thinke if ever men were good,
now it would appeare, being so heavily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> being by so many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
miraculously delivered by the hand of
<hi>Moses;</hi> yet most of these God was wroth
with, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12. and onely two of them,
<hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Iosua</hi> went into <hi>Canaan,</hi> a type
of Heaven. Looke into <hi>Solomons</hi> time,
what glorious times! what great professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was there then! yet after his death, <hi>ten
Tribes</hi> fell to the odious sin of Idolatry, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the command of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> their
King. Looke further into <hi>Isaiahs</hi> time,
when there were multitudes of sacrifices

but <hi>a remnant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 1. 9.</note> nay a very <hi>little</hi> remnant,
that should be saved. And looke to the
time of Christs comming in the flesh (for
I pick out the best times of all) when one
would thinke by such Sermons he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
such miracles he wrought, such a life
as he led, all the <hi>Iewes</hi> should have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

Behold <hi>an Israelise in whom there is

no guile.</hi> In the Apostles time, many indeed
were converted, but few comparatively,
and amongst the best Churches many bad:

                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18. many had a

kept their garments unspotted. And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after the Apostles time,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 28. 29. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>many grievous

in succeeding ages, <hi>Revel. 12. 9. all the earth
wondered at the whore in Scarlet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, when the light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to arise againe, he saw so many carnall
Gospellers, that he breaks out in one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
into these speeches; <q>God grant I may
never live to see those bloody dayes that are
comming upon an ungodly world.</q> 
                  <hi>Latimer</hi>
saw so much prophanenesse in his time,
that he thought verily Doomes day was
just at hand. And have not our eyes seene
in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> where scarce one man in
twenty that stood out, but fell from their
glorious profession to Popery, as fast as
leaves fall in Autumne. Who would have
thought there had lurked such hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such a shew of detesting Popery, as was
among them before. And at Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
<hi>shall he finde faith on the earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Let us looke into all places and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,<note place="margin">Few shall be saved in all places.</note> and see how few shall be saved. The
world is now split into foure parts, <hi>Europe,
Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America:</hi> and the three
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98772:82"/>
biggest parts are drowned in a deluge
of prophanenesse and superstition; they
doe not so much as professe Christ; you
may see the sentence of death writ on
these mens foreheads, <hi>Ier. 10. ult.</hi> But let
us look upó the best part of the world,
and that is <hi>Europe,</hi> how few shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
there. First, The <hi>Grecian</hi> Church,
howsoever now in these dayes, their
good Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a generall Reformation among
them, and hath done much good, yet
are they for the present, and have been
for the most part of them without the
saving meanes of knowledge. They
content themselves with their old su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions,
having little or no Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at all. And for the other parts, as
<hi>Italy, Spaine, France, Germany,</hi> for the
most part they are Popish; and see the
end of these men, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 9. And now
amongst them that carry the badge of
honesty, I will not speake what mine
eares have heard, &amp; my heart beleeves
concerning other Churches: I will
come into our owne Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which is the most flourishing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98772:83"/>
Church in the world: never had Church
such Preachers, such meanes, yet have
we not some Chappels and Churches
stand as dark lanthornes without light,<note place="margin">Few shall be saved in England.</note>
where people are led with blind, or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
or licentious Ministers,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 29.</note> and so both
fall into the ditch?</p>
               <p>Nay, even amongst them that have
the meanes of grace, but few shall be
saved. It may be sometimes amongst
ninety nine in a Parish, Christ sends a
Minister to call some <hi>one</hi> lost Sheepe,<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 24, 25.</note>
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. Three grounds were bad
where the seede was sowne, and onely
one ground good. It's a strange speech
of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his fourth Sermon to
the people of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he was
much beloved, and did much good.
<q>How many doe you thinke (saith he)
shall be saved in this Citie? It will
be an hard speech to you, but I will
speake it; though here be so many
thousands of you, yet there cannot
be found <hi>a hundred</hi> that shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and I doubt of them too; for
what villany is there among youth,
what sloth in old men?</q> and so he goes
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98772:83"/>
on: So say I, never tell me, we are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
and are Christians, and trust to
Christ; let us but separate the Goates
from the Sheepe, and exclude none,
but such as the Scripture doth, and sets
a crosse upon their dores, with, <hi>Lord
have mercy upon them,</hi> and we shall see,
onely few in the Citie shall be saved.</p>
               <p>1. Cast out all the <hi>Prophane people</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
among us, as drunkards, swearers,
whores, lyers, which the Scripture
brands for blacke sheepe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes
them in a hundred places.</p>
               <p>2. Set by all <hi>Civill men,</hi> that are but
wolves chained up, tame devills, swine
in a faire meadow, that pay all they
owe, and doe no body any harme, yet
do none any great good, that plead for
themselves and say, who can say black
is mine eye? These are righteous men,
whom Christ never came to call, for
he came not to call the righteous, but
sinners to repentance.</p>
               <p>3. Cast by all <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> that like
stage players in the sight of others, act
the parts of Kings and honest men;
when looke upon them in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>4. <hi>Formall Professors,</hi> and <hi>Carnall
Gospellers,</hi> that have a thing like <hi>faith,</hi>
and like <hi>sorrow,</hi> and like true <hi>repentance,</hi>
and like good <hi>desires,</hi> but yet they be
but pictures, they deceive others and
themselves too, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Set by these foure sorts, how few
then are to be saved, even among them
that are hatcht in the bosome of the
Church?</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> Here then is an use of <hi>incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</hi>
Be not discouraged by the
name of singularitie. What? doe you
thinke your selfe wiser than others?
and shall none be saved but such as
are so precise as Ministers prate? are
you wiser then others, that you thinke
none shall goe to heaven but your self?
I tell you, if you would be saved, you
must be singular men,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> not out of <hi>fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
but out of <hi>conscience,</hi> Act. 24. 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> here is matter of <hi>terrour</hi>
to all those that be of opinion, that few
shall be saved; and therefore when they
are convinced of the danger of sinne by
the Word, thy fly to this shelter, if I
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98772:84"/>
be damned, it will be woe to many
more besides me then; as though most
should not be damned. Oh yes, the
most of them that live in the Church
shall perish. And this made an Hermit,

yeares in a Cell in a desolate wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dernesse, with nothing but bread and
water, and yet doubted after all his
sorrow, whether he should be saved or
no. Oh, Gods wrath is heavie which
thou shalt one day beare.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> this ministreth <hi>exhortation</hi>
to all confident people, that think they
beleeve, and say, they doubt not but
to be saved, and hence doe not much
feare death, Oh, learne hence to suspect
and feare your estates, and feare it so
much, that thou canst not be quiet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
thou hast got some assurance thou
shalt be saved. When Christ told his
Disciples that one of them should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray

but if he had said, elev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

every man might feare, it may be

to and fro with many stinging feares
this way, yet there is a generation of

                  </gap> faced, bold peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that confidently thinke of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as the <hi>Iemes</hi> of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
(being so holy and strict) that if God
save but two in the world, they shall
make one.</p>
               <p>The child of God indeed is bold as
a Lion; but he hath Gods Spirit and
promise, assuring him of his eternall
welfare. But I speake of divers that
have no sound ground to prove this
point, (which they pertinaciously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend)
that they shall be saved. This
confident humour rageth most of all in
our old Professors at large, who thinke,
that's a jest indeed, that having beene
of a good beliefe so long, that they
now should be so farre behind hand, as
to begin the worke, and lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
a-new. And not onely among
these, but amongst divers sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98772:85"/>
whom the Devill never troubles,
because he is sure of them already, and
therefore cryes peace in their eares,
whose <hi>consciences</hi> never trouble them,
because <hi>that</hi> hath shut it's eyes; and
hence they sleepe, and sleeping dreame
that God is mercifull unto them, and
will be so; yet never see they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
untill they awake with the
flames of hell about their eares; and
the <hi>world</hi> troubles them not, they have
their hearts desire here, because they
are friends to it, and so enemies to God.
And <hi>Ministers</hi> never trouble them, for
they have none such as are fit for that
worke neere them; or if they have,
they can sit and sleepe in the Church,
or chuse whether they will beleeve
him. And their <hi>friends</hi> never trouble
them, because they are afraide to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
them. And <hi>God</hi> himselfe never
troubles them, because that time is to
come hereafter. This one truth well
pondered and thought on, may damp
thine heart, and make thy conscience
fly in thy face, and say, <hi>thou art the man;</hi>
it may be there are better in hell than

and if not; Lord, what will become

               <p>Wherein doth a childe of GOD,<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
(and so how may I) goe beyond these
Hypocrites that goe so farre?</p>
               <p>In three things principally.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, no unregenerate man, though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
he goe never so farre,<note place="margin">Wherein a childe of God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond an Hypocrite.</note> let him doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much, but he lives in some one
sinne or other, secret or open, little or
great. <hi>Iudas</hi> went farre, but he was
covetous. <hi>Herod</hi> went farre, but hee
loved his <hi>Herodias.</hi> Every dogge hath
his kennell, every swine hath his swill,
and every wicked man his lust, for no
unregenerate man hath fruition of
God to content him, and there is no
mans heart, but it must have some good
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent it; which good is to be found
onely in the Fountaine of all good, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98772:90"/>
that is God; or in the cisterne, and that
is in the creatures: hence a man having
lost full content in God, he seekes for,
and feeds upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> contentment in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which he makes a God to him,
and here lyes his lust or sinne, which he
must needs live in. Hence, aske those
men that goe very farre, and take their
penny for good silver, and commend
themselves for their good desires: I
say, aske them, if they have no sinne.
Yes, say they, who can live without
sinne? and so they give way to sinne,
and therefore live in sinne; Nay, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
all the duties, prayers, care, and
zeale of the best Hypocrites, are to
hide a lust; as the whore in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbes,</hi>
that wipes her mouth, and goes
to the Temple, and payes her vowes;
or to feed their lusts, as <hi>Iehu</hi> his zeale
against <hi>Baal</hi> was to get a Kingdome.
There remaines a root of bitternesse in
the best Hypocrites, which howsoever
it be lopt off sometimes by sicknesse,
or horrour of conscience, and a man
hath purposes never to commit it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
yet there it secretly lurkes, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98772:90"/>
though it seemeth to be bound and
conquered by the <hi>Word,</hi> or by <hi>prayer,</hi>
or by outward <hi>crosses,</hi> or while the
hand of God is upon a man, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
strength and power of it remains
still; and therefore when Temptations,
like strong <hi>Philistines,</hi> are upon this
man againe, he breakes all vowes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
bonds of God, and will save the
life of his sinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, no unregenerate man or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
woman ever came to be poore in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and so to be carried out of all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
unto Christ: if it were possible for
them to forsake and breake loose for
ever from all sinne, yet here they sticke
as the Scribes and Pharisees, and so
like zealous <hi>Paul</hi> before his conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they fasted, and prayed, and kept
the Sabbath, but they rested in their
legall righteousnesse, and in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of these and the like duties.
Take the best Hypoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

most strong perswasions of Gods love
to him, and aske him, why he hopes
to be saved. He will answer, <hi>I pray,
reade, heare,</hi> love <hi>good men,</hi> cry out <hi>of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98772:91"/>
the sinnes of the time.</hi> And tell him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that an Hypocrite may climbe
these staires, and goe as farre. Hee
will reply, True indeed, but they doe
not what they doe with a sound heart,
but to be seene of men. Marke now,
how these men feele a good heart in
themselves, and in all things they doe,
and therefore feele not a want of all
good, which is poverty of spirit, and
therefore here they fall short, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.
2. there were divers Hypocrites for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for the worship of God in the
Temple, but God loathes these, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
not <hi>poore in Spirit,</hi> to them onely
it is said, <hi>the Lord will looke.</hi> I have
seene many Professors very forward
for all good duties, but as ignorant of
<hi>Christ,</hi> when they are sifted, as blocks.
And if a man (as few doe) know not
Christ, he must rest in his duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knowes not Christ, to whom
he must goe and be carried if ever he
be saved. I have heard of a man that
being condemned to dye, thought to
be saved from the Gallowes, and to
save himselfe from hanging by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98772:91"/>
gift he said he had of whis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ling;
so men seeke to save themselves by
their gifts of <hi>knowledge,</hi> gifts of <hi>memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
gifts of <hi>prayer,</hi> and when they see
they must dye for their sinnes, this is
the ruine of many a soule, that though
he forsake Aegypt and his sinnes, and
flesh-pots there, and will never be so
as he hath beene, yet he never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but loseth himselfe
and his soule in a wildernesse of many
<hi>duties,</hi> and there perisheth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if any unr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

come unto Christ, he never gets into
Christ, that is, never takes up his <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
rest</hi> and lodging in any thing else
but Jesus Christ, <hi>Heb. 4 4. Iudas fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Christ</hi> for the bagge, he would
have <hi>the bagge</hi> and Christ too; <hi>The
Young man</hi> came unto Christ to be his
Disciple, but he would have <hi>Christ</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
the <hi>world</hi> too; they will not content
themselves with Christ alone, nor
with the world alone, but make their
markets out of both, like whorish
wives, that will please their husbands
and others too. Men in distresse of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98772:92"/>
conscience, if they have comfort from
Christ, they are contented; if they
have salvation from hell by Christ,
they are contented: but Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
contents them not. Thus farre an
Hypocrite goes not. So much for the
first Doctrine, observed out of the
Text. I come now to the second.</p>
               <p>Doct. 2.<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> That those that are saved,

               <p>The gate is straight, and therefore a

both the entrance is difficult, and the
progresse of salvation too. Jesus Christ
is not got with a wet finger. It is not
wishing and desiring to be saved, will
bring men to heaven; hells mouth is
full of good wishes. It is not shedding
a teare at a Sermon, or blubbering now

the <hi>forme</hi> of it, and this being easie,
men embrace it as their God, and will
rather lose their lives, than their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
thus taken up. This forme of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98772:95"/>
Religion is the easiest Religion in the
world; partly because it easeth men
of trouble of conscience, quieting that:
Thou hast sinned, saith conscience, and
God is offended; take a book and pray,
keepe thy conscience better, and bring
thy Bible with thee. Now conscience
is silent, being charmed downe with
the forme of Religion, as the devill is
driven away (as they say) with holy
water; partly also because the forme of
Religion credits a man, partly because
it is easie in it selfe, it's of a light carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
being but the shadow and picture
of the substance of Religion: as now,
what an easie matter is it, to come to
Church? They heare (at least out ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
very attentively an houre and
more, and then to turne to a proofe,
and to turne downe a leafe, here's the
forme. But now to spend saturday at
night, and all the whole Sabbath day
morning in trimming the Lampe, and
in getting oyle in the heart, to meete

power of godlinesse, and this men will
not take up: so for private <hi>prayer,</hi> what
an easie matter it is for a man to say o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a few prayers out of some devout
booke, or to repeate some old prayer
got by heart since a childe, or to have
two or three short-winded wishes for
GODS mercy in the morning and at
night; this forme is easie: but now to
prepare the heart by serious meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:98772:98"/>

and discover the first traine, whereby
men blow up themselves, which is
this: They know not their misery, nor
that fearefull accursed forlorn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> estate
wherein they lye, but thinke and say,
they shall doe as well as others; and
therefore when any friend perswadeth
them to come out of it, and shewes,
them the danger of remaining in such a
condition; what's their answer? <q>I
pray yon save your breath to coole
your broth. Every Fat shall stand
on his owne bottome; let me alone,
I hope I have a soule to save as well
as you, and shall be as carefull of it
as you shall or can be; you shall
not answer for my soule, I hope I
shall doe as well as the precisest of
you all.</q> Hence likewise, if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister

home with hearts full of out-cryes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the man, and their tongue dipt
in gall against the Sermon. God be
mercifull unto us, if all this be true;
here's harsh doctrine, enough to make a
man run out of his wits, and to drive
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98772:99"/>
me to despaire. Thus they know not
their misery, and not knowing (they
are lost and condemned Creatures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ever lasting vvrath of God)
They never <hi>seeke, pray, strive</hi> or follow
the meanes whereby they may come
out of it, and so perish in it, and never

                  </gap>lames of Hell about their eares. They

themselves; saying, <hi>I am the man,</hi> I am
<hi>now</hi> under Gods wrath, and may be
snatcht away by death <hi>every houre,</hi> and
then I am undone and lost for ever.</p>
               <p>Now there are two sorts of people
that are ignorant of this their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>First, the common sort of prophane,

I will begin with the first sort,<note place="margin">The 1. sort.</note> and
shevv you the reasons why they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant

               <p>First, Sometimes because they want <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the saving means of knowledge.<note place="margin">Reason.</note> Ther's
no faithfull Minister, no compassionate
<hi>Lot</hi> to tell them of fire and brim-stone
from heaven for their crying sinnes;
there's no <hi>Noah</hi> to forwarne them of
a floud; there's no messenger to bring

they have no pilots, poore forsaken

they have either no Minister at

if they doe shew men their misery,
they licke them whole againe with

(but I hope better things of

to consider of their misery,<note place="margin">Reason.</note> when
they have the meanes of revealing it
unto them, as <hi>Foelix, Acts</hi> 24, 25. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a man hath many a bitter pill given
him at a Sermon, but he hath no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98772:100"/>
to chew upon it. One man is taken
up with suites in Law, and another al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
eaten up with suretiship, and
carking cares how to pay his debts, and
provide for his owne; another hath a
great charge and few friends, and hee
saith the world is hard, and hence, like
a Mole, rootes in the earth, week-dayes
and Sabath-dayes; the world thus
calling them on one side, and lusts on
another, and the Devill on the other
side, they have no leisure to consider
of <hi>Death, Devill, God,</hi> nor <hi>themselves,
Hell</hi> nor <hi>Heaven.</hi> The Minister cryes
and knockes without, but there is such
a noise and lumber of tumultuous lusts
and vaine thoughts in their hearts and

               <p>Thirdly, because if they have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
they are afraid to knovv it. Hence
people cry out of Ministers, that they
damne all, and will heare them no
more, and they vvill not bee such

the reason is, they are afraid to know

makes a penny stand for a pound, a

counter, that is, <hi>I am not as other

it downe for 1000. pound, that is,

hee hath some good thing in

and over-reckons himselfe. There
are your <hi>Bristow</hi>-stones like Diamonds,

So many men are desirous to be honest

their eyes, that they are halfe bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by it, to thinke highly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
although they be but glittering
seeming jewels in a swines snout. A

or <hi>civill,</hi> a little morall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
(dung in respect of true grace)
goes a great way, and is esteemed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of, and he is as honest a man as ever
lived. A man that lookes through a
red glasse, all things appeare red; a man
looking upon himselfe through some
faire spectacles, through some one
good thing that hee hath in himselfe,
appeares faire to him. It is said, <hi>Luke
20. ult.</hi> the <hi>Pharisees devoured widowes
houses.</hi> Might not this racking of Rents
make them question their estates? No.
Why? They for pretence <hi>made long

good; they talke idly, but they live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly;
they doe ill sometimes, but
they meane well. Thus when some
good things are seene in themselves,
pride puffs them with an overweening
conceit of it, and so they cozen their
owne soules.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the understandings <hi>Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy:</hi>
whereby the minde having been
long rooted in this opinion, that <hi>I am
in a good estate,</hi> will not suffer this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
to be pluckt out of it. Now, your
old rooted, yet rotten professors, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
growne long in a good conceit of
themselves, will not beleeve that they
have beene fooles all their life-time,
and therefore now must pull downe,
and lay the foundation againe; and
hence you shall have many say of a
faithfull Minister, that doth convince
and condemne them and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
to be most woefull; vvhat? shall
such an upstart teach me? doth hee
think to make me dance after his pipe,
and to think that all my good <hi>prayers,</hi>

my <hi>faith,</hi> my <hi>charity,</hi> have beene so
long abominable and vile before God?
No silver can bribe a man to cast away
his old traditionall opinions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
whereby he cheats himselfe, till
Christs blood doe it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. And
hence the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> objected
this against Iesus Christ, that their
old Fathers worshipped in that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and therefore it was as good a
place as <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the place of Gods
true worship, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 20. Men grow
crooked and aged with good opinions
of themselves, and can seldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be set straight againe. Hence such
kinde of people though they would
faine bee taken for honest religious
Christians, yet will never suspect their
estates to be bad themselves, neither
can they endure, that any other should
search or suspect them to be yet rotten
at the heart: And are not those wares

nay concluded to be starke naught
which the seller vvill needs put upon

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98772:105"/>
we produce against the Papists
Religion to be suspected to be bad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they obtrude their opinions on
their followers to be beleeved without
any hesitation or dispute about them,
either before or after they have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them: certainly thy old <hi>faith,</hi> thy
old <hi>prayers,</hi> thy old <hi>honesty</hi> or forme of
piety are counterfeit wares, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not
ondure searching, because thou wilt
not be driven from this conceit, <hi>I am in
a good estate,</hi> I have beene so long of
this good mind and therefore will not
begin to doubt now. It's to be feared,
that such kind of people, (as I have
much observed) are either notoriously
ignorant, or have sometime or other
fallen into some horrible secret grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
sinnes, as whoredome, oppression,
or the like, the guilt of which lying
yet secretly on them, makes them fly
from the light of Gods truth, which
would find them out, quarrelling both
against it, and the Ministers that preach
it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 8. And therefore as it is with
theeves when they have any stollen
goods brought within doores, they will
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98772:105"/>
not be searched or suspected, but say,
they are as honest men as themselves
that come to search, for they feare if
they be found out, that they shall be
troubled before the judge, and may
hardly escape with their lives: so many
old Professors, when the Minister
comes to search them, they clap to the

                  </gap>,
and say they hope to be saved as well
as the best of them all. The reason is,
they are guilty, they are loath to bee
troubled and cast downe by seeing the
worst of themselves, and thinke it's
hard for them to goe to heaven, and be
saved, if they have beene in a wrong
way all their life-time. An honest
heart will cry after the best meanes,
<hi>Lord search me, Iohn</hi> 3. 20. and open
all the doores to the entertainment of
the straightest, strictest truths.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the understandings <hi>Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
or ignorance of the infinite exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctnesse,
glorious purity, and absolute
perfection of the Law of God; whence
it commeth to passe, that this burning
Lamp or bright sunne of Gods Law,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98772:106"/>
being set in their mindes, rotten
grounds of their ovvne righteousnesse,
doing some things according to the
Law of God, shines and glisters glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
in their eyes, in the darke night
time of dismall darknesse, by doing of
which they thinke they please GOD,
and their estates are very good, <hi>I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,</hi>
saith <hi>Paul, Rom. 7. 9. without
the Law,</hi> and he gives the reason of it,
because sin did but sleepe in him like
a cut-throat in an house, where all is
quiet. Before the <hi>Law</hi> came, hee saw
not that deadly secret core of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
and that litter of Rebellion that
was lurking in his heart, and therefore
thought highly of himselfe for his
owne Righteousnesse. The Gospell
is a glasse to shew men the face of
God in Christ, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. ult.</hi> The Law
is that glasse that sheweth a man his
owne face, and what hee himselfe is.
Now if this glasse be taken away, and
not set before a deformed heart, how
can a man but thinke himselfe faire?
And this is the reason why civill men,
formalists, almost every one, thinke
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98772:106"/>
better of themselves then indeed they
are, because they reckon without their
hoast, that is, they judge of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
nature, and greatnesse of their sins
by their owne bookes, by their owne
reason, they look not Gods debt-book,
Gods exact lawes over, and compare
themselves therewith; If they did, it
would amaze the stoutest heart, and
plucke downe mens plumes, and make
them say, is there any mercy so great
as to passe by such sinnes, and to put
up such wrongs, and to forgive such
sinnes and debts, one of which alone
may undoe me, much more so many?</p>

same Sermon principally speakes of
them; But they never say, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
me, I was found out through
the goodnesse of the Lord to day, and
surely the man spake unto none but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, as if some body had told him
what I have done. And hence you shall
find out many lame Christians, that
will yeeld to all the truthes delivered
in a Sermon, and commend it too, but
goe a way, and shake off all truthes
that serve to convince them. And
hence many men, when they examine
themselves in generall, whether they
have grace or no, whether they love
Christ or no, they think yes, that they
doe withall their hearts; yet, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have this grace or any other, what
ever they thinke, because they want a
reflecting light to judge of generalls
by their owne particular courses.
For, tell these men, that he that loves
another truely, will often thinke of
him, speake of him, rejoyce in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98772:107"/>
will not wrong him willingly in
the least thing: Now aske them if they
<hi>love</hi> Christ thus; If they have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
of light, they will see, where
they have one thought of Christ, they
have 1000. on other things. <hi>Rejoyce?</hi>
nay they are weary of his company in
word, in prayer. And that they doe
not onely <hi>wrong</hi> him, but make a light
matter of it, when it is done, all are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and no man can live without sin.
Like a sleepy man (fire burning in his

Thou mayest goe to the Devill and be

and doe not let the Devill and

whereby it lessens and vilifies the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

shall no doubt be one, <hi>Isay</hi> 26. 10, 11.
Men will not behold the Majesty of
God in the lives of his people; many
a man being too light, yet desirous to
goe and passe for current, weighs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with the best people, and thinkes,
what have they that J have not? what
doe they that J doe not? and if he see
they goe beyond him, he then turnes
his owne ballance with his finger, and
makes them too light, that so he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
may passe for weight.</p>
               <p>And this vilifying of them and their
grace, judging them to be of no other
mettall then other men, appeares in
three particulars.</p>
               <p>First, they raise up false reports, of
Gods people, and nourish a kennell of
evill suspitions of them: if they know
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98772:108"/>
any sin committed by them, they will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
conclude, they be <hi>all such;</hi> if they see
no offensive sinne in any of them, they
are then reputed a pack of <hi>Hypocrites:</hi>
If they are not so uncharitable (having
no grounds) they prophesy they will
<hi>hereafter</hi> be as bad as others, though
they carry a faire flourish now.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if they judge well of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
them, then they compare themselves
to them, by taking a scantling onely
by their outside, and by what they see
in them, and so, like children, seeing
stars a great way off, think them no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
nor brighter then winking candles.
They stand a far off from seeing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of a child of God, they see not the
glory of God filling that temple, they
see not the sweet influence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from heaven, and that fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
they have with their God; and
hence they judge but meanly of them,
because the out side of a Christian is
the worst part of him, and his glory
shines chiefly within.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if they see, Gods people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
doe excell them, that they have better
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98772:109"/>
lives, and better hearts, &amp; better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
yet they will not conclude that
<hi>they</hi> have no grace, because it hath not
that stamp that honest mens money
hath. But this prank they play, they
think such and such good men have a
greater measure, and a higher degree
of grace then themselves, yet they
dare be bold to thinke and say, <hi>their</hi>
hearts are as upright, though they be
not so perfect as others are; And so
vilifie the grace that shines in the best
men, by making this gold to differ
from their owne copper, not essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but gradually, and hence they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves miserably, not but
that one (<hi>starre</hi> or) sincere Christian
differs from another in glory: I speake
of those men onely, that never were
fixt in so high a sphere, as true honesty
dwells, yet falsely father this bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
that they are upright for their
measure, that they have not the like
measure of grace received as others
have.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, the understandings <hi>idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:</hi>
whereby the mind sets up, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98772:109"/>
bowes down to a false image of grace;
that is, the minde being ignorant of the
height and excellence of true grace,
takes a false scantling of it, and so ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
and fancies within it selfe, such a
measure of common grace to be true
grace, which the soule easily having
attained unto, conceives it is in the
state of grace, and so deceives it selfe
miserably, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3.</p>
               <p>And the minde comes to set up her
image thus.</p>
               <p>First, the minde is haunted and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
with troublesome feares of Hell.
<hi>Conscience</hi> tells him, hee hath sinned,
and the <hi>Law</hi> tells him he shall die, and
<hi>Death</hi> appeares and tells him, he must
shortly meere with him; And if he
be taken away in his sinnes, then comes
a black day of reckoning for all his
privie prankes, a day of bloud, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
judgement and fire, where no
creature can comfort him. Hence
saith hee, Lord, keepe my soule from
these miseries; hee hopeth it shall not
prove so evill with him, but feares it
will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:98772:110"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Hereupon hee desireth
peace and ease, and some assurance of
freedome from these evils. For it is
an Hell above ground, ever to be on
the wrack of tormenting feares.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, That he may have ease, he
will not swagger his trouble away, nor
drowne it in the bottome of the cup,
nor throw it away with his Dice, nor
play it away at Cards, but desires
some grace, (and commonly it's the
least measure of it too:) Hereupon he
desires to heare such Sermons, and
read such Bookes as may best satisfie
him concerning the least measure of
grace; for, sinne onely troubling him,
grace onely can comfort him sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
And so, <hi>Grace,</hi> which is meate
and drinke to an holy heart, is but
Physicke to this kinde of men, to
ease them of their feares and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Hereupon being ignorant of the
height of <hi>true</hi> grace, he fancieth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
such a measure of common <hi>grace</hi>
to be true grace. As, if he feeles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
ignorant of that which troubles
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98772:110"/>
him: so much knowledge will I then
get, saith he. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f some foule sinnes in
his practise trouble him, these he will
cast away, and so reformes: If omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of good duties molests him, he will
heare better, and buy some good Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-booke,
and pray oftner. And if he
be perswaded such a man is a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man, then he will strive to doe as
he doth; and now he is quieted.</p>
               <p>When he hath attained unto this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
pitch of his ovvne, now he thinkes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a young beginner, and a good one
too, so that if he dyeth, he thinkes hee
shall doe well; if he liveth, he thinkes
and hopes he shall grow better; and
vvhen he is come to his ovvne pitch,
here he sets downe his state fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
And novv, if he be prest to get
into the estate of grace, his answer is,
<hi>That is not to be done now,</hi> he thankes
God, <hi>that care is past.</hi> The truth is
(beloved) 'tis too high for him; his
owne legges could never carry him
thither, all his grace, comming by his
owne working, not by God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
power. Let a man have false
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98772:111"/>
weights, he is cheated grievously with
light gold; why? because his weights
are too light: So these men have too
light weights to judge of the weight
of true grace; therefore light, clipt,
crackt pieces cheat them. Hence you
shall have those men commend pith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
saplesse men for very honest men
as ever brake bread; why? they are
just answerable to their weights.
Hence I have not much wondered at
them, who maintaine that a man may
fall away from true grace: The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
lyeth here: They set up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
such a common worke of grace
to bee true grace; from which, no
wonder that a man may fall. Hence
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, That which is true
Grace, <hi>veritate essentiae</hi> onely, may be
lost, not that grace which is true, <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate
firmae soliditatis;</hi> which latter,
being rightly understood, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>speciall,</hi> as the other, <hi>common</hi>
grace. Hence also you shall have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Professors hearing a hundred Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
never moved to grovv better.
Hence likewise you shall see our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98772:111"/>
Preachers comfort every one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
that they see troubled in minde,
because they thinke presently, they
have true grace: Now they begin to
be sorrowfull for their sinnes. 'Tis just
according to their owne light weights.</p>
               <p>For the Lords sake take heed of this
deceit. True grace (I tell you) it's a
rare pearle, a glorious Sun clowded
from the eyes of all but them that have
it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 18. a strange admirable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
worke of God upon the soule,
vvhich no created power can produce,
as far different in the least measure of
it, from the highest degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
grace, as a Devill is from an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell;
for 'tis Christ living, breathing,
raigning, fighting, conquering in the
soule. Downe therefore with your I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll
grace, your Idoll honesty: true
Grace never aimes at a pitch, it aspires
onely to perfection, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 13.
And therefore <hi>Chrysostome</hi> calls Saint
<hi>Paul, insatiabilis Dei cultor:</hi> A gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
insatiable, devouring worshipper
of the Lord Almighty.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The Understandings <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98772:112"/>
is another cause of mans ruine.</hi>
And that is seene principally in these
five things, these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive errours or false
conceits.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, In judging some trouble of
minde, some light sorrow for sinne to
be true Repentance; and so thinking
they doe repent, hope they shall bee
saved; for sinne is like sweet poyson,
while a man is drinking it dovvne by
committing of it, thers much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in it, but <hi>after</hi> the committing of
it, there is a sting in it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 31.
32. <hi>then</hi> the time commeth when this
poyson workes, making the heart swell
vvith griefe, sorry they are at the heart,
they say, for it; and the eyes drop,
and the man that committed sin vvith
delight, <hi>now</hi> cryes out vvith griefe in
the bitternesse of his soule; <hi>O that I,
beast that I am, had never committed it,
Lord, mercy, mercy, Prov.</hi> 5. 3, 4. 11.
12. Nay, it may be they vvill fast,
and humble, and afflict their soules vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
for sinne, and now they think
they have repented, <hi>Isai.</hi> 58: 3. and
hereupon, when they heare, that all
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98772:112"/>
that sinne shall dye, they grant this is
true indeed, except a man repent, and
<hi>so</hi> they thinke <hi>they have done already.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is true, <hi>At what time soever a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
repents, the Lord will blot out his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities.</hi>
But this Repentance is not
when a man is troubled somewhat in
mind for sinne, but when he commeth
to mourne for sinne as his greatest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
as if he should see all his goods
and estate on a light fire before him;
and that not for some sinnes, but all
sinnes, little and great; and that not for
a time, for a fit and away (a Land-floud
of sorrow) but alwaies like a Spring
never dry, but ever running all a mans
life-time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In judging the striving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of conscience against sinne, to be the
striving of the flesh against the Spirit,
and hence come these speeches from
carnall blacke mouthes? <hi>The Spirit is
willing, but the flesh is weake:</hi> and
hence men thinke, they being thus
compounded of flesh and spirit, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
and in no worse estate then
the Children of God themselves: as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98772:113"/>
sometime I once spake with a man that
did verily thinke, that <hi>Pilate</hi> was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cause he was so unwilling
to crucifie Christ; which unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
did arise onely from the restraint
of conscience against the Fact. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men judge honestly, yet simply up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such a ground of themselves, they
say, they strive against their sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, but
Lord be mercifull unto them, they
say <hi>the flesh is fraile;</hi> and hence <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
gives a diverse interpretation of
the seventh Chapter of the <hi>Romans</hi>
from ordinary Divines; concerning
which, <hi>Paul</hi> speakes in the person of
an unregenerate man, because he obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
divers gracelesse persons (as hee
saith himselfe) having fallen, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
commonly into sinnes against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
to bring that chapter in their
owne defe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce and comfort, because
they did that which they allowed not,
vers. 15. and so it was not they, but
<hi>sinne</hi> that dvvelled in them.</p>
               <p>And so, many among us know, they
should be better, and strive that they
may grow better, but through the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98772:113"/>
of sin, cannot; conscience telleth
them they must not sinne, their hearts
and lusts say they must sinne; and here
forsooth is flesh and spirit: Oh no,
here is, conscience and lust onely by
the eares together. Which striving,
<hi>Herod, Balaam, Pilate,</hi> or the vilest
Reprobate in the World may have.
Such a vvarre argueth not any grace in
the heart, but rather more strength of
corruption, and more power of sinne
in the heart; as, it's no vvonder if a
horse run avvay vvhen he is loose; but
when his bit and bridle is in his mouth,
now to bee wilde, argueth he is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
untamed and subdued. Take
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eed therefore of judging your estate
to bee good, because of some back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardnesse
of your hearts to commit
some sinnes, though little sinnes; for
thy sinnes may be, and, it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
are more powerfull in <hi>thee,</hi> then
in others that have not the like strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
because <hi>they</hi> have not such
checks as thou hast to restraine thee.
Knovv therefore that the striving of
the <hi>Spirit</hi> against the <hi>Flesh,</hi> is against
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98772:114"/>
sinne, <hi>because it is sinne;</hi> as a man hates
a Toad, though he be never poisoned
by it; But the striving of thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
against sinne, is onely againe sin,
because it is a <hi>troubling,</hi> or a damning
sinne; The striving of the spirit against
the flesh, is from a deadly hatred of
sinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. But thy striving
of conscience against sinne, is onely
from a feare of the danger of sinne;
for <hi>Balaam</hi> had a mind to curse the
Israelites for his monies sake, but if
he might have had an house full of
silver and gold (which is a goodly
thing in a covetous eye) it is said, hee
durst not curse them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, In judging of the sincerity
of the heart by some good affection in
the heart. Hence many a deluded soule
reasons the case out thus with himselfe:
Either J must be a prophane man, or
an Hypocrite, or an upright man. Not
profane, I thanke God, for I am not
given to whoring, drinking, oppression,
swearing: Nor Hypocrite, for I hate
these shewes, I cannot indure to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
better without then I am within;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98772:114"/>
therefore <hi>I am upright.</hi> Why? Oh,
because mine heart is good, mine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
&amp; desires within are better then
my life without, and what ever others
judge of me, I know mine own heart, &amp;
the heart is all that God desires. And
thus they foole themselves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.
26. This is one of the greatest causes
and grounds of mistake amongst men
that thinke best of themselves: they
are not able to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the good desires and strong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
that arise from the love of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ.</p>
               <p>Selfe-love will make a man seeke
his own good and safety; hence it will
pull a man out of his bed betimes in
the morning, and call him up to pray;
it will take him and cary him into his
chamber towards evening, and there
privately make him seeke, and pray,
and tug hard for pardon, for Christ,
for mercy, <hi>Lord evermore give us of this
bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But the love of Christ makes a
man desire Christ and his honour for
<hi>himselfe,</hi> &amp; all other things for Christ.
It is true, the desires of Sonnes in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98772:115"/>
Christ by faith are accepted ever, but
the desire of servants, men that worke
onely for their wages out of Christ,
are not.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, In judging of Gods love
to them, by aiming sometimes at the
glory of God. Is this possible, that a
man should aime at Gods glory, and
yet perish?<note place="margin">2 King. 10 18.</note> Yes, and ordinary too.
A man may be liberall to the poore,
maintaine the Ministery, be forward
and stand for good things, whence he
may not doubt but that God loves
him: But here is the difference, though
a wicked man may make Gods glory
in some particular things his end, yet
he never makes it in his generall course
his utmost and last end: A subtle Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
may doe all his Masters work,
but he may take the gaine to himselfe,
or divide it betwixt his Master and
himselfe, and so may be but a Knave,
as observant as he seemes to be: So a
subtle heart, (yet a vile villanous heart)
may forsake all the world, as <hi>Iudas</hi>
did, may binde himselfe Apprentice to
all the duties God requireth outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98772:115"/>
at his hands, and so doe good works,
but what's his last end? It's that hee
might gaine respect or place, or that
Christ may have some part of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and he another. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would
give any money sometimes that he
could pray so well, know so much,
and doe as others doe, and yet his last
end is for himselfe; but <hi>how can you
beleeve, if you seeke not that glory that
comes from God,</hi> sayes Christ? there's
many seeke the honour of Christ, but
doe you seeke his honour <hi>onely;</hi> Is it
your last end, where you rest and seeke
no more but <hi>that?</hi> If thou wouldest
know whether thou makest Christs
glory thy last end, observe this Rule:</p>
               <p>If thou art more grieved for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
of thine owne honour, and for
thine owne losses, then for the losse of
Gods honour, it is an evident signe
thou lovest it not, desirest it not as thy
chiefest good, as the last end, for thy
<hi>summum bonum,</hi> and therefore doest not
seeke Gods honour, in the prime and
chiefest place. Sinne troubled <hi>Paul</hi>
more than all the plagues and miseries
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98772:116"/>
of the world: Indeed, if thy name be
dashed with disgrace, and thy will be
crossed, thy heart is grieved and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted,
but the Lord may lose his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
daily by thine owne sinnes, and
those that be round about thee, but not
a teare, not a sigh, not a groane, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
such a spectacle. As sure as the
Lord lives, thou seekest not the Lords
name, or honour, as thy greatest
good.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, In judging the power of
sinne to be but <hi>infirmitie;</hi> for if any
thing trouble an unregenerate man, and
makes him call his estate into question,
it is sinne either in the being or power
of it. Now sinne in the being ought
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, must not, make a man question his
estate, because the best have that left
in them, that will humble them, and
make them live by faith; therefore the
power of sinne onely can trouble a
man. Now if a man doe judge of this
to be onely but <hi>infirmitie,</hi> which the
best are compassed about withall; hee
cannot but lie downe securely, and
thinke himselfe well. And if this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98772:116"/>
be setled in one that lives in no
one knowne sinne, it is very difficult
to remove: for let the Minister cast
the sparkes of hell in their faces, and
denounce the terrour of God against
them, they are never stirred: why?
because they thinke, <hi>here's for you that
live in sinne,</hi> but as for themselves,
although they have sinnes, yet they
strive against them, and so cannot leave
them; for, <hi>we must have sinne as long as
we live here,</hi> they say. Now marke it,
there's no surer signe of a man under
the bloudy raigne, and dominion of
his lusts and sinnes, than this; that is,
to give way to sinne, (though never so
little and common) nor to be greatly
troubled for sinne (for they may be
a little troubled) because they cannot
overcome sinne; I deny not, but the
<hi>best</hi> doe sinne daily; yet this is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of <hi>Paul,</hi> and every child of
God, he mourneth not the lesse, but
the more for sinne; though he cannot
quite subdue them, cast them out and
overcome them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As a prisoner mournes
the more that he is bound with such
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98772:117"/>
fetters he cannot breake; so doth eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one truely sensible of his woefull
captivitie by sinne; This is the great
difference between <hi>a raging sinne</hi> a man
will part with all, and a sinne of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
a man cannot part withall; a sinne
of <hi>infirmitie</hi> is such a sinne as a man
would, but cannot part with it, and
hence he mournes the <hi>more</hi> for it. A
<hi>raging sinne</hi> is such a sinne, as a man
happily by vertue of his lashing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
would sometimes part withall,
but cannot, and hence mournes the
<hi>lesse</hi> for it, and gives way unto it. Now
for the Lords sake take heede of this
deceit; for I tell you, those sinnes you
cannot part withall, if you groane not
day and night under them, (saying; O
Lord, helpe me, for I am weary of my
selfe) and my life, will certainly undoe
you. You say, you cannot but <hi>speake
idely,</hi> and <hi>thinke vainely,</hi> and <hi>doeill,</hi> as
all doe sometimes; I tell you, those
sinnes shall be everlasting chaines to
hold you fast in the power of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

day.</p>

               <p>Secondly, in regard of the false ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
peace begot in the conscience.
Why should the Campe tremble
when Scouts are asleepe, or give a

               <p>1. By <hi>Sathan,</hi> whose kingdome shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
fall if it should be divided, and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in a combustion: hence he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98772:118"/>
for peace, <hi>Luke 11. 21. When
the strong man keepeth the palace, his
goods be in peace,</hi> that is, when Sathan
armed with abundance of shifts and
carnall reasonings possesseth mens
soules, they are at peace.</p>
               <p>Now looke as Masters give their
servants peace, even so the devill.</p>
               <p>1. By removing all things that may
trouble them: and</p>
               <p>2. By giving unto them all things
that may quiet and comfort them, as
meat, drinke, rest, lodging, &amp;c. so doth
Sathan deale with his slaves and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
               <p>First, by removing those sins which
trouble the conscience; for a man may
live in a sinne, and yet never be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for that sinne; for sinne against the
light of conscience onely troubles the
conscience; as children that are tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and playing in the dust, they are
not troubled with all the dust, nay, they
take pleasure to wallow in it; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with that (whether it be small or
great) that lights in their eyes. And
hence that young man came boasting
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98772:118"/>
to Christ, that hee had kept all the
commandements from his youth, <hi>but
went away sorrowfull,</hi> because that dust,
<hi>that sinne</hi> he lived in with delight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
fell into his eyes, and therefore
was troubled: Now marke the plot of
the Devill, when he can make a man
live, and wallow, and delight in his
sinnes, and so serve him, and yet will
not suffer him to live in any sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
conscience, whereby he should
be troubled, and so seeke to come out
of his woefull estate, <hi>he is sure this man
is his owne;</hi> and now a poore deluded
man himselfe goes up and downe, not
doubting but he shall be saved; why?
because their conscience (they thanke
God) is cleare, and they know of no
one sinne they live in, they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by themselves, that may make
them so much as suspect their estate is
bad, <hi>Matth. 9. 13. I came not to call the
righteous, but sinners to repentance,</hi> that
is, such an one as in his owne opinion,
is fish whole; every sinne being a child
of Gods sicknesse, he is never without
some kinde of sorrow: but some sins
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98772:119"/>
onely being a naturall mans sicknesse,
they being removed, he recovers out
of his former sorrow, and growes well
againe, and thinkes himselfe sound:
but, the Lord Jesus never came to save
such, therefore Satankeepes possession
of them. For the Lords sake looke to
this subtilty; many thinke themselves
in a good estate, because they know
not the particular sinne they live in,
whereas Satan may have stronger pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of such as are bound with his
invisible fetters and chaines, when
those that have their pinching bolts
on them may sooner escape.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, By giving the soule <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
to recreate it selfe in any sinfull
course, wherein the eye of conscience
may not be pricked and wounded. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
when they are put alwayes to
worke, and never can goe abroad, are
weary both of work and Master: that
Master pleaseth them, that giveth
them most liberty. To be pent up all
the day long in doing Gods worke,
<hi>watching, praying, fighting</hi> against eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sinne, this is a burden, this is too
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98772:119"/>
strict, and because that they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
it, they thinke the Lord lookes
not for it at their hands. Now Satan
gives men libertie in their sinfull cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
and this libertie begets peace, and
this peace makes them thinke well of
themselves, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. There's many
rotten professors in these dayes, that
indeed will not open their mouthes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the sincere hearted people of
God, yet they walke loosely, and take
too much liberty in their speeches, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in their thoughts, liberty in their
desires and delights, liberty in their
company, in their pastimes, and that
sometimes under a pretence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
liberty, and never trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with these needlesse controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
to what end, or in what manner
doe I use these things? whereas the
righteous man feareth alway, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
there is a snare for him in every
lawfull liberty. May not I sinne in my
<hi>mirth,</hi> in my <hi>speaking,</hi> in my <hi>sleeping?</hi>
Oh! this liberty that the Devill gives,
and the world takes, besots most men
with a foolish opinion, that all is well
with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:98772:120"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, by giving the soule good
dyet, <hi>meate</hi> and <hi>drinke</hi> enough, what
dish he likes best. Let a Master give
liberty, yet his servant is not pleased,
unlesse he hath meate and drinke and
food: so there's no wicked man under
Heaven, but as he takes too much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in the use of lawfull things, so
he feedeth his heart with some unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
secret lust, though all the time
they live in it, it may be, it is unknown
to them, <hi>Luk. 16. Dives</hi> had his dish,
his <hi>good things,</hi> and so sang himselfe a
sleepe, and bad his soule take his ease
and rest: yea observe, this dyet is poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
in it selfe, but ever commended
to the soule as wholsome, good, and
lawfull. They christen sinne with a
new name, as Popes are at their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
if he be bad, they call him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Pius,</hi> if a coward, <hi>Leo,</hi> &amp;c. So
<hi>covetousnesse</hi> is good husbandry; <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
keeping,</hi> good neighbourhood;
<hi>lying,</hi> to save their credit from crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but a handsome excuse: and hence
the soule goes peaceably on, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
he is in a good estate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:98772:120"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, by giving the soule rest
and sleepe, that is, cessation sometimes
from the act of sinne; hence they are
hardly perswaded that they live in sin,
because they cease sometimes from
the act of sinne, as no man doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
sweare, nor is he alwayes drunk,
nor alwayes angry. They think, onely
their falls in these or the like sinnes, are
slips and falls, which the best man may
have sometimes, and yet be a deare
child of God. Oh! Satan will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
set men at his worke; for if
men should alwayes have their cups in
their hands, and their queanes in their
armes; if a covetous man should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
root in the earth, and never
pray, never have good thoughts, never
keepe any Sabbath, if a man should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
speake idely, and never good
word drop from him, a mans consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
would never be quiet, but shaking
him up for what he doth; but by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
men respite from sinning for a
time, Satan getteth stronger possession
afterwards, as <hi>Matth. 12. 43. When the
uncleane spirit is gone out of a man, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98772:121"/>
worse. Sampsons</hi> strength alwayes
remained, and so doth sinnes strength
in a naturall man, but it never appeares
untill temptation come.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, By giving the soule faire
promises of Heaven and eternall life,
and fastning them upon the heart. Most
men are confident their estate is good,
and though God kills them, yet will
they trust in him, and cannot be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
from this. Why? oh! Satan bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
them: For as he told <hi>Evah</hi> by
the Serpent, <hi>shee should not dye,</hi> so doth
he infinuate his perswasions to the
soule, though it live in sinne, he shall
not dye, but doe well enough, as the
precisest. Satan gives thus good words,
but wofull wages, the eternall flashes
of Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. <hi>By false Teachers.</hi> Who partly
by their loose examples, partly by
their flattering doctrines in publike,
and their large charitie in private, daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
up every one (especially that is
a good friend unto them) for honest
and religious people, and if they be
but a little troubled, applying com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98772:121"/>
presently, and so healing them
that should be wounded, and not tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them roundly of their <hi>Herodias,</hi>
as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did <hi>Herod.</hi> Hereupon
they judge themselves honest, because
the Minister will give them the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
pasport, and so they goe out of
the world, and dye like Lambes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wofully cheated, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 11.
Looke abroad in the world, and see
what is the reason so many feed their
hearts with confidence they shall be
saved, yet their lives condemne them,
and their hearts acquit them; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, such and such a Minister will
goe to the Ale-house, and he never
prayes in his Family, and he is none
of these precise hot people, and yet as
honest a man as ever lives, and a good
Divine too. <hi>Ahab</hi> was miserably chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by foure hundred false Prophets.
Whilst the Minister is of a loose life
himselfe, he will winke at others and
their faults, least in reproving them,
he should condemne himselfe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
should say unto him, Physitian,
heale thy selfe. Theeves of the same
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98772:122"/>
company will not steale from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
least they trouble thereby them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and hence they give others
false Cards to saile by, false Rules to
live by; their unconscionable large
charitie, is like a gulfe that swalloweth
Ships (soules I meane) tossed with
tempests, and not comforted, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.
7, 8. and hence all being fish that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to their net, all men thinke so of
themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> III. A <hi>false spirit.</hi> This is a third
cause that begets a false peace; as
there is a true Spirit that witnesseth
to our spirits, that wee are Sonnes of
God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. So there is a false
spirit, just like the true one, witnessing
that they are the Sonnes of GOD,
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 1. we are bid to <hi>try the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:</hi>
now, if these spirits were not like
Gods true Spirit, what need tryall?
As, what need one try whether dirt be
gold, which are so unlike to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And this spirit I take to be set
downe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 23. Now looke as
the true Spirit witnesseth, so the false
spirit, being like it, witnesseth also.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:98772:122"/>
First, The Spirit of God humbles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the soule: So before men have the
witnesse of the <hi>false spirit,</hi> they are
mightily cast downe and dejected in
spirit, and hereupon they pray for ease,
and purpose to lead new lives, and cast
away the weapons, and submit, <hi>Psal.</hi>
66. 3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Spirit of God in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Gospel reveales Jesus Christ, and his
willingnesse to save; so the <hi>false spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
discovereth Christs excellency and
willingnesse to receive him, if he will
but come in. It fateth with this soule
as with Surveyors of Lands, that
take an exact compasse of other mens
grounds, of which they shall never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
a Foot. So did <hi>Balaam, Num.</hi> 24.
5, 6. this false spirit sheweth them
the glory of Heaven and Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Hereupon the soule com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to be affected, and to taste the
goodnesse and sweetnesse of Jesus
Christ, as those did, <hi>Heb,</hi> 6. and the
soule breakes out into a passionate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration:
Oh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that ever there should
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98772:123"/>
be any hope for such a vile wretch as I
am and have been, and so joyes excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
like a man halfe way wrapt up
into Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Hereupon the soule being
comforted after it was wounded, now
calleth God, <hi>my God,</hi> and Christ, <hi>my
sweet Saviour,</hi> and now it doubts not
but it shall be saved; why? because I
have received much comfort after
much <hi>sorrow,</hi> and <hi>doubting, Hos.</hi> 8. 2, 3.
and yet remaines a deluded miserable
creature still. But here marke the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene the witnesse of each
spirit. The <hi>false spirit</hi> makes a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
he is in the state of grace, and
shall be saved, because he hath <hi>tasted</hi>
of Christ, and so hath been comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and that abundantly: But the
<hi>true Spirit</hi> perswades a man, his estate
is good and safe, because he hath not
onely tasted, but <hi>bought</hi> this Christ;
as the wise Merchant in the Gospel,
that rejoyced he had found <hi>the pearle,</hi>
but yet stayes not here, but sells away
all, and <hi>buyes</hi> the pearle. Like two
Chapmen that come to buy Wine,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98772:123"/>
the one tasts it, and goeth away in a
drunken fit, and so concludes it is his:
So a man doth, that hath the false spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
but the true spirited man doth not
onely taste, but buyes the Wine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he doe not drinke it all downe,
when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to taste it; yet he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been incited by tasting to buy it,
<hi>now</hi> he calls it his owne: So a child of
God tasting a little of God, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Christ, and a little of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
at his first conversion, although
he tastes not all the sweetnesse that is
in God, yet he forsakes all for God,
for Christ, and so takes them lawfully
as his owne.</p>
               <p>Againe, the false spirit having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a man comfort and peace, suffers
a man to rest in that estate; but the
true spirit having made the soule taste
the Love of the Lord, stirreth up the
soule to doe and worke mightily for
the Lord. Now the soule cryeth out;
<hi>What shall I doe for Christ that hath
done wonders for me?</hi> if every haire on
my head were a tongue to speake of
his goodnesse, it were too little. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:98772:124"/>
8. 10. the joy of the Lord is our
strength. <hi>Psal. 51. 12. Vphold me with
thy free spirit,</hi> or as the Chaldean pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase
hath it, <hi>thy kingly spirit;</hi> the
Spirit of Adoption in Gods childe
is no underling, suffering men to lye
downe, and cry, my desires are
good, but flesh is fraile; No, It is
a kingly spirit <hi>that raignes</hi> where it <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> IV. <hi>False applying of true promises,</hi>
is the last cause of false peace. And
when a man hath Gods Spirit within,
and Gods hand and promise (as he
thinks) for his est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e, now he thinkes
all safe. Thus did the <hi>Iewes,</hi> they said,
<hi>Wee have Abraham to our Father,</hi> and
so reputed themselves safe, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made them promise, <hi>I will be a
God of thee, and of thy seed.</hi> But here is
a difference betweene a child of Gods
application of them &amp; a wicked mans;
the first applieth them so to him, as
that he liveth upon them,<note place="margin">Ps. 38. 16.</note> and nothing
but them; and to whom doth the
dugge belong, but to the childe that
liveth upon it. The other lives upon
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98772:124"/>
his lusts, and creatures, and yet cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
hold on the promise.</p>
               <p>By these foure meanes is begot a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
false peace.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the second cause of
mans deceiving himselfe; False peace
in the <hi>Conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now followeth the third.</p>
               <p>III. The corruptions and distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="111"/>
of <hi>the Will,</hi> which is the third
cause why men deceive themselves.
Which are many. I will onely name
three.</p>
               <p>First, When the <hi>Will</hi> is resolved to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
goe on in a sinfull course, and then sets
the understanding a worke to defend
it. Whence it fareth with the soule,
as with a man that commeth to search
for stollen goods, who having received
a bribe afore-hand, searcheth every
where but where it is, and so the man
is never found out to be what he is:
So a man having tasted the sweetnesse
of a sinfull course (which pleasure
bribes him) he is contented to search
into every corner of his heart, and to
try himselfe, as many doe, except <hi>there</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:98772:125"/>
where his da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ling lust lyes; <hi>he sits upon
that,</hi> and covers it willingly from his
owne eyes, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did upon stolne
gods, and so never findes out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
10. 3. 20. a man that hath a mind
to sleepe quietly, will cause the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
to be drawne, and will let some
light come in, but shuts out all that,
or so much as may hinder him from
sleeping: So a man having a mind to
sleepe in some particular sinfull course
at his ease, will search himselfe, and
let some light come into his minde.</p>
               <p>And hence many prophane persons,
that know much, (their opinions are
orthodox, their discourse Savoury)
yet doe they know little of themselves,
and of those sinnes and lusts that haunt
them, which they must part with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this light troubleth them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them from sleeping in their secure
estate, and therefore they draw the
curtaine here: Hence many men that
live in those sinnes of the grossest usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
finding the gaine, and tasting the
sweet of that sinne, will reade all
bookes, goe to all those Ministers,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98772:125"/>
they suppose, that hold it lawfull, and
so pick up and gather reason to defend
the lawfulnesse of the sinne, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they would not have it to be a
sinne, finde out reasons whereby they
thinke it no sinne; but the bottome is
this, their <hi>will</hi> hath got the bribe, and
now the understanding playes the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
and hence men live in the most
crying sinnes, and are sure to perish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they will not know they are in
an errour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when the <hi>will</hi> sets the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
a worke to extenuate and
lessen sinne: for many, when they see
their sinne, yet make it small by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the false end of their opticke
glasse; they thinke such small matters
never make any breach betweene the
Lord and their soules. Hence they say,
<hi>the best man sinnes seven times a day,</hi> and
<hi>who can say my heart is cleane?</hi> What
is the reason that a child of God hath
little peace many times after commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of small sinnes? Oh! it is because
they see the horrible nature of the
least sinne: small wrongs against so
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98772:126"/>
deare, so great a friend as the Lord is,
it cuts their hearts; yet a carnall heart
is never troubled for great sinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they make a light matter of
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Wilfull ignorance of the
horrible wrath of God. Hence men
rush on in sinne, as the horse into the
battell. Hence men never feare their
estates, because they know not Gods
wrath hanging over them. Coldest
Snakes when they are frozen with
cold, never sting nor hurt; one may
carry a neast of them in his bosome:
but bring them to the fire, then they
hisse and sting: so sinne when it is
brought neare Gods wrath, (that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
fire) it makes men cry out of
themselves, then I am undone, oh I am
a lost creature; but being not thus hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
sinne never makes a man cry out
of himselfe.</p>
               <p>These are the causes why men are
ignorant of their wofull, misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
estate, which <hi>Ignorance</hi> is
the first Rocke, or the first pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-plot
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98772:126"/>
that spoyles thousands.
Yet, there are three more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
because more secret.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the second reson
of mens ruine.<note place="margin">The second Reason why men ruine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves.</note> By reason of mans <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
securitie,</hi> whereby men cannot be
affected with, nor so much as have
hearts to desire to come out of their
misery, when they know it: for if a
mans minde understand his misery, yet
if the heart be hard or sleepy, and not
affected, loaden, wounded, humbled,
and made to groane under it, he will
never greatly care to come out of it,
<hi>Isa. 29. 9, 10.</hi> Now this is the estate
of many a soule, he doth know his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
but by reason of the sleepy, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
senseles spirit of slumber, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
feeles it, nor mournes under it, and
so comes out of it.</p>
               <p>Now the Reasons of this security
are these.</p>
               <p>Because God powres not out the
full measure of his wrath upon men,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note>
because hee kindles not the pile of
wrath that lyes upon men, its reserved
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:98772:127"/>
and concealed,<note place="margin">Nahum 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>not revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
and so long, let God frowne, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
threaten, and smaller Judgements
drop, yet they will never seeke shelter
in Jesus Christ, but sleepe in their
sinnes, untill God raine downe flouds
of horrour, bloud, fire, untill Gods ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
sticke in mens hearts, they will
never seeke out of themselves unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 8. 11. so long as
Gods plagues were upon <hi>Phara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h,</hi> he
giveth faire words, and <hi>Moses</hi> must be
sent to pray for him: but when Gods
hand is taken away, now <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
heart is hardened. So long as Gods
sword is in his scabberd, men have
such stout hearts, that they will never
yeeld; God must wound, and cut deep,
and stab, and thrust to the very heart,
else men will never yeeld, never awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
till Gods fists be about mens
eares, and he is dragging them to the
stake; men will never awake and cry
for a pardon and deliverance of their
woefull estate.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> because if they doe in
part feele, and so feare Gods wrath,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98772:127"/>
they put away the evill day farre from
them, they hope they shall doe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hereafter, and repent some other
time, and therefore they say, soule
eate, drinke, follow thy sports, cups,
queanes; thou hast a treasure of time
which shall not be spent in many
yeares, <hi>Isay</hi> 22. 12, 13. that looke as
it is with the waxe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let it be of never

                  </gap>lts, but still remaines hard:
so it is here. Let a man or woman
have never so gentle or pliable a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and let Gods wrath be never so
hot and dreadfull in their Judgements,
yet if they make not the day of wrath
present to them, if they see it not
ready every moment to light upon
their hearts, they are never melted, but
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>full estate; and this is
the reason why many men, that have
guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y consoiences, thought they have
many secret wishes and purposes to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98772:128"/>
bee better, yet never cry out of
themselves, nor ever seeke earnestly
for mercy, till they lie upon their
death-bed, and then, oh the promises
that they ply God with! try me Lord,
&amp; restore me once more to my health,
and life againe, and thou shalt see how
thankfull I will be; because that now
they apprehend wrath and misery
neare unto them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> Because they thinke they
can beare Gods wrath, though they
doe conceive it neare at hand, even at
the very doores: men thinke not that
Hell is so hot, nor the devill so black,
nor God so terrible as in deede he is.
And hence wee shall observe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
present Gods wrath as a thing
intolerable before the eyes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that thereby they might quench
all those cursed conceits of being able
to beare Gods wrath, <hi>Nahum</hi> 1. 6. and
hence we shall have many men despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
conclude, they will have their
swinge in sinne, and if they perish they
hope they shall be able to beare it, <hi>it
is but a damning</hi> they thinke, and hence
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98772:128"/>
they goe on securely. O poore wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches!
the devill scares and feares all
the world, and at Gods wrath the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
quake, and yet secure men feare
it not, they thinke hell is not so terrible
a place.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, because they know no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
better an estate: Hence though they
feele their wofull and miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
yet they desire not to come
out of it. Although men finde hard
lodging in the world, hard times, hard
friends, hard hearts, yet they make a
shift with what they finde in this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Inne, untill they come to Hell;
for such a man pursued by outward
miseries or inward troubles, there
stayes. O miserable man, that makes
shift till he come to Hell. They may
heare of the happy estate of GODS
people, but not knowing of it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally,
they stay where they are,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
               <p>Take a Princes childe, and bring it
up in a base house and place, it never
aspires after a Kingdome or Crowne:
So men, hatcht in this world, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:98772:129"/>
no better an estate, never cast about
them to get a better inheritance than
that they scramble for here. Wives
mourne for the long absence of their
beloved Husbands, because they know
them and their worth. God may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
himself from men, weeks, months,
yeares, but men shed not one teare for
it, because they never tasted the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his presence. It is strange to
see men take more content in their
cups and cards, pots and pipes, dogges
and hawkes, than in the fellowship of
God and Christ, in Word, in Prayer,
in Meditation, which Ordinances are
burdens and prisons unto them. What
is the reason of it? Is there no more
sweetnesse in the presence of Gods
smiling in Christ, than in a filthy
Whore? Yes, but they know not
the worth, sweetnesse, satisfying good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a God; yet into fresh waters
they will never returne, because now
they taste a large difference of each
estate: So it is here, if men did but
once taste of the happinesse of Gods
people, they would not for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98772:129"/>
worlds be one halfe houre in their

               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Reas. 5.</note> because if they doe know
a better estate, yet their present plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
their sloth doth so bewitch
them, and Gods denyals when they
seeke unto him, doe so farre discourage
them, that they sleepe still securely in
that estate. A flothfull heart bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with present ease and pleasures and
delights, considering many a teare,
many a prayer must it make, many
a night must it breake its sleepe,
many a weary step must it take to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heaven and Christ, if ever it
come there, growes discouraged and
deaded, and hard-hearted in a sleepy
estate, and had rather have a bird in
the hand then two in the bush, <hi>Prov.
1. 32. Ier.</hi> 48. 11. The <hi>Israelites</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
that they were at their Onyons
and garlike againe in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Was there
no <hi>Canaan?</hi> yes, but they wished thus
because there were walls built up to
heaven, and Giants sonnes of <hi>Anack</hi>
in the Land, difficulties to overcome.
O slothfull hearts! Secondly, because
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:98772:130"/>
God sometime put them to straights,
and denied them what they sought
for, they were of such a waspish,
teasty, sullen spirit, that because
the Lord had them not alwayes on
his knees, they would runne away:
so many a man meets with sorrow e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in his sinfull, dropsie, drunken
estate, he heares of heaven and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
estate; yet, why goes he to his
lusts and flesh pots againe? Oh! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there are so many difficulties and
blockes and hindrances in his way, and
because they pray and finde not ease,
therefore they eate, drinke, laugh,
sport and sleepe in their miserable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
still, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 14. therefore men
walke in the broad way, because the
other way to life is straight and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
it is a plague, a burden, a prison
to be so strict; men had rather sit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
an houre in the stockes, than be
an houre at prayer; men had rather
be damned at last, than sweat it out and
runne through the race to receive a
Crowne, and hence men remaine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:98772:130"/>
Sixthly,<note place="margin">Reas. 6.</note> because of the strange strong
power of sin, which beares that sway
over mens soules, that they must serve
it; as prisoners stoope to their Jaylor;
as souldiers that have taken their pay,
<hi>their pleasure of sinne,</hi> must follow it as
their Captaine, though they goe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
on to eternall ruine:<note place="margin">Rom. 1. ult.</note> nay though

lusts. As the Sodomites when they

tormented their eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as though they
had beene pricked with thornes, for so
the Hebrew word signifies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even when
destruction was neare, they groped for
the doore. Men cannot but sin though
they perish for sinne; hence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine secure.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">Reas. 7.</note> Despaire of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
hence, like <hi>Cain,</hi> men are Runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
from the face of God; men
thinke they shall never finde mercy
when all is done: hence they grow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately
sinfull; like those <hi>Italian</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,
that despairing of their lives
(when upon submission they had been

of their villany, made a curious
banquet, &amp; at the end of it, every man
dranke up his glasse of poyson, &amp; kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himselfe: so men feeling such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
hard hearts, and being privie to
such notorious sinnes, they cast away
lives, and heaven, and soules for lust,
and so perish wofully, because they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
desperately, and so securely.</p>
               <p>Eighthly,<note place="margin">Reas. 8.</note> Because men nourish a
blinde, false, flattering hope of Gods
mercy: hence many knowing and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
that all is naught with them,
yet having some hope they <hi>may</hi> be in
a good estate, and God may love them;
hence they lie downe securely, and
rest in their flattering hope. Hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
those people that feldome come
to a conclusion, to a point, that either
they are in the state of grace, or out
of it, that never come to be affected,
but remaine secure in their condition;
they commonly grow to this despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
conclusion; that they hope God
will be mercifull unto them; if not,
they cannot helpe it: like the man that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98772:131"/>
had on his Target the picture of God
and the Devill: under the first he writ,
<hi>si tu non vis, if thou wilt not;</hi> under the

will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">Reas. 9.</note> because men bring not
their hearts under the hammer of
Gods word to be broken, they never
bring their consciences to be cut.
Hence they goe on still securely with
festered consciences. Men put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
above the word, and their hearts
above the hammer, they come not to
have the Minister to humble them, but
to judge of him, or to pick some pretty
fine thing out of the word, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
secure sotts all their dayes: for
if ever thy heart be broken, and thy

doe it: but people are so Sermo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodden,
that their hearts, like foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths,
grow hard by the word.</p>
               <p>Tenthly,<note place="margin">Reas. 10</note> because men consider not
of Gods wrath daily, nor the horrible

art thou worse than a beast which we

things harden the heart. 1. false hope:
whereby a man hopes, he is not so bad,
as indeed he is. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. No hope; whereby
a man when he seeth himselfe so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98772:133"/>
bad, thinkes there is no willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the Lord to pardon or receive
such a monster of men to mercy; and
if neither the hammer can breake thy
stony heart, nor the Sunshine of mercy
melt it, thou hast an heart worse than
the Devill, and art a spectacle of the
greatest misery. 1. In regard of sinne,
2. in regard of Gods wrath.</p>
               <p>First, in regard of sinne. Thou hast
sinned, and that grievously against a
great God, thou makest no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this: No, but though it be no
loade to thee, it's a loade on the Lords
heart, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 24. and time will come
he will make the whole sinfull world
by rivers of fire and bloud to know
what an evill it is.</p>
               <p>For 1. In every sin thou dost strike
God, and fling a dagger at the heart of
God. 2. In every sin thou dost spight
against God: for if there were but one
onely thing wherein a man could doe
his friend a displeasure, was not here
spight seene if he did that thing? Now
tell me, hath not the Lord beene a
good friend unto thee? Tell mee,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98772:133"/>
wherein hath hee grieved thee? and
tell me, in what one thing canst thou
please the devill, and doe God a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
but by sinne? yet O hard
heart thou makest nothing of it; but
consider thirdly, in every sin thou dost
disthrone God, and setteth thy selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
God: for in every sinne, this
question is put, whose will shall be
done, Gods will or mans? Now man
by sinne sets up his owne will above
the Lords, and so kicks God, (bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for ever, adored of millions of
Saints and Angels) as filth under
his feet. What, will this breake your
hearts?</p>
               <p>Consider then of Gods wrath; the

The wildest beasts (as Staggs) if they

They heare a man cannot be saved by

               <p>First, the Papist will confesse his
misery, that he is (and all men are) by
nature a child of wrath, and under the
power of sinne and Satan.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they hold Christ is the
onely Saviour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that this Salvation is not
by any Righteousnesse in a Christ, but
Righteousnesse from a Christ, onely
by giving a man power to doe; and
then dipping mens doings in his bloud,
he merits their life. Thus the wisest
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98772:140"/>
and devoutest of them professe, as I
am able to manifest; just so doe many
Christians live. First, They feele
themselves full of sinne, and are
sometimes tyred and weary of their
lives, for their vile hearts, and they
finde no power to helpe themselves.
Secondly, Hereupon hearing, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Christ can save them, they goe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ to remove these sinnes that
tyre them and load them, that hee
would enable them to doe better than
formerly. Thirdly, If they get these
sinnes subdued and removed, and if
they finde power to doe better, than
they hope they shall be saved. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
thou mayest be damned and goe to
the devill at last, although thou dost
escape all the pollutions of the world,
&amp; that not from they selfe and strength,
but from the knowledge of Jesus
Christ, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. I say woe to you
for ever, if you die in this estate, it is
with our Christians in this case, as it is
with the <hi>Ivy,</hi> which claspes and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
about the tree, and draws sap <hi>from</hi>
the tree, but it growes not <hi>one with</hi> the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98772:141"/>
tree, because it is not ingrafted into
the tree: so many a soule commeth to
Christ, to suck juice from Christ to
maintaine his owne berries, (his owne
stocke of grace,) alas, he is but <hi>Ivy,</hi> he
is no member or branch of this tree,
and hence he never groweth to be one
with Christ. 2. Now the reasons why
men rest in their duties are these.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Why men doe rest in their good duties.</note> because it's naturall to a man
out of Christ to doe so. <hi>Adam</hi> and
all his posterity was to be saved by his
doing,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Doe this and live,</hi> worke and
here is the wages; winne life and weare
it: Hence all his posteritie seekes to
this day to be saved by <hi>doing;</hi> like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
like sonne. Now to come out of
all duties truely to a Christ, hath not
so much as a coate in <hi>innocent,</hi> much
lesse <hi>corrupted</hi> nature; hence men seek
to themselves: now as it is with a
bankrupt, when his stocke is spent and
his estate crackt, before he will turne
Prentice, or live upon another, hee
will turne Pedler of small wares, and
so follow his old trade with a lesse
stocke: so men naturally follow their
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98772:141"/>
old trade of <hi>doing,</hi> and hope to get
their living that way: and hence men
having no experience of trading with
Christ by <hi>faith,</hi> live of themselves.
<hi>Sampson,</hi> when all his strength was lost,
would goe to shake himselfe as at other
times; so when mens strength is lost,
and God and grace is lost, yet men will
goe and try how they can live by shifts
and working for themselves still.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> because men are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of Jesus Christ and his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
hence men cannot goe unto him,
because they see him not, hence they
shift as well as they can for themselves
by their duties, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 14. men seeke
to save the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves by their own swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
when they see no cable cast out
to helpe them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> because this is the easiest
way to comfort the heart, and pacifie
conscience, and to please God as the
soule thinkes; because by this meanes
a man goes no further than himselfe.
Now in forsaking all <hi>duties,</hi> a soule
goeth to heaven quite out of himselfe,
and there he must waite many a yeare,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:98772:142"/>
and that for a little it may be. Now
if a fainting man have <hi>Aquavitae</hi> at his
beds head, he will not knocke up the
shopkeeper for it. Men that have a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of their owne to heale them, will
not goe to the Physitian.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note> because by vertue of these
duties a man may hide his sin, and live
quietly in his sin, yet be accounted an
honest man: as the whore in the <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.
15, 16. having performed her vowes,
can intice without suspition of men, or
check of conscience; so the Scribes and
Pharisees were horribly covetous, but
their long prayers covered their defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 14. and hence men
set their duties at a higher rate than
they are worth, thinking <hi>they</hi> shall save
them, because they are so usefull to
them. Good duties, like new appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
on a man pursued with Hue and
cry of conscience, keepe him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
knowne.</p>

3. The paths to Hell be but two.
The first is the path of <hi>sinne,</hi> which is a

which (rested in) is but a clearer
way. When the <hi>Israelites</hi> were in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 10. 14. The Lord bids

when thou shalt lie howling on thy

you have made, and the <hi>teares</hi> you have

                  <note place="margin">Ob.</note> But I thinke thou wilt say,
no true Christian man hopes to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by his good workes and duties,
but onely by the mercy of God and
merits of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ans.</note> It is one thing to trust to be
saved by <hi>duties,</hi> another thing to <hi>rest
in</hi> duties. A man trusts unto them,
when he is of this opinion, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good duties can save him. A man
rests in duties, when he is of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that onely Christ can save him,
but in his practise he goeth about to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98772:143"/>
save himselfe. The wisest of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
are so at this day, and so are our
common Protestants. And this is a
great subtilty of the heart, that is, when
a man thinkes he cannot be saved by
his good works and duties, but onely
by Christ: he then hopeth, because he
is of this opinion, that <hi>when he hath
done all, he is an unprofitable servant:</hi>
(which is onely an act or worke of the
Judgement informed aright) that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
because he is of this opinion, he
shall be saved.</p>
               <p>But, because it is hard for to know
when a man rests in duties, &amp; few men
finde themselves guiltie of this sinne,
which ruines so many: I will shew
two things.</p>

duties.</p>
               <p>2. The insufficiency of all duties to
save men. That so those that be found
guilty of this sin, may not goe on in it.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Signes of mens resting in Duties.</note> for the signes whereby a man
may certainly know, when he rests in
his duties, which if he doe, (as few pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
especially, but they doe) he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth
eternally.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:98772:143"/>
First,<note place="margin">Signe 1.</note> Those that never yet saw they
rested in them, they that never found it
an hard matter to come out of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
For it's most naturall for a man to
sticke in them, because nature sets men
upon duties; hence it is a hard matter
to come out of resting in duties. For
two things keepe a man from Christ.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">2 things keepe us from Christ.</note> 
                  <hi>Sinne; 2. Selfe.</hi> Now as a man
is broken off from <hi>sinne</hi> by seeing and
feeling it, and groaning under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of it: so is a man broken from <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</hi>
For men had rather doe any thing
than come unto Christ, there is such
a deale of <hi>selfe</hi> in them; therefore if
thou canst not tell the time when thou
didst <hi>rest</hi> in thy duties, and then did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
groane to be delivered from these
intanglements, (I meane not from the
<hi>doing</hi> of them, this is <hi>familisme,</hi> and
prophanenesse, but from <hi>resting</hi> in the
bare performance of them,) thou dost
relye upon thy <hi>duties</hi> to this day.</p>
               <p>These rest in duties,<note place="margin">Signe 2.</note> that prize the
bare performance of Duties wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
for those duties that carry thee
out of thy selfe unto Christ, make thee
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:98772:144"/>
to prize Christ. Now tell me, dost
thou glory in thy selfe? now I am
some-body. I was <hi>ignorant, forgetfull,
hard-hearted,</hi> now I understand and
remember better, and can sorrow for
my sinnes; if thou dost rest here, thy
duties never carried thee further than
thy <hi>selfe.</hi> Dost thou thinke after that
thou hast prayed with some life, now
I have done very well, and now thou
dost verily thinke (meaning for thy
<hi>duties</hi>) the Lord will save thee though
thou never come to Christ, &amp; sayest as
he in another case; <hi>now I hope the Lord
will doe good to me, seeing I have got</hi> a
Priest <hi>into mine house, Iudg.</hi> 17. 13. Dost
thou inhance the price of <hi>duties</hi> thus,
that thou dost doate on them, then I
doe pronounce from God, thou dost
rest in them:<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>these things</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) I
accounted gaine,</hi> (that is, before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
to Christ, he prized them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly)
but <hi>now I account them losse:</hi>
and this is the reason why a childe of
God commonly after all his prayers,
teares and confessions, doubts much of
Gods love towards him? whereas ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:98772:144"/>
man that falleth short of him, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
questioneth his estate; the <hi>first</hi> seeth
much rottennesse and vilenesse in his
best duties, and so judgeth meanly of
himselfe: the <hi>other</hi> ignorant of the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of them, prizeth them and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
highly of them, and setting his
corne at so high a price, he may keepe
them to himselfe; the Lord never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
them, nor buyeth them at so
high a rate.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Signe 3.</note> those that never came to be
sensible of their poverty &amp; utter empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of all good: for so long as a man
hath a penny in his purse (that is) feeles
any good in himselfe, he will never
come a begging unto Jesus Christ, and
therefore rests in <hi>himselfe:</hi> Now didst
thou never feele thy selfe in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
poore, <hi>viz.</hi> I am as ignorant as any
beast, as vile as any devill; O Lord,
what a neast and litter of sin and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
lurks in my heart. I once thought
at least, mine heart and desires were
good, but now I feele no spirituall life.
Oh! dead heart, I am the poorest, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest,
basest, and blindest creature that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:98772:145"/>
ever lived. If thou doest not thus feele
thy selfe poore, thou never camest out
of thy <hi>duties,</hi> For when the Lord bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
any man to Christ, he bringeth him
empty, that so he may make him be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Christ for every farthing token.<note place="margin">Isa. 66. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Signe 4.</note> those that gaine no <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
righteousnesse</hi> by duties, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>duties;</hi> I say, Evangelicall righteousnes,
that is, more prizing of acquaintance,
with desire after, loving &amp; delighting
in union with the Lord Jesus Christ:
for a morall man may grow in <hi>legall
righteousnesse,</hi> (as the stony and thorny
ground <hi>seede,</hi> sprang up and increased
much, and came neere unto maturitie,)
and yet <hi>rest in</hi> duties all this while. For,
as it is with tradesmen, they rest in their
buying and selling, though they make
no gaine of their trading: now Jesus
Christ is a Christians gaine, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21.
and hence a childe of God askes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
after <hi>Sermon,</hi> after <hi>prayer,</hi> after <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
what have I gained of Christ?
<hi>have I got more knowledge of Christ, more
admiring of the Lord Iesus?</hi> Now a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
heart that rests in his duties, asketh
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:98772:145"/>
onely what he hath done, as the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see,
I thanke God I am not as other men,
I fast twice a weeke, I give almes,</hi> and
the like, and thinkes verily he shall be
saved, because he <hi>prayes,</hi> and because he
<hi>heares,</hi> and because he <hi>reformes,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he <hi>sorrowes</hi> for his sinnes, that is,
<hi>not</hi> because of the gaining of Christ in a
dutie, but because of his naked perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the duty, and so they are like
that man, that I have heard of, that
thought verily he should be rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had got a wallet to beg: so
men, because they performe duties,
thinke verily they shall be saved. No
such matter, let a man have a bucket
made of gold, doth he thinke to get
water, because he hath a bucket? No,
no, he must let it downe into the well
&amp; draw up water with it: so must thou
let downe all thy duties into Christ, &amp;
draw life and light from his fulnesse,
else though thy duties be golden du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
thou shalt perish without Christ.
When a man hath bread in his wallet,
and got water in his bucket, he may
boldly say, so long as these last, I shall

not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>amish: so mayst thou say, when
thou hast found and got Christ, in the
performance of any duty, so long as
Christs life lasteth, I shall live, as long
as he hath any wisdome or power, so
long shall I be directed and enabled in
well doing.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Signe 5.</note> if thy duties make thee sin
more boldly, thou dost then <hi>rest in</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
for these duties which carry a man
out of himselfe unto Christ, ever fetch
power against sinne; but duties that a
man rests in, arme him and fence him
in his sinne, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 14. A cart that hath
no wheeles to rest on, can hardly be
drawne into the dirt, but one that hath
wheeles, commeth loaded through it;
so a child of God that hath no wheeles,
<hi>no duties</hi> to rest upon, cannot willingly
be drawne into sinne: but another man,
though he be loaden with sinne (even
sometimes against his conscience) yet
having duties to beare him up, goeth
merrily on in a sinfull course, &amp; makes
no bones of sinne; when we see a base
man revile a great Prince, &amp; strike him,
we say, surely he durst not doe it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98772:146"/>
he had some body to beare him
out in it, that he rests and trusts unto:
so when wee see men sinne against the
great God, we conceive, certainly they
durst not doe it, if they had not some
<hi>duties</hi> to beare them out in it, and to
encourage them in their way, that they
trust unto.</p>
               <p>For, take a prophane man, what makes
him drink, sweare, cozen, game, whore?
Is there no God to punish? Is there no
hell hot enough to torment? are there
no plagues to confound him? yes, why
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inneth he then so? Oh! he prayeth to
God for forgivenesse, and sorroweth,
and repents in secret (as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith) and
this beares him out in his lewd pranks.</p>
               <p>Take a morall man, he knowes he
hath his failings and his sinnes, as the
best have, and is overtaken sometimes
as the best are; why doth he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
these sinnes then? He confesseth
them to God every morning when he
riseth; why is he not more humbled
under his sinne then? the reason is, he
constantly observeth morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
prayer, &amp; then he craves forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98772:147"/>
for his failings, by which course
he hopes he makes his peace with God,
and hence he sinneth without seare,
and riseth out of his falls into sinne
without sorrow. And thus they see and
maintaine their sinnes by their <hi>duties,</hi>
and therefore <hi>rest in</hi> duties.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">Signe 6.</note> those that see little of their
vile hearts by <hi>duties,</hi> rest in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
For if a man be brought nearer to
Christ, and to the light, by duties, he
will spy out more moats; for the more
a man participates of Christ, his health
and life, the more he feeleth the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and sicknesse of sinne.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> As <hi>Paul</hi>
when he rested in his duties before his
conversion, before that the <hi>Law</hi> had
humbled him, <hi>he was alive,</hi> that is, he
thought himselfe a sound man, because
his <hi>duties</hi> covered his sinnes, like fig-leaves.
Therefore ask thine own heart,
if it be troubled sometimes for sinne,
and if after thy praying and sorrowing
thou doest grow well, and thinkest thy
selfe safe, and feelest not thy selfe more
vile. If it be thus, I tell thee, thy <hi>duties</hi>
be but fig-leaves to cover thy naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98772:147"/>
and the Lord will find thee out,
and unmaske thee one day, and woe to
thee, if thou dost perish here.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency of any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to save a man.</note> Therefore behold the
insufficiency of all duties to save us;
Which will appeare in these three
things, which I speake that you may
learne hereafter never to rest in duties.</p>
               <p>First, Consider thy best <hi>duties</hi> are
tainted, poysoned, and mingled with
some sinne, and therefore are most odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the eyes of an holy God, (naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; barely considered in themselves)
for if the best actions of Gods people
be filthy, as they come from them, then
to be sure, all wicked mens actions are
much more filthy &amp; polluted with sin:
but the first is true,<note place="margin">Isay 6. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>All our righteousnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are as filthy ragges;</hi> for as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
is, so is the streame; but the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of all good actions, (that is <hi>the
heart</hi>) is mingled partly with sin, partly
with grace, therfore every action parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates
of some sin, which sins are dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
at Gods heart, even when a man is
praying and begging for his life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is no hope to be saved by du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:98772:148"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Suppose thou couldest
performe them without sinne, yet thou
couldest not hold out in doing so, <hi>I say
40. 6. All flesh and the glory thereof is but
grasse.</hi> So thy best actions would soone
wither, if they were not perfect: and if
thou canst not persevere in performing
all duties perfectly, thou art for ever
undone, though thou shouldest doe so
for a time; live like an Angel, shine like
a Sunne, and at thy last gaspe have but
an idle thought, commit the least sin,
that one rocke will sinke thee downe
even in the haven, though never so
richly loaden; one sin, like a pen-knife
at the heart, will stab thee; one sinne,
like a little fire-stick in the thatch, will
burne thee; one act of treason will hang
thee, though thou hast lived never so
devoutly before, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 24.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> For it's
a crooked life, when all the parts of
the line of thy life, be not straight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
almighty God,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, suppose thou shouldest <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe,</hi>
yet it's cleare, thou hast sinned
grievously already, and dost thou think
thine obedience for the time to come
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:98772:148"/>
can satisfie the Lord for all those Rents
behind, for all those sinnes past? as can a
man that payes his Rent honestly eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
yeare, satisfie hereby for the old rent
not payed in twenty yeares? all thy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
is a new debt, which cannot
satisfie for debts past. Indeed <hi>men may</hi>
forgive wrong and debts because they
be but finite, but the least sin is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
evill, and therefore God <hi>must be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied</hi>
for it. Men may remit debts, and
yet remaine men; but the Lord having
said, <hi>the soule that sinneth shall die,</hi> and
his truth being himselfe, he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
God, if he forgive it without sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
Therfore duties are but rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
crutches for a soule to rest upon.</p>
               <p>But to what end should we use any
duties?<note place="margin">Obj.</note> cannot a man be saved by his
good <hi>prayers,</hi> nor <hi>sorrowes,</hi> nor <hi>repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</hi>
what should wee pray any more
then? Let us cast off all duties, if all are
to no purpose to save us. As good play
for nothing as worke for nothing.</p>
               <p>Though thy good duties cannot
save thee,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> yet thy bad workes will
damne thee. Thou art therefore <hi>not</hi> to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:98772:149"/>
cast off the <hi>duties,</hi> but thy <hi>resting in</hi>
these duties.<note place="margin">Good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not to be cast off, but our resting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</note> Thou art not to cast them
<hi>away,</hi> but to cast them <hi>downe</hi> at the
feet of Jesus Christ, as they did their

be any good or graces in these duties,
it's thine Lord, for it is the Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that exalts a man, not his owne
gifts; they came from <hi>his</hi> good pleasure.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt say;<note place="margin">Ob.</note> to what end should
I performe duties, if I cannot be saved
by them?</p>
               <p>For these three ends.<note place="margin">Ans.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> 1. To carry thee to the Lord Jesus
the onely Saviour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. he onely
is able to save (<hi>not duties</hi>) all that come
unto God (that is, in the use of means,)
by him: heare a Sermon to carry thee
to Jesus Christ: Fast and pray, and get
a full tide of affections in them to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thee to the Lord Jesus Christ, (that
is,) to get a more love to him, more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with him, more union with
him: so sorrow for thy sins, that thou
mayest be more fitted for Christ, that
thou mayest prize Christ the more;
use thy duties, as <hi>Noah's</hi> dove did her
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98772:149"/>
wings, to carry thee to the Arke of the
Lord Jesus Christ, where onely there is
rest. If shee had never used her wings,
shee had fallen in the waters: so if thou
shalt use no duties, but cast them all off,
thou art sure to perish; Or as it is with
a poore man that is to goe over a great
water for a treasure on the other side,
though he cannot fetch the boate, he
calls for it; and though there be no
treasure in the boate, yet he useth the
boate to carry him over to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
so Christ is in heaven, and thou
on earth, he doth not come to thee, and
thou canst not goe to him; now call
for a boate, though there is no grace,
no good, no salvation in a pithlesse <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
yet use it to carry thee over to the
treasure the Lord Jesus Christ. When
thou comest to <hi>heare,</hi> say, Have over
Lord by this Sermon. When thou
comest to <hi>pray,</hi> say, Have over Lord by
this prayer to a Saviour. But this is the
misery of people, like foolish lovers,
when they are to woe for the Lady,
they fall in love with her handmaid
that is onely to leade them to her: so
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98772:150"/>
men fall in love with, and doate upon
their owne duties, and rest contented
with the naked performance of them,
which are onely handmaids to leade
the soule unto the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> use duties as evidences of
Gods everlasting love to you when
you be in Christ; for the graces and
duties of Gods people, although they
be not causes, yet they be tokens and
pledges of salvation to one in Christ:
<hi>they</hi> doe not save a man, but onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
&amp; follow such a man as shall
be saved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 9. Let a man boast of
his <hi>Ioyes, feelings, gifts, spirit, grace,</hi> if

                  </gap>ssion of any one knowne
duty, or in the slovenly ill favoured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of duties, this man, I say, can
have no assurance without flattering of
himselfe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8, 9, 10. Duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being evidences and pledges of
salvation, use them to that end, and
make much of them therefore, as a man
that hath faire evidence for his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
because he did not purchase his
Lordship, will he therefore cast it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:98772:150"/>
no, no, because it is an evidence
to assure him that it is his owne, and so
to defend him against all such as seeke
to take it from him, he will carefully
preserve the same: so because <hi>duties</hi> do
not save thee, wilt thou cast away good
duties? No, for they are evidences (if
thou art in Christ) that the Lord and
mercy is thine owne. Women will not
cast away their love-tokens, although
they are such things, as did not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
or merit the love of their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,
but because they are tokens of his
love, therfore they will keep them safe.</p>
               <p>That God the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ may be honoured by the
performance of these duties,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> therefore
use them: Christ shed his bloud, that
he might purchase unto himselfe <hi>a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
zealous of good workes, Tit.</hi> 2. 14.
not to save our soules by them, but to
<hi>honour him.</hi> Oh! let not the bloud of
Christ be shed in vaine. Grace &amp; good
duties are a Christians Crowne; it is
sin onely makes a man base: now shall
a King cast away his Crowne, because
he bought not his Kingdome by it?
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:98772:151"/>
No, because it is his Ornament and
glory to weare it, when he is made a
King; so I say unto thee, it's better that
Christ should be honoured, than thy
soule saved; and therefore performe
duties, because they honour the Lord
Jesus Christ. Thus <hi>use</hi> thy duties, but
<hi>rest not in</hi> duties; nay, goe out of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
&amp; match thy soule to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:

               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4 Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reason of mans ruine.</note> By reason of mans head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong
Presumption or false faith,
whereby men seeke to save themselves
by catching hold on Christ, when they
see an insufficiency in all duties to helpe
them, and themselves unworthy of

rock that these times are split
upon. Men make a bridge of their own
to carry them to Christ; I meane, they
looke not after faith, wrought by an

them,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 19.</note> but they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent themselves with

and hence they thinke verily and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98772:151"/>
that Christ is their sweet Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and so doubt not but they are safe,
when there is no such matter, but even
as dogs they snatch away childrens

               <p>All men are of this opinion, that
there is no salvation, but by the merits
of Jesus Christ; and because they hold
fast this opinion, therefore they thinke
they hold fast Iesus Christ in the hand
of faith, and so perish by catching at
their owne catch, and hanging on their
owne fancy and shadow. Some others
catch hold of Christ before they come
to feele the want of Faith and abilitie
to beleeve, and catching hold on him
(like dust on a mans coate whom God
will shake off, or like burrs and bryers
cleaving to ones garment, which the
Lord will trample under foot) now
they say they thanke God, they have
got comfort by this means, and though
God killeth them, yet they will trust
unto him, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
               <p>It is in this respect a harder matter to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:98772:152"/>
convert a man in <hi>England</hi> than in <hi>India,</hi>
for there they have no such shifts and
forts against our Sermons, to say they
beleeve in Christ already, as most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us doe: wee cannot wrap off
mens fingers from catching hold on
Christ before they be fit for him; like
a company of theeves in the street, you
shall see an hundred hands scrambling
for a jewell that is fallen there, that
have least, nay nothing to doe with it.
Every man saith almost, I hope Christ
is mine, I put my whole trust and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in him, and will not be beaten
from this. What, must a man despaire?
must not a man trust unto Christ? thus,
men will hope and trust, though they
have no ground, no graces to prove
they may lay hold and claime unto
Christ. This hope skared out of his
wits damnes thousands, for I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
if men did see themselves
Christlesse creatures, as well as sinfull
creatures, they would cry out, <hi>Lord,
what shall I doe to be saved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True faith is <hi>a precious faith, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 2.
precious things cost us much: &amp; we set
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98772:152"/>
them at an high rate; if thy Faith be so,
it hath cost thee many a prayer, many a
sob, many a salt teare. But ask most men
how they came by their faith in Christ?
they say, very easily: when the Lyon
sleepes a man may lye and sleepe by it,
but when it awakens, woe to that man
that doth so: so while God is silent and
patient, thou mayest befoole thy selfe
with thinking thou dost trust unto God:
but woe to thee when the LORD ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in his wrath, as one day he will;
for by vertue of this false faith, men
<hi>sinning,</hi> take Christ as a dish-clout to
wipe them cleane againe, and that's all
the use they have of this faith. They
sin indeede, but they trust unto Christ
for his mercy, and so lye still in their
sinnes: God will revenge with bloud
and fire and plagues this horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
from heaven.</p>
               <p>Hence many of you trust unto Christ,
as the Apricock tree that leanes against
the wall, but it's fast rooted in the earth:
so you leane upon Christ for salvation,
but you are rooted in the world, rooted
in your pride, rooted in your filthinesse
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98772:153"/>
still. Woe to you if you perish in this
estate, God will hew you downe as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
for his wrath, what ever mad hope
you have to be saved by Christ. This
therefore I proclaime from the God
of Heaven to you. 1. you that never felt
your selves as unable to beleeve as a
dead man to raise himselfe, you have
as yet no faith at all. 2. You that would
get faith, first must feele your inability
to beleeve; and fetch not this slip out of
thine own garden: it must come downe
from Heaven to thy soule, if ever thou
partakest thereof.</p>
               <p>Other things I should have spoken
of this large subject, but I am forced
here to end abruptly; The Lord lay not
this sin to their charge, who have stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
my mouth, labouring to withhold
the truth in unrighteousnesse. And bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be the good God, who hath stood
by his unworthy servant thus long, ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
him to leade you so farre, as to
shew you the rockes and dangers of
your passage to another world.</p>
