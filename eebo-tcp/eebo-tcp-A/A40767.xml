            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>BEcause such subscribed Engagement is agreeable to the law of nature and Nations revealed in the holy Scriptures, dictated and inspired by the Spirit of the God of Nature and Nations, who is our King and Law-giver, <hi>Isai.</hi> 33. 22, even the


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41853:8"/>
one onely Law-giver, who is able to save and to destroy; see <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 12. compared with 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. Ergo,</hi> It may and ought to be subscribed: This Reason shall be evidenced and illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the foure branches and parts observed in the Forme of Engagement.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="branch">
                     <p>1. The condition of the person subscribing, even one who is a Subject under this established present Government of the Common-wealth of England, and receiveth benefit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the same, giveth good evidence and illustration to this first Reason: For it is both lawfull and requisite that any person, who is a Subject under any supreme power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, of what kind soever the power is, whether it be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall, Aristocraticall, or Democraticall, and of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soever the person and subject is, it is necessary, I say, that such subject person be true and faithfull to such Supreme Power. This is demonstrable by an Induction of particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Ioseph</hi> the son of the Patriark <hi>Iacob,</hi> an Hebrew fearing God, he by occasion living in Egypt, (having been sold thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) did not onely accept imployment under the Supreme Power there, but also was true and faithfull thereunto, yea, though Egypt was an house of bondage unto the Israelites, see <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Mordecai,</hi> a truly religious Jew of the children of the captivity, did witnesse his truth and faithfulnesse unto the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Monarchy, by his ingenuous discovery of the treasonable and murderous designe of <hi>Bigthan</hi> and <hi>Teresh,</hi> two of the Kings Chamberlains against King <hi>Ahashuerus,</hi> reigning in Persia at that time; see <hi>Esther</hi> 2. 21, 22.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> an eminent servant of God, served <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the King of Persia, and was true and faithfull unto the supreme Power, both in submitting unto, and observing of his directions and appointment; see <hi>Neh.</hi> 2. 6. &amp; <hi>cap.</hi> 13. 6.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Our blessed Saviour Jesus Christ in the dayes of his flesh here on earth, declared his mind touching faithfulnesse to <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> the Romane Emperor, being at that time su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Commander over the Jewish Nation, so far as did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41853:8"/>
that his supreme power, whatever difficulties and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Jewish Nation was involved into in those daies; see <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 19, 20, 21.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The holy Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> approving his Apostleship to the Gentiles, as became him, instructeth the Christians at Rome to submit faithfully and conscientiously to the present supreme power there, though the Emperors in those times were mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous and bloody usurping Emperors; see <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The great Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saw just cause that the brethren of the dispersion throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia and Bythinia, should submit themselves unto the present power they were under in those severall Territories, what ever the power was for its kind; and this for the arguing their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse unto those Powers, and their Christian faithfulnesse in so doing; see 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
                     <p>These instances may beyond all exception, vindicate the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who is an English Subject, and hath his subsistence and livelihood in England, for his ingaging unto the now esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Common-wealth of England, the tie of this relation being more naturall and fundamentall then those before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: Hereunto might be added, of how good report it is, <hi>(Philip.</hi> 4. 8.) that in case any prisoners amongst us have liberty to go abroad, upon their parole, and ingaging themselves to their Goalers and Keepers to faithfulnesse, that they approve themselves unto them therein; how much more in the case in hand?</p>

It acteth in the doing of Justice and Judgment in the same way of open Courts at Westminster, and in the severall Counties of the Nation at Assizes, and Sessions, and inferior Judicatories; and these transactions are managed by the learned Judges, Justices of Peace, Stewards, Juries, and Witnesses, &amp;c. as hath been antiently accustomed.</p>

And principally it enacteth Lawes by Parliamentary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and it onely, enacting some new Laws, and repealing some old Lawes, <hi>(pro re nata)</hi> as occasion and cause requireth, and as it hath been wont to do: And herein the very form of the Commonwealth consists.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and howbeit, there have been and are various conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of persons, and also of wayes of governing by Britains, Saxons, Danes, and Normans, both in Civill and Ecclesiasticall Affairs unto this day, refining and reforming Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as need hath required; yet none of these variations may be said to abrogate or disanull the identity of the Common-wealth of England. It is true indeed, that as in some part here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, so in the later times very much that was amisse hath been amended not only in the expulsion of Antichrist in the branch in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, but also in the root by this present Parliament; as also, much good hath been by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in suppressing of arbitrary power, taking away the High Commission Court, Star-Chamber, Hierarchie, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious monuments of Popish Idolatry, &amp;c. but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it is the same Common-wealth still, yea, and English blood and spirits are yet remaining amongst us.</p>
                     <p>It is in great part with us in England, as it was with the Commonwealth of Israel, Chronichled in the Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old Testament, <hi>viz.</hi> They were the same Common-wealth of Israel, from their first establishment to be a National Commonwealth in Sinai, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 1. &amp;c. untill the utter ruine

                        <p>1. <hi>Assertion.</hi> The first of these Assertions may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested by the Parliaments Declaration, <hi>March</hi> 17. 1648. expressing the grounds of their proceedings, &amp;c. of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the present Government in the way of a free State: The Parliament Declaration containeth four remarkable Causes of such their proceedings, and setling the Government, to be viewed in a short Synopsis, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <div n="1" type="cause">
                           <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41853:11"/>
                           <p>1. <hi>Cause.</hi> The first cause was in respect of Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (set up in our Nation by the agreement of the people for their protection and better government, according to such Laws as they consented unto) which is taken away for these Reasons.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Reason.</hi> Kingly Power was perverted by most of the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stees, and most notoriously by the late King, who by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees exceeded the rest. Such his vile miscarriage is exemplified in the Parliament Declaration, by about fifty undeniable preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant instances, needlesse to insert. It were good that every English Patriot had the Declaration by him in these confused times to peruse frequently.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Reason.</hi> The Kings two eldest Sonnes appeared in actuall arms against the Parliament, so as no hope of future security could be expected unto the Nation from them.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>Reason.</hi> There is elder right of supreme power in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Land, then was in the Kings children.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Reason.</hi> If any Right or Title belonged to the Kings eldest sonne, the same is forfeited by the Fathers treasonable Act; as in other cases, even in offices of Inheritance, it is wont.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. <hi>Reason.</hi> The Kings younger children equally forfeited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same account.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. <hi>Reason.</hi> It is in the same power and authority which at first erected a King for common good, and afterwards findeth him to pervert his Kingship to common evill; it is in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whether they will continue his Kingly power, or change it to a better.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. <hi>Reason.</hi> God hath specially blessed free States, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were oppressed by tyranny, as is seen in united Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and others.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. <hi>Reason.</hi> There are manifold commodious advantages to people in Free-States: Manifold oppressions and dammages are under Monarchy: Vast expense is wont to be by Court luxury and prodigality. Profuse Donations and pensions for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Tyranny; yea, and the Court (being the nursery of vices, and corrupter of hopeful branches of noble Families) prevented in a Free State.

                           <p>2. <hi>Cause.</hi> The second cause of Parliament proceedings touched on in the Declaration, respecteth the taking away of the House of Lords, for just reasons, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Reason.</hi> The Lords sate in an house by themselves, and did not represent the people, and therefore might be well spared.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Reason.</hi> They exercised a negative Vote, tending to obstruct much.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>Reason.</hi> They exercised a juridicall power over the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and estates of all the Commons, whereof they were not competent Judges.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Reason.</hi> Their power did specially depend on the absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the King.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. <hi>Reason.</hi> The Common-Wealth could not well beare their delaies in times of exigency.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Liberty is left to such Lords, who have been, and shall be found faithfull, to choose, and to be chosen Representatives, as other competent persons have their right unto. See Declarat.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div n="3" type="cause">
                           <p>3. <hi>Cause.</hi> Thirdly, the Parliament giveth satisfactory answers to the obvious main objections against their proceedings, <hi>viz.</hi> Anticipat.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. It was intended, as it was declared <hi>April</hi> 1646. for gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Nation by King, Lords and Commons, in a confidence that the King and Peers would have applied themselves, as had been meet; but they wholly and obstinately failing therein, and there being no stipulation on both sides, it could not be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a contract; so that the Commons did most justly after their intentions.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Although some Members of the House of Commons had some force on them (it having at any time rarely happened in times of Parliament, but some force more or lesse hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised against them, or some of them, and they esteemed to be Parliament for all this) yet no breach of Priviledge can be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the remaining part in the House, which remaining part did farre exceed such authorized number, who do make an House beyond all exception.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Parliament hath declared that the Fundamentall Laws of the Nation are to be continued, as also Courts of Justice

                              <hi>Cause.</hi> Lastly, the Parliaments Declaration sheweth their just and well-grounded ends in the establishing the Common-wealth, as now it is without King and Lords: Let the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self be exactly skanned in its full and effectuall expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and it may appeare it was not force on some without the Parliament doors, but the force of right reason on the Members within the House, which hath so declared: How forcible are right words? <hi>See Iob</hi> 6. 25.</p>

                        <p>II. <hi>Assertion.</hi> The second Assertion touching the Soveraign Power of the English Parliament is taken for granted, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Parliament themselves, groundedly demonstrated in their Declaration above mentioned in the first Assertion, and likewise in their exercise of supreme power in issuing out Commissions both to subordinate Magistrates for the doing of justice, and to the Souldiery for defensive and offensive warres; but also it is taken for granted by others, rationall men in the Common-wealth, who have acted by their Commissions; and this from year to year of late whilest the King lived, as well as this present year, 1649. yea, and there are many who have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished their minds touching this matter: This hath been done by Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> (though now an adversary hereunto) in foure voluminous parts of one of his books, with a large Appendix thereunto, intituled, <hi>The Soveraigne Power of Parliaments,</hi> whither the Reader may be referred: only I doe observe herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, That God the onely Law-giver, and Soveraign King of Kings, and all supreme powers, having been graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to preserve unto us in England the substance of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth hitherto, surely he hath appointed and continued unto us the Law of Nature, contained in the Decalogue to be our rule of life in our severall capacities of inferiority and superiority, whether supreme or subordinate, as well in Civill Government, as in Church and Family; yea, to have a Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be keepers of both the Tables; see <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 6. &amp; cap. 20. 1. &amp; 12. And therefore our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions in England touching our Lawes, and the executing of them, areby lawfull commissioned persons of severall sorts

(otherwise the Law of Nature feemeth to fail) and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are lawfully administred by them. Oh that all men fearing God amongst us, specially such as have complied with the Parliament, after the King his leaving the House, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from it, would consider soberly and seriously hereof, and so take heed of daring to think, or speak, or act against those in Authority, lest they do incurre Gods fierce displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: See <hi>Numb. 12. cap. 2 Pet. 2. 10. Psal. 2. 12. It is hard for any to kick against the pricks, Acts 9. 5. and to resist the Ordinance of God, Rom.</hi> 13. 2.</p>

                        <p>III. <hi>Assertion.</hi> The third Assertion, That there is no just cause of refusing to subscribe the Engagement, in regard of the present establishment of the Common-wealth of England, without a King and House of Lords. It may be argued, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, so from the rule of our own practice, who doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our due respects to Parliaments, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. It was not taken to be prejudiciall, or dangerous to the Priviledges of Parliament, that the Lords spirituall (as they were stiled) were cashiered and expelled out of the House of Lords, albeit they had been called by Writ, and had formerly and very antiently been esteemed and reputed Members of that House.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It did not infringe the nature and being of the Parliament, that the King after a time with-drew himself totally from the House.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Parliament did retain its perfect constitution and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when very many, yea, most of the Lords, and when very many of the Commons with-drew themselves, pretending to be a Parliament at Oxford, sith a competent number remained still in the House.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is alledged out of approved Antiquaries, that in case all the Lords after a due Summons should fail to appeare and sit in the House, that their totall absence doth not, nor cannot hinder or nullifie the due Parliamentary proceedings, whereas it is destructive to the being of the Parliament, if a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent number of Commons constituted to make up an House, be absent, sith the Commons are the Representatives of the

                        <p n="5">5. It is resolved and declared by the Parliament, that the King had not a negative Vote.</p>
                        <p>These five particular instances being duely marked, together with that which the Parliament hath declared, <hi>March</hi> 17. 1648. as above, may abundantly convince, that according to this third Assertion, there is no cause of just refusall to subscribe the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to the Common-wealth of England, as it is now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished: And so the first Argument justifying the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and conscionableness of the subscription, is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>

                  <head>II. REASON.</head>
                  <p>Because subscribing the Engagement hath its due consistency and agreement with the main scope and intention of former Oaths, Protestations, and Covenants prae-ingaged in nationally unto the supreme Power of England, approved mostly on all hands; so that as right reason did then require the taking of them in their just sense, so doth the same reason now require to take the Engagement.</p>
                  <p>For the more effectuall arguing the case by this reason, these Conclusions are to be opened and considered, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Conclusion.</hi> It is presumed and taken for granted, that the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, the Protestations and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Covenants were made of lawfull things lawfully, and in the Lord, according to the sacred and divine Rule, <hi>Thou shalt sweare the Lord liveth, in Truth, in Iudgement, and in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Ier.</hi> 4. 2. For otherwise there is an undoubted nullity of them, <hi>ipse facto,</hi> sith no man ought to perform what is irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally sworn, and is in it self unrighteous and unlawfull. Of this sinfull nature have been the unlawfull and unrighteous Oaths and Subscriptions of many, many Ministers in this Land in the times of prevailing Episcopacy, and superstitious conformity; for which things sake the Land mourneth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 10. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the swearers of Canonicall obedience of the <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oath, and the Subscribers, willingly <hi>(&amp; ex animo)</hi> to the Articles by Cannon required to be subscribed unto, have cause to set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41853:13"/>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Conclusion.</hi> The main and chief scope and end of the oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance formerly; and of the Protestation and Covenant lately, and likewise of the Engagement at the present was, and is the just safety and preservation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of England, against illegall and violent usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and attempts, whether of Forreiners or Natives, of any sort and condition of persons in what kind or notion soever, as may appear by the Statutes, Acts, Declarations, and orders of those in Supreme Authority, that have required the people of the Land to submit unto the taking and subscribing of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Conclusion.</hi> It is taken for granted that the Parliament Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who ordered the Protestation first, and the Covenant after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be taken, did apprehend and judge that the said Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station and Covenant, did not contradict the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Allegiance; neither yet did the Covenantiers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any contrarinesse therein (however the Malignant Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers and Royalists might possibly think otherwise) but rather that there was a legall consistency and agreement in their sense and meaning; inasmuch as at the same time, when occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, there was a taking of the Oaths of Supremacy and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, notwithstanding the taking of the Covenant, as it is well known. For it was not the person of <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> that was sworn unto, but his Kingly legal Office, to be administred by him according to Law for the safety of the people; Because any mans person (and therefore the Kings also) being subject to such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionall accidents and incident condition, as may justly disfit and disable not only for governing, but also from being preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alive; there is therefore no just reason of swearing fealty simply &amp; absolutely, but in the Lord only, &amp; according to Law. Now there is the same reason of legall consistency and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Engagement, and with the Protestation and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as there was of the consistency and agreement of the


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41853:14"/>
Protestation and Covenant; with the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance. And albeit severall sorts of persons exercised the supreme power at severall times, <hi>viz.</hi> The King before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was called, The King, Lords and Commons a space to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether after the first sitting of the Parliament; The Commons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone at the present, yet notwithstanding the safety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was all along propounded, and to be prosecuted, and still is.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Conclusion.</hi> Every lawfull Oath, Protestation, Covenant, and Engagement, are undoubtedly sacred Obligations, and ought to be kept and preserved inviolably. For so God 1. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 12. 2. Approveth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 4. 3. Threatneth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 7. 4. Yea and punisheth breaches when it is otherwise, 2 <hi>Chron. 36. 13. Ezek.</hi> 17. 15. &amp;c. whence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance; yea, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation and the Covenant formerly taken, have in the maine scope and end of them, an obligatory force still, even the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Common-wealth, as hath been already declared.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Conclusion.</hi> Subscribing the Engagement (having it's legall consistency and agreement with former Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, and also with the Protestation and Covenant) doth engage to perform and fulfill, what <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These five Conclusions, as they have been laid open, are a sufficient way and means of making good our second reason. Let us have grace whereby we may serve the Lord acceptably, with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire, <hi>Heh.</hi> 12. 28, 29.</p>

1. Prevention of the ruine of the Common-wealth, which may be occasioned and caused through disagreement and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in point of just and requisite compliances. For when a Kingdome is divided against it self, it is brought to desolation, and every City or house divided against it self shall not stand. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 25. It is a token of Gods great controversie, when he setteth Egyptians against Egyptians, to fight every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his brother, and every one against his neighbour, City a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst City, and Kingdome against Kingdome. See <hi>Isa.</hi> 19. 2. It was a difficult and perplexed state of times in the Common-wealth of Israel, when civill warres were betwixt <hi>David</hi> and the house of <hi>Saul, 2 Sam.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. <hi>cap.</hi> but bettered &amp; more happy when matters were composed and a league made, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. And so it was an exceeding distempered state of times of late in England for some years together, when their just Liberties were endeavoured by the Parliament and their Forces (prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and covenanting thereunto) that then others of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were up in arms for tyranny, and protested for it. But the most infinitely wise and gracious God, having now been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to grant deliverance from Tyranny unto the Nation, by the Parliament and their Forces, why should not people come in and engage together, as did the Israelites above mentioned. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. Oh that we of this Nation were affected as <hi>David</hi> was (most probably on that occasion) to say or sing heartily, Psal. 133. 1. <hi>Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! &amp;c.</hi>

See <hi>Psal.</hi> 122. 6, 7, 8.) is likest to be effected and promoted in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth (as otherwise, so) by mutuall engaging to be true and faithfull thereunto. For hence good and speciall incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be to the inhabitants to exercise husbandry, trade, merchandize, building, planting, &amp;c. there being in such case oportunity to live quietly and peaceably without any distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, and to enjoy the administration of Justice and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as occasion shall require, even as it fared with the flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing Common-wealth of Israel, at such times when they had

Mat. 18. 17. 1 Tim. 4. 14. Acts</hi> 15. 2. 4. 6. &amp;c.) shall be notably and effectually accomplished by such Engagement: For thereby such as are Church-Officers, and likewise such as are Church-members, shall be disposed in their spirits, and composed in their minds and hearts, to thinke and act humbly and soberly, as becometh members of the mysticall body, whereof Christ Jesus is the head; see <hi>Rom. 12. 3, 4, 5, 6. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 10. whereas when divisions do take place, then unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable offences and scandalls are occasioned, to the Churches ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great damage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. Alas, alas! how can it be much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that Presbytery shal be generally setled throughout Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, when so many as do pretend to affect and desire it, are not only contrary minded to their brethren, who should combine together in severall associations, but do also walk contrary to the supreme power, who are the Churches nursing Fathers, and to whom it belongeth to establish and patronize Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; see <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="5">5. Rejoycing of the spirits of Christians at home and abroad, both in our own Land, and in neighbour Churches and Countreys, and their glorifying of God in such case, shall be the consequent of such Engagement, which is no small benefit: How Christians at home are taken and affected, when with one accord there is a joyning and continuing together, and what is the fruit thereof, we may see declared <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 42.—46, 47. yea, and abroad likewise, <hi>Act. 15. 31.

Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, in those dayes it shall come to passe, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the Nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Iew, saying, we will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you:</hi> Even these Prophecies and Promises may be alluded unto by way of resemblance, to denote the advantages by Englishmens concurrence unto the publike good and welfare of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>This fivefold profit insisted on, may well be an attractive to allure, and perswade to seek and follow after it, sith the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize thereof is better then the merchandize of silver, and the gaine thereof is better then gold; it is more precious then Rubies, and nothing that can be desired, is to be compared unto it.

                  <p n="3">3. In the year 1614. an aged Minister of an hoary head, and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hairs (M. <hi>Tilecoat</hi> by name of <hi>B. M.)</hi> and myself then a young man, did both of us together receive a sentence of suspension from the exercise of our Ministery, for our refusing Hierarchicall subscription and conformity to Ceremonies, declared against us by the then Chancellor of Chester, (under, which we remained for a time) who added to that our suffering, his mocking and jeering of us, that the one of us was very aged, and the other very young, as if therefore our witnesse-bearing to the truth of the Gospell were lesse to be regarded. And yet that which the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor uttered reproachfully, became unto me for confirmation and incouragement, having the good and grave old Father to be exemplary; as others of good note in Cheshire did then also judge it well might be usefull to me; whatever now some do prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conceit of the aged.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is the lesse marvell, that some do detract from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the aged and hoar-headed, whenas the same persons are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so self-willed and presumptuous in despising and speaking evill of Government and Supreme Power, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10.) whereas yet notwithstanding, God hath revealed in his word that it ought to be otherwise.

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. One would scarcely have thought that any man of common capacity to understand English, much lesse that any knowing Christian, and least of all that any Minister of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, could have had such a scruple; sith neither it's notation, nor the obvious use of the word, as it is either in the Scripture (which is full of it) or as it is in ordinary speech and acception amongst men, can give any rise for such a groundlesse scrupulous fancy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A doting about strifes of words produceth no profit, but strife, envy, railings, evill surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, even to the subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41853:18"/>
of the hearers; see 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4, 5. &amp; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14. let therfore the godly wise Christians and Ministers, avoid such questions about words clear in themselves, studying to shew themselves approved unto God, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let such wordy Questionists remember that the pious and prudent contrivers of the Directory for the publike Worship of God throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland, established by our Parliament, in that part of it which directeth about the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization of Marriage, they thought it meet that the persons to be married together should promise mutually to be faithfull unto one another: In the Directory for the Ordination of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, it is Ordered, that such as shall be ordained, do declare a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of faithfulnesse, as well as of other duties, in the exercise of their Ministery. I do hence demand, whether persons to be married, or Ministers to be ordained, should, the one sort of them scruple the accomplishment of their marriage, or the other sort scruple their Ordination, because of the Engagement to be faithfull in their relative conditions? and whether they should surcease rather therefrom upon a phantasticall conceit, that the sense of the word <hi>faithfull</hi> may be strained to some insnaring afterwards? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that as in Domestical and Ecclesiastical relations there is a requisitenesse of promising to be true and faithful, so it ought to be likewise in the relation in the Common-wealth, that there be an Engagement of faithfulnesse thereunto: If any man be otherwise minded touching being faithfull in the mentioned relations in Family, Church and Commonwealth, surely he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to give ground of just jealousie, that he meaneth not fairly; that I say no more.</p>

                  <p>VI. <hi>Object.</hi> There was a liberty granted and directed by Order of Parliament, that Preachers in giving of the Covenant should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it, and accordingly the Preacher explained it in such sense, as he apprehends stands not with his freedome of conscience to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the Engagement.</p>
