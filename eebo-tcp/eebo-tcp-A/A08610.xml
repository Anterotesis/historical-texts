            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therevpon conſidering with my ſelfe what great profit, and ſingular pleaſure might thereby come alſo to other of like mind to my ſelfe, if the ſame their excellent and rare works (diſperſed into ſeuerall pamphlets, and in part ſome thing obſcured and worne cleane out of print, and ſo out of practiſe) were by ſome painefull hand collected togither, and reuiued, or brought againe to their former good and godlie vſe in the church: mee thought I could not better ſpend my time, nor emploie my talent, either for the renowme of ſuch heroicall authors and woorthie women, or for the vniuerſall commoditie of all good chriſtians: than in, and by ſome apt treatiſe or collection, to reduce theſe their manifold works into one entire volume, and by that meanes, for to regiſter their ſo rare and excellent monuments, of good record, as perfect preſidents of true pietie and godlineſſe in woman kind to all poſteritie.

they would either by praier aſke, by meditation ponder, by precepts learne, or by examples imitate, or auoid to their comfort &amp; edification) I indeuoured for their ſakes, by all poſſible diligence, to cull and bring out of the rich ſtore and treaſurie of the approoued works of manie learned men, things both old and new concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame, both for priuate and publike vſe, adding therevnto ſuch plentie of heauenlie and ſpirituall helpes, both for profit and pleaſure, as the diuerſities of ſo diuine matter, and varietie of ſo honourable inuentions would affoord. Beſides, to auoid confuſion and diſorder (a thing verie preiudiciall to ſo holie an exerciſe) I haue carefullie digeſted the ſame into ſuch a plaine, eaſie, familiar, and certeine method, order, and direction, both for matter and maner, as I could poſſiblie deuiſe. or was requiſite for ſuch a worke, to make it profitable to the ſimple and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reader.

Thus being awaked vp laſt of all as one that gathereth after them in the vintage, I haue laboured as you ſee (good reader) like a poore gleaner or grape gatherer with reſtleſſe Ruth to go after the maidens in the harueſt, and to gleane and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for my mother Naomi certeine handfuls of corne, after the reapers and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labourers among the ſheaues, let fall of deuotion in the fruitfull feelds of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Boaz: and haue aſſailed, as you well perceiue, to repleniſh my wine preſſe with the grapes of the Lords plentifull vintage, and to fill my lampes brimfull with the oile of Gods good bleſſing and rich ſtore, left behind by the wiſe virgins in the holie veſſels of his increaſe. Here therefore if I might be ſo bold without offenſe, as in the name of the foreſaid bleſſed Boaz, I would gladlie exhort and perſuade Ruth, and in hir all other godlie women of the ſimple ſort, to followe this his good counſell (who ſaith: Heare me, my daughter, and go to none other feeld to gather, neither depart from hence to gleane, but abide here by my maidens, let thine eies be on the feeld that they doo reape in, and go thou after the maidens: and when thou art athirſt go alſo to the veſſels, and drinke of that which the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and handmaids haue drawne, and when thou art hungrie, come hither and eate of the bread, and dip thy morſell in the vineger, and ſit by the reapers, and thou ſhalt be ſatiſfied to the full.)

                  <p>As for my ſelfe (good reader) who haue rudelie as you ſee vndertaken this great labour, I proteſt, I haue doone it neither of preſumption, as he that would vſurpe the office of a Diuine, and intrude himſelfe into the ſtudies of other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions: nor of arrogancie, as he that would boaſt and make great brags of other mens labours: nor of enuie, as he that went about to make fruſtrate and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient the painfull and godlie works of better learned: neither yet of ambition or vaineglorie, as he that gaped after the praiſe and commendation of anie, or that would faine ſeeme to be approoued and regiſtred of anie Chronicler for an author, or one that knoweth ſomewhat, who in deed knowes nothing, much leſſe for all this deſerues to be thought of aboue that, which anie either of their owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or by true report doo, or ſhall ſee in me, knowe me to be, or heare of me.

O Lord, looſe me out of the bonds of this rebuke, or elſe take me vtterlie awaie from out of the earth, that I may heare no more anie reproch. Thou knoweſt, O Lord [minc innocencie,] that I neuer had deſire vnto man, and that I haue kept my ſoule cleane from all vncleanlie luſts. Thou knoweſt, O Lord, [I ſay,] that I am pure from all ſinne with man, and that I haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer polluted my name, nor the name of my father in the land of my captiuitie. I haue not kept companie with thoſe that paſſe their time in ſport: neither haue I made my ſelfe partaker with them that walke in light behauiour. I am the onelie daughter of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither hath he anie man child to be his heire, neither anie neere kinſman or child borne of him, to whom I may keepe my ſelfe for a wife. An huſband haue I conſented to take, not for my pleaſure, but in thy feare: and my ſeuen huſbands are now dead, [one after another,] and why ſhould I liue [to endure ſo great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, as to be counted a murtherer of my huſbands?

But if it pleaſe not thee that I ſhould die, [as I deſire:] for thou happilie haſt kept me to another huſband, command [then] to looke on me, &amp; to pitie me, that I doo no more heare reproch. For why, thy counſell is not in the power of man: but euerie one that ſerueth thee, is ſure of this, that if his life be in trieng, he ſhall be crowned: and if he be in trouble, that God no doubt ſhall deliuer him: &amp; if his life be in chaſtening, that he ſhall haue leaue to come vnto thy mercie. For thou haſt no pleaſure in our dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And why? After a ſtorme thou makeſt the weather faire and ſtill: after weeping and heauineſſe thou giueſt great ioie. Thy name, O God of Iſrael, be praiſed for euer, <hi>Amen.</hi>

Where is the pit of curſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, out of which doth ſpring all deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration? Is there any hel ſo profound, that is ſufficient to puniſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tenth part of my ſinnes, which in number are ſo manie, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit ſwarme of them ſo ſhadoweth my darkened ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that I can not account them, neither yet well ſee them? And I ſo farre am entred among them, that I haue no power to obteine the true knowledge of the deepe dangers of them.

                        <p>And if I looke for better, a branch therof ſhadoweth mine eies: and in my mouth doth fall, when I would ſpeake, the bitter fruit of curſed ſinne. If my ſpirit be ſtirred to harken, then the noiſe of hir leaues ſtoppeth mine eares, and filleth my noſtrils with the ſmell of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1690:39"/>
hir flowers. Behold now therefore how in paines my ſoule, a ſlaue, and priſoner without light, or comfort, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth crieng and weeping, hauing hir feete bound with the chaine of concupiſcence, and hir armes faſt tied thorough euill vſe. Who then hath power to helpe or remedie it? Not I: neither haue I power to crie for ſuccour. And as I can perceiue, there is no helpe of hope for me, but by the ſpeciall grace of God, which of my ſelfe I can not deſerue, but by Chriſt his onelie ſonne, whoſe brightneſſe giueth light to my darkneſſe: whoſe power examining my fault, breaketh the vaile of ignorance, and giueth mee cleare vnderſtanding what thing abideth in mee, where I am, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I labour.</p>
                        <p>He it is, whom I haue offended: he it is, to whom I did obeie ſo ſeldome: wherefore it is conuenient that my pride be ſuppreſſed. With weeping hart and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull ſighs, I humblie therefore confeſſe that I am much leſſe than nothing. Before my birth, mire; after a dunghill, hauing a bodie prompt to all euill, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling other ſtudie: ſubiect to care, ſorowe and paine, ſhort of life, the end vncertaine, and vnder ſin by Adam ſold, and by the lawe condemned. For of my ſelfe, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had yet the power to obſerue one onelie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, the force of ſinne was ſuch in me, and therefore is my ſinne no whit the leſſe to be hidden: and the more I cloaked and diſſembled my ſinne out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie, the more it increaſed within my hart. For what God would, that could I not will: and what hee would not, I oft times deſired to performe: which thing doth conſtraine mee by importable ſorowe, in this wearie and raging life, to wiſh the end of this miſerable bodie, through a deſired death.</p>
                        <p>Who ſhall he then be, that ſhall deliuer, or recouer anie good for me? Alas, it can be no mortall man. For his power and ſtrength is not ſuch as can deliuer me.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1690:39"/>
Who then? The onlie grace of the almightie GOD, who neuer is ſlacke to helpe the penitent with his mercie. Oh what a maiſter is that, which without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing will ſhew his mercie on ſinners! I ſerued him ſlothfullie, and without ceaſing offended him euerie daie: yet is he not ſlacke in helping me.</p>
                        <p>He doth ſee the euill that I haue, what and how much it is, and that I of my ſelfe can doo nothing that is good: but with hart &amp; bodie ſo inclined I am to the contrarie, that I feele no ſtrength in me, vnleſſe it be to doo euill. Yet doth he not tarie till I humblie praie him, or that ſeeing my hell and damnation, I doo crie vpon him: but his ſpirit whurling in my hart, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I can declare, aſketh for mee a gift, whereof the vertue is vnknowne to my little power.</p>
                        <p>And this the ſame vnknowne gift or whurling in my hart, doth bring mee a new deſire, ſhewing the good that I haue loſt by my ſinne, and giuen me againe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough his grace and bountie, that which hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all ſinne.</p>
                        <p>O my Lord, what grace and goodneſſe is this, which doth put out ſo manie ſinnes? Now may I ſee that thou art full of all godlie loue, to make me of a ſinner, thy ſeruant and child. Alas, my God, I did not ſeeke thee, but fled and ran awaie from thee: and here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, thou cameſt downe to mee, which am nothing but a woorme of the earth all naked. What doo I ſaie? A woorme? Naie, woorſe than a woorme, full of pride, deceit, malice, and treaſon. The promiſe which my friends made when I was baptiſed, is ſuch, that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, thorough faith in thy paſſion, ſhould feele the mortification of my fleſh, and dwell alwaies with thee in the croſſe, where thou waſt faſt nailed as I beleeue, and yeelded death dead, as I alſo ſhould yeeld all ſinne.</p>
                        <p>This haue I oftentimes vntied, taken downe, and ſet at large; I haue broken, denied, and falſified my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1690:40"/>
promiſe, and through pride I haue lifted vp my will in ſuch maner, that through ſloth, my dutie towards thee was forgotten, and that much more is, as well the profit, or value, which I had of thee in the daie of my baptiſme, as alſo thy ſauing loue and promiſes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, I haue all alike neglected? What ſhall I ſaie more? Albeit that oftentimes thou perceiuing mee wretched, and vnhappie, haſt giuen me ſo manie war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in faith and ſacraments, admoniſhing mee by preachings, and comforted mee by the receiuing of thy bleſſed bodie and ſacred bloud, promiſing by the ſame to put me in the number of them that now are ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with perfect innocencie: yet haue I all theſe high benefits throwne into forgetfulneſſe.</p>
                        <p>Oftentimes, O Lord, haue I with thee broken co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, &amp; partlie for that my poore ſoule was too much fed with the euill bread or damnable doctrine of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, I deſpiſed ſuch ſuccour and ghoſtlie phyſicke in Gods word, as would haue helped mee, if I had beene willing to looke for it: yet knew I at that time no tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher conuenient. For there is neither man, Saint, nor Angel, that can without thy ſpirit change the hart of a ſinner. Alas, good Ieſus, thou beholding my blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that at my neede I could haue no ſuccour of men, didſt open the waie of my ſaluation. O how great is thy goodneſſe, and how ineſtimable the ſweeteneſſe which thou haſt ſhewed therein! Is there anie father ſo naturall to the daughter, or brother to the ſiſter, which would euer haue done as thou haſt done? For thou cameſt downe into hel to ſuccour my ſoule, where againſt thy will ſhee was, intending to haue periſhed, bicauſe ſhe did not loue thee.</p>
                        <p>Alas, ſweet Lord, thou haſt loued hir, yea euen to the verie outſhedding of thy moſt pretious bloud. O cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie feruent and incomparable! Nothing ſlacke art thou in loue, that ſo louedſt euerie ſinner, yea and alſo
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1690:40"/>
thine enimies, not onelie in forgiuing their offences, but alſo in giuing thy ſelfe for their ſaluation, libertie, and deliuerance to the death, croſſe, trauell, paine, and ſufferance. When I caſt in mind what ſhould be the occaſion of thy loue towards mee, I can ſee nothing elſe but a loue woonderfull, which moueth thee to giue me that, which I can not deſerue. Then as far foorth as I can ſee, I ought to giue no thanks for my ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but onlie to thee my Lord Ieſu, to whom I owe the praiſe thereof, as to him which is my Sauior and Creator.</p>

Oh what grace is this, that ſo ſuddenlie thou vouchſafeſt to drawe my ſoule into ſuch highnes, that ſhe feeleth hir ſelfe ruler of my bodie! She poore, ignorant, and lame, doth find hir ſelfe with thee rich, wiſe, and ſtrong, bicauſe thou haſt written in hir hart, the roote of thy ſpirit and holie word, giuing hir true faith to receiue it, which thing made hir to conceiue thy ſonne, in beleeuing him to be man, God, Sauiour, and alſo the true forgiuer of ſinnes. Therefore doeſt thou aſſure hir, that ſhee is mother to thy Sonne, of whome thou art the onlie father.</p>

                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1690:41"/>
And furthermore, O my father, here is a great loue of thy well dooing, that thy holie ſonne hath taken on him the bodie of a man, &amp; hath mingled himſelfe with our aſhes, which thing we may not vnderſtand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a moſt true faith. It hath pleaſed thee to put him ſo neere vs, that he did ioine himſelfe to our fleſh, and I ſeeing him to be called man, am bold to call him bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now ſith my ſoule may ſaie of hir ſelfe, that ſhee is the ſiſter of God, ought ſhe not to haue hir ſelfe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in him? Yes trulie. For thou doeſt declare with great loue, that hir creation was onlie of thy good wil, which it pleaſeth thee alwaies to haue towards hir, giuing aſſurance, that before hir firſt daie, or time of being prouided for hir, thou thorough loue haſt made hir, as thou of power alone canſt well doo it, and alſo didſt put hir within this bodie, not for to ſlacke with ſloth, but that both of them ſhould haue none other exerciſe, but only to thinke how to doo ſome ſeruice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</p>
                        <p>Then this truth maketh hir to feele that there is in thee true paternitie. O what honor, what ſweetneſſe, and what glorie hath the ſoule, which doeth alwaies remember that ſhe is thy daughter, and that in calling thee father, ſhee doth thy commandement! What is there more? Is that all? No, it doth pleaſe thee to giue hir another name, to call hir thy wife, and that ſhe againe doo call thee huſband, declaring therby how thou haſt freelie manifeſted the mariage of hir. By baptiſme haſt thou made a promiſe, to giue hir thy goods and riches, and to take on thee hir ſinnes: for ſhe hath nothing by heritage but ſinne of hir firſt father Adam. All hir treaſures that ſhe hath of nature, are nothing elſe but ſinnes, which thou haſt tied vpon the Croſſe, and paid all hir debts with thy goodes &amp; lands.</p>
                        <p>Thou haſt made hir ſo rich, and with ſo great a ioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture endued hir, that ſhe knowing hir ſelfe to be thy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1690:41"/>
wedded wife, doth beleeue to be quit of all that ſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, eſteeming verie little that ſhee hath heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. She forſaketh hir old father, and all the goods that he giueth hir, for hir huſbands ſake. For ſurelie, O my GOD, it hurteth my ſoule to be fed with ſuch good: and againe releeued in leauing the pleaſures of this world, for that which is eternal, and where peace is without warre. Father, alas, what ought I to thinke? Shall my ſpirit be ſo bold as to take vpon him to call thee father? yea, and alſo our father, for ſo haſt thou taught in the <hi>Pater noſter.</hi> But to call me daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, haſt thou ſo ſaid? I praie thee tell me. Alas, yea Lord, when with great ſweetnes thou ſaiedſt: Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lend me thy hart: and againe, thou ſaiedſt, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy faith hath ſaued thee.</p>
                        <p>O my ſoule, inſtead of lending, my Lord is readie to giue himſelfe wholie vnto thee: receiue him then, and do not permit that anie creature put him from thee, ſo that for euer with faithfull ſtedfaſtneſſe he may loue thee, with a daughterlie loue. Now my Lord, if thou be my father, may I thinke that I may be thy mother? Indeede I can not well perceiue, how I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thee that createdſt me: but in this matter, thou diddeſt ſatiſfie my doubt, when in preaching and in ſtretching forth thy hands, thou didſt ſaie, Thoſe that ſhall do the will of my father, they are my brethren, my ſiſter, and my mother. I beleue then, that hearing, and reading the words that thou haſt taught, and vttered by thy holie Prophets and Apoſtles: the ſame alſo which through thy true Preachers thou doſt dailie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto men, in beleeuing it, and ſtedfaſtlie deſiring to fulfill the ſame, I conceiue thee, and beare thee by loue.</p>
                        <p>Therfore without anie feare I wil take vpon me the name of a mother. What? Mother of Chriſt? O ſweet virgine Marie, I beſeech thee be not angrie that I

take vp ſuch a title: I do neither ſteale, nor vſurpe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing vpon thy priuiledge, for thou onelie aboue all women, receiuedſt of him ſo great honour, that no man can in himſelfe comprehend, how he hath beene willing to take in thee our fleſh: for thou art the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and perfect virgine, before, and after, and in his holie birth. In thy bleſſed wombe thou didſt beare him and nouriſh him, thou didſt followe him in his tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and alſo in his teachings. Now brieflie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, thou haſt with God found ſuch grace, as the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie through malice and deceit had cauſed Adam and his poſteritie to loſe: by Eue, and him we haue loſt it, and by the Sonne hath it been yeelded vnto vs againe.</p>
                        <p>Therefore haſt thou bene rightfullie called full of grace, as one to whome the Lord hath ſhewed aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant fauour. Sith then that he, which is the beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that be good, and alſo the ſpring of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and power, hath created in thee ſo pure innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, endued thee with ſuch grace, &amp; exalted thee to ſuch dignitie, that he in thee, of all other the example of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, hath builded his dwelling and temple: he through loue did confirme himſelfe with thee, and thou through grace art confirmed in him, therefore no man can giue thee greater praiſe, then God himſelfe hath giuen thee, for there is no ſuch praiſe, as is the ſame, which commeth from God. Thou alſo haſt had ſo firme and conſtant a faith, that thou by the holie Ghoſt waſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with all godlineſſe. I will not take vpon me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to giue to thee greater praiſe, than the honour which thy ſonne and ſoueraigne Lord hath giuen thee.

is great, for thou haſt broken the kindred of mine old father, calling me daughter by adoption. Seeing then that we haue both one father, I will not feare to call thee my brother.

Alas my brother, I wiſh for nothing elſe, but that in wounding thee, I might finde my ſelfe wounded with thy loue, to that would I giue ouer my ſelfe. And likewiſe, thou doeſt call mee wife, ſpeaking to me theſe amorous words: Ariſe my deere doue, and come hitherward my delectable ſpouſe. Wherefore I may ſaie with louing faith, Thou art mine, and I am thine, bicauſe thou haſt called me thy loue and faire ſpouſe. If I be ſo, ſuch haſt thou made me. Alas, doth it pleaſe thee to giue me ſuch names? Trulie they are able to breake the hart, and cauſe it to burne through loue vnſpeakeable, when it thinketh vpon the honour that thou doeſt vnto the ſoule, which is much greater than it hath deſerued. A mother, a mother? Alas, but of what child is it? My God, my ſonne? O Ieſus what ſpeech is this! Mother, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſiſter, and brother. O happie kindred! O what ſweetneſſe doth proceede out of that paternitie! But what daughterlie and reuerent feare ought I to haue towards him, my father, yea and my creator, my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and ſauiour, to be my brother? Alas, heere is a great loue: I will therfore ſaie with Salomon, Now can my hart no longer refraine, but breake in ſunder, to make roome for the ſame ſo ſweete a brother, ſo that none other name be written in the ſame, but onlie the name of my brother Ieſus the ſonne of God. None o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature will I giue place to, for all the ſcurging and beating that can be done vnto me: keepe my hart then my deere brother and loue, and let not thine eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie enter into it.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> My ſweete Father, my child, my brother, and ſpouſe, with hands ioined, humblie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my knees I yeeld thee thanks and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that it pleaſeth thee to turne thy face towards me, conuerting my hart, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering me with ſuch grace, that thou doeſt ſee no more my euils and ſinnes. So well haſt thou hidden them, that it ſeemeth thou haſt put them in forgetfulneſſe: yea and alſo they ſeeme to be forgotten of me, which haue done and committed them. For faith and loue ſo working in me, cauſeth me to forget them, wholie put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my truſt in thee alone.</p>
                        <p>Then my Father, in whome lieth vnfeigned loue, whereof can I haue feare in my hart? I confeſſe that I haue done all the euill that one creature can doo, and that of my ſelfe I am naught. Alſo, I haue offended thee, as did the prodigall child, following the fooliſh trade of the fleſh, wherewith I haue prodigallie ſpent the ſubſtance and aboundance of goodes, which thou heere haſt giuen me to vſe to thy glorie: and for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of them, pouertie hath taken me, and hath withered me awaie, euen as haie, and yeelded my ſpirit dead for hunger, compelling me to eate the reliefe of ſwine: but in ſuch meates I found verie little ſauour. Then I ſeeing my life to be ſo miſerable, did returne to thee my father againe, ſaieng: Alas deere father, I haue ſinned againſt heauen, and before thee, I am therefore no more Worthie to be called thy child. But O bountifull and mercifull father, do thou no worſſe to me, than to one of thy houſhold ſeruants. Alas, deere father, what loue and zeale is this, that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not tarie my comming and praier, but ſpeedilie
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1690:43"/>
ſtretching foorth thy hands, receiuedſt me, when I did thinke thou wouldeſt not looke on me: and ſo receiuing me, in ſtead to haue puniſhed me, thou didſt aſſure me of my ſaluation? Where is he then that ſhall puniſh me, when my father ſhall denie him my ſinne? There is no Iudge that can condemne me, vnleſſe God himſelfe will damne me: the want of goodneſſe I feare not, for I haue my God for my father: my enimie ſhall do me no harme, for my father will take all his ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie from him. If I owe any thing, he ſhall paie it for me: if I haue deſerued death, he as a King ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, and deliuer me from priſon and death.</p>
                        <p>But heere is the woorſt, what maner of mother haue I beene? For, after that I by faith had receiued the name of a true mother, I became verie rude vnto thee my Sonne: becauſe that after I had conceiued and brought thee foorth, I left reaſon, and being ſubiect to my will, not taking heed vnto thee, I fell aſleepe, and gaue place to my great enimie, the which, in the night of ignorance, I being aſleepe, did ſteale thee from me craftilie, and in thy place ſhe did put hir child, which was dead, and ſo I did leeſe thee, which was a ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full remorſe for me. Thus did I looſe thee my ſonne, by mine owne fault, becauſe I tooke no heed to keepe thee. Senſualitie my neighbour, I beeing in my beaſtlie ſleepe, did ſteale thee from me, and gaue to me hir child, which had no life in him, named ſinne, whome I ſaid I would not haue, but vtterlie did forſake him.</p>
                        <p>She affirmed, that he was mine owne, but I knew him to be hirs. For as ſoone as I came to the light of grace, which thou hadſt giuen me, then I knewe my glorie to be changed, when I ſaw the dead child not to be mine. For the ſame which was aliue, whom ſhe had taken awaie, was my child: ſo apparant was the change betweene Ieſus and ſinne. But now heere is a ſtrange thing, this old woman cauſeth me to keepe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1690:44"/>
this dead child, whome ſhe reporteth to be mine, and ſo will ſhe mainteine. O Salomon, thou true and wiſe Iudge, thou haſt heard this lamentable proceſſe, and ordeined to content the parties, that the child ſhould be diuided in two parts. The falſe woman agreeth it ſhould be ſo, but I remembring him to be mine owne ſonne, which was aliue, was rather content to leeſe him, than to ſee his bodie parted in twaine. For true and perfect loue is neuer content with the one halfe of that it loueth: rather I had therefore to weepe for the whole, than to recouer the one halfe without life. Alas noble Salomon, giue her the child which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. For better it is for me to die, than to ſee my ſonne diuided. But my Lord, thou didſt better looke to it, than I. For thou ſeeing the anguiſh that I did ſuffer, and how I rather did forſake my right, than to behold ſuch cruelneſſe, thou ſaiedſt, This is the true mother, and ſo cauſed them to giue me my child againe, for whome before my hart was ſorowfull.</p>
                        <p>O ſweete Ieſus, thus haſt thou proued me, how much I loued thee: yea and when by ſinne I had loſt thee, yet didſt thou returne vnto me. Alas, how gentlie doeſt thou vouchſafe to come againe to hir, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing let by ſinne, could not keepe thee my ſweete child, my ſweete ſonne, my helper, my nouriſher, of whome I am an humble creature? Do not permit that euer I do leaue thee againe, for I do repent the time paſt.</p>
                        <p>Now come ſenſualitie with thy rablement of ſinnes, thou haſt no power to make me to receiue thy dead child. For my ſonne is ſtrong, and will defend me, he ſhall not permit that thou take him anie more awaie from me, his ſtrength is greater than anie others, therefore may I ſleepe and take reſt neere him. For all things well conſidered, he ſhall keepe me from thine aſſaults. O ſweete reſt of the mother, and the ſonne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, my ſweete child, my God, onlie vnto thee be the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1690:44"/>
honour and praiſe, for that euerie creature may ſee, how it hath pleaſed thee to call me (leſſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) a mother: and the more it is ſtrange and hard to be done, the more ought thy goodneſſe to haue praiſe for it. And further, thou haſt retained me for thy ſiſter, wherefore I acknowledge my ſelfe more bound, than to anie other creature.</p>
                        <p>Now I am ſiſter vnto thee, but ſo naughtie a ſiſter, that better it were for me that I were without the name, than I to forget the name of adoption in ſo noble a kindred, and alſo thy good and brotherlie beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour towards me. I with pride did riſe againſt thee, and not remembring my faults, but going aſtraie from thee, did agree with Aaron my brother, being in will to giue iudgement againſt thy works; and folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the example of Miriam, priuilie I grudged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, which thing cauſed me to haue remorſe in my conſcience. Alas right bountifull brother, and true Moſes, which doeſt all with goodneſſe and iuſtice, I haue eſteemed thy workes to be euen ſinne, being ſo bold to ſpeake euen raſhlie, ſaieng: Wherefore haſt thou maried a ſtrange woman? Thou giueſt vs a law, and puniſhment, if we do not fulfill it, and then thou wouldeſt not be bound to it, forbidding vs the thing which thou thy ſelfe doeſt.</p>
                        <p>For thou forbiddeſt vs to kill anie man, and thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt kill, and ſpareſt none, of three thouſand, which thou commandedſt to be ſlaine. Further, God gaue vs in commandement by thee, that we ſhould not marrie the daughter of a ſtranger, yet thou tookeſt thy wife from among them. Alas my deere brother Moſes, with a great manie of theſe words, which I knowe to be fooliſh, with Aaron and Miriam, which is mine owne wit, I imbraided thee, wherof I repent. For the liuelie voice of God, rebukinglie tooke me vp before I went out of the place. What wouldeſt thou then of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1690:45"/>
my ſinne? Thou wouldeſt not haue me puniſhed, but rather wouldeſt my ſaluation and health, in aſking for me this great benefit, that it might pleaſe God to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate his iudgement, the which thing thou couldeſt not obtaine. Wherefore I became a Lazar, ſo that all that looked on mee might well ſaie, I had not beene wiſe: and for mine vncleannes and leproſie, I was put out from the tents and tabernacles, from among the people, becauſe the ſicke ſhould not infect ſuch as were whole. Oh what ſoule can haue a greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than to be baniſhed out of the companie of them which are holie in God! But what didſt thou my ſweet loue and brother, ſeeing my repentance? Thou proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedſt that my penance was ſoone at an end, and with true loue madeſt meanes for me, wherevpon I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to thee. O what brother would, in ſtead to puniſh his fooliſh ſiſter, ſo naturallie cleaue vnto hir? For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, grudge, and great offence by hir committed, thou giueſt hir grace, and loue in recompenſe. Alas my brother, how exceeding is this thy loue? Much more is it than brotherhoode is bound to giue, to ſo poore and wretched a woman as I am. I haue done thee euill, and thou giueſt me good for it. I am thine, and thou ſaieſt, thou art mine: euen ſo I am, and euer will. I feare no more the great fooliſhneſſe of Aaron and Miriam, for no man may ſeparate me from thee; and now that we are together, as brother and ſiſter, I care little for all other, for thy land is mine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                        <p>Let vs then keepe, if it pleaſe thee, but one houſhold, ſith it hath pleaſed thee to humble thy ſelfe ſo much, as to ioine thy hart with mine, in making thy ſelfe a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie man. I do right hartilie thanke thee, and to thanke thee as I ought, lieth not in my power. Take my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then I praie thee, &amp; excuſe mine ignorance, ſeeing I am of ſo great a kindred as to be thy ſiſter. O my
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1690:45"/>
God, I haue good cauſe to loue, to praiſe, and to ſerue thee vnfeignedlie, and not to feare, nor deſire anie thing ſaue thee onlie. Keepe me well then I humblie praie thee, for I will aſke none other brother nor friend to helpe me. If anie father haue had anie pitie vpon his children; if anie mother haue taken anie care for hir ſonne; if anie brother haue hid the ſinne of his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, it is thou.</p>

                        <p>There haue beene manie of them, which for to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge their wrongs, haue cauſed the Iudges to put them to death.

And ſome, perceiuing their euill diſpoſitions, haue ſhut them vp in priſon. Now brieflie to conclude vpon their diuers complexions, the end of their pretence is puniſhment, and the leaſt harme that euer I could perceiue in puniſhing them, is this, that they would neuer ſee them againe. But I do wiſh, that all of this mind ſhould rather helpe to turne them, than to forſake them. And therfore my God, I can find no man comparable vnto thee: for of loue thou art the perfect example. Now therefore I confeſſe with low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hart, that I haue broken to thee mine oth &amp; promiſe.</p>
                        <p>Alas, thou hadeſt choſen me for thy wife, and didſt ſet me vp in great ſtate and honour. For what greater honour may one haue, than to be in the place of thy

wife, which ſweetelie taketh hir reſt ſo neere to thee, and not onlie in ſuretie of ſoule and bodie, but alſo of all thy goodes, Queene, Miſtreſſe, and Ladie? O what great fauour is it, that I ſo vile a creature, am ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobliſhed by thee to ſo honourable an huſband! Now to ſpeake it brieflie, I haue more by poſſeſſing of thee, than anie man mortall can deſire. Yet, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member mine vnwoorthie deſeruing, my hart doth ſob and ſigh, mine eies let fall abundance of teares, my mouth can not make too manie exclamations. For there is neither new nor ancient writings, that can ſhew ſo pitifull a caſe as the ſame is which I tell now. Shall, or dare I tell it? May I pronounce it without ſhame? Yea, for it is my confuſion, not to ſhew the great loue of my huſband: and for his worſhip to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my fault.</p>
                        <p>O my ſauiour, which waſt crucified on the croſſe for my ſinnes, this deede of thine is not ſuch, as a father to leaue his ſonne, or as a child to offend his mother, or as a ſiſter to chide and grudge. But alas, my fault is ſuch, and far greater. For the more familiaritie I haue with thee, and the more benefits I receiue of thee, the greater is mine offence, when I with thee diſſemble; ſpeciallie that I ſhould ſo doo, which am called thy ſpouſe, and loued of thee as thy ſoule. Shall I now tell the truth? O my ſpouſe, I haue left thee, forgotten thee, and am run awaie from thee; I did leaue thee, for to go at my vaine pleaſure: I forſooke thee, and choſe me another: yea I refuſed thee the welſpring of all goodneſſe, and faithfull promiſe. I did leaue thee. But whither went I? Into a place where nothing was but curſedneſſe.</p>
                        <p>I haue left thee my truſtie friend and louer, worthie to be beloued aboue all others: I haue put thee aſide, O welſpring of all health ſomnes, by mine owne wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched will: yea I haue forſaken thee, full of beautie,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1690:46"/>
goodneſſe, wiſedome, and power, and ſought to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe me from thy loue. I haue accepted thy great enimies, that is, the diuell, the world, and the fleſh, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whome for my ſake thou foughtedſt ſo ſore on the croſſe, to ſet me at libertie, which was by them of long time a priſoner and ſlaue, and ſo bound, that no man could cauſe me to humble my ſelfe. And as for the loue and charitie that I ſhould haue had towards thee, they did quench it; ſo that the name of Jeſus my deare huſband, which before I had found ſo ſweet, was to me tedious and hatefull, ſo that oftentimes I did ieſt at it: and when I haue heard the Goſpell prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched or taught, the word which I haue hard, hath not tarried with me, but as a feather doth in the winde.</p>
                        <p>I went neuer yet to heare thy word preached, but for a faſhion onlie, which was a worke of hypocriſie: I was alſo annoied, when I hard ſpeake of thee, becauſe I was more willing to go at my pleaſure. Now brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to conclude, all that thou didſt forbid me, I fulfilled: and all that thou commandedſt me to do, I did eſchue, and this was the cauſe why I loued not thee. But yet Lord, for all that I did thus hate thee, and forſake thee, ran awaie from thee, and betraied thee, ſhould I giue place to anie other? Haſt thou ſuffered, that I ſhould be mocked, either yet beaten, or killed? Haſt thou put me in darke priſon, or baniſhed me for euer, ſetting naught by me? Haſt thou taken awaie thy gifts and pretious iewels againe from me, to puniſh me for my vnfaithfull fruits? Haue I loſt my iointure, which thou promiſedſt me, through mine owne offence done againſt thee? Am I accuſed by thee, afore the eternall father, for a naughtie woman? Haſt thou forbidden me thy preſence, as I haue deſerued, and that I ſhould neuer appeare in thine houſe?</p>
                        <p>O moſt true huſband, pure and perfect friend, the moſt louing among all louers! Alas, thou haſt done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1690:47"/>
for me. For thou haſt diligentlie ſought for me, when I was going into the moſt deepe place of Hell, where all euils are done. When I was fartheſt from thee, both in hart and mind, and directlie out of the waie, then didſt thou louinglie call me backe, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng, My deare daughter, hearken and ſee, and vow thine eare toward me: forget that ſtrange nation, with whome thou haſt run aſtraie, and alſo the houſe of thine owne father, where thou haſt dwelt ſo long, and then ſhall the King of all faithfulneſſe deſire thy beautie. But when thou Lord ſaweſt, that thy ſweete and gratious calling did not profit me, then beganneſt thou to crie to me with a lowd voice, ſaieng: Come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me all you which are wearilie loden with labour, for I am he that ſhall plentiouſlie refreſh you, and feed you with the bread of life.</p>
                        <p>Alas, ſweet Lord, vnto all theſe ſweet words would I not hearken, but rather doubted whether it were thou, that ſo ſpake vnto me, or elſe a fabulous writing that ſo ſaid. I was ſo fooliſh, that without loue I read thy word: I conſidered not the compariſon of the Uineyard, which brought foorth thornes and briers in ſtead of good fruit, and that it ſignified me, that ſo had done. I knew alſo, that when thou didſt call the barren wife, ſaieng, Returne Shulamite, that thou didſt ſpeake it, that I ſhould forſake my ſinnes. Yet for all theſe words did I, as though I had vnderſtood neuer a whit. But when I had peruſed the Prophet Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, I confeſſe that I had in the reading thereof, feare in my hart, and baſhfulneſſe in my face. I will tell it, yea with teares in mine eies, and all Lord for thine honor, &amp; to ſuppreſſe my pride. Thou haſt ſaid by that holie Prophet: If a woman haue offended hir huſband, and is ſo left of him, for going aſtraie with other: if he therevpon refuſeth hir, is ſhe not to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed polluted, and of no value?</p>

The lawe doth conſent to put hir in the hands of iuſtice, or to driue hir awaie, and ſo neuer to take hir againe. Thou haſt made a ſeparation betweene thy bed and mine, ſaith he vnto me, and placed forren lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in my roome, committing with them fornication: yet for all this, thou maiſt returne to me againe, for I will not alwaies be angrie againſt thee. Lift vp ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine eies, and looke about thee on euerie ſide, and then ſhalt thou well ſee, into what place thy ſinne hath lead thee, and how filthilie thou lieſt in the earth. O poore ſoule, looke where thy ſinne hath put thee, euen vpon the high waies, where thou didſt waite, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to beguile them that came by, euen as a theefe doth, which is hidden in the wilderneſſe. Therefore thou, in fulfilling thy wicked pleaſure, haſt with forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation infected all the earth, which was about thee: thine eies, thy forehead, and thy face, haue loſt all their good maner, for they were ſuch as an harlot hath, and yet thou hadeſt no ſhame of thy ſinne.</p>
                        <p>And the ſurplus that Ieremie ſaith, conſtreineth me to knowe my wretched life, and to wiſh with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull ſighes, the houre, the moneth, the daie, the yeare, and time that my life might haue an end, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my ſelfe condemned, and worthie to lie for euer in the euerlaſting fire. The ſame feare which proceedeth of thee, and not of my ſelfe, putteth me rather in hope, than in deſpaire, as often as I do remember my ſinne. For as ſoone as thou knoweſt my will, bowing vnder thine obedience, then putting in me a liuelie faith, thou didſt vſe great clemencie, ſo that after I knewe thee to be that ſame Lord, Maiſter, and King, whome I ought to haue feared, then found I my feare not quenched, but mixed with loue, beleeuing that thou art ſo gratious, gentle, and ſweete, and ſo pitifull an huſband, that I which ſhould rather haue hid me, than to haue ſhewed my ſelfe, was not then in feare to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1690:48"/>
go foorth, and to looke for thee, &amp; ſo ſeeking, I found thee.</p>
                        <p>But what didſt thou then? Didſt thou refuſe me? No Lord, but rather haſt excuſed me. Haſt thou turned thy face from me? No, for thine eie ſo ſweetlie penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my hart, that wounding it almoſt to the death, it did giue to me remorſe of my ſinnes. Thou haſt not put me backe with thy hand: but with both thine armes, and with a ſweet and manlie hart, thou didſt meete with me by the waie, and not once reprouing my faults, embracedſt me. I could not ſee in beholding thy countenance, that euer thou didſt once perceiue mine offences: wherefore thou haſt done ſo much for me, as though I had neuer broken promiſe with thee. For thou didſt hide my fault from euerie bodie, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing me againe the part of thy bed, and alſo in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the multitude of my ſinnes are ſo hidden and ouercome by thy great victorie, that thou wilt neuer remember them more: ſo that now thou ſeeſt nothing in me, but the graces, gifts, and vertues, which it hath pleaſed thy free goodneſſe to giue me.</p>
                        <p>O charitie moſt pretious! I do ſee well, that thy goodneſſe doth conſume my lewdneſſe, and maketh me a new, godlie, and ioifull creature. The euill that was mine, thou haſt deſtroied, and made me ſo perfect a creature, that all the good a huſband can do to his wife, thou haſt done it to me, in giuing me a faithfull hope in thy promiſes.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Las, what is this? For caſting mine eies on high, I ſee thy goodnes, thine vnknowne grace, and thy loue ſo incomprehenſible, that my ſight is woonderfull in beholding thee: but looking downeward, I might ſee what I am, and what I was willing to be. Alas, I do ſee in it the lewdeneſſe, darkeneſſe, and extreme deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mine euils. My death, which by humblenes clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth mine eie: the admirable goodneſſe of thee, and the vnſpeakable euill, which is in me: thy right highnes, &amp; pure maieſtie, my right fragill and mortall nature: thy gifts, goods &amp; beatitude, my malice &amp; great vnkindnes.</p>
                        <p>O how good art thou vnto me! and how vnking haue I bene vnto thee? this that thou wilt, and this that I purſue? Which things conſidered, cauſeth me to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, how it pleaſeth thee to ioine thy ſelfe to me, ſeeing there is no compariſon betweene vs both. Thou art my God, and I am thy worke: thou my creator, and I thy creature. Now to ſpeake brieflie, though I cannot define, what it is to be of thee; yet know I my ſelfe to be the leaſt thing that may be compared vnto thee. O moſt happie loue! Thou madeſt this agreement, when thou didſt ioine life &amp; death together, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnion hath made aliue death; life dieng, and life without end, haue made our death a life. Death hath giuen vnto life a quickning, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> through death I being dead, may receiue life; and by death, I am rauiſhed with him which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. I liue in him, otherwiſe of my ſelf I am dead. And as concerning bodelie death, to me it is nothing, but a comming out of priſon: death is to me life, for through death, I am aliue. And as this mortall life filleth me full of care and ſorowe, ſo death yeeldeth me content.</p>

O what a godlie thing is it to die, that the ſoule may liue! For in deliuering hir from this mortall death, ſhe is deliuered from the death miſerable, and matched with hir moſt mightie louer. Is not then the ſoule blameleſſe, which faine would by to haue life? Yes tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and ought to call death hir welbeloued friend. O ſweet death, pleaſant ſorowe, mightie king, deliuering from all wickednes! O Lord, thoſe which truſt in thee, and in thy death, are mortified by the hope they haue in thy paſſion.</p>
                        <p>Thus with a ſweet ſleepe doſt thou put them out of that death, which cauſeth manie to lament. O how happie is the ſame ſleepe vnto him, which when he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waketh, doth find through thy death, life euerlaſting! For death is none other thing to a Chriſtian man, but a libertie or deliuerance from his mortall band: and the death which is fearefull to the wicked, is pleaſant and acceptable to them that are good, bicauſe that death through death is deſtroied.</p>
                        <p>Therefore my God, if I were rightlie taught, I ſhould call death life, the end of labour, and beginning of euerlaſting ioie. For I knowe that long life doth let me from the ſight of thee. O death come and doe thine office on me, that I may ſee my ſpouſe: or elſe ſweet loue, tranſforme me in thee, and then ſhall I the better tarie the comming of death! O ſweet Lord, let me die, that I may liue with thee! For there is none other that can deliuer me, but thou onelie. O my Sauiour, through faith I am planted and ioined with thee. O what vnion is this, ſith that through faith I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured to thee, and may call thee father, brother, ſonne, and huſband!</p>
                        <p>O my father! what paternitie? O my brother! what fraternitie? O my child! what delectation? O my ſpouſe! what coniunction is this? A father full of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, a brother hauing our ſimilitude, a ſonne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1690:49"/>
through faith and loue, a huſband louing and releeuing in all extremitie. But whom doſt thou loue? Alas, it is ſhe whom thou haſt withdrawne from the ſnare, wherin through malice ſhe was bound, and haſt put hir in place, name, and office of a daughter, ſiſter, mother, and wife. O my Sauiour, it is a great ſauour of ſweetneſſe, right pleaſant, and delectable; when a ſoule after the hearing of thy word, ſhall cal thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, his father, his brother, child and ſpouſe: ſuch a ſoule doubtleſſe may continuallie burne in loue.</p>
                        <p>Is there anie loue, vnleſſe it be this maner of loue, but it hath ſome euill condition? Is there anie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be hereto compared? Is there anie honour to this, but may be accounted ſhame? Yea, is there anie profit equall to this? Moreouer to conclude, is there any thing, that I could more earneſtlie loue? Alas no. For he that vnfeinedlie loueth God, reputeth all theſe things wordlie, of leſſe valure than the dunghill. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, profit, and honour of this world, are all but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and trifles vnto him which hath found God. Such loue is ſo profitable, honourable, &amp; abundant in grace, that I dare ſaie, ſhe onlie ſufficeth the hart of a godlie ſoule, and yeeldeth hir ſo conſtant, that ſhe neuer deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, or would haue other. For whoſoeuer hath God, as he ought to be had, accounteth all other things ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous or vaine.</p>
                        <p>Now thanked be my Lord, and my father; through faith I haue gotten the ſame loue: wherfore I ought to be ſatiſfied and content. Now haue I thee my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for defence of my want on fooliſhnes, and my long youth. Now haue I thee my brother, for to ſuccour my ſorowes, wherein I find no end. Now haue I thee my ſonne, for my feeble age, as an onlie ſtaie. Now haue I thee a true and faithfull huſband, for the ſatiſfieng of my whole hart. And now, ſith I haue thee, I will, and doo forſake all them that are in the world, holding thee
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1690:50"/>
faſt, that thou maieſt no more eſcape me. Seeing now that I haue poſſeſſed thee, I will look vpon none other thing, that might keepe me backe, from the beholding of thy diuinitie. Seeing that I doo heare thee, I will heare nothing that letteth me from the fruition of thy voice. Seeing that I may freelie talke with thee, I will common with none other. Seeing it pleaſeth thee to put me ſo neere thee, I will rather die, than to touch anie other: and ſeeing I ſerue thee, I will ſerue none other. Seeing that thou haſt ioined thy hart with mine, if it depart from thee, let it be puniſhed for euer. For the departing from thy loue is harder than any damnation. I doo not feare the paine of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hels, as I doo feare the once looſing of thee.</p>
                        <p>Alas my God, my Father, and Creator, doo not thou ſuffer that the enimie, inuenter of all ſinne, haue anie power to make mee to looſe thy preſence. For whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall feele the loſſe of thy loue, ſhall ſaie, he would rather be bound for euer in hell, than to feele the paine thereof one moment of time. O my Sauiour, doo thou not permit, that euer I depart from thee againe; but that it may pleaſe thee, to put me in ſuch a place, that my ſoule, through wantonneſſe of ſinne, be neuer ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from thy loue.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1690:50"/>
but onlie bicauſe he would, for my ſake, vnder the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of mortall death? Now is Ieſus dead, in whom we are all dead, and through his death we all ſhall liue: I meane thoſe, which through faith are partakers of his paſſion. For euen as the death, before the great myſterie of the croſſe, was hard to euerie man, &amp; there was no man but was feared therewith, conſidering the copulation of the bodie, and the ſoule, their order, loue, and agreement; ſo were their ſorowes extreme, in departing of the one from the other.</p>
                        <p>But ſince it hath pleaſed the ſweet Lambe to offer himſelfe vpon the croſſe, his great loue hath kindled a fire within the hart, ſo vehement, that euerie true beleeuer eſteemeth the paſſage of death but a plaie, or paſtime, and ſo prouoketh other conſtantlie to die. And euen as the feare of death doth retrograde vs: ſo ought loue to giue vs a deſire to die. For if true loue be vnfainedlie within the hart of man, he can feele none other thing; bicauſe loue is ſo ſtrong of it ſelfe, that ſhe keepeth all the room, and putteth out all other deſires, ſuffering nothing there but God onlie. For whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer true and perfect loue is, there is remembred nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feare, nor ſorowe: yet our owne pride to attaine honour, cauſeth vs to ſeeke death by manie ſtrange waies. As if a man, to haue his fooliſh pleaſure, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe in ieopardie of life: if a merchant, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine riches, doth danger himſelfe ſomtime for a ſmall value: if the theefe, conceiuing of roberie, or murther, crueltie, or deceit, doth ſo blind a man, that he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing the danger of death, neither yet miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, when he ſeeketh to aduenge himſelfe, or doth any other euill: if the furie of ſickneſſe, or the rankeneſſe of melancholie, cauſeth a man fiercelie to wiſh for death, or oftentimes to drowne, hang, or kill themſelues. Such euils are ſometimes ſo great, that they cauſe their pained patient to chooſe death for libertie. If it

ſo be then, that theſe paines full of euils and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, cauſe them not to feare the hazard of death, but rather to thinke that death tarieth too long: alas, what ought true &amp; laudable loue to doo? What ought the loue of the eternall creature to wiſh? Should ſhe ſtir a hart in ſuch wiſe, that ſhe being maiſtered with ſuch affections, ſhould feele none other thing in hir? Alas yea. For death is a pleaſant thing to the ſoule, which is in loue with God, and eſteemeth the paſſage eaſie, thorough the which ſhe commeth out of priſon. For the hard waie, where through ſhe commeth, can be no let for hir to embrace hir huſband. O my Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, how good and pleaſant is the ſame death, through whom I ſhall haue the end of all ſorowes: &amp; by whom I ſhall enioie thy ſight without impediment, and be tranſformed into the likeneſſe of thy maieſtie!</p>

For the inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faith cauſeth me to beleeue, that all things, which are impoſſible to man, are poſſible vnto thee; ſo that thou doo conuert my worke, which is nothing, into ſome good worke of thine in me, which is ſpeciallie faith. Then my Lord, who ſhall condemne me? Or what Iudge will damne me? Sith that thou, which art my Iudge, art alſo my father, my ſpouſe, and my refuge. Alas, what father? Such as doth neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne his child: but alwaies doth excuſe and defend

him.</p>
                        <p>Then I perceiue to haue none other excuſer, but Ieſus Chriſt, which is my ſpouſe, and my redeemer, whoſe death hath reſtored me my loſt inheritance. For he made himſelfe my man of lawe, ſhewing his ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie merits afore his father, wherewith my great debt is ſo aboundantlie recompenſed, that in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is nothing. O redeemer, here is a great loue: I find but few ſuch men of lawe. O ſweete Ieſus, it is to thee that I am a debtor, yet doeſt thou both praie and ſpeake for me. And moreouer, when thou doeſt ſee that I am poore, with the aboundance of thy goods thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt paie my debts. O incomprehenſible ſea of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe! O my deare father, doeſt thou vouchſafe to be my Iudge, not willing the death of a ſinner? O Ieſus Chriſt crucifier and ſauiour of the ſoule, friend aboue all friends: thou being my man of law, didſt excuſe and ſpeake for me, where thou couldſt iuſtlie haue accuſed mee.</p>
                        <p>I feare no more therefore the crueltie of mine eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, for the lawe by thee is ſatiſfied for all: the paiment is ſo made by my ſweete ſpouſe, that the lawe can aſke nothing of me, but it is paid by him. For as I beleeue, that he hath taken all my ſinnes vpon him, and hath giuen me in place of them his owne goodes in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: ſo, O my Sauiour, thou preſenting thy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, doeſt content the lawe. And when ſhe will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch me of my ſinnes, thou doeſt ſhew hir how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie, in thine owne fleſh, thou haſt taken the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of them, through the coniunction of our mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Alſo vpon the Croſſe, through thy paſſion, thou haſt made ſatiſfaction for it. Morouer, thine onlie cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie hath giuen me this, that thou haſt for me deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Therefore, ſeeing thy merite to be mine, the lawe can aſke nothing of me. Now then will I feare no more the iudgement, but with deſire, more than with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1690:52"/>
perforce, I will tarrie the time that I ſhall ſee my Iudge, and heare a iuſt iudgement of him.</p>
                        <p>I knowe that thy iudgement is iuſt, and that there is no fault therein, though mine infidelitie is woorthie to ſuffer the cruelneſſe of hell. For if I do onlie conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my deſeruing, yet I can ſee nothing in it that can keepe me from the fire of hell. For true it is, that the torment of hell was prepared for the Diuell and his children. So if anie man haue ſet his minde, to be like to the Diuell, by ſenſuall appetite, then ought he, as the Diuell, to be paid with a like reward. But if a man through contemplation of the ſoule, do hold of thee, his Angell of counſell, vertue, and perfection, he is ſure to obtaine heauen, which is a place of thy deſeruing for him: then ſhall the wicked be puniſhed, with the ſame puniſhment, which they ought to haue, to whom they haue ioined themſelues. For ſith they folowed Satan, they muſt enioie ſuch place as is for him, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels prepared.</p>
                        <p>Now I, conſidering the diuerſitie of both the ſorts, am little comforted in ſpirit by this. For I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but that I am more like the Diuell, than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light: wherefore I feare and tremble. For as the Angell is pure and perfect, ſo am I vnpure and vnperfect, and am nothing like vnto him. But thus I confeſſe, that to the other I am ſo like in my dooings, and ſo accuſtomed in his waies, that of his paine and torment I ought to be partaker. For the cruell ſinne which hath bound me in hell, is ſo great, and his force ſo ſtrong, that it letteth nothing to come from it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feareth it the contrarie aſſault. But he, whoſe force lieth in this kind of ſtrength, knoweth not how his ſtrength goeth awaie, when a ſtronger than he commeth in place.</p>
                        <p>I could neuer yet ſee, that anie man by merite, or paines taking, could euer yet vanquiſh that hell, ſaue
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1690:53"/>
onlie he, which did the great aſſault through his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable charitie, when he humbled himſelfe to the croſſe, whereby he hath vanquiſhed and ouercome his enimie, and robbed hell of his power: ſo that now, it hath no more force and ſtrength to keepe that ſoule, which putteth hir truſt in God. Then beleeuing in the great ſtrength that my ſauiour hath, I do not ſet by hell and ſinne. For ſinne can haue no hold of me, vnles it be to ſhew how my God is mercifull, ſtrong, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and a puiſſant vanquiſher of all the euils within my hart. If by ſinnes forgiueneſſe, is the glorie of my moſt louing ſauiour: then ought I alſo to beleeue, that my glorie is increaſed by his loue, and that I am plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and graffed in him.</p>
                        <p>His honour onlie doth honour all his, and his riches doo repleniſh euerie one with his goods. Then death, hell, and ſinne are ouercome by him. O gluttonous hell! where is thy defence? Thou cruell villaine ſinne, where is thy tyrannous power? O Death! where is thy ſting, and victorie, which are ſo much ſpoken of? In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of death, thou death giueſt me life, and ſo doeſt thou contrarie to thy will. Alſo, thou ſinne coueteſt to drawe each creature to damnation. Thou giueſt me a ladder, to reach thereby that godlie Citie Ieruſalem: yet wouldſt thou of thy curſed nature, that mine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall maker ſhould looſe his creature: but through his loue and grace, the ſorie remembrance of thine vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, doth cauſe hir by repentance againe to come, and ſubmit hir ſelfe vnto God, whoſe ineſtimable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe cauſeth thee to looſe thy whole labour, which thou takeſt in hand. For the number that thou pretendeſt to haue, thou ſhalt not haue, becauſe that the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſhadowe of Chriſt his paſſion, is ſuch a mightie protection to the ſoule, that he needeth neither to doubt death, ſinne, nor hell. Is there anie thing then, that can pull me backe, if God be willing, through the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1690:53"/>
gift of faith to drawe me to him? I meane ſuch a faith, as we muſt needes haue, to obtaine the high graces from aboue: and alſo ſuch a faith, as through charitie doth ioine the humble ſeruant to his maker. Now I being ioined vnto him, ought to haue no feare of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, paine, nor ſorowe. For whoſoeuer doth willinglie ſuffer anie maner of death, paine, or ſorowe, for the truth, as Chriſt did, he ſhall feele in ſuch torment, great comfort &amp; conſolation for his ſoule: knowing all this, I my ſelf am weake, yet with God I am right ſtrong.</p>
                        <p>Through his comfort I may do all things, and his loue is ſo conſtant, and permanent, that it varieth not for anie worldlie thing. Who can then withdrawe me from his grace? Surelie the great height of heauen, the depth of hell, the breadth of the whole earth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death, nor ſinne, which dailie doth warre againſt me, can ſeparate me one minute from the great loue and charitie, that my heauenlie father, through Ieſus Chriſt, hath vnto me. His goodneſſe is ſuch, that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me, which hath not all times loued him; and if I now loue hun, then ſhall I feele his loue increaſe in me. But becauſe my loue is not a worthie loue to him, I deſire his loue to be mine, which I feele ſuch as it were mine owne: his deſire is to loue, and his loue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flameth my hart with a heauenlie loue.</p>
                        <p>And through ſuch loue, he findeth himſelfe, that his owne deede yeeldeth him well content, and not my loue or ſtrength: thus contenting himſelfe, his loue doth more increaſe in me, than I can of him deſire.</p>

Therfore doth man thinke, which hath one ſparke of the loue of God, that he hath all the world therewith: euen as we ſee the Sunne, with one onlie ſparke of his light, doth blinde the eie, and yet doth he withhold from it his great light. If then you ſhould aſke the eie, what it hath ſeene, he would ſaie, that it hath beholden the whole brightnes of the ſame. Neuertheleſſe, he is ſo content, that it ſeemeth vnto him as though he had ſo much light as the Sunne conteineth, which if he had more than the ſaid ſparke, he were not able to ſuffer it. Euen ſo the ſoule, which through faith doth feele one ſparke of the loue of God, doth finde therewith the heate ſo great and maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſo ſweet and delicious, that it is impoſſible to hit to declare what thing the ſame loue is. For the little thereof, that ſhe hath felt, doth yeeld hir mind ſatiſfied, and yet deſiring more, where of ſhe hath ynough: thus doth ſhe liue, languiſhing and ſighing in hir ſelfe.</p>
                        <p>The hart that doth feele that he hath receiued too much, hath conceiued ſuch a deſire in this too much, that he alwaies deſireth to receiue the thing which he cannot haue, neither is he worthie to receiue it. He knoweth not the good that he hath alreadie to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, yet would he haue more of that, where of he cannot ſkill: trulie he cannot feele or thinke the good which is in him. Then lieth it not in my power, to tell
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1690:54"/>
what thing the loue of God is, ſith I haue no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the feruentneſſe thereof. He that thinketh to haue all this loue within his hart, can not trulie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what thing it is: happie is he therefore which hath ſuch aboundance of this loue, that he may ſaie, My God, I haue ynough of it.</p>
                        <p>He which hath this loue within him, dare not much boaſt thereof, leaſt in much ſpeaking he do looſe it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he do it, to edifie his neighbour to ſaluation. The impoſſiblitie then of the declaration of this loue, ſhall make me hold my peace. For there is no ſainct ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if he will ſpeake of the loue of the high God, of his goodnes, ſweetnes, graces, and of all things elſe, which pertaine to him, but looking a lowe, ſhall find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnworthy, and ſo ſtop his mouth. I then, a worme of the earth, leſſe than nothing, ought to ceaſe, and not to ſpeake of the incomparable highneſſe of this loue: yet were it too much vnkindneſſe to be noted in me, if I had written nothing, hauing that done vnto me, which would ſatiſfie a much better wit than mine is. For hee that would hide the goodneſſe of God, ſo good a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſhould commit a ſin worthie to be puniſhed with euerlaſting paine.</p>
                        <p>Therefore come O happie Paule, which haſt taſted ſo much of the ſame ſweet honnie, beeing blind for the ſpace of three daies, and rapt vp into the third heaven, and ſatiſfie (I beſeech thee) mine ignorance, and tell me what in ſuch viſion thou haſt ſeene? Harken then what he ſaith. O the vnſpeakable highnes of the aboundant riches or treaſure, both of the wiſdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God! How incomprehenſible are his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and how vnſearchable are his waies vnto our weake wits? O holie Paule, thy words cauſe me much to maruell, that thou hauing knowledge, and ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie ſecrets, wouldeſt ſpeake no further in them. At the leaſt yet tell thou me, what thing I may hope to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1690:55"/>
haue, throgh ſuch godlie loue, as grace hath wrought in me; and I will giue eare vnto thy words: neither hath the eie ſeene, nor yet the eare heard, neither yet hath it euer entred into the hart of man, what GOD hath prepared for them that loue him. O bleſſed Paul, all this yet that thou haſt ſaid, is for none other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to prouoke me earneſtlie to loue, willing me by thy words to thinke, that thou canſt none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe declare of it, and ſo giue mine hart to patience, and hope of that thing, which neuer man yet could ſee, or yet deſerue, although manie through loue haue died.</p>
                        <p>O excellent gift of faith, whereof ſo much good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that it cauſeth man to poſſeſſe the things which he can not comprehend! For faith, ioined with truth, bringeth foorth hope, whereby perfect charitie is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred: and charitie is God, as witneſſeth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. If we haue charitie, then haue we alſo God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and then is God in vs, and we in him; and all this commeth of the benefit of faith. For he dwelleth in all men, which haue true faith. Thus haue we a greater treaſure than we can tell of, nor yet anie man expreſſe vnto vs.</p>
                        <p>Now to conclude, ſith that ſo great an Apoſtle, as is S. Paule, will ſpeake no further of God, and his ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable loue; I will (according to his righteous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and doctrine) hold my peace and be ſtill, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neuertheleſſe his teachings. Notwithſtanding, though herein I acknowledge my ſelfe but earth and duſt, yet may I not faile to yeeld thanks to mine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and liuing God, for ſuch great graces and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, as it hath pleaſed him to giue me. Unto that euerlaſting King of heauen, immortall, inuiſible, incomprehenſible, mightie and wiſe, onlie to him be all honour, praiſe, glorie, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and loue, for euer and euer:</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſt gentle and Chriſtian Reader, if matters ſhould bee rather confirmed by their reporters, than the reports warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the matters, I might iuſtlie bewaile our time, wherin euill deeds be well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and good acts euill cleaped. But ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere truth is, that things be not good for their praiſes; but be praiſed for their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I doo not mooue thee to like this Chriſtan Treatiſe, bicauſe I haue mind to praiſe it; but I exhort thee to mind it, and for the goodnes thou ſhalt allow it, for whoſe liking I labour not to obteine, onelie mooued by mine example, their iudgement Iregard, chieflie confirmed by the matter. Trulie our time is ſo diſpoſed to grant good names to euill fruits, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent termes to meane works, that neither can good deeds enioie their due names being defrauded by the euill, neither excellent works can poſſeſſe their woorthie termes, being foreſtalled by the meane: inſomuch that men ſeeke rather how much they can, than how much they ought to ſaie, inclining more to their pleaſure, than to their iudgement, and to ſhew themſelues rather eloquent, than the matter good: ſo that neither the goodnes of the cauſe can mooue them to ſaie more, neither the euilnes leſſe. For if the excellencie of
<pb facs="tcp:1690:57"/>
this Chriſtian contemplation, either for the goodnes herein to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell appearing, either for the profit herevpon to the Reader enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhould be with due commendation followed, I of neceſſitie ſhould either trauell to find out new words, the old being antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by euill matters, or wiſh that the common ſpeech of praiſing were ſpared vntill conuenient matters were found to ſpend it: ſuch is the plentie of praiſing, and ſcarſenes of deſeruing.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore lacking the maner in words, and not the matter in deed of high commendation, I am compelled to keepe in my iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſilence, truſting whom my report could not haue moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to like this preſent Treatiſe, the woorthineſſe of the matter ſhall compell to giue it honour.</p>
                     <p>Anie earthlie man would ſoone be ſtirred to ſee ſome myſterie of magike, or practiſe of Alchumie, or perchance ſome inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of elements; but thou which art chriſtened, haſt here a woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull myſterie of the mercie of God; a heauenlie practiſe of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; a ſpirituall inchantment of the grace of God. If ioie and triumph be ſhewed when a kings child is borne to the world; what ioie is ſufficient when Gods child is regenerated from heauen? The one is fleſh, which is borne of fleſh; the other is ſpirit, which is borne of ſpirit. The one alſo ſhall wither like the graſſe of the earth in ſhort time; the other ſhall liue in heauen beyond all time. If the finding of one loſt ſheepe be more ioifull, than the hauing of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and nine; what ioie is it to conſider the returne of a ſtraie child of almightie God, whoſe returne teacheth the ninetie and nine to come to their fold? Euen ſuch cauſe of ioie is this, that the Angels in heauen take comfort herein. Be thou therefore ioifull when a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble child is newlie borne; ſhew thy ſelfe glad when the loſt ſheepe hath wonne the whole flocke: be thou not ſad, wherein Angels reioiſe.</p>
                     <p>Here maiſt thou ſee one, if the kind may mooue thee, a woman; if degree may prouoke thee, a woman of high eſtate; by birth, made noble; by marriage, moſt noble; by wiſedome, godlie; by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie King, an excellent Queene; by a famous HENRIE, a renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med KATHERINE; a wife to him that was a King to Realmes: refuſing the world, wherein ſhe was loſt, to obtaine heauen, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe may be ſaued: abhorring ſinne, which made hir bound, to receiue grace, whereby ſhe may be free: deſpiſing fleſh the cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:1690:57"/>
of corruption, to put on the ſpirit the cauſe of ſanctification: forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ignorance wherein ſhe was blind, to come to knowledge, whereby ſhe may ſee: remoouing ſuperſtition, wherewith ſhe was ſmothered, to imbrace true religion, wherewith ſhe may reuiue.</p>
                     <p>The fruit of this Treatiſe (good Reader) is thine amendment: this onelie had, the writer is ſatiſfied. This good Ladie thought no ſhame to deteſt hir ſinne, to obteine remiſſion; no vilenes, to become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; to be a member of him, which is all things in all; no follie to forget the wiſedome of the world, to learne the ſimplicitie of the Goſpell at the laſt; no diſpleaſantneſſe to ſubmit hir ſelfe to the ſchoole of the croſſe, the learning of the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> the booke of our redemption; the verie abſolute librarie of Gods mercie and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. This waie thought ſhe hir honour increaſed, and hir ſtate permanent, to make hir earthlie honour heauenlie, and neglect the tranſitorie for the euerlaſting.</p>
                     <p>Of this I would thee warned, that the profit may enſue. Theſe great myſteries and graces be not well perceiued, except they be ſurelie ſtudied; neither be they perfectlie ſtudied, except they be diligentlie practiſed; neither profitablie practiſed, without amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

It is eaſier to ſee theſe, than to learne: begin at the eaſieſt to come to the harder; ſee thou hir confeſſion, that thou maieſt learne hir re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; practiſe hir perſeuerance, that thou maieſt haue like amendment; deſpiſe thy ſelfe in eſchewing vice, that thou maieſt pleaſe God in asking grace: let not ſhame hinder the confeſſion, which hindered not the offenſe. Be thou ſure if we knowledge our ſinnes, God is faithfull to forgiue vs, and to clenſe vs from all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſnes.

the multitude and greatneſſe of my ſinnes I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to accuſe my ſelfe! Was it not a maruellous vnkindneſſe, when God did ſpeake to me, and alſo call me, that I would not anſwere him? What man ſo called would not haue heard? Or what man hearing, would not haue anſwered? If an earthlie Prince had ſpoken, either called, I ſuppoſe there be none but would willinglie haue done both. Now therefore, what a wretch and caitife am I, that when the Prince of princes, the King of kings, did ſpeake manie pleaſant and gentle words vnto me, and alſo called me ſo manie and ſundrie times, that they can not be numbred: and yet, notwithſtanding theſe great ſignes and tokens of loue, I would not come vnto him, but hid my ſelfe out of his ſight, ſeeking manie crooked and biwaies, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I walked ſo long, that I had cleane loſt his ſight? And no maruell or woonder. For I had a blind guide called Ignorance, who dimmed ſo mine eies, that I could neuer perfectlie get anie ſight of the faire, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, ſtreight, and right waies of his doctrine: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie trauelled vncomfortablie, in foule, wicked, crooked, and peruerſe waies. Yea, and bicauſe they were ſo much haunted of manie, I could not thinke, but that I walked in the perfect and right waie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more regard to the number of the walkers, than to the order of the walking: beleeuing alſo moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, with companie to haue walked to heauen, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I am moſt ſure they would haue brought me down to hell.</p>
                        <p>I forſooke the ſpirituall honouring of the true liuing God, and worſhipped viſible idols, and images made of mens hands, beleeuing by them to haue gotten hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: yea, to ſaie the truth, I made a great idole of my ſelfe. For I loued my ſelfe better than God. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainlie, looke how manie things are loued, or preferred in our harts before God, ſo manie are taken and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1690:60"/>
for idols, and falſe gods. Alas, how haue I viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this holie, pure, and moſt high precept and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the loue of God? Which precept bindeth me to loue him with my whole hart, mind, force, ſtrength and vnderſtanding. And I, like vnto an euill, wicked, and diſobedient child, haue giuen my will, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and ſenſes to the contrarie: making almoſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie earthlie and carnall thing a god.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the bloud of Chriſt was not reputed by me, ſufficient for to waſh me from the filth of my ſinnes; neither ſuch waies as he had appointed by his word: but I ſought for ſuch riffraffe, as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome hath planted in his tyrannie and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, truſting with great confidence, by the vertue and holineſſe of them, to receiue full remiſſion of my ſinnes. And ſo I did, as much as was in me, obfuſcate and darken the great benefit of Chriſtes paſſion; than the which no thought can conceiue anie thing of more value. There cannot be done ſo great an iniurie and diſpleaſure to almightie God our father, as to tread vnder foote Chriſt, his onlie begotten and welbeloued ſonne. All other ſinnes in the world, gathered together in one, be not ſo heinous, and deteſtable in the ſight of God. And no wonder. For in Chriſt crucified, God doth ſhewe himſelfe moſt noble and glorious, euen an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and moſt louing father, in his onlie deare and choſen bleſſed ſonne.</p>
                        <p>And therefore I count my ſelfe one of the moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and miſerable ſinners in the world, bicauſe I haue beene ſo much contrarie to Chriſt my ſauiour. Saint Paule deſired to knowe nothing but Chriſt crucified, after he had beene rapt into the third heauen, where he heard ſuch ſecrets as were not conuenient &amp; meete to vtter to men: but counted all his works and doings as nothing, to win Chriſt. And I, moſt preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie thinking nothing of Chriſt crucified, went about
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1690:60"/>
to ſet foorth mine owne righteouſneſſe, ſaieng with the proud Phariſie: Good Lord I thanke thee, I am not like other men; I am none adulterer, nor fornicator: and ſo foorth, with ſuch like words of vaine glorie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling my ſelfe, and deſpiſing others, working as an hired ſeruant for wages, or elſe for reward: and not as a louing child, onlie for verie loue, without reſpect of wages or reward, as I ought to haue done. Neither did I conſider, how beneficiall a father I had, who did ſhew me his charitie and mercie of his owne meere grace and goodneſſe, that when I was moſt his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, he ſent his onlie begotten and welbeloued ſonne into this world of wretchedneſſe and miſerie, to ſuffer moſt cruell and ſharpe death for my redemption. But my hart was ſo ſtonie and hard, that this great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit was neuer trulie and liuelie printed in my hart, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with my words it was oft rehearſed, thinking my ſelfe to be ſufficientlie inſtructed in the ſame, and being in deede in blinde ignorance: and yet I ſtoode ſo well in mine owne iudgement and opinion, that I thought it vaine to ſeeke the increaſe of my knowledge therein.</p>
                        <p>Paule calleth Chriſt the wiſdome of God; and euen the ſame Chriſt was to me fooliſhneſſe. My pride and blindneſſe deceiued me, and the hardneſſe of my hart withſtoode the groning of truth within it. Such were the fruits of my carnall and humane reaſons, to haue rotten ignorance in price for ripe &amp; ſeaſonable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: ſuch alſo is the malice and wickedneſſe that poſſeſſeth the harts of men: ſuch is the wiſdome and pleaſing of the fleſh. I profeſſed Chriſt in my baptiſme, when I began to liue: but I ſwarued from him after baptiſme, in continuance of my liuing; euen as the heathen which neuer had begun.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt was innocent and void of all ſinne; and I wallowed in filthie ſinne, and was free from no ſinne.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1690:61"/>
Chriſt was obedient vnto his father, euen to the death of the croſſe; and I diſobedient and moſt ſtubborne, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the confuſion of truth. Chriſt was meeke and humble in hart, and I moſt proud and vaine-glorious. Chriſt deſpiſed the world, with all the vanities therof; and I make it my God, becauſe of the vanities. Chriſt came to ſerue his brethren; and I coueted to rule ouer them. Chriſt deſpiſed worldlie honour; and I much delighted to attaine the ſame. Chriſt loued the baſe and ſimple things of the world; and I eſteemed the moſt faire and pleaſant things. Chriſt loued pouertie; and I wealth. Chriſt was gentle and mercifull to the poore; and I hard-harted and vngentle. Chriſt praied for his enimies; and I hated mine. Chriſt reioiced in the conuerſion of ſinners; and I was not greeued to ſee their reuerſion to ſinne. By this declaration, all creatures may perceiue, how far I was from Chriſt, and without Chriſt; yea how contrarie to Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I bare the name of a Chriſtian. Inſomuch that if anie man had ſaid I had beene without Chriſt, I would haue ſtiffelie denied and withſtoode the ſame: and yet in deede I neither knew Chriſt, nor wherefore he came.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the effect and purpoſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, I had a certaine vaine and blind knowledge, both cold and dead, which may be had with all ſinne: as doth plainelie appeare by this my confeſſion and open declaration.</p>

For I am ſo ignorant, blind, weake, and feeble; that I can not bring my ſelfe out of this intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and wayward maze: but the more I ſeeke means &amp; waies to winde my ſelfe out, the more I am wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and tangled therein.</p>

It is the hand of the Lord that can and will bring me out of the endleſſe maze of death. For without I be preuented by the grace of the Lord, I can not aſke forgiueneſſe, nor be repentant or ſorie for them. There is no man can auow, that Chriſt is the onlie Sauiour of the world, but by the holie Ghoſt: yea, as S. Paule ſaith, no man can ſaie, <hi>The Lord Ieſus,</hi> but by the holie Ghoſt.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut now, what maketh me ſo bold and hardie to preſume to come to the Lord with ſuch audacitie and boldneſſe, being ſo great a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Trulie nothing but his owne word. For he ſaith, Come to me all ye that labour, and are burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and I ſhall refreſh you. What gentle, mercifull, and comfortable words are theſe to all ſinners? Were he not a frantike, madde, beaſtlie, and fooliſh man, that would runne for aide, helpe, or refuge to anie other creature? What a moſt gratious, comfortable, and gentle ſaieng was this, with ſuch pleaſant and ſweete words to allure his verie enimies to come vnto him? Is there anie worldlie Prince or Magiſtrate, that would ſhew ſuch clemencie, and mercie, to their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient &amp; rebellious ſubiects, hauing offended them? I ſuppoſe they would not with ſuch words allure them, except it were to call them, whome they cannot take, and puniſh them being taken. But euen as Chriſt is Prince of princes, and Lord of lords: ſo his chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and mercie exceedeth and ſurmounteth all others. Chriſt ſaith, If carnall fathers do giue good gifts to their children, when they aſke them, how much more ſhall your heauenlie father, being in ſubſtance all holie, and moſt highlie good, giue good gifts to all them that aſke him?</p>
                        <p>It is no ſmall nor little gift that I now require, neither thinke I my ſelfe worthie to receiue ſuch a noble gift, being ſo ingrate, vnkind, and wicked a child. But when I behold the benignitie, liberalitie, mercie, and goodneſſe of the Lord, I am encouraged, boldened, and ſtirred to aſke ſuch a noble gift. The Lord is ſo bountifull and liberall, that he will not haue vs ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1690:63"/>
and contented with one gift; neither to aſke ſimple and ſmall gifts: and therefore he promiſeth, and bindeth himſelfe by his word, to giue good and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall gifts to all them that aſke him with true faith, without which nothing can be done acceptable or pleaſing to God. For faith is the foundation &amp; ground of all other gifts, vertues, and graces: and therefore I will praie and ſaie: Lord increaſe my faith.</p>
                        <p>For this is the life euerlaſting, Lord, that I muſt beleeue thee to be the true God, and whom thou didſt ſend Ieſus Chriſt. By this faith I am aſſured, and by this aſſurance I feele the remiſſion of my ſins. This is it that maketh me bold, this is it that comforteth me; this is it that quencheth all deſpaire.</p>
                        <p>I knowe O my Lord, thine eies looke vpon my faith. S. Paule ſaith, We be iuſtified by faith in Chriſt, and not by the deeds of the lawe. For if righteouſnes come by the lawe, then Chriſt died in vaine. S. Paule mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not here, a dead, humane, and hiſtoricall faith, gotten by humane induſtrie: but a ſupernall, and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie faith, which worketh by charitie; as he himſelfe plainlie expreſſeth. This dignitie of faith is no dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to good works. For out of this faith ſpring all good works: yet we may not impute to the woorthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith or works, our iuſtification before God: but aſcribe and giue the woorthineſſe of it, wholie to the merits of Chriſts paſſion, and refer and attribute the knowledge and perceiuing thereof, onlie to faith: whoſe verie, true, and onlie propertie it is, to take, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and hold faſt the promiſes of Gods mercie, the which maketh vs righteous: and to cauſe me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie to hope for the ſame mercie, and in loue to worke all maner of waies allowed in the Scripture, that I may be thankfull for the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Thus I feele my ſelfe to come (as it were) in a new garment before God; and now by his mercie, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1690:63"/>
iuſt and righteous, which of late without his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie was ſinfull and wicked: and by faith to obteine his mercie, the which the vnfaithfull can not enioie. And although S. Iohn extolleth charitie in his Epiſtle, ſaieng that God is charitie, and he that dwelleth in charitie, dwelleth in God. Truelie charitie maketh men liue like Angels; and of the moſt furious, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brideled, and carnall men, maketh meeke lambes.</p>
                        <p>Yea, with how feruent a ſpirit ought I to call, crie, and praie to the Lord, to make his great charitie to burne and flame my hart, being ſtonie and euill affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it neuer would conceiue nor regard the great ineſtimable charitie and loue of God, in ſending his onlie begotten and deere beloued ſonne into this vale of miſerie, to ſuffer the moſt cruell and ſharpe death of the croſſe for my redemption? Yea I neuer had this vnſpeakeable, and moſt high charitie, and abundant loue of God printed and fixed in my hart duelie, till it pleaſed God, of his meere grace, mercie, and pittie, to open mine eies, making me to ſee and behold with the eie of liuelie faith, Chriſt crucified, to be mine onelie Sauiour and redeemer. For then I began (and not before) to perceiue and ſee mine owne ignorance and blindneſſe: the cauſe thereof was, that I would not learne to knowe Chriſt my Sauiour and redeemer.</p>
                        <p>But when God, of his meere goodneſſe, had thus ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mine eies, and made me ſee and behold Chriſt, the wiſedome of God, the light of the world, with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall ſight of faith; all pleaſures, vanities, honor, riches, wealth, and aids of the world, began to waxe bitter vnto me. Then I knew it was no illuſion of the diuell, nor falſe, ne humane doctrine I had receiued. When ſuch ſucceſſe came thereof, that I had in dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation and horrour that which I erſt ſo much loued and eſteemed: being of God forbidden that we ſhould loue the world, or the vaine pleaſures and ſhadowes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1690:64"/>
in the ſame: then began I to perceiue that Chriſt was my onlie Sauior and redeemer; and the ſame doctrine to be all diuine, holie, heauenlie, and infuſed by grace into the harts of the faithfull, which neuer can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by hnmane doctrine, wit, nor reaſon, although they ſhould trauell and labour for the ſame, to the end of the world. Then began I to dwell in God by chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, knowing by the louing charitie of God, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of my ſinnes, that God is charitie, as S. Iohn ſaith. So that of my faith (whereby I came to knowe God, and whereby it pleaſed God, euen bicauſe I tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in him, to iuſtifie me) ſprang this excellent chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in my hart.</p>
                        <p>I thinke no leſſe, but manie will woonder and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell at this my ſaieng, that I neuer knewe Chriſt for my Sauiour and redeemer, vntill this time. For many haue this opinion, ſaieng: Who knoweth not there is a Chriſt? Who being a Chriſtian doth not confeſſe him his Sauiour? And thus, beleeuing their dead, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, hiſtoricall faith and knowledge (which they haue learned in their ſcholaſticall bookes) to be the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed faith and knowledge of Chriſt, which may be had (as I ſaid before) with all ſinne, they vſe to ſaie, by their owne experience of themſelues, that their faith doth not iuſtifie them. And true it is, except they haue this faith, the which I haue declared here before, they ſhall neuer be iuſtified.</p>
                        <p>And yet it is not falſe, that by faith onlie I am ſure to be iuſtified. Euen this is the cauſe that ſo manie impugne this office and dutie of true faith, bicauſe ſo manie lacke the true faith. And euen as the faithfull are forced to allow this true faith; ſo the vnfaithfull can in no wiſe probablie intreate thereof: the one fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in himſelfe that he ſaith, the other hauing not in him for to ſaie.</p>
                        <p>I haue certeinlie no curious learning to defend this

matter withall, but a ſimple zeale, and earneſt loue to the truth inſpired of God, who promiſeth to powre his ſpirit vpon all fleſh, which I haue by the grace of God whom I moſt humblie honour) felt in my ſelfe to be true.</p>

                        <p>Firſt it is to be conſidered, yea to be vndoubtedlie, and with a perfect faith beleeued, that God ſent him to vs freelie. For he did giue him, and ſold him not.

He ſent not a ſeruant or a friend, but his onlie ſonne ſo deerelie beloued: not in delights, riches, and honours; but in croſſes, pouerties, and ſlanders: not as a Lord, but as a ſeruant, yea and in moſt vile and painefull paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to waſh vs: not with water, but with his owne pretious bloud: not from mire, but from the puddle and filth of our iniquities.

How hard, and obſtinate was it, that would not be mollified with ſo manie teares, ſuch ſweate, and ſo much bloudſhead of the ſonne of God, ſuffering with ſo great and high charitie?</p>
                        <p>Therefore he is now verie blind, that ſeeth not how vaine, fooliſh, falſe, ingrate, cruell, hard, wicked, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill the world is. We may alſo in Chriſt crucified weigh our ſinnes, as in a diuine ballance, how gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and how weightie they be, ſeeing they haue cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Chriſt. For they would neuer haue beene coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpaiſed, but with the great and pretious weight of the bloud of the ſonne of God. And therefore God, of his high goodneſſe, determined that his bleſſed ſonne ſhould rather ſuffer bloudſhead, thau our ſinnes ſhould haue condemned vs. We ſhall neuer knowe our owne miſerie and wretchedneſſe, but with the light of Chriſt crucified: Then we ſhall ſee our owne crueltie, when
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1690:65"/>
we feele his mercie; our owne vnrighteouſneſſe and iniquitie, when we ſee his righteouſnes and holineſſe. Therefore, to learne to knowe trulie our owne ſinnes, is to ſtudie in the booke of the Crucifixe, by continuall conuerſation in faith: and to haue perfect and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full charitie, is to learne firſt by faith the charitie that is in God towards vs.</p>
                        <p>We may ſee alſo in Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, how great the paines of hell, and how bleſſed the ioies of heauen be: and what a ſharpe and painefull thing it ſhall be to them, that of that ſweet, happie, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ioie Chriſt ſhall be depriued. Then this Crucifixe is the booke, wherein God hath included all things, and hath moſt compendiouſlie written therein all truth, profitable and neceſſarie for our ſaluation. Therefore let vs endeuour our ſelues to ſtudie this booke, that we being lightened with the ſpirit of God, may giue him thanks for ſo great a benefit.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we looke further in this booke, we ſhall ſee Chriſts great victorie vpon the croſſe, which was ſo noble and mightie, that there neuer was, neither ſhall be ſuch. If the victorie and glorie of worldlie Princes were great, becauſe they did ouercome great hoſtes of men: how much was Chriſtes greater, which vanquiſhed not onelie the Prince of this world, but all the enimies of God; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing ouer perſecution, iniuries, villanies, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yea death, the world, ſinne, and the diuell; and brought to confuſion all carnall prudence?</p>
                        <p>The Princes of the world neuer did fight without the ſtrength of the world: Chriſt contrarilie went to warre, euen againſt all the ſtrength of the world. He
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1690:66"/>
fought, as Dauid did with Golias, vnarmed of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome and policie, and without all worldlie power and ſtrength. Neuertheleſſe, he was fullie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed and armed with the whole armour of the ſpirit. And in this one battell, he ouercame for euer all his enimies. There was neuer ſo glorious a ſpoile, neither a more rich and noble, than Chriſt was vpon the Croſſe, which deliuered all his elect from ſuch a ſharpe and miſerable captiuitie. He had in his battell manie ſtripes, yea and loſt his life, but his victorie was ſo much the greater. Therfore, when I looke vpon the ſonne of God with a ſupernaturall faith and light, ſo vnarmed, naked, giuen vp, and alone with humilitie, patience, liberalitie, modeſtie, gentleneſſe, and with all other his diuine vertues beating downe to the ground all Gods enimies, and making the ſoule of man ſo faire and beautifull: I am forced to ſaie, that his victorie and triumph was maruellous. And therefore Chriſt well deſerued to haue this noble title: <hi>IESVS OF NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZARETH, KING OF THE IEWES.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if we will particularlie vnfold and ſee his great victories, let vs firſt behold how he ouercame ſinne, with his innocencie; &amp; confounded pride, with his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie; quenched all worldlie loue, with his charitie; appeaſed the wrath of his father, with his meekeneſſe; and turned hatred into loue, with his ſo manie bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and godlie zeale.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt hath not onlie ouercome ſinne, but rather he hath killed the ſame; in aſmuch as he hath ſatiſfied for it himſelfe, with the moſt holie ſacrifice and oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his pretious bodie, in ſuffering moſt bitter and cruell death. Alſo, after another ſort, that is, he giueth all thoſe that loue him, ſo much ſpirit, grace, vertue, and ſtrength, that they may reſiſt, impugne, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſinne; and not conſent; neither ſuffer it to reigne in them. He hath alſo vanquiſhed ſinne, becauſe he hath
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1690:66"/>
taken awaie the force of the ſame; that is, he hath cancelled the lawe, which was in euill men the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinne. Therefore ſinne hath no power againſt them that are with the holie Ghoſt vnited to Chriſt: in them there is nothing worthie of damnation. And although the dregs of Adam do remaine, that is, our concupiſcences, which in deede be ſinnes: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, they be not imputed for ſinnes, if we be trulie planted in Chriſt. It is true, that Chriſt might haue taken awaie all our immoderate affections: but hee hath left them for the great glorie of his father, and for his owne greater triumph. As for example. When a Prince fighteth with his enimies, which ſometime had the ſouereigntie ouer his people, and ſubduing them, may kill them if he will: yet he preſerueth and ſaueth them: and whereas they were Lords ouer his people, he maketh them after to ſerue, whome they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had ruled. Now in ſuch a caſe, the Prince doth ſhew himſelfe a greater conquerour, in that he hath made them, which were rulers, to obeie: and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to be Lords ouer them, to whome they ſerued, than if he had vtterlie deſtroied them vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. For now he leaueth continuall victorie to them whome he redeemed, whereas otherwiſe the occaſion of victorie was taken awaie, where none were left to be the ſubiects. Euen ſo in like caſe, Chriſt hath left in vs theſe concupiſcences, to the intent they ſhould ſerue vs, to the exerciſe of our vertues; where firſt they did reigne ouer vs, to the exerciſe of our ſinne. And it may be plainelie ſeene, that whereas firſt they were ſuch impediments to vs, that we could not moue our ſelues towards God: now by Chriſt we haue ſo much ſtrength, that notwithſtanding the force of them, we may aſſuredlie walke to heauen. And although the children of God ſometime do fall by fariltie into ſome ſinne: yet that falling maketh them to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1690:67"/>
and to reknowledge the goodneſſe of God, and to come to him for refuge and helpe.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe Chriſt, by his death, hath ouercome the Prince of diuels with all his hoaſt, and hath deſtroied them all. For as Paule ſaith, it is verified, that Chriſt ſhould breake the Serpents head, propheſied by God. And although the diuell tempt vs, yet if by faith we be planted in Chriſt, we ſhall not periſh, but rather by his temptation take great force and might. So it is euident, that the triumph, victorie, and glorie of Chriſt is the greater, hauing in ſuch ſort ſubdued the diuell; that whereas he was Prince and Lord of the world, holding all creatures in captiuitie: now Chriſt vſeth him as an inſtrument to puniſh the wicked, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and make ſtrong the elect of God in Chriſtian warfare.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt likewiſe hath ouercome death in a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner (if it be poſſible:) becauſe he hath not taken it awaie, but leauing vniuerſallie all ſubiect to the ſame. He hath giuen ſo much vertue and ſpirit, that whereas afore we paſſed thereto with great feare, now we be bold through the ſpirit, for the ſure hope of the reſurrection, that we receiue it with ioie. It is now no more bitter, but ſweete: no more feared, but deſired: it is no death, but life.</p>
                        <p>And alſo it hath pleaſed God, that the infirmities and aduerſities do remaine to the ſight of the world: but the children of God are by Chriſt made ſo ſtrong, righteous, whole, and ſound, that the troubles of the world, be comforts of the ſpirit: the paſſions of the fleſh, are medicines of the ſoule. For all maner things worke to their commoditie and profite. For they in ſpirit feele, that God their father doth gouerne them, and diſpoſeth all things for their benefit: therefore they feele themſelues ſure. In perſecution they are quiet and peacefull, in trouble they are without wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1690:67"/>
feares, anxieties, ſuſpicions, miſeries: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie all the good and euill of the world worketh to their commoditie.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, they ſee that the triumph of Chriſt hath beene ſo great, that not onelie he hath ſubdued and vanquiſhed all our enimies, and the power of them; but he hath ouerthrowne and vanquiſhed them after ſuch a ſort, that all things ſerue to our helth. He might and could haue taken them all awaie, but where then ſhould haue beene our victorie, palme, and crowne? For we dailie haue fights in the fleſh, and by the ſuccour of grace haue continuall victories ouer ſinne: whereby we haue cauſe to glorifie God, that by his ſonne hath weakened our enimie the diuell, and by his ſpirit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs ſtrength to vanquiſh his ofſpring.</p>
                        <p>So doo we knowledge dailie the great triumph of our Sauiour, &amp; reioice in our owne fights; the which we can no wiſe impute to anie wiſdome of this world; ſeeing ſinne to increaſe by it. And where worldlie wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome moſt gouerneth, there moſt ſinne ruleth. For as the world is enimie to God, ſo alſo the wiſdome ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is aduerſe to God: and therefore Chriſt hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; diſcouered the ſame for fooliſhneſſe. And although he could haue taken awaie all worldlie wiſedome: yet he hath left it for his greater glorie, and triumph of his choſen veſſels. For before, whereas it was our ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler againſt God: now by Chriſt we are ſerued of it for God, as of a ſlaue in worldlie things: albeit in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall things the ſame is not to be vnderſtood. And further, if at anie time men would impugne, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaie vs, with the wiſedome of the world: yet we haue by Chriſt ſo much ſupernaturall light of the truth, that we make a mocke of all thoſe that repugne the truth.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt alſo vpon the croſſe hath triumphed ouer the world. Firſt, bicauſe he hath diſcouered the ſame to be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1690:68"/>
naught: that whereas it was couered with the vaile of hypocriſie, and the veſture of morall vertues; Chriſt hath ſhewed, that in Gods ſight the righteouſneſſe of the world is wickedneſſe: and he hath yeelded witnes, that The works of men, not regenerated by him in faith, are euill: and ſo Chriſt hath iudged and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the world for naught. Further more, he hath giuen to all his ſo much light and ſpirit, that they knowe it, and diſpraiſe the ſame: yea and tread it vnder their feet, with all vaine honours, dignities, &amp; pleaſures, not taking the faire promiſes, neither the offers which it doth preſent: naie, they rather make a ſcorne of them. And as for the threatnings and force of the world, they nothing feare.</p>
                        <p>Now therefore we may ſee how great the victorie and triumph of Chriſt is, who hath deliuered all thoſe the father gaue him, from the power of the diuell, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling vpon the croſſe the writing of our debts. For he hath deliuered vs from the condemnation of ſinne; from the bondage of the lawe, from the feare of death, from the danger of the world, and from all euils in this life, and in the other to come. And he hath inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vs, made vs noble, and moſt highlie happie, after ſuch a glorious and triumphant waie, as can not with tongue be expreſſed: and therefore we are forced to ſaie, his triumph is maruellous.</p>
                        <p>It is alſo ſeene and knowne, that Chriſt is the true Meſſias. For he hath deliuered man from all euils, and by him man hath all goodneſſe: ſo that he is the true Meſſias. Therefore all other helpers be but vaine, and counterfeited ſauiours; ſeeing that by this our Meſſias Chriſt, wholie and onlie we be deliuered from all euils, and by him we haue all goodneſſe. And that this is true, it is euident and cleare; bicauſe the verie true Chriſtian, is a Chriſtian by Chriſt. And the true Chriſtian feeleth inwardlie by Chriſt, ſo much
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1690:68"/>
goodneſſe of God, that euen troublous life and death be ſweet vnto him, and miſeries happie. The true Chriſtian by Chriſt is diſburdened from the ſeruitude of the lawe, hauing the lawe of grace (grauen by the ſpirit) inhabiting his hart, and from ſinne that reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in him, from the power of the infernall ſpirits, from damnation, and from euerie euill: and is made a ſonne of God, a brother of Chriſt, heire of heauen, and Lord of the world: ſo that in Chriſt and by Chriſt, he poſſeſſeth all good things.</p>
                        <p>But let vs knowe, that Chriſt yet fighteth in ſpirit in his elect veſſels, and ſhall fight euen to the daie of iudgment: at which day ſhall that great enimie death be wholie deſtroied, and ſhall be no more. Then ſhall the children of God reioice on him, ſaieng: O death where is thy victorie and ſting? There ſhall be then no more trouble nor ſinne; naie rather, none euill: but heauen for the good, and hell for the wicked. Then ſhall wholie be diſcouered the victorie &amp; triumph of Chriſt, who (after Paule) ſhall preſent vnto his father the kingdome, together with his choſen ſaued by him.</p>
                        <p>It was no little fauour towards his children, that Chriſt was choſen of God, to ſaue vs his elect, ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by the waie of the croſſe. Paule calleth it a grace, and a moſt ſingular grace. We may well thinke, that he hauing beene to the world ſo valiant a captaine of God, was full of light, grace, vertue, and ſpirit: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might iuſtlie ſaie: <hi>Conſummatum eſt.</hi> Wee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then, that the triumph and victorie of our cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Chriſt, is ſo maruellous, glorious, and noble, to the which war we be appointed: let vs force our ſelues to folowe him, with bearing our croſſe, that we may haue felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him in his kingdome.</p>

                        <p>Alas Lord that euer I haue ſo wickedlie offended thee, being to me from the beginning ſo gratious and ſo good a father, and moſt ſpeciallie now haſt declared and ſhewed thy goodneſſe vnto me, when in the time I haue done thee moſt iniurie, to call me, and alſo to make me knowe &amp; take thee for my Sauior and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.

For
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1690:69"/>
except this great benefit of Chriſt crucified be felt and fixed ſurelie in mans hart, there can be no good worke done acceptable before God. For in Chriſt is all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Godhead, and in him are hid all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdome and knowledge. Euen he is the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, whereof whoſoeuer ſhall drinke, he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more thirſt; but it ſhall be in him a well of water, ſpringing vp into euerlaſting life. S. Paule ſaith, There is no damnation to them that are in Chriſt, which walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit. Moreouer he ſaith: If when we were enimies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his ſon: much more, ſeeing we are reconciled, we ſhall be preſerued by his death. It is no little or ſmall benefit we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by Chriſt, if we conſider what he hath done for vs, as I haue perfectlie declared heretofore. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I praie the Lord, that this great benefit of Chriſt crucified, may be ſtedfaſtlie fixed &amp; printed in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians harts, that they may be true louers of God, and worke as children for loue: and not as ſeruants, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled with threatenings, or prouoked with hire.</p>
                        <p>The ſincere and pure louers of God doo embrace Chriſt, with ſuch feruencie of ſpirit, that they reioice in hope, be bold in danger, ſuffer in aduerſitie, continue in praier, bleſſe their perſecutors.

For they liued vnder ſhadowes and figures, and were bound to the lawe. And Chriſt (we being his greateſt enimies) hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vs from the bondage of the lawe, and hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all that was figured in their lawe, and alſo in their propheſies, ſheading his owne pretious bloud, to make vs the children of his father, and his brethren, and hath made vs free, ſetting vs in a godlie libertie: I meane not licence to ſinne, as manie be glad to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the ſame, when as Chriſtian libertie is godlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of.</p>
                        <p>Trulie it is no good ſpirit that moueth men to find fault at euerie thing, and when things may be well taken, to peruert them into an euill ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. There be in the world manie ſpeakers of holines and good works, but verie rare and ſeldome is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red which be the good and holie works. The works of the ſpirit be neuer almoſt ſpoken of, and therefore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie few knowe what they be. I am able to iuſtifie, the ignorance of the people to be great, not in this matter alone, but in manie other, the which were moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for Chriſtians to knowe. Becauſe I haue had
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1690:71"/>
iuſt proofe of the ſame, it maketh me thus much to ſaie, with no little ſorowe and greefe in my hart, for ſuch a miſerable ignorance and blindneſſe amongeſt the people.</p>
                        <p>I doubt not but we can ſaie all, Lord, Lord. But I feare, God may ſaie vnto vs; This people honoureth me with their lips, but their harts be far from me. God deſireth nothing but the hart, and ſaith, He will be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth. Chriſt condemned all hypocriſie and feigned holines, and taught ſincere, pure, and true godlineſſe: but we worſſe than frantike or blinde, will not followe Chriſts doctrine, but truſt to mens doctrines, iudgements, and ſaiengs, which dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth our eies, and ſo the blind leadeth the blind, and both fall into the dich. Trulie, in my ſimple and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned iudgement, no mans doctrine is to be eſteemed or preferred like vnto Chriſts, and the Apoſtles; nor to be taught as a perfect and true doctrine, but euen as it doth accord &amp; agree with the doctrine of the Goſpell.</p>
                        <p>But yet thoſe that be called ſpirituall paſtours (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be moſt carnall, as it doth verie euidentlie and plainelie appeare by their fruites,) are ſo blinded with the loue of themſelues, and the world, that they extoll mens inuentions and doctrines, before the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell. And when they be not able to mainteine their owne inuentions and doctrines, with anie iot of the ſcripture, then they moſt cruellie perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them that be contrarie to the ſame. Be ſuch the louers of Chriſt? Naie, naie: they be the louers of the wicked Mammon, neither regarding God nor his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. For filthie lucre hath made them almoſt mad, but frantike they be doubtleſſe. Is not this miſerable ſtate of ſpirituall men in the world, much to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all good Chriſtians? But yet I cannot allowe, neither praiſe all kind of lamentation, but ſuch as may ſtand with Chriſtian charitie.</p>

I would all Chriſtians, that like as they haue profeſſed Chriſt, would ſo endeuour themſelues to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe him in godlie liuing. For we haue not put on Chriſt, to liue anie more to our ſelues, in the vanities, delightes, and pleaſures of the world, and the fleſh, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the concupiſcence and carnalitie of the fleſh to haue his full ſwinge. For we muſt walke after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not after the fleſh. For the ſpirit is ſpirituall, and coueteth ſpirituall things: and the fleſh carnall, and deſireth carnall things. The men regenerate by Chriſt, deſpiſe the world, and all the vanities and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof. They be no louers of themſelues. For they feele how euill and infirme they be, not being able to do anie good thing, without the helpe of God, from whome they knowledge all goodneſſe to proceede.</p>
                        <p>They flatter not themſelues, with thinking euerie thing which ſhineth to the world, to be good and holie. For they knowe all externe and outward works, be they neuer ſo glorious and faire to the world, may be done of the euill, as well as of the good. And therefore they haue in verie little eſtimation the outward ſhew of holineſſe, becauſe they be all ſpirituall, caſting vp their eies vpon heauenlie things: neither looking nor regarding the earthlie things, for they be to them vile and abiect. They haue alſo the ſimplicitie of the doue, and the policie of the ſerpent. For by ſimplicitie they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1690:72"/>
haue a deſire to do good to all men, and to hurt no man, no though they haue occaſion giuen: and by policie they giue not nor miniſter anie iuſt cauſe to anie man, whereby their doctrine might be reproued. They be not alſo as a reede ſhaken with euerie winde: but when they be blaſted with the tempeſts and ſtormes of the world, then remaine they moſt firme, ſtable, and quiet, feeling in ſpirit, that God (as their beſt father) doth ſend and ſuffer all things for their benefit and commoditie. Chriſt is to them a rule, a line, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſtian life. They be neuer offended at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing, although occaſion be miniſtred vnto them. For like as Chriſt, when Peter would haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne him from death, anſwered and ſaid, Go backe from me Sathan, for thou offendeſt me: that is, As much as lieth in thee, thou giueſt me occaſion with thy words, to make me withdrawe my ſelfe from death, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I yeelded not thereto. For this thy procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can not extinguiſh the burning deſire I haue, to ſhed my bloud for my choſen. Euen ſo the perfect men are neuer offended at anie thing. For although the world were full of ſinne, they would not withdrawe themſelues from doing of good, nor waxe cold in the loue of the Lord. And much leſſe they would be moued to do euill: yea rather, they be ſo much the more moued to do good.</p>
                        <p>The regenerated by Chriſt are neuer offended at the works of God, becauſe they knowe by faith, that God doth all things well: and that he can not erre, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of power, nor by ignorance, nor malice. For they knowe him to be almightie, and that he ſeeth all things, and is moſt aboundantlie good. They ſee and feele in ſpirit, that of that will moſt highlie perfect, can not but proceede moſt perfecte works. Likewiſe, they be not offended at the works of men. For if they bee good, they are moued by them to take occaſion to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1690:73"/>
folowe them, and to reknowledge the goodnes of God, with giuing of thanks, and praiſing his name dailie the more. But if they be indifferent, and ſuch as may be done with good and euill intents, they iudge the beſt part, thinking they may bee done to a good purpoſe, and ſo they bee edified. But if they bee ſo euill, that they can not bee taken in good part by anie meanes; yet they bee not offended, although occaſion bee giuen, naie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be edified, in aſmuch as they take occaſion to be better, though the contrarie bee miniſtred to them.</p>
                        <p>Then begin they to thinke and ſaie thus: If God had not preſerued me with his grace, I ſhould haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this ſin, and worſſe. O how much am I bound to confeſſe and knowledge the goodneſſe of God! They go alſo thinking and ſaieng further: He that hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, may be one of Gods elect: peraduenture the Lord hath ſuffered him to fall, to the intent he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowe himſelfe. I knowe he is one of them that Chriſt hath ſhed his bloud for, and one of my Chriſtian brethren: trulie I will admoniſh and rebuke him; and in caſe I find him deſperate, I will comfort him, and ſhewe him the great goodneſſe and mercie of God, in Chriſt: and with godlie conſolations I will ſee if I can lift him vp. And thus ye may ſee, how the men regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Chriſt, of euerie thing win and receiue fruit.</p>

If this were the

greateſt euill of theſe yonglings, it were not the moſt euill. But I feare they be ſo blind and ignorant, that they are offended alſo at good things, &amp; iudge nothing good, but ſuch as they embrace and eſteeme to bee good, with murmuring againſt all ſuch as folowe not their waies. If there be anie of this ſort, the Lord giue them the light of his truth, that they may increaſe and growe in godlie ſtrength. I ſuppoſe, if ſuch yonglings and vnperfect, had ſeene Chriſt and his Diſciples eate meate with vnwaſhen hands, or not to haue faſted with the Phariſies, they would haue beene offended, ſeeing him a breaker of mens traditions. Their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions diſpoſe their eies to ſee through other men, and they ſee nothing in themſelues: where charitie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be moſt ful of eies to ſee the faults of others, whome it coueteth to amend, thinketh none euill, but diſcreetlie and rightlie interpreteth all things, by the which more iuſtlie and trulie euerie thing is taken.</p>
                        <p>Now, theſe ſuperſtitious weaklings, if they had been conuerſant with Chriſt, and ſeene him leade his life ſometime with women, ſometime with Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, with Publicanes, ſinners, and with the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, they would haue murmured at him. Alſo, if they had ſeene Marie powre vpon Chriſt the pretious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they would haue ſaid with Iudas: This oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might haue beene ſold, and giuen to the poore. If they alſo had ſeene Chriſt with whips driue out of the Temple thoſe that bought and ſold, they would foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with haue iudged Chriſt to haue beene troubled and moued with anger, and not by zeale of charitie. How would they haue beene offended, if they had ſeene him go to the Iewes feaſt, heale a ſicke man vpon the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both daie, practiſe with the woman of Samaria, yea &amp; ſhew vnto hir of his moſt diuine doctrine &amp; life? They would haue taken occaſion to haue hated &amp; perſecuted him, as the Scribes and Phariſies did: and euen ſo
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1690:74"/>
ſhould Chriſt the Sauiour of the world, haue beene to them an offence and ruine.</p>
                        <p>There be an other kind of little ones vnperfecte, which are offended after this ſort and maner. As when they ſee one that is reputed and eſteemed holie to commit ſinne, forthwith they learne to do that, and woorſe, and waxe cold in dooing of good, and confirme themſelues in euill: and then they excuſe their wicked life, publiſhing the ſame with the ſlander of their neighbor. If anie man reprooue them, they ſaie: Such a man did this, and woorſe. So it is euident, that ſuch perſons would denie Chriſt, if they ſawe other men doe the ſame. If they went to Rome, and ſawe the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Prelates, which is ſaid to reigne there among them, I doubt not, if they ſawe one of them ſinne, which were reputed and taken for holie, their faith ſhould be loſt; but not the faith of Chriſt, which they neuer poſſeſſed: but they ſhould looſe that humane opinion, which they had of the goodneſſe of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. For, if they had the faith of Chriſt, the holie Ghoſt ſhould be a witnes vnto them, the which ſhould be mightie in them, that in caſe all the world would denie Chriſt, yet they would remaine firme and ſtable in the true faith.</p>
                        <p>The Phariſies alſo tooke occaſion of the euill of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to waxe hautie and proud, taking themſelues to be men of greater perfection than anie other; bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their vertue, euen as the Phariſie did, when he ſawe the Publicans ſubmiſſion. And ſo they be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with euerie little thing, iudging euill, murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt their neighbour, and for the ſame, they are of manie reputed and taken for the more holie and good: whereas in deed they be the more wicked. The moſt wicked perſons are offended, euen at themſelues. For at their little ſtabilitie in goodneſſe, and of their delectable and euill life, they take occaſion to deſpaire:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1690:74"/>
where they ought the more to commit themſelues to God, aſking mercie for their offences: and foorthwith to giue thanks, that it hath pleaſed him of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſuffer them ſo long a time.</p>
                        <p>But what needeth it anie more to ſaie? The euill men are offended euen at the works of God, they ſee God ſuffer ſinners, therefore thinke they, ſinne diſpleaſeth him not. And bicauſe they ſee not the good rewarded with riches, oftentimes they imagine, that God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them not. It ſeemeth to them God is parciall, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath elected ſome, and ſome reprooued. And therefore they ſaie, that the elected be ſure of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, taking by that, occaſion to doo euill inough, ſaieng: Whatſoeuer God hath determined, ſhall be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. If alſo they ſee the good men oppreſſed, and the euill men exalted, they iudge God vniuſt, taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to liue euillie, ſaieng: Inaſmuch as God fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the naughtie men, let vs doo euill inough, to the intent he doo vs good. If then the wicked be offended euen at God, it is no woonder if they be offended at thoſe that followe and walke in his paths and waies.</p>

to procure ſome credit and good opinion of the true and verie fauourers of Chriſts doctrine, either to find out ſome carnall libertie, either to be contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſputers, finders or rebukers of other mens faults, or elſe finallie to pleaſe and flatter the world. Such goſpellers are an offence, and a ſlander to the word of God, and make the wicked to reioice &amp; laugh at them, ſaieng: Behold I praie you their faire fruits. What charitie, what diſcretion, what godlineſſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, or puritie of life is among them?

                        <p>And thus it may be ſeene, how the word of God is euill ſpoken of, through licentious and euill liuing: and yet the word of God is all holie, pure, ſincere, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, being the doctrine &amp; occaſion of all holie and pure liuing. It is the wicked that peruert all good things, into euill. For an euill tree can not bring foorth good fruit. And when good ſeede is ſowne in a barren and euill ground, it yeeldeth no good corne: and ſo it fareth by the word of God. For when it is heard and knowne of wicked men, it bringeth no good fruit: but when it is ſowne in good ground, I meane the harts of good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it bringeth foorth good fruit abundantlie: ſo that the want &amp; fault is in men, and not in the word of God. I praie God all men and women may haue grace to become meete tillage for the fruits of the Goſpell, and to leaue onlie the iangling of it. For onlie ſpeaking of the Goſpell maketh not men good Chriſtians, but good talkers, except their facts and works agree with the ſame: ſo then their ſpeech is good, bicauſe their harts be good. And euen as much talke of the word of God, without practiſing the ſame in our liuing, is euill &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable in the ſight of God: ſo it is a lamentable thing

to heare, how there bee manie in the world, that do not well digeſt the reading of ſcripture, and do commend and praiſe ignorance, and ſaie, that much knowledge of Gods word is the originall of all diſſention, ſciſmes, and contention; and maketh men hautie, proud, and preſumptuous, by reading of the ſame.</p>
                        <p>This maner of ſaieng is no leſſe than a plaine blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie againſt the holie Ghoſt. For the ſpirit of God is the author of his word, and ſo the holie Ghoſt is made the author of euill, which is a moſt great blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, and (as the ſcripture ſaith) a ſinne that ſhall not bee forgiuen in this world, neither in the other to come. It were all our parts and duties, to procure and ſeeke all the waies and meanes poſſible, to haue more knowledge of Gods word ſet foorth abroade in the world, &amp; not allow ignorance, and diſcommend know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods word, ſtopping the mouthes of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned with ſubtile and craftie perſuaſions of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, and Sophiſtrie, whereof commeth no fruite, but a great perturbation of the mind to the ſimple &amp; ignorant, not knowing which waie to turne them. For how is it not extreame wickedneſſe, to charge the holie ſanctified word of God with the offences of man? To alledge the ſcriptures to be perillous learning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe certaine readers there of fall into hereſies?</p>
                        <p>Theſe men might be inforced by this kind of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to forſake the vſe of fire, becauſe fire burneth their neighbours houſe: or to abſteine from meate and drinke, becauſe they ſee manie ſurfet. O blind hate! They ſlander God for mans offence, &amp; excuſe the man whome they ſee offend; and blame the ſcripture, which they can not improue. Yea I haue heard of ſome, that haue verie well vnderſtood the Latin tongue, that when they haue heard learned men perſuade to the credite and beleefe of certaine vnwritten verities (as they call them) which bee not in ſcripture expreſſed,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1690:76"/>
and yet taught as doctrine apoſtolike, and neceſſarie to bee beleeued; they haue beene of this opinion, that the learned men haue mo Epiſtles written by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of Chriſt, than wee haue abroad in the Canon of the old and new teſtament, or knowne of anie, but onlie to them of the Clergie. Which beleefe I did not a little lament in my hart to heare, that anie creature ſhould haue ſuch a blind ignorant opinion.</p>
                        <p>Some kind of ſimplicitie is to bee praiſed, but this ſimplicitie, without the veritie, I can neither praiſe nor allow. And thus it may bee ſeene, how wee that bee vnlettered remaine confuſed, without God of his grace lighten our harts and minds with a heauenlie light and knowledge of his will. For wee bee giuen of our ſelues to beleeue men better than God. I praie God ſend all learned men the ſpirit of God aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that their doctrine may bring forth the fruits ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, For thy ſake are we killed all daie long; and are counted as ſheepe appointed to bee ſlaine: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, in all theſe things wee ouercome, through him that loueth vs. For I am ſure, that neither death, nor life, neither Angels, nor rule; neither power, neither

things preſent, neither things to come, neither quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie or qualitie, neither anie creature, ſhall bee able to depart vs from the loue of God, which is in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu our Lord.</p>
                        <p>They are not by this godlie faith preſumptuouſlie inflamed, nor by the ſame become they looſe, idle, or ſlowe in dooing of godlie works, as carnall men dreme of them: ſo much the more feruent they be in dooing moſt holie and pure works, which God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to walke in. They wander not in mens tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and inuentions, leauing the moſt holie and pure precepts of God vndone, which they knowe they be bound to obſerue and keepe. Alſo they worke not like hirelings, for meede, wages, or reward; but as lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing children, without reſpect of lucre, gaine, or hire. They be in ſuch libertie of ſpirit, and ioie ſo much in God, that their inward conſolation can not be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with tongue. All feare of damnation is gone from them; for they haue put their whole hope of ſaluation in his hands, which will and can performe it; neither haue they anie poſt or piller to leane to, but God, and his ſmooth and vnwrinkled Church. For he is to them all in all things, and to him they leane, as a moſt ſure ſquare piller, in proſperitie and aduerſitie, nothing doubting of his promiſes and couenants. For they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue moſt ſurelie they ſhall be fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>Alſo the children of God be not curious in ſearching the high myſteries of God, which be not meet for them to knowe: neither doo go about with humane and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſons to interpret Scripture, perſuading men by their ſubtile wits, and carnall doctrine, that much knowledge of Scripture maketh men heretikes, without they temper it with humane doctrine, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtrie, Philoſophie, and Logicke, wherewith to bee ſeduced according to the traditions of men, after the ordinances of the world, and not after Chriſt. S. Paul
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1690:77"/>
doth moſt diligentlie admoniſh vs, which arts are not conuenient &amp; meet to be made checkmate with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For the Scriptures be ſo pure and holie, that no perfection can be added vnto them. For euen as fine gold doth excell all other mettals, ſo doth the word of God, all mens doctrines. I beſeech the Lord to ſend the learned and vnlearned ſuch abundance of his holie ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that they may obeie and obſerue the moſt ſincere and holie word of God, and ſhew the fruits thereof, which conſiſteth chieflie in charitie and godlie vnitie: that as we haue profeſſed one God, one faith, and one baptiſme; ſo we may be all of one mind, and one accord, putting awaie all biting and gnawing. For in backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſlandering, and miſ-reporting our Chriſtian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we ſhew not our ſelues the Diſciples of Chriſt, whom we profeſſe. In him was moſt high charitie, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie and patience, ſuffering moſt patientlie all ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie, rebukes, and ſlanders, praieng to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall father for his enimies with moſt perfect charitie; and in all things did remit his will to his fathers, as the Scripture doth witneſſe, when he praied in the Mount. A godlie example and leſſon for vs to followe at all times and ſeaſons, as well in proſperitie, as in aduerſitie; to haue no will but Gods will, committing and leauing to him all our cares and greefes, and to abandon all our policies and inuentions. For they be moſt vaine, and fooliſh, and indeed verie ſhadowes and dreames.</p>
                        <p>But we be yet ſo carnall and fleſhlie, that we run headlong like vnbrideled colts, without ſnaffle or bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. If we had the loue of God printed in our harts, it would keepe vs backe from running aſtraie. And vntill ſuch time as it pleaſe God to ſend vs this bit to hold vs in, we ſhall neuer run the right waie, although wee ſpeake and talke neuer ſo much of God and his word. The true followers of Chriſts doctrine haue alwaies
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1690:78"/>
a reſpect, and an eie to their vocation. If they be called to the miniſterie of Gods word, they preach and teach it ſincerelie, to the edifieng of others; and ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their liuing, followers of the ſame. If they be maried men, hauing children and familie, they nouriſh and bring them vp, without all bitterneſſe, and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in the doctrine of the Lord, in all godlineſſe and vertue; committing the inſtruction of others, which apperteine not to their charge, to the reformation of God, and his miniſters, which chieflie be Kings and Princes, bearing the ſword euen for that purpoſe, to puniſh euill dooers. If they be children, they honour their father and mother, knowing it to be Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and that he hath thereto annexed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of long life. If they be ſeruants, they obeie and ſerue their maiſters with all feare and reuerence, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for the Lords ſake; neither with murmuring nor grudging, but with a free hart and mind.</p>
                        <p>If they be huſbands, they loue their wiues, as their owne bodies, after the example as Chriſt loued the congregation, and gaue himſelfe for it, to make it to him a ſpouſe without ſpot or wrinkle. If they be wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men maried, they learne of S. Paule to be obedient to their huſbands, and to keepe ſilence in the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to learne of their huſbands at home. Alſo they weare ſuch apparell as becommeth holineſſe, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vſage, with ſoberneſſe; not being accuſers or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors, not giuen to much eating of delicate meats, and drinking of wine; but they teach honeſt things, to make the yong women ſober minded, to loue their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, to loue their children, to be diſcreet, chaſte, houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifelie, good, and obedient vnto their huſbands: that the word of God be not euill ſpoken of. Uerelie, if all ſorts of people would looke to their owne vocation, and ordeine the ſame according to Chriſts doctrine, we ſhould not haue ſo many eies and eares to other mens
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1690:78"/>
faults as we haue. For we be ſo buſie and glad to find and eſpie out other mens dooings, that we forget, and can haue no time to weigh &amp; ponder our owne, which after the word of God we ought firſt to reforme: and then we ſhall the better helpe an other with the ſtraw out of his eies.</p>
                        <p>But alas, we be ſo much giuen to loue and to flatter our ſelues, and ſo blinded with carnall affections, that we can ſee and perceiue no fault in our ſelues. And therfore it is a thing verie requiſite and neceſſarie for vs, to praie all with one hart and mind to God, to giue vs an heauenlie light and knowledge of our owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and calamities, that we may ſee them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them trulie before him.</p>

God knoweth of what intent and mind I haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented mine owne ſinnes and faults to the world. I truſt no bodie will iudge that I haue done it for praiſe or thanke of anie creature; ſince rather I might be aſhamed, than reioice in rehearſall thereof. For if they knewe how little I eſteeme and weigh the praiſe of the world, that opinion were ſoone remooued and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie. For I thanke God (by his grace) I knowe the world to be a blind iudge, and the praiſes therof vaine, and of little moment: and therefore I ſeeke not the praiſes of the ſame, neither to ſatiſfie it none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than I am taught by Chriſt to doo, according to chriſtian charitie. I would to God we would all (when occaſion doth ſerue) confeſſe our faults to the world, all reſpects of our owne commoditie laid apart. But alas, ſelfe-loue doth ſo much reigne among vs, that (as I haue ſaid before) we can not eſpie our owne faults. And although ſomtime we find our owne guilt, either we be fauourable to interpret it no ſin: or elſe we be aſhamed to confeſſe our ſelues thereof. Yea, and we be ſore offended and greeued, to heare our faults charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie and godlie told vs of other, putting no difference betweene charitable warning, &amp; malicious accuſing.</p>

We ſhall haue no man

of lawe to make our plea for vs, neither can we haue the daie deferred, neither will the Iudge be corrupted with affection, bribes, or reward; neither will he heare anie excuſe or delaie, neither ſhall this Saint or that Martyr helpe vs, be they neuer ſo holie; neither ſhall our ignorance ſaue vs from damnation.

                        <p>When ſhall I wholie gather my ſelfe in thee ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie, that I ſhall not for thy loue feele my ſelfe, but thee onlie aboue my ſelfe, &amp; aboue all worldlie things, that thou maiſt vouchſafe to viſit mee in ſuch wiſe, as thou dooeſt viſit thy moſt faithfull louers?</p>

                        <p>Lord, I knowe that no man ought to be aſhamed or miſcontent, that he is in a lowe eſtate in this world, and lacketh the pleaſures of this life; but rather to be glad and reioice thereat:</p>

                        <p>If I loue the fleſh, I imagine oftentimes that, that pleaſeth the fleſh.</p>

                        <p>And whatſoeuer I loue, of that I gladlie heare, and ſpeake, and beare the images of them ſtill in my mind.</p>

                        <p>Returne thee therefore O my ſoule vnto thy Lord God, praie to him humblie on thy knees for grace, and continue to bewaile thy ſinnes paſt, becauſe that he which loueth thee, prouoketh thee dailie with his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious gifts and bleſſings to loue him, and will not leaue thee, vntill he haue made perfect his worke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, and brought his mercie to full effect in thee.

The vertue of ſeed ſowne, doth not ceaſe till the fruit be brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, yet that nature worketh not at once, but firſt prepareth the matter, and then diſpoſeth and makes it fit to receiue the ſhape, which is the perfection and end thereof. And as by naturall order, and right courſe things do proceede and increaſe by little and little, from the leſſe to the more, euen ſo doth God firſt diſpoſe vs to his mercie, and then increaſing his goodneſſe dailie, beſtoweth on vs in the end, the treaſure of his grace and inheritance of euerlaſting ioies.

For Paule in this life, notwithſtanding his high perfection and grace, had a motion of the fleſh to vexe and trouble him.

ſongs, that ſet foorth the praiſe and honor of thy name: in thee are the felowſhip of heauenlie citizens: in thee reſteth the ſweete ſolemnitie of all ſuch as returne from this miſerable pilgrimage vnto thy glorie; the companie of the Prophets, Apoſtles, and victorious armie of Martyrs; holie men and women, which haue vanquiſhed the pleaſures of the world, haue their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with thee. There are yoong children and maidens, which haue paſſed ouer their daies in holineſſe of life, publiſhing thy praiſe in all puritie and pietie. Euerie one reioiceth in his degree, though not equall in glorie, yet like in ioies and gladneſſe. For there reigneth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect charitie, &amp; God is all in all, whoſe Maieſtie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end they ſee continuallie, and ſtill in beholding him their loue increaſeth.</p>
                        <p>Of this eternall bleſſedneſſe the holie Apoſtle Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had as it were a ſhadowe, or a taſt, vpon the mount Thabor, at the tranſfiguration of Chriſt, from whence he deſired he might not depart. Paule alſo had a proofe of it, when he was rapt or taken vp into the third heauen, where he heard words, and ſawe things ſo maruellous and ſecret, as far paſſeth all mans vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and ſuch as were not to be told or reuealed vnto men. Moſes his face became ſo bright, through the conuerſation that he had with the diuine glorie vpon mount Sinai; that the Iſraelites could not abide it. What then ſhall become of vs, when perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallie with thee (which art the Lord of all glorie) we ſhall be conuerſant, after the maner of thy children and familiar friends? Who is he then, that will not ſeeke and deſire by all meanes poſſible, to be a dweller there; both for the deſire of peace, ioie and eternitie; and for the perfect ſight of God?</p>
                        <p>Contrariwiſe, who is able to expreſſe the torments appointed for the vngodlie and vnrepentant liuers; in that deadlie place called Hell, which Sathan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1690:140"/>
abhorreth? What other thing can be there, but continuall paines, eternall tribulation, and infinite calamitie, repleat with all euils? There dwell wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ouglie Angels, whoſe horrible lookes bring ſudden feare, greeuous paines, and fearefull death, with continual clouds of euer-during darknes. There is nothing but howling, wailing, lamentation and mourning without all end; fearfull ſcriches, &amp; confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed cries are there in all places ſuddenlie raiſed. There the woorme of conſcience neuer dieth: in that damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dungeon, there is fire vnquenchable, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all gnaſhing of teeth. The miſerable ſoule findeth there no reſt, but is afflicted with all kind of torments, and ſuch as can neuer be expreſſed; all which endure for euer.</p>
                        <p>Alas, little auaileth it thoſe that are ſubiected as firebrans of hell, to crie vnto the Lord: for he will not heare them. Then ſhall they knowe, that all things which they had in this life are vaine; and ſuch things as they thought to be pleaſant, to be found more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than gall or poiſon. Then where is the pleaſure of the fleſh, ſo termed falſlie? For there is none other pleaſure, but to feare the Lord. Then ſhall they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and ſaie, that the iudgement of God is true and righteous, ſaieng: Did we not heare of this, and yet would not be conuerted from our wicked deeds? But then ſhall nothing preuaile. No ſorowe can find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; no complaints, anie remorſe; no torments, eaſe; nor painfull paſſions an end: ſuch and ſo exceeding are the vexations of the ſecond death, wherewith all the bodies and ſoules of the vnrighteous ſhall for euer be enuironed.</p>
                        <p>Sith therefore, O heauenlie Father, and moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious God, it ſeemeth good to thine eternall wiſdome, by the knowledge of thine euerlaſting truth, to giue me knowledge of thine ineſtimable mercie offered free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

Likewiſe, after ſupper he tooke the cup, ſaieng: This cup is the new teſtament in my bloud: doo this as often as you ſhall drinke it in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me.

                        <p>The ſecond of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, who is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall wiſdome of God.

                        <p>The fourth of the Church, and of the graces of God towards the ſame.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The ſecond point to honour God aright, conſiſteth in this, that we obey his will. The rule to obey him, is giuen vs in the ten commandements of the lawe.</p>
                        <p>The foure firſt commandements conteine the dutie that we owe vnto God.</p>

                        <p>The ſame promiſes are comprehended by faith.</p>
                        <p>Faith is an aſſured knowledge of the good will of God towards vs, grounded vpon the free promiſes, which is giuen vnto vs in Ieſus Chriſt, and confirmed in our hearts by his holie ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe of the weakeneſſe of our faith, our Lord hath giuen vs the Sacraments.</p>
                        <p>A Sacrament is an outward teſtimonie, which by a viſible ſigne repreſenteth vnto vs the promiſes of God, ſpirituallie accompliſhed in vs.</p>
                        <p>Baptiſme is vnto vs as an entrance into the Church of God, and repreſenteth vnto vs the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and our renouation of life.</p>

                        <p>The Supper was inſtituted of our Lord, to aſſure vs, that by the communion of his bodie, &amp; of his bloud, our ſoules are nouriſhed in hope of life euerlaſting.</p>

Then ſhall the King ſaie to them on his right hand, Come yee bleſſed children of my father, inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world, for I was an hungred, and yee gaue me meate.

                        <p>And there ſhall be ſignes in the Sunne, and in the Moone, and in the Stars, and in the Earth: the Sea, and the waters ſhall roare, and mens harts ſhall faile them for feare, and for looking for thoſe things which ſhall come on the earth.

                           <p>O my God, my King; I will highlie extoll thee, and celebrate thy name for euer and euer: I will conſecrate all the daies of my life to ſet foorth thy glorie, and will amplifie thy name with ſongs, that neuer ſhall haue end.</p>
                           <p>For thou art great, O Lord; and no praiſe is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for thee: neither can anie man attaine to thy greatneſſe.</p>
                           <p>For thy woonderfull works endure not for one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and age alone; but as one age ſucceedeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo likewiſe muſt ſome men commit the memoriall of them vnto others, vnleſſe they will be negligent in dooing their dutie.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore trulie, be it far from me thy handmaid, that anie thing ſhould be of greater authoritie with me, than that I ſhould carefullie thinke, that the brightneſſe of thy Maieſtie, which ſhineth vnto vs in the verie dailie vſe of things; and that thy deeds to me and my people-ward are greater, than can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, by the admiration or capacitie of all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men and women.</p>
                           <p>And doubtleſſe, Lord, though verie manie be moſt blockiſh, and woonderfull thankeleſſe; yet can there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be wanting ſome, which ſhall euen againſt their willes confeſſe at the leaſt thy terrible power, euen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all princes and people of the world. But admit that others be ſilent, and vnthankefull; yet I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ceaſe to declare thy greatneſſe; and the nations

moſt far off ſhall heare me publiſhing thy praiſes, and ſinging vnto thee, for deliuering and ſauing me by thy power, whome thou haſt choſen and loued.</p>
                           <p>But God forbid, that I alone ſhould labour to doo this my dutie. For verelie, there will be alwaies ſome aſſemblie, which will by all meanes teſtifie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thy peculiar goodneſſe, and thy moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted promiſes.</p>
                           <p>Namelie, that thou art moſt mercifull, and moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to exceeding mercie; and of whome a man may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt doubt, whether thou be more ſlowe to wrath, or more prone to pardon.</p>
                           <p>For is there anie thing, O Lord, void of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Naie, what is there in this whole world anie where, which doth not teſtifie thy clemencie, and euen of it ſelfe ſet foorth thy glorie in this point, that thou dooeſt ſuffer ſo manie generations and ages to paſſe and ſucceede in this world, that is defiled ſo manie and fundrie waies: and that thou dooeſt cauſe thy choſen people to knowe, and declare by experience, what thy dominion and power is, that is to ſaie, to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers of thy praiſe and valiant acts, for committing the glorie of thy kingdome to their poſteritie.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore by good right, O Lord, I will giue vnto thee due and conuenient praiſe, &amp; declare thy woonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous works, euen with a ſounding voice; that all may heare, as it becommeth me; &amp; all men, to whom thou granteſt the vſe of this life, to doo both diligentlie, and continuallie.</p>
                           <p>As for me, I will ſtill call to mind the multitude of thy miracles, and woonderous works wrought for me; and I will conſume all my life daies in praiſing thee therefore, ſo long as I ſhall remaine aliue. It ſhall be my ſpeciall care to publiſh thy renowne with ſongs of praiſe. And would to God that my ſongs might be ſo pleſant and acceptable vnto thee, as I with glad hart
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:1690:216"/>
and cheerefull mind will celebrate thy ſo manie and ſo great benefits beſtowed vpon me.</p>
                           <p>And be it far awaie, and God forbid, O my ſoule, that euer we ſhould forget the Lord our God. But let ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my right hand forget hir cunning, and all plaieng of inſtruments: and let the tongue of euerie one of vs rather cleaue to the roofe of our mouthes, than that it ſhould be once vnmindfull of him; or at anie time aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the due deſerued praiſes, belonging to his moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, glorious, mightie, and eternall name and Maieſtie.</p>

                           <p>I ſubmit my ſelfe, O God, in this thing therefore to thy triall; how I doo prefer the conſideration of thy woonderfull works, words, and benefits, before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; which are ſo great verelie, that I am not able once to accompt the ſumme of them, nor to reach to the height, depth, length, and bredth of thy great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards me. For I find them mo than the ſands
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:1690:221"/>
of the ſea, or the heares of my head. Wherefore I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie refer my ſelfe to thee my God, I ſaie, that thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt throughlie prooue thine handmaid, and ſee if my hart be not altogether fixed vpon thee; and vtterlie ſearch out all my thoughts, to write them downe in thy booke of conſciences.</p>
                           <p>Finallie, conſider Lord, I praie thee, whether I haue prouoked the vngodlie, with giuing anie offence: &amp; as thou knoweſt me innocent, ſo preſerue thou me, and gouerne the courſe of my life with thy counſels.</p>
                           <p>Yea thou knoweſt, O Lord, that I haue neuer bent mine eies to high things; nor entangled my ſelfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie with great matters, whereby I might win to my ſelfe the opinion of excellencie, aboue all other: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet haue reached vnto ſuch things, as were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue my capacitie. But contrarilie, vnleſſe I haue bene content with my ſtate howſoeuer; and haue ſtaid my mind to depend wholie on thee, as they teach the weaned child to forget the Nurſſe, and to regard the mother alone: vnleſſe, I ſaie, I haue ſo behaued my ſelfe hitherto, as the weaned infant, let me in deede be refuſed of thee.</p>
                           <p>Therefore, according to this mine innocencie, O Lord, by the aſſiſtance of thy grace, I will proceed: yea ſurelie, Lord, according to my power, as I haue begon in thee, ſo I will endeuour my ſelfe to end in thee, and to walke with thee vprightlie; and ſetting all my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in thee alone, I am fullie minded to continue to the end of my life, without wauering in the faith of a right Chriſtian feare and loue to thee.</p>
                           <p>That I ſtand vpright in the waie of thy truth, I doo attribute it onlie vnto thee, O Lord my God; and will therefore magnifie thy name in the publike congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I doubt not, but thou, O Lord, thine owne ſelfe, wilt ſullie performe the worke that I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſed by thine authoritie. For this is thine euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:1690:221"/>
mercie, teſtified by thy word: neither wilt thou, I knowe, leaue the worke vnperfect, which thou haſt once begun by me, and in me.</p>
                           <p>And now ſurelie mine eies are ſtill alwaies bent vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy goodneſſe, and I haue appointed thy truth to be the guide and leader of my life: yea, I vnfeinedlie vow, and make a ſolemne promiſe before thee, and all thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Angels; that I will giue all poſſible diligence, both that I may throughlie knowe the right waie appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thee, and alſo may obſerue the ſame purelie, in my houſe and Realme.</p>
                           <p>I will neuer ſet before me to doo anie wicked thing; but will endeuour my ſelfe to godlines more and more, and keepe my hands pure from all iniurie and wrong: that I may ſo liue the true life; and ſpend the whole courſe of this my peregrination, in ſetting foorth thy glorie.</p>

                           <p>Yea, Lord, thou knoweſt how carefullie I haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided the companie of theſe moſt vaine men; and I haue fled awaie from theſe deceitfull dealers.</p>

And thou gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me grace, when the caſe ſo ſtandeth, that the bonds of the lawes are broken, and the kingdome is in anie thing diſordered or confounded; I will carefullie compoſe, and ſet the ſame againe in good order; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh the pillers and foundations thereof in their places, if they be remoued.

They diſdaine not now to be our ſeruants, that ſhall be our felowes: we haue made them reioice in our conuerſion and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

But what will they doo then, when they ſhall ſee thoſe turned backe from the gate of Paradiſe, who had alreadie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt one foote in heauen?</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, though our bodies be on earth, let vs ſet our harts on the higheſt heauens: let vs run thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not with bodilie members, but with ſpirituall affections, deſires, and longing; where not the angels onlie, but the Creator of angels doth long looke for vs. God the father looketh for vs, as his owne ſonnes and heires, to commit the rule of all his treaſure vnto vs. God the ſonne looketh for vs, as his deere german bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and coparteners, that he may preſent God his father with the fruite of his natiuitie, and price of his owne bloud. The holie Ghoſt alſo looketh for vs: for he verelie is that bountie and benignitie, wherein from euerlaſting we were predeſtinate to ſaluation; and no doubt, he wiſheth our predeſtination accompliſhed.</p>

                        <p>Therefore, whereſoeuer thou be, ſtill praie within thy ſelfe. If thou chance to be far from thy cloſet, ſeeke no place. For thou to thy ſelfe art a place. If thou be in thy bed, praie; and praie often in the temple. And in proſtrating thy bodie, lift vp thy mind to God. For as there is no time, wherein we doo not vſe and enioie the

But thou wilt ſaie, I praie continuallie, and yet I ſee no fruit of my praier: as I come vnto it, ſo I depart; none anſwereth, or ſpeaketh vnto me; nothing is giuen me, but my labour ſeemeth vaine. This is the ſpeech of humane follie, not obſeruing what truth it ſelfe promiſeth, ſaieng: Uerelie I ſaie vnto you, whatſoeuer ye aſke in praier with faith, yee ſhall receiue it; and it ſhall be performed vnto you. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme not lightlie therfore of praier. For he to whome thou praieſt, hath it in price; and before it proceed from thy mouth, commandeth it to be regiſtred in his owne booke. One of theſe two we may vndoubtedlie hope for; that either he will giue vs our requeſts, or better. Thinke of God as highlie as thou art able, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue more of him, than thou canſt thinke. All the time wherein thou thinkeſt not vpon God, eſteeme it loſt; all other things be foraigne vnto vs, time onlie is our owne. Attend therefore vpon God; and whereſoeuer thou art, be all with him. Impart, but giue not vp thy ſelfe to worldlie affaires. Whereſoeuer thou art, caſt thy thoughts vpon God. No place is vnfit for medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore, with all cheerefulneſſe, gather vp thy ſpirits, dwell at libertie with thy ſelfe, and out of the largeneſſe of thy heart meaſure out a lodging for thy Lord Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>A wiſe mans mind is alwaie with God. He ought to be alwaies in our ſight, by whome we haue our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, life, and knowledge.

Heerein we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the diuine image of the heauenlie Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For as he hath his being in excellencie of wiſdome and goodneſſe; ſo we, according to our creation, haue our ſubſiſtence; being endued alſo with reaſon, and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:1690:255"/>
delight in knowledge, as a ſignature and impreſſion of the diuine Maieſtie. Eſteeme therefore of thy ſelfe, as of the temple of God; ſeeing it pleaſed him to impart his likeneſſe to thee, as a high renowne, to adore and imitate God. Thou dooeſt imitate him, if thou be holie, as he is holie. For a holie mind is the temple of God; and a ſincere hart, the moſt acceptable aultar. Thou dooeſt adore God, if thou be mercifull, euen as he is mercifull to all. For it is a pleaſing ſacrifice to God, to gratifie all for the cauſe of God.</p>
                        <p>Doo all things as the ſonne of God, that thou bee not vnworthie of him, that hath vouchſafed to be thy father. Knowe that of all thy actions, God is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

For his almightineſſe diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thy deeds. Thou haſt neede of a great watch, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging all the actions in the face of the Iudge; yet liue thou maiſt without ſecuritie, if thou behaue thy ſelfe ſo, as he vouchſafe thee his preſence.

reigne among the members of his bodie, the Church of the Corinthians; for not worthilie preparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and for miſvſing the Sacrament of the bodie and bloud of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: and manie died thereof, as thine holie Apoſtle Saint Paule hath taught vs.</p>
                           <p>Since which time, O Lord, as the Monuments of thy Church, and other Chronicles doo declare, thou haſt from time to time ſo plagued with peſtilence, not onelie cities, but alſo whole countries for theſe and other like cauſes, that we may iuſtlie looke for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Sauiour; ſo manie and ſo horrible peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences haue beene among vs alreadie.</p>
                           <p>All which cauſes, O Lord, for the which thou haſt ſo afflicted thy people, are through the malice of Satan, and our wilfull conſenting vnto him, growne ſo ripe in vs; that were it not for the exceeding greatnes of thy mercie and compaſſion, we ſhould all preſentlie periſh, and that woorthilie; ſo horrible and outragious are our iniquities.</p>
                           <p>For we loath, not onelie the plentifull prouiſion of wholeſome victuals and apparell, which thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs for our bodies, more abundantlie than to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie nations; trauelling by all meanes to get where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to pamper our fleſh with wines, ſpices, ſilks, and other vaine, coſtlie, and delighting things: but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Manna of our ſoules, thy holie word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, we can not awaie with; we are ſo full, that we are glutted therewith.</p>
                           <p>We ſo little eſteeme the heauenlie kingdome, which our Sauiour hath ſo deerlie prepared, and kindlie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to vs; that we abhor it, and are readie to ſtone thoſe few that commend it, and exhort vs for our owne good to trauell thitherward: better liking and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe falſe prophets the Epicures, and Atheiſts, that with their lies diſcourage vs therefrom.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="485" facs="tcp:1690:290"/>
What murmuring and grudging make we againſt the miniſters of thy word, which thou of thine eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all goodneſſe haſt in mercie giuen vs? How deſpiſe wee our biſhops, preachers, and other miniſters of thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Sacraments, whom thou haſt commanded vs to reuerence and honour?</p>
                           <p>Did not we, through our wicked liues, wretchedlie leeſe the Arke of thy holie word, and the true miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacraments, not manie yeeres agone, which the popiſh Philiſtines tooke from vs? And now, when thou through thy plagues laid vpon them haſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſlie ſent it againe; ſee how hold we be with the Beth-ſamites, vnreuerentlie to receiue it. For manie make of it a gazing-ſtocke, to ſerue their eies and tongues; rather than a lawe, to obeie and followe in their liues.</p>
                           <p>Yea, the knowledge of thy truth, goodneſſe, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, breedeth in manie of vs a careleſſe ſecuritie, and a contempt of thy holie ordinances. For we preſume vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy mercie and promiſes; not regarding the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor anie of thy commandements, which in our baptiſme we vowed to obſerue. Yea, we make thy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell a cloke of our couetouſneſſe, vnder colour whereof we ſeeke our owne lucre, and hide all our wicked and filthie practiſes.</p>
                           <p>If the Corinthians deſerued to be plagued for abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thy holie Sacraments, how much more are wee woorthie of fierce wrath, that not onelie abuſe it; but alſo abhor &amp; contemne it: bicauſe it is miniſtred as it ought? For thou knoweſt, O Lord, what a ſort there are, which bewitched with the diuell, and the Popes doctrine, doo vtterlie abhor Chriſts holie communion; and ſauing for feare of the lawe, would neuer come at it. In what ſort theſe receiue, and how they be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is not vnknowne vnto thee. How raſhlie alſo, and vnaduiſedlie, and vnprepared the common multitude
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:1690:291"/>
doo frequent it; partlie appeareth, in that manie of them neuer forgiue old offences, nor reconcile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, nor in anie thing doo amend their old ſinnes and vices.</p>
                           <p>Seeing then that we, Lord, the common ſort and multitude doo thus abound in all kind of wickedneſſe; how can it be, but that thou of thy iuſtice, muſt ſuffer our magiſtrates to offend alſo in ſomewhat, to the end thou maiſt iuſtlie take vengeance of our ſinnes?</p>
                           <p>For theſe manifold heapes of ſinnes and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, O Lord, thou haſt iuſtlie at this preſent ſent this dangerous peſtilence among vs; as thou haſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and long time threatened by the mouthes of thy faithfull preachers, who continuallie haue called vpon vs, to ſtaie thy wrath, by earneſt repentance &amp; amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of life: but we haue alwaies beene deafer and deafer. The delight in our ſinnes not onlie ſtopped our eares, but alſo hardened our harts againſt their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and friendlie admonitions. And in that we now, O Lord, doo begin to feele and acknowledge our ſinnes; it commeth more of thy rigour in plaguing vs, than of anie good inclination of our ſelues. Mollifie therefore, O Lord, our flintie harts, with the ſuppling moiſture of thy holie ſpirit. Make vs to reuerence thee, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for loue of thy mercies; and not to dread thee like ſlaues, for feare of puniſhment.</p>

With all my hart, and with all my might, and power, I thanke thine infinite liberalitie, for hauing created me to thine owne likeneſſe and ſimilitude, and for hauing for my conſeruation created likewiſe ſo great varietie of other creatures: and much more doo I laud &amp; bleſſe thee, for that with thy pretious death and bloud-ſhed thou haſt redeemed me: ye a O Lord &amp; now I doo with all my bowels and powers of my body &amp; ſoule thanke thee, bleſſe thee, &amp; adore thee, for hauing left vs this he auenlie and moſt woorthie Sacrament; and for giuing me miſerable wretch, the grace eftſoons to receiue it, that eftſoones I may thereby be made partaker of the fruit of thy redemption.</p>

And bicauſe theſe my thanks and praiſes be ſlender, weake, and vnwoorthie of ſuch gifts as I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: I beſeech thy ſweet ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, to ſupplie my want.

And yet for that, all that I can doo is finite, &amp; is not correſpondent to the value of the benefit I haue this daie receiued, being infinite. Thoſe moſt holie and gratefull thanks, which thou Lord Ieſu gaueſt to thy Father, minding to grant vs this ſo ineſtunable a gift, euen thoſe ſame, which are infinite, doo I offer both to him and thee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For verelie beleeue I, that for this cauſe didſt thou yeeld them; that ſo incomparable a gift ſhould not be deſtitute of condigne graces, and thanks. And now doo I humblie beſeech thee, of thy moſt bonntifull clemencie, that ſeeing it hath pleaſed thee to ſatiate and honour me with thy moſt worthie preſence in this venerable and redoubted Sacrament; thou wilt alſo vouchſafe to grant me thy grace to be alwaies grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and to anſwere woorthilie to this moſt happie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation.</p>
                        <p>This hath alwaies beene thy woont, my Sauiour and Redeemer; that where through thy goodnes thou haſt vouchſafed to enter, there haſt thou departed of thy bleſſings moſt abundantlie; heaping grace vpon grace; and mercie vpon mercie. Thou enteredſt into Matthew the Publicans houſe; and from a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can thou madeſt him thy Diſciple, &amp; an Apoſtle. Thou enteredſt into Zacheus houſe; when by and by he was changed from his old cuſtome: and health was giuen to all his houſhold.

                        <p>Wherefore, O moſt ſweet and welcome gheſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through thy goodneſſe thou haſt vouchſafed this daie to enter into my poore cottage, ſend downe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thy holie bleſſings thereon; by meanes whereof, I may woorthilie anſwer vnto this thine incomparable mercie. Cleanſe and fine this houſe, Lord, from all the filth thou ſeeſt in it.

Tarrie ſtill with me, O Lord, my comforter; the night draweth nigh, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee ſhall I remaine in darkeneſſe, and ſo be ſore endangered. O therefore, I ſaie, tarrie thou ſtill with me, and depart not from this lodging. Thou haſt affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, O eternall truth, how thy whole delight is to dwell with the children of men, and how thou ſtandeſt knocking at the doore, ready to euter and ſup with ſuch as ſhall open, and let thee in. Behold how I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee free entrance into me; and thou of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe haſt admitted me to the ſweet ſupper of thy moſt ſacred bodie. Abandon me not therfore my ſouereigne Lord, ne depart thou from me; drawe me after thee; knit and tie me faſt to thee; yea drawe me quite out of my ſelfe, ſith I am much better in thee, than in me.

Then ſith he hath ſhed his teares for vs, let vs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe nightlie waſh our beds with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>punction of hart, and continuall teares, for verie heauineſſe that wee haue ſo greeuouſlie offended ſo louing a Maiſter. And ſith he hath ſhed his pretious bloud for vs, ſhed we ours alſo in a ſort: that is to ſaie, with dailie affliction, and mortifieng of our bodies. And let vs not haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what the fleſh deſireth, but what is moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for our ſoules health. For then ſhall our ſoules be glorious, when they ſhall returne to our Lord God by true repentance and penitence.</p>
                        <p>Let vs then call to remembrance the louers of this world, that were here among vs not long agone, what is now become of them: and that nothing remaineth of them but duſt and woormes. They haue beene men as we are: they ſolicited and vſed all kind of mirth; they banketed; they were gorgiouſlie apparelled, they were verie pleaſant, and led their daies in all worldlie delights: but ſuddenlie, and as it were in the midſt of their iolitie, death areſted them, &amp; caried them downe into hell. Here the fleſh of them is appointed to feede the woormes; and there their ſoules be euermore tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the vnquenchable flame of hell fire, where now they find no profit of all thoſe fleſhlie pleaſures, worldlie reioicings, and euill concupiſcence. And for ſo ſhort and vaine pleaſures, what continuall torment and miſerie doo they now endure: where they neuer ſee light; neuer receiue eaſe of their paine, nor comfort of their heauineſſe: where the fire continuallie burneth them, and yet neuer conſumeth them; nor by his long burning leeſeth anie part of his heate? Where the woorms doo gnawe their conſcience; where the diuels, which are their tormentors, waxe neuer wearie in tormenting of them, or take anie pitie on them, nor will be intreated to mitigate anie part of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Where nothing ſhall be heard; but weeping, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, groning, and wofull criengs. Where they ſhall ſauour and ſmell nothing; but horrible ſtinch and corrupt aire. Where they ſhall ſee nothing; but the monſtrous ſhape of the horible tormentors the diuels. Wherefore, let vs now aduiſe our ſelues, whether in folowing of the vaine worldlie pleaſures, we will giue our ſoules in like ſort to be eternallie tormented; or elſe in refuſing them, for the little times of paines we ſhall here ſuffer, to reioice with Chriſt, and to be bleſſed Saints in heauen for euer. For whileſt we are here in this world, God dooth ſet before vs both fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that is to ſaie, ſaluation and damnation; that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we will we may ſtretch our hands.</p>
                        <p>Let vs laſtlie conſider what comfort it is, and ſhall be to all ſaued ſoules to ſee God, and the brightneſſe of his face; to liue with God, to poſſeſſe God, which is high and perfect goodneſſe; and where the perfect good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is, there is the higheſt, and moſt perfect felicitie; there is the chiefe and perfect charitie; eternall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſure eternitie; true gladneſſe; full knowledge; all beautie; all bliſſe. In this ſort ſhall the man be bleſſed with God, in whoſe conſcience ſhall be found no ſinne; he ſhall ſee God after his owne deſire; he ſhall poſſeſſe to pleaſure, and enioie to gladneſſe; he ſhall flouriſh in eternitie; he ſhall ſhine in veritie; he ſhall ioie in righteouſneſſe; and as he ſhall haue eternitie of continuance, ſo he ſhall haue facilitie of knowledge, and felicitie of reſt. He ſhall be delighted in God; whoſe countenance is amiable; whoſe face is beautifull; whoſe ſpeech is pleaſant. He is delectable to behold; ſweet to poſſeſſe; pleaſant to enioie. In him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is made cleere; affection is purified, that we may loue and knowe him as he is: ſo that then wee ſhall not need to ſeeke anie thing beſides him.

                        <p>I will giue praiſe vnto thy name, O Lord, who by creating me after thine owne image, haſt made me capable of ſo great glorie, as to become the ſonne of God. This trulie can not trees doo; this can not ſtones doo; this, to ſpeake generallie, can not anie of the things doo that moue or growe in the aire, or in the ſea, or on the earth; in aſmuch as he hath not giuen them power by thy word, to become the ſonnes of God: becauſe they haue not reaſon. For the power whereby we knowe, conſiſteth in reaſon. But he hath giuen this power vnto men, whome he created reaſonable, after his owne image and likeneſſe. Certeſſe Lord, it is by thy grace that I am a woman, and by grace I may be thy child, which thing the other can not be.</p>
                        <p>Whence haue I this, O Lord, the ſouereigne truth and true ſouereigne, and the beginning of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Whence haue I this, O Lord, that I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the child of God, which the other things cannot? Thou art he that endureſt for euer, and thou haſt made all things at once. Thou haſt made man and beaſts, ſtones, and greene things of the earth all at once. For there went no deſert of theirs afore; there went no good turne of theirs afore. Thou haſt created all things onlie of thine owne goodneſſe; no creature hath deſerued more than other: for none of them had deſerued ought at all. And why then did thy goodneſſe ſhewe it ſelfe more in this creature, which thou haſt made reaſonable, than in all other that be without reaſon? Why was not I as all they be; or why are not all they as I am; or I alone as they be? What had I deſerued, that thou ſhouldeſt make me able to become the child of God, and denie the ſame abilitie to all the reſt? God forbid that I ſhould thinke ſo. It was thine onlie grace, it was thine onlie goodneſſe, which
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:1690:380"/>
brought it to paſſe, that I might be partaker of that ſweetneſſe. Of that grace therefore, whereby thou haſt created me of nothing, I beſeech thee, O Lord, to giue me the grace to be thankefull vnto thee.</p>
                        <p>And I thy creature will put my truſt vnder the ſhadowe of thy wings, and in the goodneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through thou haſt created me. Helpe thy creature, whome thy gratious goodneſſe hath created. Let not that periſh through my naughtineſſe, which thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath wrought. Let not that periſh through my wretchedneſſe, which thy ſingular mercie hath made. For what auaileth it me that thou haſt created me, if I ſhall ſinke downe into mine owne corruption? O God, haſt thou made all the ſonnes of men in vaine? Thou haſt created me, O Lord: rule thou the thing that thou haſt created. Deſpiſe not the worke of thine owne hands, O God. Thou haſt made me of naught, O Lord; and if thou gouerne me not, I ſhall returne to naught againe. For like as when I was not, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt me of nothing: ſo if thou gouerne me not, I ſhall yet againe be brought to nothing in my ſelfe. Helpe me O Lord my life, leaſt I periſh in mine owne naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                        <p>Lord, if thou hadſt not created me, I ſhould not haue beene at all: but becauſe thou haſt created me, I am. Now if thou gouerne me not, I am vndone. For it was not mine owne merits, or mine owne deſerts (as I haue ſaid) that made thee to create me; but thine owne moſt gratious goodneſſe and mercifulnes. That louingneſſe of thine, O Lord my God, which made thee to create me, I beſeech thee let the ſame make thee to gouerne me. For what booteth it that thy louingneſſe cauſed thee to create me, if I muſt periſh in mine owne wretchedneſſe; and that thy right hand gouerne me not?

Therfore we beſeech thee renew vs, I ſay, dailie by thy mightie power from aboue, that being borne of the ſpirit, our harts and our hands, our deeds and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and whatſoeuer is in vs, may be ſpirituall as thou art.

                           <p>We thanke thee for ſauing mankind from eternall damnation, and for making the attonement betweene thy father and vs, through thine incarnation, For ſo it was expedient, according to the order of iuſtice, that the puniſhment of a guiltleſſe man, ſhould quit man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind guiltie; and that a ſufficient ſatiſfaction might be made, it was required that he which would be the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, ſhould be God.

Grant that from the hart, and ioifullie we may aſcribe all glorie, fame, and honor vnto thee the true God, which art wiſe, righteous, almightie, pure, liberall, and mercifull, according to the rule deſcribed in thy commandements, which didſt ſend thy Sonne to bring vs to that glorie; whereof we were depriued, and to reſtore vs againe to our firſt integritie, which was loſt through ſinne.</p>
                           <p>O Sonne of God, confirme thou, and ſeale theſe things in our harts by thy holie ſpirit powred vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, which may worke within vs vnfeigned righteouſneſſe; that by the ſame thy ſpirit ſhining in the nature which thou tookeſt vpon thee, we may be committed to thee, vpholden, quickened, &amp; brought by thee vnto eternall life: that that league made betweene God and vs, may eternallie be confirmed, and we loued in the beloued; and the eternall Father may loue vs with that loue, wherewith he loueth thee the ſubſtantiall image of himſelfe. Suppreſſe the diuell, that he breake not this woonderfull and profitable peace: and ſuffer vs not hanging on thy necke, running to thine armes, ſeeking thy fauour, to be plucked out of thy hands.

After thy comming to <hi>Gethſamane,</hi> heauineſſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed thee, and therefore thou wouldeſt thy diſciples to praie.

After this, thou wenteſt a ſtones caſt from them, and didſt praie thy ſelfe, falling flat and groueling vpon the earth: but alas, thou fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt no comfort, and therefore thou cameſt to thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples (which of all other were moſt ſweet and deere vnto thee) but lo, to thy further diſcomfort, they paſſe neither of thy perils, nor of their owne, and therefore ſleepe apace. After thou hadſt awaked them, thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt againe to praie, but thou foundeſt no comfort at all; and therefore didſt returne againe for ſome comfort at thy deereſt freends hands, but yet againe (alas) they are faſt aſleepe, wherevpon thou art inforced to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to thy heauenlie Father for ſome ſparkle of comfort, in theſe thy wonderfull croſſes and agonies. Now, heere thou waſt ſo diſcouraged, and ſo comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, that euen ſtreames of bloud came running from thine eies, and eares, and other parts of thy bodie.

                           <p>After thy bloudie praier thou cameſt, and yet againe foundeſt thy diſciples aſleepe; and before thou canſt well awake them, lo, Iudas commeth with a great band of weaponed men to apprehend thee as a theefe, and ſo doth, leading thee awaie bound to the high Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops houſe Annas, &amp; ſo from him to Caiphas. Heere now to augment this thy miſerie, behold, thy diſciples flie from thee, falſe witneſſes be brought againſt thee. Thou art accuſed &amp; condemned of blaſphemie. Peter

euen in thy ſight forſweareth thee. Thou art vniuſtlie ſtriken for anſwering lawfullie. Thou art blindfeeld, ſtriken and buffeted all the whole night in the Biſhop Caiphas houſe of their cruell ſeruants.</p>
                           <p>In the morning betimes thou art condemned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of the Prieſts of blaſphemie, and therefore they bring thee before the ſecular power to Pilate, by whome thou art openlie arraigned as other theeues and malefactors were. And when he ſawe that thou waſt accuſed of malice, and that his wife had ſent a meſſenger vnto him, ſaieng: Haue thou nothing to doo with that iuſt man, for I haue ſuffered manie things this daie in a dreame by reaſon of him: yet he did not diſmiſſe thee, but did ſend thee to Herod, where thou waſt derided ſhamefullie, in comming and going to him and from him all the waie wonderfullie, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie after Herod had apparelled thee as a foole.</p>
                           <p>Afore Pilate againe therefore thou waſt brought and accuſed falſlie, no man did take thy part, or ſpeake a good word for thee.</p>
                           <p>Pilate cauſed thee to be whipped and ſcourged, and to be handled moſt pitifullie, to ſee if anie pitie might appeare with the Prelates, but no man at all pitied thee. Barrabas that notable theefe and murtherer was preferred before thee: all the people head and taile was againſt thee, and cried out <hi>Crucifige,</hi> hang thee vp. Uniuſtlie to death waſt thou iudged. Thou waſt crowned with ſharpe thornes that pierced thy braines. Thou waſt made a mocking ſtocke. Thou waſt reuiled, beaten, ſcourged, ſpit vpon, and moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerablie handled.</p>
                           <p>Thou wenteſt through Ieruſalem to the place of execution, euen to the mount of Caluerie: a great croſſe to hang thee vp was laid vpon thy backe, to beare and drawe as long as thou waſt able.</p>
                           <p>Thy bodie was racked to be nailed to the tree. Thy

Thou waſt hanged betweene heauen and earth as one ſpued out of heauen, and vomited out of the earth, vnworthie of anie place. The high Prieſts laughed thee to ſcorne. The Elders blaſphemed thee, and ſaid, God had no care for thee. The common people alſo laughed and cried, Out vpon thee. Thirſt oppreſſed thee, but vineger onlie and gall was giuen thee to drinke. Heauen ſhined not on thee; the Sunne gaue thee no light; the earth was afraid to beare thee; ſathan euen then tempted thee, and thine owne humane ſenſes cauſed thee to crie out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>

Behold O King, my king and God almightie, behold a good ſhepheard, which rendereth to thee that which thou committedſt to his charge. He tooke vpon him through thine ordinance to ſaue man, whom he hath deliuered vnto thee cleane and pure from all ſpots, through the waſhing in his bloud. Lo thy moſt deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie beloued Sonne hath reconciled vnto thee thy han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die worke, which was gone aſtraie far out of the waie. Lo, a gentle ſhepheard bringeth home againe to thy flocke, hir that the violent pirate and robber had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen awaie.

                           <p>I was able, O holie father, by my ſelfe to offend thee, but I was not able of my ſelfe to pacifie and appeaſe thee.

                           <p>Lo, my hope, behold in whome is all my truſt. If thou deſpiſe me (as it were meete) for mine iniquities, yet looke vpon me (at leaſtwiſe) mercifulle, for the charitie of thy welbeloued Sonne. Giue heed to thy Sonne, whereby thou maieſt haue mercie vpon thy bond-ſeruant. Looke vpon the ſacrament of fleſh, and
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:1690:455"/>
pardon the offences of fleſh. How often ſoeuer thou doeſt remember the wounds of thy bleſſed Son, ſo oft, I beſéech thee, let mine iniquitie be hid. And bicauſe fleſh hath ſtirred thee to wrath, let fleſh I beſeech thee mooue thee to mercie; that like as fleſh hath ſeduced and led me to ſinne, ſo fleſh may get and obteine for me remiſſion.</p>
                           <p>For certainly, it is much that mine iniquitie hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, but much more it is that the goodnes of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer may euen of right require. Mine vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is great, but his righteouſnes is bigger. For looke how much God is ſuperiour vnto man, euen ſo much is my malice &amp; euill inferiour vnto his goodnes, both in qualitie and quantitie. For what haue I ſinned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man, that the Sonne of God being made man hath not redeemed? What pride could be in me ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high, but ſuch humilitie as was in him ſhould bring it downe? What power of death was there in me ſo great, but the puniſhment, which the Sonne of God ſuffered vpon the croſſe, might deface it, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie deſtroie it? Trulie my God, if the ſinnes of ſinfull men or women ſhould be weied in a iuſt and equall balance, with the loue and fauour that was in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer towards vs, the Eaſt is not ſo far diſtant from the Weſt, nor the innermoſt part of the earth ſo much ſeparated from the vppermoſt part of the heauen, as they ſhould be vnlike, ſo much leſſe ſhould mine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be than is his goodneſſe.</p>
                           <p>Now, O moſt noble Creator of light, now pardon mine offences, for the vnmeaſurable trauels &amp; paines that thy beloued Sonne did ſuſteine.

                           <p>We are made of earth, and after ſinne, our bodies were appointed to the earth; yea the vngodlie ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide for euer in the earth, and neuer appeare in thy glorious heauen. But after thou touchedſt the death with thy liuelie fleſh, thou madeſt it light, thou tookeſt awaie the heauineſſe thereof. Through the blaſt of the firſt ſerpent manie times, euen mans fleſh is turned into verie ſerpents. And in the graue of the wicked, more horrible is the filth of ſpirituall dragons and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents which deuour them euerlaſtinglie, and keepe them in perpetuall death. But thou, O Sonne of God makeſt the graues of thy ſaincts euen pleaſant cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as it were. Thou driueſt far awaie from thence
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:1690:457"/>
all filthineſſe of ſathan. Thou ſetteſt about them the watchmen, euen thy pure Angels, which bring their ſoules into paradiſe, commending them into the hands and boſome of thy Father, and keepe alſo their aſhes, which both were and ſhall be at thy returne the houſe of the holie ghoſt.</p>
                           <p>Beautifie vs in like manner with this thy glorie of true knowledge and calling vpon thee. Be preſent with vs at the point of death; receiue our ſoules at their departure into thine hands, ſhew thou thy comfort &amp; ioie, till at the reſurrection of mankind thou crowne thine elect with perfect &amp; endleſſe glorie, a taſte wherof might be ſeene in thoſe fortie daies after thy reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Neuer was there ſo goodlie a world as that was, when thou roſeſt from death, and broughteſt out of their graues a great companie of thy Saincts, as the Scripture plainelie (but breeflie for the vngodlie) doth teſtifie. Familiarlie did the holie fathers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones remaine with thy ſweet mother and Apoſtles. Pleaſant ſpeeches and much talke was made, no doubt of the miſeries of man, of the vnſpeakable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits gotten by thee, and of the glorie of eternall life.</p>
                           <p>O Lord, raiſe thou vp our harts, that with a true deſire, we may long to come into this faire companie. Let vs turne our ſelues in cogitation vnto that holie aſſemblie. Let vs hearken vnto and learne thy wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome reuealed in thy word. In this life thy Church is in darkeneſſe, in miſeries; men are occupied in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of outward ceremonies, as thoſe godlie wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; they will annoint thy bodie. Manie times thy Church ſeemeth to be depriued of thy ſweet preſence, and vttereth theſe ſorrowfull words: They haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken awaie my Lord, and I can not tell where they haue laid him.

                           <p>And for aſmuch as the one part of vs is heauenlie, and the other earthlie; our bodie which is corrupt, doth loden, and is burdenous vnto the ſoule: therefore my mind, which is my felowe and freend, being wearie with wandering foorth of the waie, is ſicke, and lieth all to torne and rent of thoſe things, which it hath paſſed by. It hungreth and thirſteth greatlie after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and I haue nothing to ſet afore it, bicauſe I am poore and a begger. Thou, O Lord my God art rich in all good things, and the moſt plentious giuer of the deinties of heauenlie ſatietie. Giue meate vnto the wearie; not ſuch as it thirſteth after, but ſuch as is conuenient for it. Gather togither the diſperſed; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new

and refreſh the torne. Lo, he ſtandeth at the doore and knocketh. I beſeech thee, by the bowels of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, wherwith thou being the daie-ſpring from an high haſt viſited vs; open the hand of thy pitie to a wretch that knocketh, and vouchſafe mercifullie to enter into thee; and that I may reſt with thee, and be refreſhed of thee, which art the liuing &amp; heauenlie bread, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with when I am once fed, and that my ſtrength is come to mee againe: I may aſcend vnto more high things, and be lifted vp out of this vale of miſerie and teares, and with the wings of my godlie deſires I may flie vp vnto thee, and the heauenlie kingdome.</p>
                           <p>Let my ſpirit, O Lord, I beſeech thee, take wings as an Egle, and flie without fainting: let it flie vp, and come to the beautifulneſſe of thine holie houſe, and to the place of heauen, where thy glorie dwelleth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as vpon the meate-tables of thy ſupernall citizens, it may be fed full of thy ſecrets in the place of thy paſture by the moſt plentifull riuers ſides. Let mine hart reſt in thee, my God; my hart, I ſaie, which is as though it were a great ſea ſwelling with waters. Thou diddeſt rebuke the winds and the ſea, and there was made ſtreightwaies a great calme: O come and wake vpon the fluds of mine hart, that all things which belong vnto me, may be made calme and cleere: that I may imbrace thee, which art mine onelie God, and that I may behold thee, which art the ſweet light nf mine eies without anie blind darkneſſe of troubleſome cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and thought. Let my mind flie, O Lord, vnder the ſhadowe of thy wings for meate, that it being couered with the temperateneſſe of thy pleaſant coolneſſe, may ſing ioifullie, and ſaie; I will laie me downe, and reſt in peace. Finallie, let my memorie ſleepe, O my God, I beſeech thee, from all euils; make it to hate iniquitie, and to loue righteouſneſſe. For what can be better, or more delectable, than in the middes of the darkneſſe of

                           <p>Oh Lord, which for thy louing kindneſſe art moſt woorthie to be deſired, and coueted of all things: when ſhall I ſee thee? When ſhall I appeere before thy face? When ſhall I be ſatiſfied of thy glorie? When wilt thou bring me foorth of this darke priſon, that I may confeſſe thy name, ſo that afterward I bee no more pricked? When ſhall I paſſe, and go to that maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and beautifull houſe of thine, whereas the voice of gladneſſe and reioicing doth ſound in the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of iuſt men? Bleſſed are they that dwell in thine houſe, O Lord; they ſhall praiſe thee euer world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. Bleſſed are they, yea bleſſed indeed, whom thou haſt choſen, and taken into that heauenlie inheritance. Behold, O Lord, thy Saints flouriſh before thee, like vnto lillies. For they are repleniſhed with the plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of thine houſe, and thou dooeſt giue them to drinke of the flowing riuer of thy pleaſure, bicauſe thou art the well of life, and in thy light and brightnes they doo ſee light; and that ſo greatlie, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which are a light, and are made bright by thee, O Lord, which dooſt giue them light, doo ſhine like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſunne in thy ſight.</p>
                           <p>O how maruellous, how faire and beautifull, how acceptable are the manſions and dwelling places of thine houſe! O Lord of powers, my ſinfull ſoule dooth couet to enter into them. O Lord, I haue loued the comlineſſe of thine houſe, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. I aſked one petition of the Lord, and the ſame will I require; that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the daies of my life. Like as the Hart coueteth to go vnto the water brookes; euen ſo
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:1690:463"/>
dooth my ſoule deſire to come vnto thee, O Lord. When ſhall I come and appeare before the face of my Lord? When ſhall I ſee God, after whom my ſoule longeth verie ſore? When ſhall I ſee him in the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing? For in this land of the dead he cannot be ſeene with mortall eies.</p>
                           <p>What ſhall I doo wretch that I am, which am fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the heauie gieues of mortalitie? What ſhall I doo? Whiles we continue in this bodie wee go aſtraie from the Lord: we haue here no abiding place for euer; but we labour for one that is to come. Our free citie is in heauen. Wo is me; me thinke I dwell among the barbarous nations and infidels, and not amongſt the faithfull Iſraelites. I lead my life in the tents of Cedar. My ſoule hath dwelt too long with them that hate peace and quietneſſe. Who will giue me wings as a dooue, that I may flie awaie, and reſt me? There is nothing that I deſire, or delight ſo much in, as to be in my Lords companie. It is good for me to cleaue vnto God. Oh grant me, O Lord, whileſt I am in theſe fraile members, to ſticke vnto thee, as it is written; He that cleaueth vnto the Lord, is all one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with him. Giue me therefore, I beſeech thee, the wings of contemplation, wherewith when I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled, I may flie vpward. And for aſmuch as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnluckie and infortunate thing lieth beneath: doo thou, O Lord, hold vp my mind, leaſt it fall headlong into the loweſt bottoms of the darke vallie, and leaſt the ſhadowe of the earth ſhould come betweene and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it from thee, that art the bright ſunne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes; and leaſt it once hid with the clouds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhould not haue libertie; but be letted to looke for heauenlie things which be aboue.</p>
                           <p>Therefore I doo aſſaie to go vpward vnto the ioies of quietneſſe and peace, and vnto the delectable and pleaſant ſtate of light. O hold mine hart with thine
<pb n="826" facs="tcp:1690:464"/>
hand, bicauſe it cannot be drawne vnto high things without thee. Thither doo I make haſte, whereas moſt chiefe and principall peace reigneth, and continuall quietneſſe ſhineth foorth. Hold and gouerne my ſpirit, and take it according to thy will, that thou being a guide vnto it, it may aſcend into the region and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of plentifulneſſe, wheras thou feedeſt Iſrael euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtinglie with the food of truth, to the intent, that there at the leaſtwiſe with my ſwift cogitation and thought, I may come nigh thy wiſedome, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth aboue all things, ouerpaſſeth all things, and gouerneth all things.</p>
                           <p>But alas, there be manie things, which when my ſoule would flie vnto thee, doo crie out vpon it. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them all, O Lord, to hold their peace, and ſpeake not vnto me. As for my ſoule it ſelfe, let it giue neuer a word to anſwer. Let it paſſe by all things. Let it clime aboue althings that be created, &amp; come vnto thee. And that it may faſten the eies of faith vpon thee, which art the onlie Creator of all things. Let it couet vnto thee, and be bent towards thee. Let it thinke vpon thee by meditation and contemplation; let it laie thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hir eies for it ſelfe. Let it roll and toſſe thee in hir hart; thee, I ſaie, which art the true and chiefe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the ioie that will remaine without ending.</p>
                           <p>There are ſurelie manie contemplations, in the which mans ſoule is maruellouſlie fed of thee; but in none of them is my ſoule ſo much delighted, or yet hath ſo good reſt in, as in thee, and when as it thinketh vpon thee, and hath thee onelie in contemplation. Oh how much is thy ſweetneſſe, O Lord! How maruellouſlie dooeſt thou inſpire the harts of them that loue thee? How delectable is thy loue, the fruition whereof they haue that loue nothing but thee; they ſeeke nothing elſe; they couet nothing elſe: happie are they, whoſe onelie hope thou art; which haue no truſt, but in thee

                           <p>I require thee by thoſe thy wounds, which bring health vnto vs, which wounds thou ſufferedſt vpon the croſſe for our health; out of the which thy pretious bloud (wherewith thou redeemedſt vs, did diſtill and drop downe,) wound this my ſinful ſoule, for the which alſo thou didſt vouchſafe to die: wound it, I ſaie, with the fire and mightie dart of thy great charitie. For the word of God is liuelie and effectuous, and more pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and ſharpe than anie two edged ſword. Thou, O choſen dart, and moſt ſharpe ſword, which art able by thy power to pearce through the hard ſhield, or buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of mans hart, faſten and ſtrike the ſhaft of thy loue in mine hart, that my ſoule may ſaie vnto thee; I am wounded with thy charitie, ſo that foorth of that ſame wound of thy loue, teares may flowe moſt plentiouſlie both daie and night.</p>
                           <p>Strike, O Lord, ſtrike I beſeech thee this moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durated and hardened hart and mind of mine, with the ſharpe dart of thy loue, and pearce it deeper &amp; dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per into the innermoſt parts thereof, by thy mightie power, and ſo bring out of my head aboundance of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and out of mine eies a verie well of teares, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie running, through the great affect, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous deſire to ſee thy glorie, that I may moorne daie and night, without taking anie comfort in this life, vntill in thy heauenlie wedding chamber I may ſee thee my welbeloued and beautifull ſpouſe, my God and my Lord, and that there when I ſee thy glorious, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous, and beautifull face full of all ſweetnes, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them which thou haſt choſen, then I ſaie, I

In the Sonne the glorie of the Father doth ſhine, and filleth that humane ſubſtance, which the word, through an eternall couenant, coupleth to himſelfe with the ſame
<pb n="833" facs="tcp:1690:467"/>
ſpirit, and powreth it into the harts of beleeuers, to make them like vnto him. For the word, through the ſame ſpirit, quickeneth both his owne and our fleſh. And this is the beginning of eternall life in this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable world. This ſpirit imprinteth the image of God, which the word (preſent in our minds) doth ſpeake in our ſoule, kindeling a light and knowledge conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Goſpell, turneth vs to the true ſeruice of GOD, and ſtirreth vp in our wils ſo holie motions, agreeing to the lawe of Chriſt, as ſhine in that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt now glorified, who cureth our infirmitie.</p>
                           <p>He commeth from the Father ſent by the Sonne to renew vs according to the image of Chriſt. He retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the Sonne and Father to couple vs vnto God; to make interceſſion for vs with grones vnſpeakable, and to mooue the hart of eternall God vnto mercie and compaſſion towards vs. Such is our nature, that through Gods ſpirit we reaſon chriſtianlie, and thinke godlie: then how can it be, but that the ſpirit muſt raiſe godlie cogitations &amp; good motions in our minds, which is by nature a God, and therefore ſubſtantiallie doth he mingle himſelfe with our ſpirits, ſpringing in our nature, but regenerated by him to imprint in vs another light and newneſſe, than is naturall wiſdome and righteouſneſſe; and therefore manie ſighes doo we fetch, euen theſe deepe ſighes.</p>
                           <p>And thou word dwelling in our minds, be thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and kindle our harts by thy blaſt. Conuert vs, Lord, and we ſhall be conuerted. Turne vs to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of our ſinnes; erect vs by the preaching of the Goſpell, and grant that through faith we may receiue the promiſe of the ſpirit. Strengthen vs, that we may retaine ſo excellent a gift, and at no time be intangled in the ſnares of Sathan, neither yet forgo ſo noble a gheſt, for our wickednes, Make vs to walke

circumſpectlie, not as fooles following our vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence; to ſhun all occaſions of falling, &amp; euermore to craue at thine hands, that this pretious gift may from time to time continue with vs, and increaſe.</p>
                           <p>And as vpon this daie thou haſt taught the harts of thy people, by the ſending to them the light of thine holie ſpirit; ſo grant vs by the ſame ſpirit, to haue a right iudgment in all things, and euermore to reioice in his holie comfort. Let the ſame ſpirit bring into our memorie, that which thou haſt ſaid; make it firmelie to retaine the foundation of ſound doctrine, vttered from the boſome of the Father, and at no time to ſeeke new reuelations, as doo the Enthuſian heretikes, both without and beſide the warrant of thy word. Let vs neuer inuent fained gods, and falſe worſhippings; but followe onelie and ſincerelie that, which thou haſt ſaid and taught.</p>
                           <p>The world followeth vaine pleaſure, ſeeketh proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and hunteth after wealth and worſhip, eſpeciallie the laſt age of this world doth ſo: it altogither doteth, and is become ſecure; but fill thou our harts with true peace, wherewith we may ſtaie our ſelues in the combate of conſcience, fighting before the iudgment of God. And in our agonies, when a ſeparation ſhall be made both of ſoule and bodie; then giue vs grace to be mindfull of this thy ſaieng; <hi>Let not your harts be gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; I go, and come againe vnto you.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Let not thy comfortable preſence depart from our ſoule: thou wilt certainlie come againe, euen to raiſe vs from the dead, to place vs in thy kingdome. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we reioice at thy departure vnto thy Father. For the Father is greater than thou. Thou haſt prepared a place, and bleſſed manſion in the houſe of thy Father, exalted to the right hand of the Father, and haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the perſon ſent euen till the conſummation of the world. Ceaſe not to applie the merits of thy ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="835" facs="tcp:1690:468"/>
vnto vs, make continuall interceſſion for vs. Thou abideſt our King and Prieſt, vntill thou deliuereſt the kingdome to thy Father. And therefore as a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor thou dooſt verelie obtaine thoſe good things, which thou haſt promiſed to all beleeuers.</p>
                           <p>Thou valiantlie didſt conquer Sathan, to make vs parteners of thy victorie. Thou willinglie gaueſt thy life, that it might ſatiſfie for manie. Thou waſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to thine eternall Father, in the race of thine humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, that by thy death we might liue. Wherefore, ſeale within vs this faith and righteouſneſſe; grant that continuallie we may retaine thy ſaiengs in our minds; that we may enioie thy peace, and keepe a place for thy diuinitie in our harts, while we liue in this world, through our firſt fruits, and ſo hereafter in the life to come, we ſhall attaine the tenths, and be made like vnto thee, beholding God face to face: <hi>So be it.</hi>

                           <p>And thou, an vnitie of the God-head, through the pluralitie of perſons manifold, art in number infinite, and therefore meaſurablie vnmeaſurable, and waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily vnwaiable. For we knowledge no beginning of the ſouereigne goodneſſe, the which thou art, of whome, through whome, in whom are all things, but through participation thereof we ſaie all good things are. For thy diuine eſſence hath alwaies been, and yet is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out matter, although it lacke no forme, to wit, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the forme of formes, the moſt welformed forme, the which while thou imprinteſt as a ſeale to euerie particular thing, thou makeſt them doubtleſſe to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from thy ſelfe, without any either of your augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or diminiſhing, but whatſoeuer is in the world it is thy creature.</p>

The immenſitie of thy diuine greatneſſe is this, that we knowe thee to be within all things, not as inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and without all things, yet not as excluded. And therefore thou art within, that thou maiſt containe all; and therfore without, that all things may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the immenſitie of thine vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed greatneſſe. So then by that thou art within, thou art knowne to be a Creator; by that thou art without, we perceiue how thou art the gouernour of all things. And leaſt all things, which are created might be without thee, thou art within and without, that all things may be included of thee, not by locall greatneſſe, but by thy mightie preſence, who art eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie-where preſent, and all things preſent before thee: although ſome vnderſtand theſe things, yet ſome doo not.</p>
                           <p>The vnitie then of thine inſeparable nature, can not haue ſeparable perſons; bicauſe, as thou art a Trinitie in vnitie, and an vnitie in Trinitie; ſo can you not haue a ſeparation of perſons. Sometimes indeed, thoſe perſons are particularlie named; but ſo thou wouldeſt, O God the Trinitie, declare thy ſelfe inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in perſons; that there is no name in anie one perſon, but may be referred vnto another, according to the rule of relation: as the Father vnto the Sonne, &amp; the Sonne vnto the Father; ſo hath the holie Ghoſt true relation both vnto the Father &amp; the Sonne. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, thoſe names, which ſignifie either your ſubſtance, O GOD, or perſon, or power, or eſſence, or elſe what, which properlie is called God, doo equalliie agree to all the perſons: as great God, almightie, eternall, and generallie all things, which naturalle are ſpoken of God. So that there is no name of nature, which ſo maie agree vnto thee, God the Father, but the ſame alſo may fitlie be referred vnto the Sonne, and holie Ghoſt.</p>

And therefore, O God holie Trinitie, in perſons thou art inſeparable; in ſenſe are they to be vnderſtood, though in ſound you haue ſeparable names. For you receiue no plurall number in the nature. For hereby it is declared, how the perſons in the holie Trinitie, which is one verie God, can not be diuided: for that the name of euerie perſon, reſpecteth alwaie another perſon. If I ſay the Father, I point vnto the Sonne; if I name the Sonne, I preſuppoſe a Father; if I mention the holie Spirit, I muſt neceſſarilie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of whom he is the Spirit; namelie, of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Sonne.

                     <p>Firſt of all, good Ieſu, I acknowledge before thy

Maieſtie mine vnrighteouſneſſe towards thee. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, O Lord, I was conceiued in ſinne, and borne in the ſame; and thou diddeſt waſh them off from me, and ſanctified me; but I afterward defiled my ſelfe with bigger, and more greeuous ſinnes. For I was borne in ſinne of neceſſitie, bicauſe I could be borne none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: but afterward I rolled my ſelfe willinglie in ſinnes. Neuertheleſſe, thou O Lord, being mindfull of thy pitie, diddeſt take me out of the houſe of my carnall father, and out of the tents of the vngodlie, and haſt inſpired me, and put me in mind to followe thee with the generation of them that ſeeke thy face, of them that walke in the right path of puritie; of them that abide and continue among the lillies of virginitie and chaſtitie, and of them that ſit downe togither with thee at ſupper of moſt ſcarſitie and leaſt exceſſe.</p>
                     <p>But I an vnkind wretch, forgetting ſo manie great benefits, after that I was entered into thy ſeruice, haue committed manie vnlawfull things. I did offend woonderfull vngratiouſlie, dooing manie a foule ſinne. And where I ſhould of right haue amended mine euil life, and left my ſinnes, I heaped ſinnes vpon ſinnes. And theſe be the euils, wherewith I (whom thou didſt create after thine owne ſimilitude and likeneſſe) haue diſhonoured thee, O Lord, and haue ſpotted and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my ſelfe: namelie, with idolatrie, ſuperſtition, pride, vaine-glorie, couetouſneſſe, and other manie euils and foule vices, wherewith mine vnluckie ſoule is vexed, puniſhed, torne, and deſtroied.</p>
                     <p>Behold, O Lord, mine vnrighteouſneſſe is gone ouer mine head, and is like a ſore burden ouer heauie for me to beare: and except thou, whoſe propertie is euer to haue mercie, and to forgiue, doo laie vnder mee the right hand of thy Maieſtie: I ſhall be conſtrained miſerablie to ſinke into the deepe, and be drownd. Giue heed, O Lord God, and behold, bicauſe thou art holie:

looke how mine enimie aſſaulteth me, ſaieng; GOD hath forſaken him, I will perſecute him, and catch him, bicauſe there is no man that will deliuer him; but thou, Lord, how long? Turne againe and deliuer my ſoule, oh ſaue me for thy mercies ſake.</p>
                     <p>Haue mercie vpon thy daughter, whom thou haſt brought foorth with no ſmall ſorowe and paine, and bee not ſo intentiue vnto mine euilneſſe, that thou forget thine owne goodneſſe. What father is there, but hee will deliuer his child? Yea, and what father is there, that will not correct his child, and chaſten it? But with the rod of pitie. Therefore, O Father and Lord, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I be a ſinner, yet can I not chooſe but bee thy daughter, bicauſe thou haſt made me, yea and made me againe when I was mard with ſinne. Repaire and amend me now euermore, O Lord; but firſt of all, I being mended and chaſtiſed as thy child, with thy gentle ſcourge, deliuer me to thy Sonne.</p>
                     <p>Can a mother forget the child ſhe bare of hir womb? And ſurelie although ſhe ſometime be forgetfull, yet thou, O Father, haſt promiſed not to forget vs. Behold I crie, and thou dooeſt not heare me; I am vexed with ſorowe, and thou comforteſt me not. What ſhall I ſaie? Or what ſhall I doo moſt wretched caitife that I am? I being deſolate of ſo great comfort, am caſt out tro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſight of thine eies. Wo be vnto me! From how great goodneſſe into how great a miſchiefe am I fallen? Whither purpoſed I to go? And whither am I come? Where am I? And where am I not? Whom did I labour to attaine vnto? And what euils haue I obteined? I ſought for good things, and behold I haue found trouble, anguiſh, &amp; care. Behold now I am in a moſt miſerable caſe, euen in the ſtate of death and damnation. For Ieſus is not with me; my Ieſus is departed from me: and ſurelie it were better for me to haue nothing at all, yea no being at all, than to bee

without Ieſu. It is better not to liue, than to liue without life.</p>
                     <p>And thou, O Lord Ieſu, where be thine old mercies? Wilt thou abſent thy ſelfe for euer? Wilt thou bee angrie towards me a wretch for euermore? O be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified I beſeech thee, and haue mercie vpon me! Be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified I ſaie, and turne not thy face awaie from me, which to the intent thou mighteſt redeeme me, didſt not turne awaie thy face from them that rebuked thee, ſcorued thee, and ſpitted vpon thee. I confeſſe and acknowledge that I haue ſinned, and my conſcience deſerueth damnation, and the penance that I am able to doo, is not ſufficient to make amends for mine iniquitie: but ſure and certaine I am that thy mercie exceedeth all offences that a man can doo.</p>
                     <p>Oh doo not I be ſeech thee, moſt pitifull Lord, write my heinous ſinnes againſt me, that thou ſhouldeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into iudgement with thy ſeruant; but according to the multitude of thy mercies now haue mercie vpon me, and croſſe and blot out all mine iniquities, before I depart hence, and ſhall be no more ſeene in this world. For elſe, wo be vnto me wretch that I am, when the daie of iudgement commeth, and the bookes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſhall be laid wide open: when it ſhall be ſaid of me, Lo, looke vpon this woman and hir works, how wicked ſhe is, and abhominable they are. What ſhall I doo then, I ſaie, O Lord my God, when the heauens which I haue offended, ſhall reueale and ſhew foorth mine iniquitie; and the earth which I haue polluted, ſhall ariſe vp and teſtifie my manifold miſdeeds againſt me? Behold, I ſhall be able alas to giue neuer a word to anſwere, but to ſtand in thy preſence, trembling, quaking, vtterlie confounded, and holding downe my head for ſhame, as condemned alſo by the teſtimonie of mine owne giltie conſcience, vnto eternall damnation.</p>
                     <p>Alas wretch that I am, what ſhall I ſaie? I will
<pb n="935" facs="tcp:1690:519"/>
crie vnto thee O Lord my God. Why am I conſumed and fretted with holding my peace? But if I ſhould ſpeake, my greefe would not ceaſe: and if I hold my peace, I ſhall be moſt bitterlie vexed within. Go to therefore O my ſoule, moorne and lament as a widowe for hir huſband that ſhe had in hir virginitie. Howle wretch and crie out with weeping, becauſe thy ſpouſe Chriſt hath forſaken thee. O caitiffe crie alowd in the eares of thy God, and ſaie, O God almightie, let not thine anger fall vpon me. Deale not with me after my ſinnes, neither reward me after mine iniquities, becauſe that if thou laie ſo much to my charge as is due for my ſinnes, it is ſo much that I cannot receiue it; ſurelie Lord, my power is not able for to ſuffer or beare it.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, O Lord, haue mercie vpon me, leaſt I deſpaire: but in deſpairing I will take hart to me, and be ſomewhat comforted. For although I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo much, that thou maiſt condemne me woorthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, yet thou haſt not loſt that, wherewith thou waſt woont to ſaue ſinners: neither dooeſt thou reioice at the deſtruction and loſſe of them that die. Yea to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that dead men might liue, thou thy ſelfe didſt die, and thy death did kill the death of ſinne: and if they were reuiued againe, and did liue by thy death, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee let not me die now that thou liueſt. Send downe thy hand and power from high, and deliuer me out of the hands of mine enimies, that they reioice not ouer me and ſaie, Let vs deuoure him.</p>
                     <p>Who euer, O good Ieſu, needed to miſtruſt of thy mercie, which when we were thine enimies, didſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vs with thy bloud, and reconciled vs vnto God? Behold therefore, I being hid vnder the ſhadowe of thy mercie, doo come vnto the throne of thy glorie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring: and I doo runne crieng and knocking, vntill thou take pitie vpon me. For if thou didſt call vs to

pardon and forgiueneſſe before we laboured for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, how ſoone ſhall we obtaine forgiueneſſe when wee aſke it? Doo not remember, O moſt bountifull Ieſu, thy iuſtice towards a ſinner; but thinke vpon thy libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie and gentleneſſe toward thy creature. Doo not remember thine anger toward the giltie, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy pitie and mercie toward a wretch. Forget me, in that I proudlie did prouoke and mooue thee vnto wrath, and looke vpon a wretch that calleth vpon thee. For what is <hi>Ieſus</hi> but a <hi>Sauiour?</hi> Therefore O good <hi>Ieſu,</hi> for thine owne ſake, ariſe and helpe me: and ſaie vnto my ſoule, <hi>I am thy health and thy ſafegard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I preſume much, and am verie bold of thy goodneſſe, O Lord, becauſe thou dooeſt teach vs to aſke, to ſeeke, and to knocke: wherfore, I being admoniſhed by thy word, doo aſke, ſeeke, and knocke. And thou O Lord, that commandeſt vs to aſke, make mee able to receiue. Thou that giueſt counſell to ſeeke, grant that I may finde. Thou that teacheſt vs to knocke, open to me when I knocke, and confirme me which am vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and wauering.

Lo, I haue no more, neither can I giue that which I haue vnto thee, without thee; but doo thou take me, and drawe me vnto thee, that I may be thine in following and louing thee, like as I am thine in condition and creation, which liueſt and reigneſt one God in bleſſed Trinitie, worlds without end,</p>

My zeale is cold, my loue feeble, my exerciſes of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on faint and few, and I take no waie but that which leadeth from euill to worſſe, and finallie, would leade me from ſinne, to the reward of ſinne. All this is true, deere Father, yet my hart is not moued with feare; all this true, yet I doo not ſorowe for it, but walke with ioie, where I muſt (if I continue) reape affliction. Therefore, be mercifull vnto me, and bleſſe me: be mercifull vnto me, and in Chriſt Ieſus waſh awaie all mine iniquities: be mercifull vnto me, and create in me a new hart, and prepare it to praier, and to thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſeruice. For thou alone, O Lord, art my hope, and the mightie God of my ſaluation. Thou haſt giuen me a deſire to ſerue thee, O teach me that I may doo it! and the good worke which thou haſt begun, make it perfect in me, that I may no more loue goodneſſe, and yet followe vanitie; but that my good deſires in thee may be increaſed, and all of them accompliſhed, ſo ſhall I praiſe thee, and magnifie thee for euer. For there is no honour but thy honour; no glorie but thy glorie, O Lord. It is in vaine to truſt in princes, but trulie to truſt in the Lord, bringeth plentifull ſaluation. From age to age it hath appeared, that thou O Lord God art mercifull, and that in thy courts there is nothing but truth and holineſſe. This world is full of vanitie, full of pride, full of rebellion, and the fleſh alſo. The world hath manie baits to deſtruction, and the fleſh doth delight in them, they are ſworne togither to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traie vs to Sathan, yea we betraie our ſelues.
