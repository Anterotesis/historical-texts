            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN framing these myne OBSERVATIONS, Christian Reader, I have had as is meet, first and most regard to the holy Scriptures; in which respect I call them DIVINE: next to the memorable Sayings of wise &amp; learned men, which I have read, or heard, and carefully stored up as a pretious treasure, for mine own, and others benefit; and lastly, to the great volume of mens manners, which I have diligently obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and from them gathered no small part thereof; having also had, in the dayes of my pilgrimage, speciall opportunitie of conversing with persons of divers nations, estates, and dispositions, in great varietie. The names of the authors, specially known, out of whom I gathered any thing, I have, for the most part, expressed: partly to give them their due; and partly, that the authoritie of their persons might procure freer passage for their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and wise sayings, with others: and make the deeper impression of them, in the readers heart. In the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I have been neyther curious, nor altogether negligent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:11142:3"/>
as the reader may observ. Now as this kinde of study, and meditation hath been unto me full sweet, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull; and that wherein I have often refreshed my soul, and spirit, amids many sad, &amp; sorrowfull thoughts, unto which God hath called me: so if it may finde answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptance with the christian Reader, and a blessing from the Lord; it is that which I humbly crave, specially at his hands, who both ministreth seed to the sower, &amp; fruit to the reaper.</p>

                  <hi>the mind is lifted up to see God, which is not fit to see it self;</hi> so seem the reasons of most weight, which prefer the <hi>knowledg of God</hi> to the first place. For, first, God in his Word, and Works is the rule and measure of mans good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and man, at his best, but formed, and reformed after Gods Image. As in Nature, the rule is before that which is to be ruled by it; so must it be in our knowledg. Secondly, such is our in-bred pride, and hipocrisie, as that, whilst we looke only upon our selus, and upon other
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11142:4"/>
Creatures here below, we think we are some-body for goodnesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and vertue: but are then brought to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in our selus, which is requisite for our humiliation, when we come to take some <hi>knowledg</hi> of the super-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie <hi>of God:</hi> even as our bodily ey forth-with daze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth being cast upon the bright Sun; how quick, and strong-sighted soever it seem, whilst it is set onely upon earthly objects. Thirdly, so absolutely necessarie is the <hi>knowledg of God,</hi> as that we can ascribe nothing, as is meet, unto him, <hi>of whom, and for whom</hi> we, and <hi>all things are,</hi> till we first <hi>know</hi> him in his Word, and Works: but even in our best <hi>devotions,</hi> with the superstitious <hi>Athenians</hi> shall build our <hi>Altars to the unknown God;</hi> and with the blinde<note place="margin">Acts 17. Iohn 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Samaritans, worship</hi> we <hi>know not what.</hi> To conclude; He that pretends the service of God, &amp; yet <hi>knows</hi> him not in his Word, and Works of Creation, &amp; Redemption also, wherein his face is seen; is like him that counterfeits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be the houshold Servant of some great Lord, whose face he never saw, nor once came within his Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gates.</p>
               <p>Some ambitious, and curious wits, but not able (&amp; no marvail) to raise up, &amp; advance their notions to <hi>God</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitenesse, for the comprehending of it; have laboured to depresse, &amp; pull him down to their dwarfish conceptions of him: and have indeed rather made him some great, and giant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like man, or Angel; then (as he is in truth) an infinite <hi>God:</hi> allowing him an essence, power, and wisdom hugely great; but not properly infinite, and immence: as though <hi>God</hi> could not be that, which they cannot conceive of him.</p>
               <p>The essence of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>known</hi> onely to himself; but is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discernable to all men, and Angels: partly by reason of its infinitenes, which therefore no finite understanding can comprehend; and partly, for that, no voice, signe, or form can sufficiently expresse it either to sence or reason. And if God have placed such light, &amp; glorie in some created bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11142:4"/>
as that we cannot intentively fix our bodily ey upon them, without dazeling; what marvail is it, though the ey of the understanding of all men, and Angels dazle, in the too curious, &amp; intentive contemplation of his infinite, &amp; infinitely glorious Majestie it self? So as, if the most wise, &amp; learned Christians should with the heathen Phylosopher<note place="margin">Thales.</note> undertake to descry <hi>Gods</hi> being; they would be compelled, as he was, <hi>after one daies respite, to crave two; and after two, four; &amp; so still to double the time, with acknowledgment, that the more they searched into it, the more unsearchable it appeared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Albeit the understanding of man though glorified can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly comprehend Gods infinite being yet shall we, (coming to enjoy the blessed uision of God, where of <hi>the Angels,</hi> and <hi>Spirits of iust men perfited</hi> are made partakers) know in a far both greater measure, &amp; more excellent, and immediate manner, then now we do. <hi>We now walk by faith;</hi>

And although the arguments of comfort be great, which we draw from the certain

Which (considering, that through our abuse of them, they may prove prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to our Spirituall man) if so be the Lord should <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> absolutely, as the former; it were, many times, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, not to <hi>promise</hi> a benefit, but to threaten a hurt rather. And truly we may observe in the dangerous fals, &amp; mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariages of the wise <hi>Salomon,</hi> unto whom temporall good things were absolutely <hi>promised,</hi> in the fullest measure, and accordingly performed; how graciously our wise, and good God provides for our slipperie state, in scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his <hi>promise</hi> of good things of that kinde to our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall skill, and care of useing them, for the advantage of our true, and eternall happinesse. We are therefore first, to beware, that we expect not absolutely temporall pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie: lest by so doing we both wrong the Lords truth,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11142:8"/>
and our own Faith in the things <hi>promised</hi> indeed, by doubting of them, because we have failed of obtaining of other things by us presumed of, but not <hi>promised</hi> by the Lord. Secondly, We must as firmly beleeve, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the performance of temporall <hi>promises</hi> (as the Lord hath made them) as of eternall. For, albeit his loue do not manifest it self in like degree in <hi>promiseing</hi> both; yet his truth is alike bound to exhibit both being once <hi>promised.</hi> Neither is that person in earnest with God, who pretending Faith for eternall good things, yet dare not trust his Word, for temporall. Such as despise Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, and loue earthly, usually pretend their trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God for the former (of which they are indeed profanely secure): but will trust themselvs, and their own fingers for Earthly, which in truth they set by. I must therefore thus conclude with my self touching those matters. Seeing <hi>God hath promised all good things to them</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>that love him. If this, or that bodily good thing (good in it self) be indeed for my good, I shall receave it from him, in due time: And if I receave it not, it is a reall testimonie from him, that indeed it is not good for me, how much soever I desire it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As Gods goodnesse shines most clearly in his <hi>promises;</hi> so mans perversnesse abuseth, and misapplieth them above all other parts of his Word. A great many divide <hi>Gods promises</hi> from the other parts of his revealed will: and making small, or none account, that either the rules of the Word appertain unto them for direction, or the precepts for obedience, or the threatnings for restraint; yet do lay their sacrilegious hands boldly upon the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> as their true, and undoubted right. And the reason is, because the <hi>promises</hi> contain in them things good, and pleasing to mans nature; which because we would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have true, we readily beleeve, and apply.

                  <hi>preserv knowledg,</hi> the Romish Priests chaleng an immunity from erring, whence they should take warning, that they er not.

that are, or can be, and what either he, or they, or both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether will do, or can do, and that upon supposition of whatsoever can be supposed; but both <hi>willeth,</hi> and <hi>doth</hi> in time himself, what he <hi>willeth;</hi> and <hi>doth</hi> it also for good cause, and to good purpose: and accordingly, either, on the one side, hinders; or, on the other, sustains, effects, and orders everie motion of everie Creature.</p>
               <p>By exerciseing these Attributes <hi>God worketh</hi> all his <hi>works</hi> whether immediate by himself alone, or mediate by the creatures; which he useth of all kindes, and everie one according to his kinde; whether good or evill; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable or without reason.

                  <hi>and all things therein.

               <p>Neither can any of the <hi>works of God</hi> possibly be other then verie good, and righteous; seeing they are all wrought by the exerciseing of his holy <hi>will,</hi> divine <hi>power</hi> and godly <hi>wisdom.</hi> And if a simple man ow the honour to him that is of greater wisdom, and understanding then himself, to think, upon occasion, that the other hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for that which he speaks, or does, though he in his shallownes cannot reach unto it: how much more do all men and Angels ow this honour unto God, to <hi>beleev</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, <hi>that whatsoever he saith is true, and whatsoever he doth,</hi>

                  <hi>good, and righteous,</hi> though they discern not the reason of it.</p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>works of God</hi> are such, as we can rather admire at them, then discern of them: Some again are such, as at which proud flesh is ready to repine, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. Amongst <hi>the works of Gods</hi> most wise, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full providence upon bodily things, it is most admirable, that the Heavenly bodies, the Sun, Moon, and Starres should by their influence, and operation, have such power, and effects upon the bodies here below, as to change, order, and dispose the Ayer, Earth, and Water, with all things framed, and compounded of them as they appear to do, by Scripture, sence, and experience. Yet, if we consider (besides the two <hi>greatest lights</hi> and most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">Gen. 49. Iob 38. Hosh. 2.</note> agents, <hi>the Sun and Moon</hi>) the numberlesse number of the Stars, their huge greatnesse, the varietie, and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of vertues, wherewith they are furnished far above the most precious Pearls, or any earthly quintessence; and with all these, the infinite <hi>power</hi> and <hi>wisdom</hi> of him that made, and constituted them; it will not seem incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible unto us, that the least, &amp; suddainest naturall change in the Ayer, Water, or other Elementarie bodies, should be wrought by the position, and disposition of the Stars, and Celestiall bodies. Neither doth this at all diminish, or detract from the honour of the Lord in governing the World, but rather amplifieth it; as it ads to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the skilfull Artificer, so at the first to frame his Clock, or other work of like curious deuise, as that the severall parts should constantly move, and order ech other in infinite varietie, he, as the Maker, and first Mover moveing, and ordering all. Where yet this difference must alwaies be minded, that the Artisan leavs his work being once framed to it self; but God by continuall

influx preservs, and orders both the being, and motions of all Creatures. Here also we except both unnaturall acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; and specially, supernaturall, &amp; miraculous events; which are, as it were, so many particular creations, by the immediate hand of God.</p>
               <p>In them that are made partakers of the grace of God, the remainders of corrupt reason is readiest to rise up at the <hi>work of Gods</hi> providence in <hi>the prosperitie of the way of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 12. Ps. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>the wicked, and workers of iniquitie:</hi> especially, if they themselvs be pressed with any singular afflictions: as we may see in <hi>David, Ieremy,</hi> and other. But the same men of God, who were in their persons, present exampls of humain frailtie, do in their writeings, by the Holy Ghost, affoard us matter sufficient for Divine comfort, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. As first that, before we come to <hi>plead with God, how his works are righteous,</hi> we <hi>know,</hi> and acknowledg <hi>them</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>all to be righteous;</hi> that so we may learn how and wherein their righteousnesse consists. Secondly, that God is both as good to those whom he loves in their afflictions, as in their prosperitie; and as wroth with his enemies, in their momentarie prosperitie, as if his rod were already upon their backs. Thirdly, that he hath appointed a day, in which he will right whatsoever seemeth crooked in the mean while; and will fully, and for ever, recompence both the good and evill: In the expectation of which day, and of the work of the Lord in it, we should satisfie our selvs, for the present, and suspend our thoughts till the manifestation of his righteous Iudgment therein.</p>
               <p>In them that desire to establish mans righteousnesse rather then Gods either righteousnesse, or power; fleshly reason is most apt to quarrell partly that <hi>work of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> by which he freely justifies a sinner; and partly those his just dispensations, upon which followeth the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:11142:12"/>
sin, and miserie for sin. But for the former: It stands not with the riches of <hi>Gods mercie,</hi> and grace, whereof he would make full manifestation in the justifying of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to borrow any thing of mans merit; but well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his bountie, freely to bestow both the gift, and hand to receav it. For the latter; It must be considered, that <hi>Gods work</hi> (so far as it is his) is good, as well in the sinfull doings, or miserable sufferings of men; as in their most holy, and happy estate. The person that sinneth, with all his parts, and powers of soul, and body, is Gods work: so is the preservation, and sustentation of both person, and personall abilities; so is the naturall motion it self, whether within, or without the person (in which the sin is like the halting in the Horses going); and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so is, not onely the voluntarie permission of the sin, which he could easily hinder by his omnipotent <hi>power,</hi> if he would oppose it; but also the ordering both of sin and sinner to his own supernaturall ends. For example; The act of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Thamar,</hi> morally considered, was sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and impure: but naturally; good, and blessed of God with a Son, of whom Christ came according to the flesh. So the abhominable sins of <hi>Absolom</hi> were ordered of God unto most just punishments of the sins of his Father <hi>David.</hi>

               <p>There is a <hi>two-fold use of the world,</hi> and <hi>works of God</hi> in<note place="margin">Bodin.</note> it: the one <hi>naturall;</hi> the other supernaturall. The former is common to men with beasts; who are alike cherished with the heat and influence of the Sun; alike nourished by the Fruits of the Earth. The other is peculiar to men with the holy Angels, by which they behold the face of the Creators power, wisdom, goodnesse, &amp;c. as in a most<note place="margin">Rom. 1.

                  <hi>thought, he was born to look upon the Sun, and Heavens,</hi> was not wide, but short; nor absurd, but defective; For he should have pierced further, even through the Heavens, unto him, that made, and governs them, whose glorious power, and goodnesse shineth in them; that so he might have <hi>glorified him as God, in his works.</hi> For though by that glimpse of light in the Creatures, we cannot attain to the knowledg of God, as our Father in Christ; yet are we both to honour him according to it, and to be provoked by it to further search, and enquirie after him, in such means of revelation, as by which he further manifests himself; which are his Word and Gospel of Salvation: Even as he, that lying in a dark Dungeon spies some small glimpse of light, will <hi>groap</hi> toward it by the wall, hoping<note place="margin">Acts 17.</note> to finde some dore, or window, by which it comes in.

               <p>Thirdly, We must do <hi>good</hi> readily, and <hi>whilst we have</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6. Prov. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>opportunitie; not saying to our neighbour, go, and come again to morrow, and we will do it, if it be in our power to day.</hi> For who knoweth what a day will bring forth, and whether the opportunitie of <hi>doing good,</hi> will continue till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or no? <hi>He that giveth</hi> (or doth other good) <hi>readily,</hi>

And without which loving affection all the kindnesses, which we shew to any, are but so many false witnesses to the unbeleeving, and unkind heart.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, According to our abilitie; knowing that as our receavings are from God greater or lesse, so must our accounts be, for <hi>good doing.</hi> It is true, that God lookes to the heart of the doer, and measures the work by the <hi>will,</hi>

                  <hi>much as the richer, though they have not so much money to do good withall: yet is not the will good, except they do the good they are able.</hi> And this our abilitie we must not measure

according to our wantonnesse, and unbelief: but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the truth of the thing, and equitie of the case: which is, that our superfluities give way to our brethrens conveniencies: our conveniencies to their necessities: yea even our (though great) <hi>necessities</hi> to their extreamities,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.</note> for the supplying of them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, We must have respect to mens present wants; and not onely consider, what we can best spare, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, what they stand most need of: as having learnt of our Lord, and Master, in his Gospel, that our dutie is to <hi>feed</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> and <hi>the shewing of a spring of water to him that is thirstie, being a benefit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>We must do good to all,</hi> knowing, that <hi>wheresoever</hi>

                  <hi>a man is, there is place for a good turn:</hi> but more specially to some, according to the singular bond, Naturall, Civill, or Religious, wherewith God hath tied us together.

               <p>Although this good nature, and the grace of God be as different as Heaven, and Earth: the one being <hi>of our selvs</hi> (that is) of nature created: and the other the <hi>gift of God</hi> by supernaturall grace: and that a man be neither the neerer God for his good nature, where the grace of God is wanting; nor the further of for his ill, where it pleaseth God to use his alsufficient work of grace: yet the sweet and kind naturall disposition in some much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageth the manifestation of their smaller measure: which an ill nature, as we speak, so much obscures, as it can scarse be seen of other men: though the Lords ey peirce through all such humain prejudices.</p>
               <p>It is the main order, which God hath set both in grace, and nature, that the superiour should do <hi>good</hi> to the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour. So God doth <hi>good</hi> to all, and receavs <hi>good</hi> from<note place="margin">Ps. 16.

                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Children for their Parents.</hi> And for this end God bestows <hi>good</hi> things, both inward, and outward, upon some above others, in ample measure; that their aboundance might supply the others want. It were good for other men, that the Mightie of the Earth duly considered this; but better for themselvs; as it is <hi>better to do good to others, then to receav good from them.</hi> But this most wise, and equall order of God is perverted everie where, by mans ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie; <hi>and they who are lesse able, must still be adding</hi>

that the meaner sort bestow more on the better able, then these of them.</p>
               <p>When I consider, what <hi>good</hi> the rich and mightie otherwise, in the World might easily do, if they had hearts answerable; and how little they do, for the most part; it seems horrible unthankfulnesse, and iniquitie in them, and matter of indignation against them: But then, on the other side, when I consider, how little <hi>good</hi> I my self do, in my meannesse (and others my likes) to that which I should, and might do, if I did my utmost; I finde reason to be most angry at my self, and mine own unprofitablenesse; and to be glad, and thankfull, that so much <hi>good</hi> is done by the other, as is.</p>
               <p>In <hi>benefits</hi> and <hi>good turns</hi> done, and receaved, it is the best, and right order, that <hi>he who doth them should</hi> forget,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> and <hi>conceal them;</hi> and <hi>he</hi> remember, <hi>and speak of them, that receavs them.</hi> And therefore the first of the <hi>three Graces</hi> is so ordered, as ever to look forward for the doing of more <hi>good,</hi> and never backward, to upbraid with <hi>good</hi> done: which, where it is used, takes away the grace of the kindnesse; and is as unpleasing, as the after-upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of meat in the stomack, eaten with delight. The other two ever look towards the first, to signifie, in how continuall remembrance <hi>benefits</hi> receaved should be born. Which accordingly to acknowledg with thankfulnesse, is a ready way to procure further <hi>good:</hi> as from God, who specially delights in a thankfull heart, and <hi>would</hi>

A wise man should be a wise man at all times, and in all things; and so should a good man be a good man. Otherwise when a good thing is done (spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be not ordinarie) the goodnesse seems rather to arise from some other motiue from without, then from within the person doing it. Besides, what strange thing is it to see a Stone fall downward, or a Spark fly upward? So nor to see a fool do foolishly, or a lewd person like himself.

               <p>He that hath not in him all Christian graces, in their measure, hath none; and he that hath any one truly, hath all.

And whereas weak Christians might unhappily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> stumble at the revolt from Faith, and holynesse formerly professed by many; as if there were not that stablenesse, satisfaction, and comfort in the Gospel, and grace thereof, which it promiseth; the Lord, in great wisdom, and mercie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves this stone of offence out of their way, by inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating plainly, that those <hi>Apostates</hi> were never truly and throughly made partakers of the Gospels grace; from the former profession whereof they had unfaithfully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.

There is <hi>one Lord</hi> Christ, through whom; and <hi>one Faith,</hi> by which they are justified, and that equally; <hi>one Spirit</hi> by which they are sanctified, though in different degrees; <hi>One calling of God</hi> begun, and perfited by the same Gospel, and Ordinances thereof. No mans highnesse of worldly estate can set him above the lowest part of it, or them:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:11142:24"/>
nor anyes mean-nesse keep him down from flying as high a pitch of Christianitie, as any other. An afflicted outward state stands in need of <hi>Religion</hi> to sustain it: a prosperous, to perfit it in eternall happinesse; besides the moderating of it in the mean while. And seeing our <hi>Religion</hi> is to God alone; and onely the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to men; we ought to be alike grounded in it, and resolved of it, and zealous for it; whether we enioy the fauour of the times, or the contrarie.</p>
               <p>All things requisite for the performance of <hi>Religious</hi> exercises are not parts of <hi>Religion;</hi> but some are of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall necessitie; others for civill order, and comlinesse. The former need neither be taught, nor commanded, being imposed by absolute <hi>necessitie;</hi> which is the <hi>strongest</hi> Law, and most pressing Master, that may be.<note place="margin">Thales.</note> The other are such, as without which all exercises of <hi>Religion</hi> would be confused, and unorderly; and like the Chaos which <hi>God made in the beginning, void and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>without form, and whose face darknesse covered.</hi> For these, the generall rules of the Word, with common sence, and discretion, are sufficient. Notwithstanding, though things be not therefore comely, and orderly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they are done of custom, or commanded by authoritie; but are therefore both used and commanded (lawfully) because they are comely, and orderly: yet if either custom commend, or authoritie command things that are such indeed; wise, godly, and peaceable men should hold themselvs even therefore the more bound unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Religion</hi> is the best thing; and the corruption of it the worst: neither hath greater mischief, and villanie ever been found amongst men, Iewes, Gentiles, or Christians, then that, which hath marched under the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:11142:24"/>
Flag of <hi>Religion,</hi> either intended by the seduced, or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Hypocrites. The <hi>Iews in zeal of God</hi> (such as it was) persecuted Christ himself to the death: and <hi>Saul</hi> in a kind of <hi>zeal of the Law,</hi> was no lesse then a <hi>blasphemer,</hi>

                  <hi>visit the fatherlesse, and widows in their affliction, and to keep a mans self unspotted from the World.</hi> There are many civill Hypocrites, who, if they converse honestly, and kindly with men, presume of great acceptance from God, though they have little care to know his will in his Word, and lesse to observe his Precepts, and Ordinances of Worship. There are also <hi>Religious</hi> Hypocrites not a few, who because of a certain zeal which they have for and in the duties of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:11142:25"/>
the first Table, repute themselvs highly in Gods favour, though they be far from that innocencie towards men, specially from that goodnesse, and <hi>love indeed,</hi> which the Lord hath inseperably joyned with a <hi>truly-Religious</hi> disposition. Such persons vainly imagine God to be like unto the most great men; who if their followers be obsequious to them, in their persons; and zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for them in the things, which more immediately concern their honours, and profits; do highly esteem of them; though their dealings with others, specially meaner men, be far from honest, or good. But God is not partiall, as men are: nor regards that Church, and Chamber <hi>Religion</hi> towards him, which is not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied in the House, and Streets, with loving kindnesse, and mercie, and all goodnesse towards men. Such are also stuffed with selflove in their verie <hi>service of God,</hi> and do but flatter him for their own advantage: For <hi>if they</hi>

                  <hi>love not</hi> (and that <hi>in truth and deed) their brother whom they see, how can they love God whom they see not?</hi> Besides, they sacrilegiously divide the two Tables of the Law one from another, making the <hi>two great Commandments,</hi> which Christ saith, are <hi>like one to another,</hi> to be unlike in effect. In these, Pharisaism lives, and <hi>Faith is dead:</hi> who as they shame Christianitie, and Christ in it, what in them lyes; so shall their recompence from him be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable at that day, when everie man shall receav ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or shame, according to the works, specially of mercie, and goodnesse that way, which he hath done, or not done in the flesh.</p>
               <p>The common saying, <hi>As good never a whit, as never the better,</hi> is verified in the works of <hi>Religion:</hi> which not being performed, as they ought, for substance, are accounted, as not done, in regard of Gods acceptance,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:11142:25"/>
and the doers present benefit. So the new <hi>Inhabitants of</hi>

                  <hi>Samaria served not the Lord; and yet they served the Lord.</hi> So <hi>he is not a Iew, who is one outwardly, neither that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>which is outward</hi> (to wit onely) <hi>in the flesh.</hi> So the <hi>carnall Corinthians in eating the Lord Supper,</hi> did <hi>not that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11</note> 
                  <hi>which was to eat the Lord Supper,</hi> to wit, with acceptance from God, and <hi>profit</hi> to themselvs, for the present. I say, for the present: for by after repentance those verie <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> might come to have and obtain the right use and end of the Lords Ordinance formerly abused by them, and unusefull to them: and so might <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> by <hi>repentance,</hi> of the <hi>baptism</hi> prophanely, on his part, receaved at the first. The reason of this is, because the effect of the Word, and Sacraments, and other Ordinances of <hi>Religion</hi> is neither naturall, as of meat, and drink, which must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nourish presently, or not at all: nor depends upon the worthinesse of the Minister, as the <hi>Donatists</hi> imagined; no nor upon the present fitnesse of the Receaver simply (though both Minister and Receaver ought to be worthy, and fit): but upon Gods blessing of that which is his own, in his time (it may be many yeers after the receaving) unto his elect; and in mercie covering what was formerly amisse both in Giver and Receaver.</p>
               <p>Besides them, who put on <hi>forms of godlinesse,</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.</note> onely, as men put on their Cloaths (because to be naked of all <hi>Religion</hi> would be both shamefull, and in many places dangerous) and them, who for <hi>love of lucre</hi>

                  <hi>and riches fein and dissemble in Religion;</hi> many of those who seriously minde it, make their choise amisse: as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lead by custom of times, and places, in which they live; or by affection and admiration to and of some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall persons; or traduced by some vehement passion of anger, fear, envie, or the like: or mislead by some guilfull
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11142:26"/>
appearance, without due examination. And having so done, they commonly set themselvs earnestly to advance that faction into which they have once entred, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse all others, though oft without competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of one, or other. Wherein yet they misse, whichso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is good, or bad; since either may be either, for ought they know. Notwithstanding, we ow this honour to the particular courses of <hi>Religion</hi> which we have once im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, or wherein we have been brought up, and receav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any good, that we leav it not lightly; nor further in any particular, then we needs must; nor at all, in the things, which God, in it (in true, and distinct consideration) hath blessed to our Spirituall good. To be lightly moved in <hi>Religion,</hi> is childish weaknesse: but to be stiffe without reason, manly obstinacie: and better to be a childe in weaknesse, then a man in perverse obstinatenesse. The former thinks too well of others, by whom he is too easily moved: the latter thinks too well of himself; despising other men, and Gods gifts, and graces in them; as if <hi>the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Word of God came either from him, or to him alone.</hi> And this fault of the two, is both the worse, and more dangerous: The former may in time be more easily confirmed in the truth; as a childe, in time, becomes a man: the other is seldom and hardly reclaimed, by reason of his hardnesse and obstinacie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Disputations in Religion</hi> are sometimes necessarie, but alwaies dangerous; drawing the best spirits into the head from the heart; and leaving it either emptie of all; or too full of fleshly zeal and passion if extraordinarie care be not taken still to supply, and fill it a new with pious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions towards God, and loving towards men. And this the more, considering how the <hi>controversies in Religion</hi> are generally carried with more heat, then of any other
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:11142:26"/>
subject: For that, besides reason, art, credit, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of truth, and right; which warm men in other differences; they are in this inflamed, as it were, with zeal for God, and his service: for whom, and which, not to be fervent, seemeth to be derogatorie to his, and its honour. We are therefore carefully to beware, and earnestly to pray, that we may in <hi>controversies of Religion</hi> strive for God, and according unto God: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them we both may easily, and do dangerously er, if we misse at all: And therewith, that we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make our adversaries cause worse then it is; nor conceiv a sinister opinion of his affections in it, without reason. In both which men seek unhonest and unconscionable advantages: and are sorrie in effect, that they whom they oppose, are not worse then they are.</p>
               <p>He that <hi>strives</hi> for errour, <hi>strives</hi> for Satan against God: He that <hi>strives</hi> for victorie, <hi>strives</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against other men: But he that <hi>strives</hi> for truth against errour helps the Lord against Gods, and his own enemie Satan, <hi>The Father of Lyes;</hi> and this specially, if withall he handle Gods cause according unto God. A man shews most knowledg and understanding in the matter of truth: but most grace in the manner of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, with reverence, holinesse, and modestie.</p>
               <p>No Facultie hath so many unskilfull ones to medle in it; as that of <hi>disputing in matter of Religion.</hi> Which cometh to passe, either because men think it a shame for them not to have both knowledg in, and zeal for that subject: or because they make account in truth, that they venture nothing but words in the voyage, and so can have no great losse: or els (which, is common with ignorants) because they still presume they gain,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:11142:27"/>
with whom, or about whatsoever they medle: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if they had modestie to call things into considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and wisdom to discern of them aright; they would finde themselvs plain loosers, where they think their gain greatest.</p>
               <p>Divers men are affected diversly with the oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and arguments this way brought against their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents. Some through feeblenesse of heart are afflicted with them, as with a troup of enemies invading their possessions: others are lightly turned about, like wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-cocks, with everie puffe of new Doctrine. The complaint is just, and great of the vanitie, and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of men, and women, in finding, and following new fashions of apparell: but it were well, if this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and newfanglednesse, were to be seen onely on peoples backs, and that the complaint were not as just, and more grievous of the profane wantonnesse of many in taking up new forms of Faith, and <hi>Religion,</hi> specially in places of Libertie, and where men may professe any <hi>Religion,</hi> or none, if they will, without bodily danger. I have known divers, that have more lightly, and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously changed their <hi>Religion,</hi> and that in no small points, then a sober man would do the fashion of his Coat: and who (in my conscience) if it might but have gained, or saved them twelue pence, would have held their former <hi>Religion</hi> still. Others by <hi>oppositions</hi> are drawen into further <hi>search,</hi> and examination of things:<note place="margin">Acts 17.</note> and this is commendable, where the matter is such, as we either understand not throughly, or may er in. Some again, though of weak understanding, no sooner heare an objection against any thing, which they hold, but forth with they fall upon it with an answer. And this they do oft out of a conceipt that it is a point of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:11142:27"/>
wit in them, and credit to them, to say something to everie thing, though little to purpose to any thing: in whom the Proverb is verified, to the contrarie, <hi>He that answereth</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Divisions</hi> amongst a few, though not in the greatest matters, are most observed, because First, It is expected that weak parties should be firmly united for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defence.

are oft more vehement, partly for the greater zeal (spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, or carnall) of the persons; and partly because their <hi>opposition is more immediate;</hi> whereas amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">Bodin.</note> it will be hard, but some mediatours will be found, to moderate things.

               <p>Men are for the most part minded for, or against <hi>Toleration of diversitie of Religions,</hi> according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie, which they themselvs hold, or hold not with the Countrey, or Kingdom, where they live.

The verie same is to be observed in the ancient Fathers, in their times: of whom, such as lived in the first three hundred yeeres after Christ, and suffered
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11142:29"/>
with the Churches, under Heathen Persecuters, pleaded against all violence for <hi>Religion,</hi> true or false: affirming that <hi>it is of humain right and naturall libertie, for everie man</hi>

                  <hi>to worship what he thinketh God:</hi> and that <hi>it is no propertie of Religion to compell to Religion, which ought to be taken up freely:</hi> that <hi>No man is forced by the Christians against his will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lactantius</note> 
                  <hi>seeing he that wants faith, &amp; devotion, is unserviceable to God:</hi> and that <hi>God not being contentious, would not be worshiped of the unwilling:</hi> Whereas, on the contrarie, the latter, having the Emperours Christian, and on their side, incited, and pressed them to violent courses. But considering, that to tolerate is not to approve; and that the Magistrates are Kings, &amp; Lords over men properly, and directly, as they are their Subjects, and not as they are Christs; but that by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and as the same persons who are civilly their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, are Spiritually Christs and Christians; and lastly, considering, that neither God is pleased with unwilling worshipers, nor Christian societies bettered, nor the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons themselvs neither, but the plain contrarie in all three; the saying of the wise <hi>King of Poland</hi> seemeth approveable,<note place="margin">King <hi>Steven.</hi>
                  </note> that it is <hi>one of the three things which God hath kept in his own hands, to urge the conscience this way,</hi> and to cause a man to professe a <hi>Religion,</hi> by working it first in his heart.</p>
               <p>If the order in <hi>Israel</hi> be objected; it may be answered, First that the Land was holy, as no Land now is; that one Nation seperated from all other Nations to be the Lords peculiar people, as no Nation now is; the Kings types and figures of Christ, as no Kings now are: and Secondly, That none were, in truth, compelled to the Israelitish Church and <hi>Religion;</hi> but being of it, whether <hi>Israelites,</hi> or <hi>Proselites,</hi> were to be <hi>cut off from the Lords people, and</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If it be further objected, that men may be by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate constrained to the outward acts of justice, honestie, and the like, though destitute altogether of the inward vertues; It may be answered, that these serv properly, and immediately to preserv civill societies, of which Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates are properly Kings, and Lords, and so do obtain their proper ends, if the verie outward things be done, though never so unwillingly: But of <hi>Religious</hi> actions the proper end is not civill societie, nor is attainable but by Faith, and devotion in the heart of the doers.</p>
               <p>Lastly, To that of the Father, that <hi>many who at first serv</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Austin.</note> 
                  <hi>God by compulsion come after to serv him freely, and willingly.</hi> I answer, that neither good intents, nor events, which are casuall, can justifie unreasonable violence: and withall, that by this course of compulsion many become Atheists, Hypocrites, and Familists: and being at first constrained to practise against conscience, loose all conscience afterwards. Bags, and vessels overstrained break, and will never after hold any thing. Yet do I not denie all compulsion to the hearing of Gods Word, as the means to work <hi>Religion,</hi> and common to all of all sorts, good, and bad; much lesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse civill disobedience palliated with <hi>Religious</hi> shews, and pretences; or condemne convenient restraint of publike Idolatry; so as this rule of reason holds its place, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the bond between Magistrate, and Subject is essentially civill:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Keckerm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> but <hi>Religious</hi> accidentally onely, though <hi>eminently.</hi> For conclusion of this matter, Let the godly Magistrate consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that as there is no Church-state, and profession so
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:11142:30"/>
truly Christian, and good, in which too many may not be found carried in their persons with a Spirit plainly Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian: so there is hardly any Sect so Antichristian or evill otherwise, in Church profession, in which there are not divers truly, though weakly <hi>led with the Spirit of Christ</hi> in their persons, and so true members of his mysticall body. With whom to deal rigorously for some few aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of ignorance, or infirmitie, were more to please Christs enemie in the oppressing of the person; then Christ, in so repressing his failing in some particulars, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be not fundamentall.</p>
               <p>As then the Christian Magistrate hath his power of Magistracie from God, which his Christianitie servs to sanctifie, and direct: so, undoubtedly, he is to use it for God, and his honour, &amp; that in his true worship, in which he is specially honoured; and against the contrarie; yet with these two cautions. First, That as the greater sins of other kinds, do not so violate and dissolv the marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond, as adulterie doth, by reason of its direct opposition thereagainst: so neither do Idolatry, or Heresie (how great sins soever in themselvs) so outlaw a Subject civily, as do Seditions, Murthers, Adulteries, and the like directly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, and disturbing civill societies. The second is, That no authoritie of man may bring into, or uphold in the Church either Doctrine, or Ordinance of Religion, or person (which last is not lightly to be regarded, seeing the other two serv for it) unto which the Lord in his Word hath not first given testimonie of approbation for that use: seeing Magistrates are not Governers against, nor besides, but under God, in their Dominions.</p>

We are led to the knowledg of God in his Power, Wisdom, Goodnesse, Iustice, and Mercie, by his Works both without, and within us; And whensoever God either doth, or suffers a thing to be done (though not so much as insinuated formerly in his <hi>Word</hi>) we then know it to be his will, that such a thing should be, as certainly, as if he had expresly revealed it before in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> I speak of <hi>pleasing God in all things;</hi> First, because entire obedience (so far as humain frailtie will permit) is the immediate end, and use of the <hi>Word of God;</hi> and the way, and means to Salvation: Secondly, to meet with that dangerous presumption of doing that, which is <hi>necessarie to Salvation</hi> (as many use to speak) though with affected ignorance of, and apparent disobedience to many of Gods Commandments. Who knoweth with how little God can, and doth save many, being faithfull in learning what they can, and in observing what they know? Though much more be necessarie to such, as have means to know more. And thirdly, because it is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:11142:31"/>
no childe-like, but a bastardly disposition, to take care for serving God no further (though, alas, all be little enough for that) then to be sure of the Fathers inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

               </p>
               <p>God would have his will written, that is, his <hi>Word</hi> to become <hi>Scripture,</hi> partly for more certaintie of truth to men, and to preserv it the better from being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; as all make account, that things <hi>set down in black, and white</hi> (as they speak) are most firm: partly, for accord, and unitie of Churches, and Christians in the same truth: who, if they differ so much, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they use the same rule; what would they do, if their rules were different, or uncertain? and partly, for more communitie; seeing <hi>Books,</hi> and <hi>Writings</hi> may easily both be dispersed whither the voyce of Teachers cannot come, and also be read in private by Christians, when they are apart from their Teachers.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>written by Divine inspiration</hi> (but some of them humainly, as their humain affaires, common to them with other men, required): <hi>Neither was all wherein they were divinely inspired, brought into the publike treasurie of the Church, or made part of the Canonicall Scriptures, which we call the Bible;</hi> no more then all which they spake, was spoken by the Spirit; or all which they spake by the Spirit, <hi>written:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 20. and 21.</note> but onely so much, as the Lord in wisdom, and mercie, thought requisite to guide the Church in Faith, and obedience, to the worlds end: so as the <hi>Scriptures</hi> should neither be defective through brevitie; nor burthensom by too great largenesse, and prolixitie. And thus to judg

is more answerable both to Gods providence in preserving the <hi>Scriptures</hi> from miscarrying; and to the Churches care, and faithfulnesse in keeping safe this heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure committed to her custodie; then to say with some, that any of the Books, or parts of the <hi>Canonicall Scriptures</hi> are lost.</p>
               <p>It no more detracts from the authentique authoritie, or generall use of some parts of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> that they were penned upon some speciall occasions, then of the Sermons of Christ, the Prophets, and Apostles, that some of them were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preached upon speciall occasions: And surely, it seems a strange conceipt, that the authoritie of the <hi>writing</hi> should be the lesse, because the thing <hi>written</hi> was suggested by the Holy Ghost, and so penned, upon speciall occasion offered: as such <hi>Scriptures</hi> were.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scriptures</hi> are not onely authentique in themselvs, as having <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> for the Authour both of matter,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> and manner, and writing; but do also (as they say) <hi>carrie their authoritie in their mouthes,</hi> binding both to credence, and obedience, all whomsoever, unto whom they come, by what means soever.

God as most needfull for their fruitfull understanding, the light of his holy Spirit: onely we account, and avow them as a most perfect rule neither crooked any way, nor short in any thing requisite. This their suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie and perfection is not to be restrained to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters simply necessarie to Salvation: For who can say, how many, or few, and no more, nor lesse, they are? But to matters necessarie to obedience, that we may <hi>please God</hi> in all things, great, or small; expressed, or<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4.</note> intended, and to be gathered by proportion, and just consequence. <hi>Without Faith we cannot please God;</hi> and<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.

                  <hi>Faith comes</hi> onely <hi>by the Word of God:</hi> which we must therefore make our guide in <hi>all our wayes.</hi> And if we be to <hi>give an account for everie idle word,</hi> and so for every vain thought, or work, there is then a Law of God for these smallest matters: for <hi>where no Law is, there is no transgression;</hi> and where there is no transgression, or fault, there is no account to be given.

But this is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>the Scriptures</hi> are defective in directing; but we either blinde in discerning, or negligent in searching, or both. And if the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> direction reach unto the whole course of our life, how much more of our Religion, or worship of God? In which nothing is to be practised, but that which is to be beleeved; nothing to be beleeved, but that which is to be taught; nothing to be taught, but according to the <hi>Scriptures: This being</hi>

               <p>As <hi>the title set over the head of Christ crucified,</hi> was the same <hi>in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin;</hi> so are the <hi>Scriptures</hi> the same, whether in the Originall; or other Language, into which they are faithfully translated.

               <p>In a Translatour is required specially skill in words, and Tongues; in an Expositour, judgment in things.

Law, and how it is to be expounded; so for the exposition of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> the Spirit of God, as the Authour thereof, is first and most to be consulted with, by faithfull, and earnest prayer, from a good conscience; that God may fulfill his promise made of <hi>giving his holy Spirit to them</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 11. Psal. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>that ask it;</hi> and of <hi>revealing his secrets to them that fear him.</hi> And so some speciall Instruments of renuing the <hi>Gospels</hi> light in the former Age, have professed, that they <hi>learned</hi>

                  <hi>more this way by prayer, then by much studie</hi> otherwise.</p>
               <p>There is in a <hi>Scripture</hi> but one proper, and immediate sense; others are rather collections from it, relations unto it, or illustrations of it, then immediate senses. The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall sense is to be followed (as being most naturall) what may be; and not to be refused, if it may stand <hi>without</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ireneus</note> 
                  <hi>danger, without blasphemie, and according to other Scriptures.</hi> And here it must be noted, that Christ, and his Apostles in expounding <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, did not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly expresse their conceptions, and meanings, but the meaning of the Spirit speaking in them; and that (by reason of their more plentifull measure of the same Spirit and experience withall) in some particulars (as I conceav) further then the Prophets themselvs understood: albeit they alwaies knew the immediate drift of the Spirit and meaning of the things, which they spake: and were not as the <hi>Pythonists,</hi> or other the like Instruments of the Divell, uttering Oracles which they themselvs understood not.</p>
               <p>The Lawyers have a rule (and the same competent to the matter whereof they treat) that <hi>Laws of fauour are to be extended, as largely, as may be:</hi> but <hi>odious Laws</hi> (as they speak) <hi>as much straitned, and confined within the narrowest bounds of interpretation.</hi> But all <hi>Gods Laws, and Instructions</hi> must, in honour of the Lawgiver, be expounded in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:11142:34"/>
largest sense, that they can beare: that so they may reach as far, and binde as fast, as may be. This the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitenesse of his wisdom challengeth, in directing us; of his authority, in commanding us; of his mercy, in promiseing; and justice, in threatning: Which by so interpreting, and applying his <hi>word,</hi> we acknowledg, and honour, as is meet. And as they are blame-worthy, who out of a scrupulous fear, lest they should ad to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> allow them no further meaning, then the words expresse: so is their sin greater, and full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, who shorten, and straiten the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to that which is expressed in so many words, that they may make room thereby, for their own devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. A <hi>Scripture</hi> commandeth, promiseth, or threatneth whatsoever is contained in it, though not expressed: And that is contained in it, which can truly, and iustly be gathered from it, though by never so many conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, or inferences; though the fewer the lesse dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, by reason of our weaknesse of discourse.</p>
               <p>Particular words and phrases more obscure are to be interpreted according to the scope &amp; <hi>mind of the speaker</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Celsus.</note> (the Holy Ghost) in the place: which is, both <hi>in time, and excellencie, before the thing spoken;</hi> and that for which the Spirit speaketh as it doth in the place: <hi>neither is the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chrysostom</note> 
                  <hi>Scripture profitable, except the scope be first found.</hi> And to hang upon a word, phrase, or sentence in a Text, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking to the main drift, is, if any other, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an hereticall disposition. With this that other most necessarie rule hath affinitie; namely, that <hi>the words</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Melancton</note> 
                  <hi>are to be understood according to the subject matter:</hi> the words of Law, and Gospel according to the different nature of Law, and Gospel; the words of an Historie Historically; of a Sacrament Sacramentally and mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11142:34"/>
and accordingly notes of universalitie according to the extent of the matter, or person spoken of.</p>
               <p>As we oft finde out, &amp; learn mens meaning by some of their companie, &amp; of such as are about them; which we could not learn of themselvs; so may we gather the meaning of a <hi>Scripture</hi> (otherwise hard to be understood) by marking the things which accompanie it, and which are <hi>above and below,</hi> as the Iews use to speak, and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans<note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> with them.</p>
               <p>Like as the Lamps in the Golden Candlestick did one help anothers light; so doth one place of <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> anothers. And though a thing found in one place (if in one indeed) be as true, &amp; binde as strongly, as if it were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times <hi>written;</hi> yet so to insist upon any one place, in a difference, as to neglect others, is the high-way to error, and to <hi>loose the right sense, by breaking the Scriptures golden chain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chrysostom</note> whose links are all fastened together. And as one place must be expounded by another; so must the more brief and obscure by the more plain, and larg: and not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, &amp; crosse way: for that were not to lighten the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a Text, but to darken its light: according to that of the Father: <hi>The fewer must be understood according to the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> 
                  <hi>more; and one saying must rather be taken according to all, then against all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching precepts affirmative, and negative, First, They are usually either kept, or broken together. He who doth not what he should do, commonly doth what he should not do; If <hi>a man be drawn away</hi> from God, he<note place="margin">Iames 1.</note> is easily <hi>ensnared by his own lust:</hi> On the contrarie, he that doth his dutie faithfully, hath as it were, a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> from the Lord, against the temptations of sin, and Satan. The way <hi>not to fulfill the lusts of the flesh is to walk</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>in the Spirit.</hi> Secondly, The receaved rule, that <hi>affirmative</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:11142:35"/>
                  <hi>precepts binde alwayes, but not to alwayes, as negatives do,</hi> is true, being rightly understood. We are to take no time for doing evill, and but some time for the <hi>doing</hi> of the best <hi>good,</hi> to wit, as we have <hi>opportunitie,</hi> and abilitie. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> In the prohibition of an evill we must ever understand the command of the opposite vertue; and so on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. He that saith expresly <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> means also, as well, <hi>Thou shalt preserv thy neighbours life.</hi> Lastly, There is both more vertue, &amp; more vice practised in affirmatives, then in negatives. It is more good to do good, then not to do evill: and more evill to do evill, then not to do good; though both <hi>the tree that brings forth</hi> evill fruit, and <hi>that brings forth no fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The oppositions intended in <hi>Scriptures</hi> are diligently to be observed: upon mistaking whereof errour followeth; upon neglect, maimed obedience. For example: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in teaching that there is but <hi>one God the Father, and one</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> doth not oppose the Father to the Son; nor the Son to the Father for either is God, either Lord): but both to all whether Creatures, or Idols. So where Christ bids his Apostles <hi>baptize them that beleev,</hi> he doth<note place="margin">Math. 25. Mark. 14.</note> not exclude their infants; but such as <hi>beleev not</hi> the Gospel being preached unto them. Likewise, where <hi>Paul</hi> saith of the incestuous man, that he was <hi>rebuked of many;</hi> he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.</note> not many to all (as some conceav) but to one, <hi>viz.</hi> himself.</p>
               <p>Lastly, He that will expound the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ought in honour of the graces of God bestowed upon other men, and in conscience of his own infirmitie, with the holy use of other means, to joyn the reading and searching of the commentaries &amp; expositions of such speciall Instruments, as God in mercie hath raised up for the opening of them,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11142:35"/>
and edifying of the Church thereby: remembring alwaies, that <hi>the Word of God neither came from him, nor to him alone.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14</note> He that depends too much upon other mens judgment, makes as if <hi>the Word of God</hi> came not to himself at all: He that neglects it, as if it came to him onely. Of which two evils the latter is so much the worse, as arrogancie in a mans self is more odious both to God, and men, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther slacknesse in examining, or dulnesse in discerning, or excessive fear of departing from the opinion (specially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved) of others.</p>
               <p>It is strange, and lamentable, that in the great profession of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> made in our dayes, so many should be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the difference between the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel;</hi> of which two heads the <hi>Scriptures</hi> consist: making the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> nothing els, but a more favourable, and easie <hi>Law:</hi> and thereby transforming grace into nature; a promise to be receaved, into a commandment to be fulfilled: and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of new life (even <hi>the life of Christ</hi>) into the exacting<note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> of old, and due debt onely. God as an absolute Lord, gives his holy <hi>Law,</hi> saying, <hi>Do this and live:</hi> and therein properly exacts obedience, as a naturall debt, of the reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thereunto enabled by creation: But as a gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publisheth <hi>the Gospel,</hi> in it offering help to the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and helplesse creature, and working withall (according to the election of grace) power, &amp; will to receav the help, and hand offered. This if many considered, as they ought, they would not, as they do, plead the power of mans free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in Spirituall things, against the free grace of God; nor exclude, as some of them do, the infants of beleevers from the covenant, and baptism of the Church: as though God could not shew grace, because they cannot shew free-will to receav it.</p>
               <p>The utmost ordinarie means of revelation of Gods will
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11142:36"/>
for mans salvation, and happines, is <hi>the Gospell.</hi> When the <hi>Law</hi> written in mans heart by creation was almost worn out, God gave it written in tables of stone. But <hi>life, and freedom from sin, and death,</hi> being <hi>impossible</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>to the Law in that it was weak, through the flesh,</hi> and all men by it (whether considered as written in tables of stone, or of the heart, by creation) <hi>comming short of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>glory of God;</hi> it hath pleased the same God by <hi>the Gospell</hi> of his son Christ to provide a gracious remedy; that the sick to death, by the justice of the <hi>Law</hi> might be cured; yea the dead revived, by the grace of the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi> and mercy of God therein. And other remedy besides, and beyond this, for the obteyning of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God hath not revealed. He that fulfils not the righteousnesse of the <hi>Law,</hi> violates Gods justice: but remaining obstinate against the grace of the <hi>Gospel</hi> also, he despises, with Gods justice, his mercy; and his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in both. And what remains for such, but a fearful expectation of the work of his terrible power; of <hi>the</hi>

                  <hi>revelation of his wrath from Heaven against all</hi> (specially such) <hi>ungodlinesse of men? For if the word</hi> (of the Law) <hi>spoken by Angels was steadfast, and everie transgression, and disobedience receaved a just recompence of reward: How shall</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Vthoritie</hi> leads us to the <hi>Authour</hi> of a thing, and bids us rest in his word, whether for credence to his relation, or obedience to his commandment. <hi>Reason</hi> wils us to look to the thing it self, and to the arguments for, or against it, taken either from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense; or naturall principles, and conclusions; or other undoubted grounds of truth, or goodnesse of matter.

It is a kind of impeachment of <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</hi> to examine the <hi>Reasons</hi> of things: so is it a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to <hi>Reasons</hi> work to call <hi>Authoritie</hi> to counsell; save onely when God speaks; for then the <hi>Authoritie</hi> justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the <hi>Reason;</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> bids, receav the <hi>Authoritie,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Authoritie</hi> and credit of him that relates a matter, whether man, or Angel, yea or God himself, makes it not the truer in it self, but the more readily to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them that hear it. The testimonie of God in his Word, that <hi>in the beginning he made the World of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> and will <hi>judg men and Angels at that day by Iesus Christ,</hi> is onely therefore true in it self, because God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath done the one, and will do the other; but is therefore by us to be beleeved as true, because he so testifies in his Word.</p>
               <p>Divine <hi>Authoritie</hi> is to sway with us aboue all <hi>Reason:</hi> yea <hi>Reason</hi> teacheth, that God is both to be beleeved, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:11142:37"/>
obeyed in the things, for which man can see no <hi>Reason.</hi> And hence it is that the Lord hath so severely punished mens transgressing his Laws of Ceremonies, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institutions, called by the Schoolmen <hi>voluntarie precepts;</hi> for that in commanding of them Gods abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Authoritie</hi> most clearly appears, and mans pure obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in observing them. Humain <hi>Authoritie</hi> hath more or lesse weight, according to the worth of the person, or other circumstances: But as the moneys of all men high, and low; good, and bad; are alike; so are the <hi>Reasons.</hi> The meanest mans <hi>Reason</hi> (specially in<note place="margin">1 Sam. 6. 2 Sam. 6. 2 Chr. 26</note> matter of Faith, and obedience to God) is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all <hi>Authoritie</hi> of all men. I say, specially of Faith; yet not excluding other subjects. For though I will and ought to do some things, simply because I am commanded; yet I will not therefore simply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev that any thing is good in it self. And albeit I am bound to obey humain <hi>Authoritie</hi> in sundry things, for the commanding of which I know no <hi>Reason,</hi> yea know there is no <hi>Reason:</hi> yet know I <hi>Reason</hi> for mine obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, even the honour of <hi>Authoritie,</hi> and preservation of peace. The thing commanded may be unjust, and evill in him that commands, and yet good in me obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Authoritie</hi> in it. For example. A matter of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wrong to me commanded by the Magistrate; in the doing whereof I sustain dammage, but sin not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> who <hi>made two great lights</hi> for the bodily ey, hath also made two lights for the ey of the mind: The one the Scriptures, for her supernaturall light; and the other <hi>Reason,</hi> for her naturall light. And indeed onely those two are a mans own: and so is not the <hi>Authoritie</hi> of other men. The Scriptures are as well mine, as any
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:11142:37"/>
other mans; and so is <hi>Reason</hi> as far as I can attain to it: But the <hi>Authoritie</hi> of others is not mine, but theirs: which when I use, I borrow, and lay to pawn unto them, whom I cannot satisfie, or secure by the other means, which are mine own. Who would, borrow of others that hath enough of his own to satisfie as well.</p>
               <p>God, who, though he be absolute Lord, so oft an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexeth <hi>Reasons</hi> to his <hi>Precepts,</hi> teacheth even the most powerfull and mightie upon the Earth, in their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to prefer <hi>Reason</hi> afore <hi>Authoritie.</hi> And the man that would not rather rule men by <hi>Reason</hi> (yea beasts, if they were capable thereof) then by violent <hi>Authoritie,</hi> is himself inhumain, and beast-like.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Authoritie</hi> of Gods Word, and testimonie is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the same, as being grounded upon his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able veritie: But the credit of mens judgments is lesse, or more according to varietie of circumstances. Men deserv most credit in the facultie wherein they haue been most exercised: for <hi>none can judg so well of the craft,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anacharsis</note> 
                  <hi>as the crafts-man.</hi> So more likely it is, that a man wise, learned, and studious in the Scriptures, specially, if withall, he be such a one, as unto whom God hath promised, in ordinarie course, as unto one that <hi>fears him,</hi> to <hi>reveal his secrets,</hi> should finde the truth, then one sleightie, illiterate, and of more shallow meditations. In former ages the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell hath so far prevailed, as that men in superstitious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, haue, as it were, pinned their Faith and Religion upon the sleeves of the Churches <hi>Authoritie,</hi> and Clergies learning: putting out, or winking with their own eyes, that their guides might lead them: and this blinde-fold devotion is yet affected by too many. But withall, there want not, specially in places of libertie, whose minds Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath so far possessed with the contrarie delusion, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:11142:38"/>
they think it halfe Poperie so much as to seek counsell, and direction at men of Learning, and knowledg; lest, for sooth, they should be deceaved by them. This suspition hath been, and is, too much occasioned, by the abuse of Learning to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse, and ambition in the Learned: but is taken and held up by the other; partly, by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, whilst they more fear the Divels subtletie in deceaving them by Learned men (specially being in any measure conscionable) then they trust to the blessing of God upon his own gifts in them for their information; partly, from conceiptednesse in themselvs, as if they were indeed verie Popes, and exempted from danger of erring; and partly, through partiall affection to their preconceaved opinions: of which they are as loath to hear any ill, as fond Parents are to hear ill of their Children, though there be never so much cause; lest thereby they should be brought out of love with them. But as we are more to desire, and endeavour, that we our selvs may walk in the wayes of God, then others: so should we rather desire, and more endeavour, as we have occasion, to converse with men of knowledg, and such, as may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us; then with them that know lesse then our selvs, and do depend upon us for information. And, to conclude; as <hi>Learning makes the good better, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Comineus.</note> 
                  <hi>the bad worse: so is it more likely, that a man should be bettered by it, then not; and that knowing what concerns him, he will be the more ashamed of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is also more probable, that many, specially wise, and godly, should finde the truth, then one; as <hi>many eyes see more then one:</hi> whereupon it was, that the verie
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:11142:38"/>
Apostles in some cases of practise sought or took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise<note place="margin">Acts 21.</note> of others; which help our dulnesse makes much more necessarie for us.</p>
               <p>Into this account we must also bring the advantage of Ages, and times in which men live: and so more credit in matters controverted between <hi>Rome</hi> and Vs, is to be given to the Churches, and Fathers of that first Age after Christ, then of the latter, when the Mysterie of Iniquitie (rising by degrees) had gotten too great both height, and breadth.</p>
               <p>Besides, the occasions offered have their weight in these Ballances. <hi>Austin</hi> is observed, by occasion of the errour of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> to have examined more diligently, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly discerned, and in preffer terms to have propounded the truth, in the points of Predestination, and Free-will; then others his Ancients. Many are ignorant, yea mistake, specially in smaller matters; not properly because they want either skill, or will to finde out the truth in them, but occasion onely pressing them to examine things receaved by tradition, or done of custom without ground of reason.</p>
               <p>With these also we must ioin the consideration of such advantages, as the latter times have of the former, whose helpfull labours they enjoy: by which those which follow them (though in themselvs meaner then they) are enabled to discern of many things better then the other that went before them; as a dwarf set upon the shoulders of a giant can see further then he.</p>
               <p>Lastly, It is more likely, that of two, in any measure alike otherwise, he who suffers affliction for conscience of God, should have the truth; then he that gets worldly benefit by his course in Religion; specially if he have not in a great measure learned to denie himself, and this world: it being <hi>their guize to dissemble herein, who love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ucre, and riches:</hi> as<note place="margin">Lactantius</note> too many do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:11142:39"/>The credit commending a testimonie to others cannot be greater then is the <hi>Authoritie</hi> in it self of him that gives it; nor his <hi>Authoritie</hi> greater then his person. The person then being but a man, the <hi>Authoritie</hi> can be but humain; and so the faith but humain, which it can challeng. <hi>The custom of the Church is but the custom of men: the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>

And so, if all the men in the World (not immediately directed, as were extraordinarie Prophets, and Apostles, <hi>in whom the Spirit</hi> spake, and <hi>testified</hi> by them) should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in one; as they, notwithstanding their multitude, were but men, though many; so were their testimonie but humain, though of many men; neither could it challeng other then humain assent unto it: and not that neither absolutely either in matters of discourse of reason, wherein it is possible that men should deceav themselvs; or of relation from others, by whom they may be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. We are therefore to beware, that we neither wrong our selvs by credulitie; nor others by unjust suspition. <hi>To receav without examination mens sayings, is to make of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. Martyr</note> 
                  <hi>men, God: to reject them lightly, is to make of men Divels;</hi> or fools, at the best. The latter hath pride, and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse for the ground: the former either argues men to be simple, which cannot; or idle, which will not; or presumptuous, which think they need not; or superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which dare not judg; or (which is worst of all the rest) desirous in a kinde of humble hypocrisie to shelter an evill conscience before God under the shadow of great mens <hi>Authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To presse immoderately mens <hi>Authoritie</hi> in Divine things, is to wrong Gods: which alone is authentick; and whose will, and it alone, and all it (so far as is fit for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:11142:39"/>
us to know it) we know more certainly to be contained, and preserved, without corruption, in the Scriptures; then any Fathers opinion, in the Books, which go under his name. This also wrongs mens Faith, and reason, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating them by prejudice; and rather offering a hand to lead the blinde; then a light for the help of him that hath eyes to see with. I have known some, who, if they light upon a peremptorie Authour, and bold asserter of things, were readie to be still of the same opinion with the Book which they last read: their weaker judgment being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born rather by the strength of other mens asseverations, then reasons. Lastly, this ingenders endlesse contentions: as is to be seen in some Learned mens writings; in which there is more adoe about the meaning of such, or such a place in a Father, then were enough to determine the whole controversie by the Scriptures, and good <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things notwithstanding, there is both a lawfull, and convenient use of humain <hi>testimonie</hi> even in Divine things; as first, for the convincing of such thereby, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it too much, and Gods Word too little Thus <hi>Paul</hi> amongst Heathens, even in his verie Sermons, alledged Heathenish <hi>Poets,</hi> and <hi>Phylosophers;</hi> and we in our writings rightly alledg <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Councels</hi> against Papists, and others, who more regard the saying of an ancient Father, or Canon of a Councell, then the written Word of the <hi>Ancient of Dayes.</hi> They are twice overcome, who are beaten with their own weapons, in which they trust. Secondly, It induceth a morall probabilitie, though no absolute necessitie of truth: and though we see not the truth by other mens eyes, but by our own; yet may we be something held up in the arms of their <hi>testimonie</hi> to see it the better, and so be helped, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> was, by the Tree, into which he clymbed, to see Christ. So the Apostles in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:11142:40"/>
penning some parts of Holy Scripture, upon occasion of differences in the Churches, and opposition to their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall <hi>Authoritie,</hi> took in, for the better passage with men of Gods undoubted truth, the concurring testimonie even of ordinarie Christians: though both the <hi>Decrees, &amp; Epistles</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 15. 23. 29. Gal. 1. 2.</note> were penned by infallible, and immediate direction of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as well, and as much, as any other parts of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scriptures. Thirdly, Citation of humain <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> helps to wipe away the aspersion of Schism, &amp; singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie, when we can shew that our assertions, and practises have agreement with such as are in account in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Lastly, It commends both a mans modesty &amp; diligence, when he enquires after, and withall, his cause, in the eyes of men, when he appears to know the judgments of others in the things he handles: as it is, on the other side, an imputation to him that knows them not; and that even where it is otherwise, no benefit, to know them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Authoritie</hi> of him that prescribeth, or commandeth (within his limits) is the same, whether the matter be great, or small. God is God, in the smallest things, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; and man but man, in his deepest charges. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Apostles in their writings are extraordinarie; and Pastors and Teachers, ordinarie Ministers; and neither are either more, or lesse in any part of their Ministerie, for the instruction of the Churches. So likewise all true <hi>Reasons</hi> are of the same force in themselvs, to confirm that for which they are brought: neither is any one stronger then other, but onely more evident. The best but proves of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the things to be so; and the meanest (if sound) doth as much.</p>

Yet so as the more <hi>reasonable</hi> the thing related is, the more readily we <hi>beleev</hi> it to be true. The thing beleeved <hi>Faith</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends primarily, as a matter of truth, and therein hath its seat in the understanding. Divine <hi>Faith</hi> assents to the revealed will of God, for the authoritie, and truth of God, which cannot deceav. That <hi>Faith,</hi> or act of <hi>Faith</hi> by which we are justified is a due assent to, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the promises of the Gospel, as made, and appertaining to us in particular: the generall promise upon condition of application duly, and rightly made, being as much for certaintie, as either extraordinarie revelation, or particular nomination of person. This application of Gods promises in Christ hath evermore affiance necessarily, and immediately ioyned with it. For being by the Spirit of God, and Word of the Gospel, perswaded of Gods love in Christ; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but trust unto him, rest, and repose our selvs upon

him, and expect accordingly from him, all good. But as we must lay hold of the stay or prop before we can rest upon it; So must <hi>Faith</hi> go before affiance in order of causes: and we lay hold of Gods love before we can repose our selvs upon it.</p>

                  <hi>Faith</hi> for its <hi>foundation.</hi> These two, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> have many the same objects; yet neither all; nor any in the same respect.

And for the verie same things in themselvs <hi>beleeved,</hi> and <hi>hoped</hi> for; as for example, <hi>the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting;</hi> we <hi>beleev</hi> them as present in Gods promises, which <hi>Faith</hi> applyes unto us; but <hi>hope</hi> for them as absent, and to come in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, unto which <hi>Hope</hi> carieth us.</p>

And <hi>Hope</hi> again, as a good Childe, helps to reliev its Father <hi>Faith,</hi> in time of need: whereupon the Apostle saith of the <hi>Faithfull,</hi> that <hi>if they had hope onely in this life,</hi>

                  <hi>they were of all men the most miserable.</hi> For what availeth it a man in miserie to <hi>beleev</hi> eternall life, if he had not <hi>hope</hi> in time to obtain it, and therewith freedom, and redemption from distresse?

And hereupon it is said of that <hi>cloud of witnesses,</hi> that <hi>by faith they quenched the violence of fire, stopped the mouths of Lyons, put to flight the armies of alients,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>The strength of true Christian <hi>Faith</hi> the Divel knows to his cost; as that, by which he <hi>the Prince,</hi> with his whole<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1 Iohn 5.</note> Armie <hi>the World,</hi> hath been so often foyled, and overcome: For being by <hi>Faith</hi> perswaded, that in doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or suffering according to the will of God, we please him, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his protection, and blessing, we stedfastly persevere in well-doing, and patiently endure all things for his names sake: whereupon he, specially in the day of their distresse, assaults the <hi>Faith</hi> of the godly, that that might <hi>fail;</hi> as<note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> knowing that if the root of <hi>Faith</hi> be shaken loose, the

               <p>This <hi>love is the fulfilling of the Law: the love of God</hi>

               <p>If we were perfit in this <hi>Love</hi> we needed no other Law to rule us, either in the duties towards God, or our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, no more then do the Angels in Heaven, and Souls of the Faithfull men departed: who by the Law of <hi>Love</hi> alone, do live both most perfit, and most happie lives. And indeed to <hi>love</hi> as we ought, is a verie happie thing, wherein we resemble God, and the Angels: as by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, we complice with the Divel, and wicked men; who <hi>live in mallice, and envie, hatefull, &amp; hating one another.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Titus 3.</note> And howsoever naturally we desire rather to be <hi>beloved,</hi> then to <hi>love;</hi> yet is it incomparably a more both excellent, and <hi>blessed</hi> thing to <hi>love,</hi> then to be <hi>beloved;</hi> as it is <hi>to give,</hi>

               <p>Besides, <hi>Love is the Loadstone of Love:</hi> And the most readie, and compendious way to be <hi>beloved</hi> of others is to <hi>love</hi> them first.

                  <hi>sinners love those that love them.</hi> Yea, admit thy <hi>love</hi> of them never come to their knowledg; yet will God by the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible hand of his providence, bend their hearts, by mutuall affection unto thee, at least, so far as is good for thee: and wherein they are inflexible, and defective, he will make supply out of the aboundance of his <hi>love,</hi> and goodnesse; that so it may be verified which is written; <hi>With the same</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 6.</note> 
                  <hi>measure that ye meet with all, it shall be measured to you again.</hi> To conclude this point: Let the grace of God herein spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially triumph over our corruption: that whereas by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we would be <hi>loved</hi> of them, whom we hate; by grace, we may <hi>love them, Which hate us.</hi> And this is a great<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> work of grace in deed; and yet most necessarie for all Christs Disciples. We must not be like the Pharisees who in stead of enlarging their own affections, streightned the Law of <hi>loving their neighbours,</hi> unto such, as <hi>loved</hi> them, or dwelt within a certain compasse of them: but we must account all our <hi>neighbours</hi> that need pittie or help from us: and our Christian neighbours, and brethren also, if <hi>the Lord have receaved them,</hi> though they be neither minded in all things as we are; nor towards us, as we are towards them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, as <hi>Faith</hi> is to rule <hi>Love,</hi> that it prove not lust;<note place="margin">Luke 10.</note> and <hi>Hope,</hi> that it prove not presumption: so also must it <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Sense</hi> in all their operations: which it no way abolisheth, but orders, and sanctifies. And as in Nature, the denomination is from the predominant qualitie; so is it in our course of life. To live by <hi>Reason</hi> is to live the life of a man; To live by <hi>Sense</hi> is to live the life of a beast: But to <hi>live by Faith is to live the life of the Son of God,</hi> and to<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 1.

For these three, <hi>Faith, Reason,</hi> and <hi>Sense,</hi> being all
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:11142:45"/>
Gods works in a man, cannot be contrarie, in their right use, one to another: neither can any thing be true in one, which is false in another: neither doth, or can any one of them destroy another; but use, order, and perfit it: <hi>Reason, Sense;</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> both <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> For <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> at the first, and is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> and encreased both by hearing, and seeing, and by the benefit of all other <hi>Senses</hi> afterwards. Neither can it possibly either be begot, or nourished, or encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but by the discourse of <hi>Reason</hi> ordered, and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit of God. Which Spirits work is so effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, as it makes even the meanest powers of nature created in a man to serv effectually for the furthering of the highest works of supernaturall grace. Sweet is the harmonie of all the powers, and parts both of the Soul and bodie of a sanctified person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason is that wherein man goes before all other earthly</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome are <hi>Atheists</hi> in opinion; others in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but many more in conversation of life. There are but few of the first coat, and which can so wholy blot out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of Gods Image written by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their hearts, as to leav them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther emptie, and devoyd of the knowledg, conscience, and reverence of a Divine Majestie; and which come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude roundly in their hearts, that <hi>there is no God.</hi> Yet, some, without doubt, in time, and by degrees, proceed from <hi>Atheism</hi> in conversation, to <hi>Atheism</hi> in affection; and from <hi>Atheism</hi> in affection, to <hi>Atheism</hi> in opinion, and judgment. Men civilly honest, seldom, or never become <hi>Atheists</hi> in perswasion; but lewd, and flagitious persons do; who being pursued by the furie of an accusing conscience for hainous evils, wish (and no marvail) that there were no Iudg in Heaven to condemn them: and so come at last to be perswaded in themselvs of that, which they gladly would have true; and are justly left of God to such horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble delusion: that so sinning without fear, they may perish without remedie. And this is the reason, why there are more <hi>Atheists</hi> in opinion, in our dayes, then of old; even because so many are more bent upon mischief: and <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Morneus</note> 
                  <hi>wickedly in this world, bear themselvs in hand</hi> (and so get to beleev) <hi>that there is no justice in the world to come.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason is the proportion of wit to which our Age is come, above the former. In regard hereof it is, that <hi>Atheism</hi> (though dissembled, and concealed by the same
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:11142:46"/>
ungracious wit, which begets it) is a thousand times more to be feared in the Land, then <hi>Papism.</hi> Men have too much wit to become <hi>Papists,</hi> in any generallitie: and just enough to fit them for <hi>Atheists,</hi> if Gods powerfull hand restrain them not. The verie <hi>simple</hi> dare not become <hi>Atheists;</hi> but are more in danger to prove superstitious, and to <hi>beleev</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 14</note> 
                  <hi>everie thing:</hi> the verie understanding hardly can: but have by sound reason, and sad thoughts (will they, nill they) some acknowledgment of a Divine Majestie forced upon them: But persons of froathy wit, and vicious life, are fitly tempered for the impression of <hi>Atheism</hi> for the Divel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atheism</hi> is incomparably worse, and more odious, then <hi>Idolatry:</hi> as it is more intollerable in a State, or Kingdom, to enterprize the overthrow of all Kingly Power, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie, then to detract how much soever, from the lawfull Kings, or Magistrates due honour, and to give it to a Stranger. Besides, whereas <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and superstitious persons, having in them some reverence of a Divine Power, are thereby both restrained from many mischiefs, and provoked to many good actions: the <hi>Atheist</hi> wanting both this Divine restraint, and motive; both runs riot in wickednesse, and villanie; and is barren of all good things: neither doing good, nor forbearing evill, further then for meer fear, or shame of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atheists</hi> use to be verie <hi>confident</hi> in their assertions, as the Orator observs in <hi>Vellejus:</hi> partly lest they should seem<note place="margin">Cicero.</note> unto others to doubt, or fear, that there is a God, who will punish heir impieties: and partly to <hi>encourage themselvs in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 64.</note> 
                  <hi>their wickednesse;</hi> as fearing lest they should be drawn into some conscience, and aw of Gods Majestie. It is oft true in this case amongst others, that <hi>the most cowards are the greatest boasters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:11142:47"/>
                  <hi>Idolatry</hi> either makes that to be God, which is not;<note place="margin">Rom. 1. Acts 17 Exod. 32. 2 Chr. 33.</note> or God to be that, which he is not. It is exercised either in intending Divine worship (so known to be) to that which is not God: or in intending a devised worship to the true God; wherein men make a will of God, which is not, and so a God willing, which is not: or els in an act of worship in it self, though neither profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed nor judged such by him that performs it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such mens actions reprove both their intention in heart, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in word: and can not be excused by either from Idolatrous.</p>
               <p>This sin in Gods people is usually compared by the Holy Ghost to the <hi>whoredom</hi> of a Wife; and Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at it to the Husbands <hi>jealousie,</hi> in that case. And as Adulterie most directly impeacheth the mariage bond (and so procures the Bill of Divorce): so doth <hi>Idolatry</hi> the Churches Covenant with the Lord, and provokes to sequestration from him. Yet herein two rules must be held. The former, that not onely speciall <hi>Idolatry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but even all, or any other wickednesse with profane obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie adjoyned, separates from God. Secondly, that all sin whatsoever is founded upon a kind of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> In sins of omission, we acknowledg not God, for our God, as we ought, in doing what he commands: In sins of commission we make some other thing our God; as our riches, if we trust to them, as to God; or our <hi>belly</hi> if<note place="margin">Coloss. 3.

                  <hi>CAP. XII.</hi> Of Heresie, and Schism,</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an ancient, and receaved saying, that <hi>Heresie ariseth from want of Faith, and Schism from want of Love:</hi> which also hath its truth, being rightly understood. Yet if we mark, we shall find the Scriptures to speak something otherwise of both the one, and other, then men commonly understand. We usually call <hi>obstinate Errour in the foundation Heresie:</hi> but the Scriptures<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11 Gal. 5. Titus 3.</note> many times seem rather to place it in the peruersnesse of the will, and affections, whether the matter be great, or small; then in the errour of the judgment: the word also <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifying any election, or choise of will which a man makes; or Sect which he followeth, whether good, or bad; whether in matters of greater, or smaller mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Besides, men are oftens accounted <hi>Heretiques,</hi> with greater sin, through want of charitie, in the Iudges; then in the judged, through defect of Faith. Of old, some have been branded for <hi>Heretiques,</hi> for holding <hi>Antipodes;</hi> others for holding <hi>the originall of the Soul by traduction;</hi> others for thinking that <hi>Marie the Mother of Christ had other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by her Husband Ioseph:</hi> the first being a certain truth; and the second a Philosophicall doubt; and the third, though an errour, yet neither against foundation, nor post of the Scriptures building. As there are certain <hi>Elements</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and foundations of the Oracles of God,</hi> and <hi>of Christian Faith,</hi> which must first be <hi>layed,</hi> and upon which other truths are to be built: so must not the foundation be confounded,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:11142:48"/>
with the wals, or roof; nor errours lightly be made fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, or unavoidably damnable. Yea who can say with how little, and unperfit Faith in Christ both for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and parts, God both can, and doth save the sincere in heart? Whose Salvation depends not upon the perfection of the Instrument, Faith; but of the Object, Christ. As, on the contrarie, there are some vulgar, and common <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> (though lesse severely censured) which are apparently damnable; as by name, for a man to beleev, and expect mercie from God, and salvation by Christ, though going on in affected ignorance of, or prophane disobedience to Gods Commandments.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Schism;</hi> The Scriptures note it as sometimes made from the Church; but most commonly in it. From it by the <hi>ten Trybes</hi> sequestring themselvs from <hi>Iudah,</hi> and<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the onely place where the Lord had promised to dwell by his solemn Church presence: and after Christ, by certain of the <hi>Hebrews forsaking the assemblies</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note> The former was from the onely true instituted, and ministeriall Church in the World; which was then one individuall, and not many, as now; and that by Idolatry. The latter, from all Christian Churches, and persons by totall defection from Christ himself. The other <hi>Schisms</hi> mentioned were made in the Church, either through the <hi>carnall</hi> lusts (bearing two great sway) of <hi>envie, strife,</hi> and<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. and 12.</note> uncharitablenesse; whilst the <hi>stronger despised the weaker,</hi> and the <hi>weaker judged the stronger;</hi> or by Heresie, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse<note place="margin">Iude 19 2 Pet. 2. 1 Iohn 2.</note> of manners: of which the Apostles <hi>Peter, Iude,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> speak.</p>
               <p>That which is commonly called <hi>Schism,</hi> ariseth (if it be affected) from the conceipt of Faith, and want of Love: but may fall out, upon simple errour of judgment, or scrupulositie of conscience: By occasion whereof a person
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:11142:48"/>
may seqester himself, eyther in (or from) some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church in some inferior courses of religion, from them, towards whom he yet bears much more true, and hearty Christian affection, then the most of them do, who unite with them therein.</p>
               <p>And if onely an uncharitable heart make an uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable person before God, and a proud heart a proud person, then he, who upon due examination, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledg of his heart, findes, and feels the same truly disposed to union with all Christians, so far as possibly he can see it lawfull; though through errour, or frailtie, he may step aside into some by-path, that way: yet hath that person a Supersedeas from the Lord in his bosom, securing him from being attached for a <hi>schismaticall</hi> person, and so found in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; what blame soever he may bear from men upon Earth, or correction from God, for his failing, upon infirmitie, therein.</p>
               <p>No man can endure to be <hi>withdrawn from,</hi> nor easily dissented from, by another, in his way of Religion; in which, above all other things, he makes account, that he himself draws nearest unto God.

                  <hi>Ignorance</hi> is not alwayes blame-worthy, but then onely, when we are <hi>ignorant</hi> of that which we should know.

                  <hi>ignorance,</hi> though it justifie not wholy, yet excuses a fayling in part; and that more, or lesse, as the thing whereof we are <hi>ignorant,</hi> either is more, or lesse necessarie to be known of us; or can be known more, or lesse easily: and thus <hi>the Servant that knows</hi>

               <p>The safest way not to be <hi>deceaved</hi> by others, specially to our Spirituall prejudice, is not to <hi>deceav</hi> our selvs: which till we do, no other can <hi>deceav</hi> us.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome have been found not onely contented with, but glorying in the name of irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and unhonest: but hardly ever any were willing to bear the note of <hi>foolish,</hi> or <hi>unwise.</hi> And even of them, in whom is found some true love of vertue and goodnesse, how few are there, that either indeed do, or would be thought to do any thing, in fauour thereof, which might, in the least degree, impeach the credit of their <hi>wisdom,</hi> in the eyes of the partiall world? So fain would all be counted, though few, in truth, be <hi>wise.</hi> The main reason of this seems to be, that whereas the want of <hi>wisdom</hi> imports impotencie, and inabilitie; Irreligion, and dishonestie are by election, and free choyse. The pride of men, if Gods grace correct it not, makes them more impatient of a want either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or outward, arguing them to be weak, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; then of a grosser vice in either, upon their own free election, and choyse of will. And hence it is, that many boast of things done by them for some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular advantage, which they know to be evill, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
               <p>It is the first, and a great point of <hi>wisdom</hi> to know wherein true <hi>wisdom</hi> stands: specially, seeing that the thing, which God cals <hi>wisdom,</hi> and which the world cals <hi>wisdom,</hi> are as different, as Heaven, and Earth; yea as Heaven, and Hell. That cannot but be best, which God so valueth. It is known from the Worlds <hi>wisdom,</hi> by first,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:11142:56"/>
its object: Secondly, the properties which attend it: Thirdly, the School where it is learnt: Fourthly, the end to which it tends. The object is Christ primarily who <hi>of God is made unto us wisdom;</hi> and <hi>in whom are hidden all</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Gor. 1. Coloss. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>the treasures thereof,</hi> which the Gospel the <hi>wisdom of God</hi> openeth unto us. He that knows Christ aright in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, knows both God, and man, and the most gracious, and glorious effects of both united in one. Secondly, <hi>The</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iames 3.</note> 
                  <hi>wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be entreated, full of mercie, and good fruits, without jangling, and without hypocrisie:</hi> The other is clean contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily qualified: thick, and muddie with lusts, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously compounded, arrogant, self-willing, and self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loving, inexorable, quarrelsom, craftie, and cruell. Thirdly, The <hi>wisdom</hi> of God is learnt in the School of Christ, and upon the Book of Holy Scriptures: the other hath so many Masters, as there are corrupt either lusts within a man, or customs in the World. Lastly, The <hi>wisdom</hi> of God teacheth to provide surely for the Spirituall, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall state, though with prejudice to the bodily, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall: The other bids, make sure worke for the flesh, and pinch not it, though the Spirituall man speed hardly by it. He that will be <hi>wise</hi> to God, must be a <hi>fool</hi> to the World: which yet makes him not a <hi>fool</hi> in worldly affairs, but skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full how to order them aright, both for the Spirituall life, and naturall also, as far as it is subordinate unto it.</p>
               <p>The high-way to <hi>wisdom</hi> Divine or humain is to observ and consider the reasons, and causes of things. He that beleevs a thing because God affirms it, shews faith; he that does it because God commands it, obedience: but he that joyns with these the reasons of the Doctrine, or exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Word gets into his heart the props of <hi>wisdom</hi> against the storms of temptation both of unbelief, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:11142:57"/>
disobedience. So in humain affairs, he that minds, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members things to be thus, or thus, gets skill in the things: but he that observs, and learns the reasons, and causes why they come so to passe, or are so done, he takes the right course to become <hi>wise</hi> in the matter, of what kind so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>A <hi>wise</hi> man is the same, though his outward state be changeable, yea changed from a prosperous to an afflicted, or the contrarie way: els he but hits right at aventure, when he doth well in either of both. His condition is rather happily fitted to him (as the howre once a day comes to the hand of the Clock that stands alwayes still) then he to it, by true <hi>wisdom.</hi> A <hi>wise</hi> man will <hi>wish the</hi>

                  <hi>more prosperous state, but fear the more afflicted,</hi> and use that which falls, and his <hi>wisdom,</hi> in it. The Sayler, which wants skill, may misse his course, or drown his Ship in a fair wind; but he needs most skill in a tempest: So is the <hi>wisdom</hi> of a man most seen in the right guiding of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and his affairs in a stresse of trouble, and affliction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have seen it in experience, that many, specially women, and women like men, who have shewed forth much goodnesse in a quiet, and prosperous state of things, if any great storm of tryall have happened to have overtaken them; have, through the want of <hi>wisdoms</hi> chart, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, lost all, and not onely been altogether uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but above measure, burthensom both to others, and themselvs. The Apostle by the work of the <hi>wisdom</hi> of God <hi>knew both how to be abused, and how to abound.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And of such use is this <hi>discretion,</hi> in the whole course of our life in regard of the infinite varietie of circumstances, according to which particulars are performed convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or inconveniently; as that we may daily observ men, of lesser meanes for the World as riches, trading, and skill in faculties, and yet doing well in it, yea better by <hi>discreet</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageing their little; then others, wanting this <hi>discretion,</hi> with far greater helps, and measure of means otherwise.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:11142:59"/>
before wit, or art, or learning; and onely comes after goodnesse in worth.</p>
               <p>As the Serpent-like generation (specially where truth and honestie goes with a scratcht face, and is in disgrace of the times) esteems men square &amp; upright in their courses, for witlesse &amp; silly: so must the more shallow-headed take heed, that they sensure not <hi>discreet</hi> cariage, and handling of things, for craftie, and unhonest: considering that other men may do that in good, &amp; honest <hi>discretion,</hi> which they, by defect thereof, could not do but in evill conscience.

               <p>Of all enemies this vertue hath none greater, then pride; which deprives men (able otherwise) of much, and fools of all use of <hi>discretion:</hi> as making them either rash, by which they do not; or so presumptuous in themselvs, as they wil not restrain, and humble their understanding to due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of circumstances of conveniencie; in the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof <hi>discretion</hi> stands.

                  <hi>Mine, Counsell is, and sound wisdom.</hi> This, he that gives ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,<note place="margin">Prov. 8.</note> must well weigh, that he neither dishonour the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and goodnesse of God, whose place for the dispenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these attributes, he sustains therein; nor wrong him, by whom he is so far honoured, as to be sought to, as Gods mouth. And so must he also that takes <hi>counsell;</hi> that he may neither seek it at Fools, which none but Fools will do; nor at godlesse persons (specially in matter of conscience) which he that doth, desires to deceav himself, and to mock with God. Now of all <hi>Councellors,</hi> in whom any wisdom, and goodnesse is to be found, the perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and bold are most dangerous: whose custom is to put men upon extreamities, happily fitting their own venter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som disposition, but oftens above the strain, and strength of their friends, or reach of reason either. Whereas <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors,</hi> specially in more difficult, and dangerous cases, should both verie sensibly apprehend the difficultie, and danger of the thing in deliberation; and withall be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that they spur not on their friends whom they <hi>advise,</hi> above their pace, lest they tyre them by preposterous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements, and put them upon such difficulties, as they are not fit to struggle with.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:11142:64"/>
but oftens by a just judgment of God punishing them with their own desires, and so ordering that <hi>they that seek shall finde</hi> such as may rather deceav them by flatterie, then trouble them with the truth. Yet in these <hi>dead Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors (Books)</hi> there is wanting a lively, and likely discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such particular circumstances, as must be observed, and gathered by present discourse, that men <hi>counsell</hi> not at adventure; which no Books can sufficiently provide for. In <hi>Books</hi> we best learn generall grounds of direction; but that skill is unperfect, &amp; must have joyned with it a large, and piercing discourse of the <hi>Councellors</hi> mind, who by comparing together things past, and present, with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to singular circumstances incident, is able probably to gather things to come; in which the life of <hi>counsell</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</p>
               <p>Some will eloquently propound, and earnestly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade to good and profitable courses in generall; but in the mean while, give no direction, how or by what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular means to prosecute them, for the attaining to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired end. Such <hi>Councellors</hi> are like him that is earnest in perswading with a travellor to hold the right way to the place, where he would be; but shews him not which it is, and what are the marks of it: Or to him, <hi>who trims the</hi>

                  <hi>we love them:</hi> So <hi>blinde love</hi> (which alone in effect, the bellows of loud, but windie perswasion kindles in the brests of many) <hi>avails nothing, where knowledg guides us not</hi> in our way.</p>
               <p>The fewest of them that ask good <hi>counsell,</hi> do mean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to follow it. Some ask <hi>counsell</hi> onely in good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to make shew of respect to friends: Others for a<note place="margin">Ierem. 42 Ezech. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> colour, that they did nothing, but having first heard, what
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11142:65"/>
such and such (it may be, wise and godly) could say about it: And not a few, though they pretend to ask, yet indeed intend rather to give <hi>counsell;</hi> that is, to have the courses allowed by others, which they themselves affect. A man may have divers ends, in requiring the <hi>adviee</hi> of others, and all of them honest, and lawfull; provided he alwayes keep his heart free to receav either information, or confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or reformation from others, upon good ground.</p>
               <p>Three sorts of men though standing most in need of <hi>counsell,</hi> are many of them most uncapable of it. First, They in great prosperitie; Secondly, They in extream affliction; And thirdly, Such as are weak, and simple. They of the first sort are, for the most part, high minded, and lifted up in themselvs (<hi>Nabal-like</hi>) above the good<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25</note> 
                  <hi>counsell</hi> of other men, presuming, that they are able enough to direct themselvs. The second are commonly either ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate, or melted in their miserie; like Wax, either too hard to receav; or too soft to retain any impression, as the <hi>Israelites for anguish of Spirit, harkned not unto Moses</hi> the<note place="margin">Exod. 6.</note> messenger of their deliverance. The third are partly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of <hi>advice,</hi> through simplenesse; and partly suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, either lest they should be circumvented by their friends close-minding their own ends; or els thought weak, and too simple to govern, and manage their own affairs: by which prejudice it comes to passe, many times, that they become wilfull, and headie; because they would not be thought simple, and unable to direct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs.</p>
               <p>It is a rule, wherein many wise men have agreed, that <hi>it is more available for the Common-wealth to have an evill Prince, and good Councellors, then a Prince good, and vertuous, with corrupt Councellors about him; for that, it is more like, that one should be bettered by many, then many be corrupted by</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:11142:65"/>
                  <hi>one.</hi> But the mischief is, that such as are nought themselvs will make choyse usually of such <hi>Councellors</hi> as themselvs are, rather to flatter, then better them: as contrariwise, the good commonly, will chuse such, as may further them in goodnesse.</p>
               <p>When a thing verie inconvenient, and absurd is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to us, it is not best alwayes to manifest any great dislike; though we both have it in our selvs, and our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for it, never so present: except either urgent necessitie presse a sudden, and violent stop of the matter; or that we have to do with him, whom we know we can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sway, by our reasons, and authoritie: lest by that course our friend take occasion to withdraw himself, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his affairs from us, and so to steal miserie closely, and, it may be, suddenly also, if he be bent upon his course; for fear that our importunitie should bring hindrance to his purpose. But it is best, at first, to put off the thing, and to provoke to further consideration, and so to gain time, with some small manifestation of dislike for the present; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as it were, pointing, and making way for our after more vehement disswasions. By which course we shall have our friends both ear, and heart more open to receav <hi>advice</hi> from us; as conceiving, that we neither are forward to crosse his designe, nor caried against him, or it, in passion, contempt, or unadvisednesse.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. XXI.</hi> Of Thoughts.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>En say, <hi>Thoughts are free, and pay no tribute:</hi> and this is true being understood of mens Custom-houses, where they cannot be sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, but as they bewray themselvs by some outward signe, either word, or work. But so much the more watchfull we had need to be in our selvs, over those close commodities, lest we willingly feed a filthy, though secret sinck within us; which in time will shame us before men, as it stinks in the mean while, where it is, in the Nostrils of God; and men for it. Besides, if we do evill in word, or deed, men may help us, either by contrarie examples, or friendly reproofs, or hatefull upbraydings, or just punishments: but against sinfull, and unsanctified <hi>thoughts</hi> we have no help but from God alone, and our selvs, by his grace; to whom alone they are known.</p>
               <p>Everie <hi>thought</hi> of evill is not an evill <hi>thought,</hi> but onely such as to which we adjoyn either consent of will, or, at least, delight of affection. For besides the <hi>thoughts</hi> of, or about evill, which are either in pure speculation, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall consideration of the thing, or with aversenesse of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the matter <hi>thought</hi> on; there are <hi>thoughts</hi> meerly by suggection from Satan; who being a Spirit, and having such affinitie of nature with our Spirits, and Souls, can unite, himself, in his suggestions, with our imagination, after a manner by us unconceavable; and offer unto us <hi>thoughts</hi> of great evill: which yet
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:11142:66"/>
we may by grace so resist, as that they are to be accounted his sin, and our crosse onely, who are constrained to bear such temptations; as we are compelled oftentimes to hear, and bear the ill counsell of wicked men his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with sin in them, and grief in our selvs; but without our sin, if we no way hearken unto them: yea with commendation, both in the one, and other, in the victorie of Faith which we obtain over them. Indeed we are too readie to receav such suggestions; as tinder is to take fire; specially being subtilely fitted by Satan to our speciall inclinations, and occasions: and so must be more carefull either to prevent them by nourishing in our selvs an abhorring of them; or to quench them if they arise, by the stream of Holy meditations running in our hearts.</p>
               <p>They whose words, and deeds are faultie, and evill, and yet plead their good <hi>hearts</hi> towards God, are like malefactours, who being convinced of theft, or the like naughtinesse, by plain evidence, to their faces; do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the testimonie of such persons for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as they know cannot be found. If the hearts of such men could be seen of others, as their works, and words are, they would appear worse then they; as they do to God who seeth them. There is no evill in the mouth, or hand, which was not in the heart first, as the stream in the<note place="margin">Math. 15 <hi>Ambrose.</hi>

                  <hi>the righteous are righteous.</hi> And <hi>by these, good and evill men are best and trulyest differenced</hi> one <hi>from another:</hi> Whereas all outward works ly common; and are many of them oft exercised equally by good, and bad. No outward works are so good, but Hypocrites have done them, at times: And few, or none so evill, but some godly haue at some times (by temptation) faln into them. But how alike soever the outward faces of such sinfull actions be; the difference is great in the heart of the doer, and is so seen of God to be at the verie time of the doing; and by after and better fruits in their time, so manifested unto men afterwards, to have been at that time, when in the outward evill act no such difference could appear. But our onely comfortable course, and that by which our hearts are assured before the Lord, is, to provide, that in them may run constantly so strong a stream of holy purposes, and setled thoughts, as may both over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the contrarie current of our flesh, and lusts; and also carrie with it our outward man to all good, and godly practises.</p>

On the contrarie, besides other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, there is nothing, by which men may at so cheap a rate purchase good will, especially at their hands, who are of a lower rank then themselvs, as by kind, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective <hi>language:</hi> which made <hi>Titus Vespasian</hi> say (as he<note place="margin">Sueton.</note> also proved the good of it by experience, gayning the opinion, and name of <hi>The darling of man-kind</hi>) that <hi>A Prince should never send away any petitioner discontented.</hi> And, albeit, as the saying is, <hi>Fair words make fools glad;</hi> yet so do they wise men also. Good <hi>language</hi> ioyned with reall performance, is as a pleasant sause to whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som meat.

then otherwise: seeing they carrie with them some appearance of respect to him, to whom they are used; whereas the contrarie cast withall contempt upon his person; which is more grievous to most men, then a moderate disappointment in their suit.</p>

               <p>Both length, and shortnesse of <hi>speech</hi> may be used commendably, in their time; as Mariners sometimes sayl with larger-spread, and sometimes with narrower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathered Sayls.

more sparingly: But fools pour out theirs by talents, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, or wit. Besides, wise men <hi>speak</hi> to purpose, and so have but some thing to say: The other <hi>speak</hi> everie thing of everie thing, and thereupon take libertie to use long wandrings. Lastly, they think to make up that in number, or repetition of <hi>words,</hi> which is wanting in weight. But above all other motives, some better, some worse, too many love to hear themselvs <hi>speak;</hi> and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining vainly, that they please others, because they please themselvs, make long Orations, when a little were too much. Some excuse their tediousnesse, saying, that they cannot <hi>speak</hi> shorter: wherein they both say untruly, and shame themselvs also: For it is all one, as if they said, that they have unbrydled <hi>tongues,</hi> &amp; inordinate passions setting them a work.

               <p>Some have said, that <hi>hurt never comes by silence:</hi> but they<note place="margin">Numb. 30</note> may as well say, that good never comes by <hi>speech:</hi> for where it is good to <hi>speak,</hi> it is ill to be <hi>silent.</hi> Besides, he that holds his tongue in a matter that concerns him, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, as consenting.

               <p>The Lord God in providing, that the <hi>Books</hi> of Holy Scriptures should be <hi>written,</hi> effectually commended the <hi>writing,</hi> and reading of other <hi>Books</hi> touching all subjects, and sciences lawfull, and lawfully handled. For though the difference be ever to be held between Divine, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <hi>writings,</hi> so as the former may worthily challeng ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute credence, and obedience, as breathing out onely truth, and godlinesse; whereas the other are not onely to be learned, but judged also: yet even in humain <hi>writings,</hi> the truth in its kind, is taught commonly both more fully, and more simply, and more piously, then by speech. For howsoever the lively voyce more pierce the heart, and be apter to move affection, and that to the receaving of truth, and goodnesse not onely by love, and liking, but by Faith also, and assent (for <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God):</hi> yet men seldom take either the pains, or<note place="margin">Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:11142:72"/>
may do. Besides, men are commonly in their <hi>writings</hi> both freer from passion in themselvs, and from partiall respect of others, then in their speeches. And hence it comes to be said of <hi>dead men,</hi> that they are the <hi>best councellors;</hi> to wit, in their <hi>Books,</hi> wherein they are freest from affection one way, or other. Lastly, though the Father found some in his time, who <hi>because Christ had said, Thou shalt not swear, thought they might do that in writing, which they might not do in speech;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> and confirm Idolatry with their <hi>hand,</hi> so they professed it not with their <hi>tongue:</hi> yet it is usually found otherwise; and that men are, or would seem to be more religious in <hi>writing,</hi> then in speech. Who ever shall finde a black-mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed blasphemer cursing, &amp; swearing in his <hi>Books?</hi> though in daily speech he scarse utter ten words without oath, or execration. Yea are there not many, who by the glosse of pietie cunningly set upon their <hi>writings</hi> published to the World, steal the opinion of pietie, &amp; vertue from strangers, and those that know them not; whose ordinarie conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in word, and deed to them that are acquainted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, proclaims them no better then verie Atheists, and Epicures? I ad, even touching conferences, and disputations of purpose appointed, and used, for light of truth; that though they may be, and are singularly profitable for that purpose, to a modest, and tractable disposition, which will as well hear, as speak; and be as readie to learn truth of others, as to teach it them: yet to men of more unquiet, and stiffe spirits, the reading of <hi>Books</hi> is a course far more convenient for information: For that therein will not be the provocation to inordinate anger, and passion, which in speech oftens falls in. Besides, he who comes to dispute, comes specially to shew the truth to others: but he that comes to read an Authour, comes specially to learn some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him, for the most part.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:11142:72"/>Great care is to be taken, and circumspection used in <hi>writing</hi> of Books; not onely (though specially) for conscience of God; but also because the Author therin exposeth himself to the censure of all men, and those not onely then living, but also to be born, when he is dead, and rotten. And under their censure he comes, whether he be wise, or foolish; learned, or ignorant; of sound, or of corrupt judgment: and in part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, whether of vertuous, or vitious disposition. <hi>He</hi>

But this is rare by reason of the different temper of the brain requisite for such furniture. Some are of great reading, but of so slippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie memorie, as they are like Water-conduits, which what they continually receav in at one end, they let out as fast at the other.

                     </gap>xes,</hi> serving for nothing but to shew, where, and in what Authours, things are to be found; by benefit of their strong memorie. There are also of those great <hi>Book-men,</hi> that know better the most other mens judgments, then their own, in matters of controversie, through injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousnesse, or irresolution; and if they come to settle upon any rather opinion, then perswasion, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly according to the last <hi>Bool</hi> which they read. It is best for ordinarie capacities to travell in some few <hi>Books</hi> (though by occasion they may step into many) and the

same picked by good advice, of unpartiall, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced men; and those throughly to digest, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon; as it is best for weak stomacks to eat of few, and wholesom dishes: Which may also be done for further use, extention, and applycation, then the Authour himself conceaved, or at least, expressed.

               <p>As the maladies of the minds of many have been cured by reading of <hi>Books;</hi> so have the diseases of the bodyes of some, and those such as wanted no other Medicines; if we may beleev Histories: As of <hi>Alphonsus King of Spain, by reading of Livy;</hi> and of <hi>Ferdinand King of Sicily, by reading of Quintus Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> The cure is both more common, and more excellent, which the reading of the Holy Scriptures affoard.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE effectuall <hi>calling</hi> of a Christian is that by which the Lord first differenceth actually, and in the person himself, the elect from the reprobate: and by which the <hi>called</hi> approacheth, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh unto God that <hi>calleth</hi> him: and that takes away his sin, which separated betweene the Lord, and him; both by justifying, and sanctifying him.</p>
               <p>This generall <hi>calling</hi> of a Christian is incomparably more excellent, and honourable, then any particular <hi>calling,</hi> and state whatsoever. By it we are <hi>blessed with all</hi>

                  <hi>callings:</hi> which also are so far lawfull, and lawfully used, as they further it; and not otherwise. If the excellency of it were well weighed, &amp; rightly prized, no man ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured therewith should be thought worthy to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised for any other meannesse; nor without, it to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed for any other excellency how glorious soever in the worlds ey.</p>
               <p>These two mayn priveledges of Gods providence the elect before their effectuall <hi>calling</hi> are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of, aboue others. The former that into what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or howsoever otherwise greivous sins they fall, yet they are kept by the power of the Lord, from <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against the Holy Ghost,</hi> of which there is <hi>no forgivenes:</hi> And this the Apostle insinuates, where he testifyes of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:11142:78"/>
himself, that before <hi>his calling by grace, he was a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and pers quuter; but doing it of ignorance, in unbeleif,</hi> he <hi>obteyned mercy:</hi> which if he had done of malicious knowledg, he could not possibly have done. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond priveledg is, that though such a man may fall into great dangers, so as there is oft but a step between him and death; yet still God will rescue, and keep him alive, till he be effectually <hi>called</hi> to the participation of his grace in Christ: witnesse <hi>the Iaylour in Philippi.</hi> God <hi>calls</hi> a<note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> man actually in tyme, as he hath chosen him in his eternall decree; that is, as he hath purposed to <hi>call,</hi> and save him in due tyme. And if there be a particular, and effectuall calling of some above others, then was there undoubtedly a particular election, or purpose from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in God so to do: except we will say, that God doth that in tyme, which he did not from eternity purpose to doe. And if the Lord work no otherwise in <hi>calling</hi> of any to the grace of Christ, then by outward means, and motives, so leaving them, as some say, to the freedom of their will to determine it self by chusing, or refuseing the grace offered in the gospell; then are many wicked men, so liveing and dying, more bound to the Lord for his work of grace towards them, then are divers his holy, and faythfull servants. The reason is, because many of the former have been made partakers of the outward means, and motives of grace, in preaching of the gospell, godly examples, and education, in far greater measure, and more ample, and excellent; then many of the latter have been: Neyther are the true servants of God, by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to go so far in humble thankfulnes to God, as did the prowd <hi>Pharisee</hi> in the Gospell; who <hi>thanked God, that he was not like the Publican, and other sinners.</hi> For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever<note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> els they have cause to thank God for; by these mens
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:11142:78"/>
gospell, they have cause to thank themselves, and not God, that they are <hi>not like other men,</hi> who haue been made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of as great, and ample outward means, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kations of grace, as they have been.</p>
               <p>A lawfull <hi>calling</hi> is necessarie for every lawfull work: the generall <hi>calling</hi> of a Christian, before we can perform any Christian work aright: and so a particular <hi>calling</hi> to this, or that state of life, before we perform the works thereof. The inward <hi>calling</hi> is requisite in regard of God, who knows the inwards of the man, and with what heart, and affection he undertakes any state, or action: so is the outward also, because <hi>God is the God of order.</hi> Also, when a man knows himself to be orderly <hi>called</hi> to a condition of life, he both sets himself more chearfully, and roundly to the works thereof, wherein he is assured he servs Gods providence by his order, and appoyntment: and with fayth expects a blessing from God upon his endeavours in that course of life, in which his hand hath set him; and with all, bears with comfort the crosses befalling him therein: as wee see in <hi>David;</hi> whose sheild of comfort against all darts of danger was, that <hi>God had selected him</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Litle account is made by many of a lawfull outward <hi>calling:</hi> whereas indeed it is that alone, by which all states (save those that are naturall, and so are subject neyther to election nor change) are both constituted, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For what makes him, who yesterday was none, to day to be a magistrate in the common wealth; minister in the Church; steward in the family, or any other officer, or member in any orderly society, but an orderly outward <hi>calling</hi> by them, who have lawfull authority to confer that state upon him? This being neglected opens a gap to all
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:11142:79"/>
confusion in all states. The gifts of a man enable him to his office; his grace sanctifyes both the gifts, and office to the person; his <hi>inward calling</hi> perswades his heart to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the outward in <hi>desire to glorify God, and in love to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> 
                  <hi>men;</hi> his exequution of it in the works thereof presuppose it; and testify his faythfulnes in it: but onely the outward orderly <hi>calling</hi> confers the outward state, and condition of life.</p>
               <p>Abilitie for a mans <hi>calling</hi> is greatly to be desired for many reasons. For, first, it is a thing well-pleasing in Gods sight, specially in the most serviceable courses of life, as we may see in <hi>Salomon,</hi> who being <hi>called</hi> to the state of<note place="margin">1 King. 3.</note> a King, desired above all other things, kingly endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therein <hi>pleased God</hi> greatly. Secondly, He whom God <hi>calls</hi> to a place, or sets over a busines, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables accordingly; as he did the same <hi>Salomon,</hi> being set <hi>over a people many in number, as the sand by the sea shore, with</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>wisdom, and largenes of heart, as the sand by the sea-shore.</hi> Thirdly, It is great case to a man, when he is mayster of his place, and course, and able to play with it: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if he be compelled to strive continually with it; it will both make his life burthensome; and force him at some time, or other, to let fall the works thereof, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to weild it. Yet if such a one be willing, and able to bear it out, it is a good way for him to grow to great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by daily improveing his abilitie to the full: as <hi>Milo by using to bear a calf every day, proved able to bear him, when he was grown an oxe.</hi> Fourthly, It is an honour to a man to be excellent in his <hi>faculty,</hi> yea though it be mean in it self. And so men excelling in mean trades, or <hi>callings</hi> are more regarded, then those who are mean in more excellent faculties. One sayth truly, that <hi>even plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and sheep-heards being excellent are applauded.</hi> Lastly,<note place="margin">Pindarus.</note>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:11142:79"/>
the unskilfulnes of the artisan dishonours the art it self how excellent soever, in the eyes of many: although in reason it should not so be; seeing that <hi>the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Erasmus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>any profession is, it finds the fewer, whose worth can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer its excellencie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although <hi>callings</hi> most usefull, and necessarie, are most despised by prowd folks; both because they are ordinary and common; and followed by mean, and ordinary persons: yet it stands with a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to provide, that our <hi>course of life</hi> be such, as in which we benefit humayne societyes. And an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thing it is to him, that hath any either feare of God, or love to men, to spend his dayes, and labour in such a <hi>course,</hi> as by which more hurt then good comes to the world.</p>
               <p>It is a good and godly course for a person diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to read, and seriously to meditate upon such places of holy Scripture, as concern his, or her speciall <hi>calling:</hi> as, for the magistrate diligently to read Deut. 1. 16. &amp;c. the minister 1 Tim. 3. and so for husband, and wife; father, and childe; mayster and servant; and the rest: that by so doing we may both more fully learn, and better remember, and conscionably practise the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular duetyes, in which God would have us exercise our generall christian graces.</p>

The World,</hi> and all things serving for this life, we ought to <hi>use</hi> with a kinde of indifferency, and without setting the affections of our hearts upon it, or them, how busy soever our hands be about them: spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good things, on the contrary, and which concern our eternall happines, we ought to <hi>use,</hi> as <hi>using</hi> them indeed, with all earnest bent of affection upon them; and as not suffering our selvs, at any hand, to be disappoynted of the fruit of them.</p>

                  <hi>God</hi> (sayth the wise man) <hi>hath made every thing beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>

                  <hi>in his time:</hi> and indeed, every thing is good for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: (I mean every thing that God hath made; for there are many vayn and leaud devises of men, which are truly good for nothing) as, on the other side, nothing is good for every thing. And hereupon <hi>Prometheus told the Satyre, when he would haue kissed the fire, upon his first see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                  <hi>it, that if he did so, it would burn his lips, as not being for that use, but to minister heat, and light.</hi> Some things alwayes bear, as it were, their <hi>use</hi> on their backs, and cause also the right <hi>use</hi> of other things, where they are found; as the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying graces of Gods spirit, which yet some <hi>use</hi> more

fully, and faythfully then others; and this is also a grace of God: whereas all other things haue theyr good in theyr <hi>useing,</hi> and not in their owning. And a great poynt of wisdom, and advantage for good it is to apply things to their right <hi>use,</hi> and end, whether great, or smal. He that can doe this spiritually, is happy, though he have receaved but <hi>one pound</hi> for others <hi>five,</hi> or <hi>ten.</hi> As on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, how many were, (though not happy, yet) lesse miserable, if they altogether wanted the wit, learning, riches, and authority; which they want grace to <hi>use,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of the giver?</p>
               <p>A man hath that most, and best, whereof he hath the (lawfull) <hi>use.</hi> And hereupon a follower of a great Lord was wont to say, that he had, in effect, as much, as his Lord; though he were owner of little, or nothing: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how he had the <hi>use</hi> of his gardens, and galleryes, to walk in; heard his musick, with as many ears, as he did; hunted with him in his parkes; and ate, and drank of the same, that he did, though a litle after him; and so for the most other delights, which his Lord enjoyed. And, in truth, what great difference is there, save in the proud, and covetous minde of a man, whether he himself, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be owner of the good things; whereof he with him, hath the lawfull <hi>use,</hi> and benefit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Distinction must be put between the things themselvs, and</hi>

                  <hi>their casuall, and personall abuses: otherwise the natures of the things can neither be rightly conceaved of, nor expressed.</hi> Neyther doth the <hi>abuse</hi> of good things so take away, or make forfeyture of <hi>the use,</hi> as that the counsayl of <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>

If men were not above measure infatuated with sensuallitie, they, who know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good things, would not affect outward inordinately. That fools, and idiots, that know no better things, should <hi>love mony,</hi> is not strange: For oxen love grasse; and swyne draffe; and every creature naturally the best thing which it knows: But that wise, and learned men, and they who know the good things of the minde, specially the good things of God in his word, should so doat upon it, is most vile, and monstrous. Some <hi>love mony</hi> for it self, and for the bare possession of it, and because they delight to tell their pence: but that is the case of few of learning, or wisdom. But as mouls by digging in the earth rayse up hils: so do they hope to clyme up by this basenes; as being set a work, this way, by ambition, for the most part; which too often breeds in the breasts of men rarely endowed; as the cancker doth in sweet flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

And as <hi>riches</hi> are in themselvs Gods blessings, so are we to desire them of him, and to use lawfull diligence to get them: for the comfortable course of our naturall, and civill state: For though we are to be able to bear <hi>poverty,</hi> if God send it:<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> yet should we rayther desire <hi>riches;</hi> as <hi>a man, though he can go afoot, yet will rayther chuse to ride.</hi> Secondly, to free us from such temptations unto sin, as <hi>povertie</hi>

haue their temptations, and those not small: In which regard <hi>Agur</hi> prayes God <hi>to give</hi> him <hi>neyther</hi> of both; <hi>but</hi> to <hi>feed him with food convenient for him.</hi> And, in truth, the middle state is freest from the greatest danger eyther of sin, or misery, in the world: as <hi>Icarus</hi> his father told him, that <hi>the middle way was safest for his waxen wings, neyther to be moystned with the water, nor molten with the heat of the sunne.</hi> And of the two states, the wise man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates in that his prayer to the Lord, that the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>riches</hi> are the more dangerous. <hi>Povertie</hi> may drive a man to <hi>steale,</hi> or deal unjustly with others; and after to <hi>lye,</hi> or, it may be, and, as the Holy Ghost insinuates, by swearing to <hi>take the name of God in vain,</hi> to cover it: But if a man be <hi>rich,</hi> and <hi>full,</hi> he is in danger to <hi>deny God,</hi> and to say in pride, and contempt of him in effect, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did, <hi>who is the Lord?</hi> For hardly doth any thing cause the mynd to swell more with pryde, then <hi>riches;</hi> both by reason of the ease, and plenty of worldly good things, which they bring with them: as also of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, which <hi>rich</hi> men, or their purses, have in the world; and both those specially, if they have gotten their <hi>wealth</hi> by their own art, or industrie. He that is proud in a <hi>poore</hi> estate, would in <hi>a rich</hi> be intollerable before men, as he is in the meane while abhominable in Gods sight: He that is humble in a <hi>prosperous,</hi> is a good scholler of <hi>Christ,</hi> and hath taken out a hard lesson, which the Apostle would haue <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>charge the rich withall;</hi>

               <p>The speciall use of <hi>wine,</hi> and <hi>strong drink</hi> is, that <hi>the heavy of heart, and readie to perish might drink, and</hi>

                  <hi>forget his povertie,</hi> and miserie. But the abuse is more common then the use; by which the strong, and stout take the greatest part therein; <hi>drinking</hi> many times, till they forget both God, and them selvs; whilst the other languish in want, and sorrow.</p>
               <p>Christ, and his Apostles oftens joyn in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations<note place="margin">Math. 24. Luke 12. 1 Thes. 5.</note>

               <p>It is a question amongst learned men, whether of the two extreames of <hi>liberalitie; prodigalitie</hi> in the excesse, or <hi>covetousnes</hi> in the defect, is worse: but something the lesse needfull to be determined, considering how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten they meet together in the same person, and beget eyther the other.

On the other side, they who scape best with <hi>prodigalitie,</hi> are driven to repair their too great <hi>lavishnes</hi> in one thing, by too great <hi>nigardlines</hi> in another.

Hence some borrow without means, or meaning, to pay again; circumvent others, if they haue more cunning then they; oppresse them, if they have more power; and some are driven to plain theeverie, violent, or secret.

                  <hi>lust, then fuell doth the flame.</hi> Secondly, the aged are oft charged with families, and freinds, for whom they are to provide; from which burden youth is free: for <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not to lay up for the parents, but parents for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> But for this also; we see, that <hi>a man, though he be alone, and have no second, neyther child, nor brother,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>puts no end of labour to get, nor is ever satisfyed with riches.</hi> I have not in my life observed any more given to <hi>covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> then such as have not, nor are like to have children to leave their goods to. Thirdly, the other lusts of <hi>prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> youth languishing in age, the heart (not being set upon God, and true goodnes, which alone could fill, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy it) findes onely the lust of <hi>coveting</hi> riches a fit guest to harbour in it; wherewith the flesh mainteyns it self, that it fall not wholly into decay. So <hi>Symonides, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutarch</note> 
                  <hi>of covetousnes, answered, that whereas the delight of all other pleasures was gone, he nourished his age with that alone profitable pleasure.</hi> And lastly, which is worst of all, though God have set religion, and <hi>covetousnes</hi> at such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, that they can not possibly reign in one person: <hi>None can serve God, and mammon:</hi> And again, <hi>He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this world, the love of God dwelleth not in him:</hi> yet we see it, that religion working in persons a loathing of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse</hi> in worldly vanities, their flesh so works with it, as it disposeth very manie to such a <hi>warines,</hi> as between which, and playn <hi>covetousnes</hi> there is too near affinitie. Yea how many have I known, who having passed the danger of <hi>the high-way ground,</hi> and <hi>understood the word of God</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,<note place="margin">Math. 13.</note> and professed the same: and of <hi>the stonie ground</hi> too, in undergoing some troubles, and <hi>persequutions</hi> for the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:11142:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
same: yet nourishing in themsevs too much love, and <hi>care of worldly riches,</hi> have had all their goodnes <hi>choaked</hi> before the harvest, by those dangerous <hi>thornes?</hi> Against this so dangerous, deceitfull, and close-cleaving evill, we are, first, to get into our hearts fayth in Gods providence, as well, and as much, for <hi>the good things of the life present,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.</note> so far forth, as they are good indeed, as of that to come. He that dares not in the use of good means, trust God for this life, doth not indeed trust him for <hi>life everlasting,</hi> how oft soever he say over his creed. Such a man mocks with God, in making a shew of trusting him with that, which in truth he profanely despiseth: whereas, for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good things which he desires in earnest, he will trust God no further then he sees him. Though the Lords love shew forth it self more in heavenly, then in earthly things; yet his truth bindes him alike to performance, as he hath promised: upon which, he that dares not rest for the lesser, makes but a shew of resting for the greater. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we must get <hi>contentation with that which we have, seeing</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>God hath said</hi> to us, <hi>I will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> never leav thee, nor forsake thee:</hi> esteeming, and saying with our selvs, that this which we enjoy with a good conscience, and by means lawfull, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently used, is our alotment from God, by the sanctified use whereof, he will provide competently for our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall state, and further our eternall. Thirdly, considering, how uncerteyn means of our good, even for this life, all earthly things are; and how, many times they become the very snare thereof, as in the case of <hi>Naboth;</hi> and how<note place="margin">1 King. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> alwaies the <hi>coveting</hi> of them deprives of the hope of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.</note> (for <hi>the covetous</hi> is an <hi>idolater, and hath no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, and of God</hi>) it is both sin, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, inordinately to affect the getting, or keeping of them.<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> But, as <hi>the Pharisees being covetous, mocked at Christ, when</hi>

                  <hi>they heard him speak</hi> against their joyning <hi>the serving the mammon of unrighteousnes,</hi> with <hi>the serving of God:</hi> so men, in all ages, becomeing rich by <hi>covetousnes,</hi> and proud by riches; are ready to mock at whatsoever God, or man can say against their <hi>gaynfull wickednes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Considering how many poore people want, and of those not a few, the living members of Christ Iesus; we ought to make great conscience eyther of <hi>spending prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally,</hi> or <hi>sparing covetously</hi> any thing lesse, or more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we might comfort them, and shew them mercy: how much more, of that whereby we should deal justly with them in giving them their due? which should first be done.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ealth</hi> is the greatest bodily blessing, which God bestows upon any in this life: yet is it one of the least regarded: partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of its commonnes to al sorts of people, poore and rich, fools and wise, the vilest and most excellent otherwise: partly, for that it is a naturall good thing, which we bring, for the most part, into the world with us, and so oftens preserv, without any sensible change: And accordingly, we see, that no man is the more honoured for his <hi>health;</hi> which can scarse be sayd of any other good thing whatsoever. The benefit of this <hi>most sweet sause of al other goods</hi> is scarsly<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> discerned by them that enjoy it, till <hi>sicknes</hi> come: for then not onely <hi>Orpheus his song,</hi> but much more our own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:11142:90"/>
teacheth us, <hi>that nothing is avaylable to men without health:</hi> neyther riches, nor honour, nor the greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights for belly, or back, which the earth can affoard. This blessing therefore, where it is, may be set alone against ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other wants: and God acknowledged to deal graciously with us in bestowing it, though with the want of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward good things: which though others enjoy, yet without it, they want the comfortable use of them; &amp; have lesse joy of their lives by far, then we by it, without them.</p>
               <p>The best rule in <hi>physick</hi> is to preserv <hi>health</hi> by the use of things wholesome, and eschewing what is noxious, and hurtfull, either in matter, or manner, or measure: and that betimes, and before distempers have taken too deep root, or that the strength of nature be too much impayred by the inordinate appetites, and licentiousnes of unadvised youth. We say in the proverb, <hi>At fortie years every man is either a fool, or a physition.</hi> But because most are fools so long before, &amp; that in their best years, it is too late for them to become <hi>physitions</hi> at this age; &amp; the after years are constrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to bear the manifold infirmities, &amp; diseases which are owing to inordinat youth. And a happy thing it were, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how few young folks will regard, or beleev these things, till they be taught them by miserable experience, that wise parents, and governers would so shew their care over their children, pupils, and servants; that where they cannot disswade the affection, they might yet prevent the using of those unwholesom, &amp; hurtful youth-banes, unto which inordinate appetite carryes young folk headlong.</p>
               <p>I have marvailed oft at the aversnes of many, specially of the meaner sort, from <hi>physick,</hi> in time of sicknes: but more at their unreasonable choyse of <hi>physitions,</hi> when they use it. How ordinarie a thing is it with a number, that if but theyr horse, or cow be sick,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:11142:91"/>
or but in danger; they will let them blood, or get them a mash; or run to a leach for them? who yet for themselvs, or their nearest freinds will neyther seek, nor willingly be perswaded to use the counsail, or help of a physitian. The reasons hereof I conceav to be, eyther, for that men are prone, and ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade themselvs, and to be perswaded by their freinds, that they shall do wel enough without such helps, and that manie times out of a superstitious presumption of Gods speciall help, where mans is neglected: or, on the contrary, when they are heartlesse, and dispair of good thereby. But yet more strange is the choyse which many make, when they use means. For though in all other courses, men seek for such, as are most skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; yet in this they are not onely <hi>more readie to beleev any that professeth himself a physition, then of any other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pliny.</note> but also chuse rayther to trust theyr bodyes, and lives in the hands of ignorant <hi>Empericks,</hi> men or women, then of the most expert, and learned <hi>physitions</hi> that are. Which I speak not, as esteeming the counsayl, or help of the meanest to be neglected, specially where eyther the more skilfull cannot wel be come by, or that the danger is not great: But for that all things are to be done reasonably, and for the best advantaging and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of good, that may be. The causes of this are on the <hi>Empericks</hi> part; that they are more officious about their patients; the other being many tymes supercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and neglective of meaner persons: Secondly, that they are more bold boasters of their own doings then the other, whose learning makes them modest: Thirdly, their affoarding their counsail, and pains at a cheaper rate then the other do; who verie likelily, and as experience teacheth in other countries) if they
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:11142:91"/>
would descend to that rule of equitie in other cases, (<hi>A penny-worth for a penny</hi>) would finde, that <hi>lighter gayns</hi> comming thicker, would <hi>make heavier purses.</hi> Fourthly, their administring of <hi>medicines</hi> usually lesse offensive, and loathsome unto nature: which, it may be, the others skill, and care (if custome made not men lesse compassionate then they should be,) might much correct: though it can not be denyed, that by Gods providence, and for mans sin, the most wholesom things eyther naturally, or morally, are bitter, and unpleasing. On the <hi>patients</hi> part this aryseth commonly, 1. from a suspition, least they being mean, and playn persons should eyther be overreached, or neglected by the learned. 2. From envy, which the learneds arrogancy also oftens occasioneth. 3. From an ambitious desire in them, to advance those of their own order; as of old, the <hi>citizens of Rome</hi> would have the cheif officers, even the <hi>Consuls,</hi> and <hi>Dictatours crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Livy.</note> and chosen out of their rank. And lastly, for that, if any cure be, or seem to be wrought by them, which want art, men are therein ready to conceav of a special divine assistance, and helping hand of God.</p>
               <p>One speciall use of a <hi>skilfull artist</hi> is to discerne aright of the varietie of circumstances that fall in. Simple men and women have many times the same <hi>medicines,</hi> or simples, at least, with the most skilful doctours: But wanting art, and skil to temper, and apply them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diversitie of the estates of patients, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of accidents within, and without the sick, they eyther profit not; or hurt one way, what they profit an other. To which purpose it was wittily answered of the <hi>physition,</hi> who <hi>having prescribed a medicine to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and thereby cured him; and being asked by him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:11142:92"/>
                  <hi>why the same medicine, which the same person, falling into the same disease again, took himself, did not avayl him, as before;</hi> that <hi>the reason was, because he</hi> (the <hi>physition) gave it him not.</hi> Neyther is the use greater of the skilfull in this consideration, then of the experienced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Physitians</hi> (sayth one, and truely) <hi>have this advantage</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Antoninus</note> 
                  <hi>above them of other professions; that the sun beholds their cures, and the earth covers their faylings.</hi> They that dy under their hands, or by their default, are past complayning of them: they that recover and survive, though, sometimes, by the benefit of nature alone, under Gods providence, will repute, and report them the means of their recovery. Which consideration makes not the honest, and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable the more secure; but the more carefull of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be given unto God, from whose eyes nothing is covered.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Naziam.</note> 
                  <hi>hath been darkned.</hi> Now, as it were to be wished, that we could alwaies certainly know the Lords particular ends <hi>in afflicting</hi> us; (as we may gather much ordinarily, by the knowledge of his word, observation of his dealing towards our selvs, and others, and due examination of our estate, and wayes in his sight) so is it most necessarie for all his people, ever to hold this generall conclusion; that in all <hi>their afflictions</hi> the justice, and mercy of God meet together: and that he begins in justice, and wil end in mercy, with them.</p>
               <p>God hath in a peculiar manner entayled <hi>afflictions</hi> to the sincere profession of the gospel, above that of the law before Christ. <hi>The law was given by Moyses,</hi> whose mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie began <hi>with killing the Egiptian, that oppressed the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite;</hi> and was prosequuted <hi>with leading the people out of Egipt, through the sea, and wildernes, with great might, and a strong hand;</hi> and lastly, was finished with bloody victorie over <hi>Sihon, and Og the kings of Canaan.</hi> But Christs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation was all of an other kynde: his birth mean; his life sorrowfull; and his death shamefull. And albeit the love of God towards his people be alwaies the same in it self, yet is the manifestation thereof very divers. Before Christs coming in the flesh, in whom <hi>the grace of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,</hi> God shewed his love more fully in earthly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and peace; and more sparingly in spirituall, and heavenly: But now, on the other side, he dealeth forth temporall blessings more sparingly; and spirituall with a fuller hand. It is not unprobably gathered, that, after
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:11142:93"/>
                  <hi>the destruction of the dragon, and beast,</hi> and recalling of the Iewes after their long divorse from the Lord; the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of both kindes shall meet together, and the Church enjoy, for a time, a verie gracefull state upon earth both in regard of spirituall, and bodily good things.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, many would fayn have their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantage, and the obedience of the gospell to agree together, further then they will. And when they cannot frame the world and their worldly conveniencie to the gospell; they will fashion the gospel to the world, and to their carnall courses in it. Pitty it is, that such men were not of the Lords councell, when he first contrived, and preached his gospel; that they might have helped him in some such discreet, and middle course, as might have served the turn both for Heaven, and earth. But let the world, in its foolish wisdom, say and do what it will, or can; <hi>the way is narrow, which leads unto life:</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> mans naughtines, it is neyther fit, nor hardly possible, that it should be broader.</p>
               <p>All <hi>the afflictions</hi> which Christians suffer are not <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of Christ: nor all the <hi>crosses</hi> which they take up, the <hi>crosses</hi> of Christ. The <hi>afflictions</hi> of Christ may be set in three ranks. The first, (and those most properly so called) are when men for Christs cause, hate, revile, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quute us. The second, when we suffer <hi>evils,</hi> which we might be free from, and escape, if we durst deny in word, or deed any part of Christs truth. The third, and last sort are, such as befall us in the course of godlines, though hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn, and as they do all other men; as bodily sicknes, death of freinds, crosses, and losses by sea, and land, and the like. If we be members of Christ our such <hi>afflictions</hi> are the <hi>afflictions</hi> of Christ; els the mercy shewed, and good <hi>done</hi> to such were not <hi>done</hi> to Christ. But now, if he that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:11142:94"/>
in his person is a true Christian, <hi>suffer</hi> for evil doing, he takes not up the <hi>crosse</hi> of Christ, but of the divel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and if he put himself upon needlesse danger, and difficulties, he takes not up Christs <hi>crosse,</hi> but his own herein: and so hath his amends in his own hands. Yet may even <hi>afflictions</hi> so coming by our true repentance be sanctified unto us; and we please God in their use, though not in their cause.</p>
               <p>Both good conscience and wisdom must be used in applying such scriptures, as speak of the <hi>afflictions</hi> of Christians for well doing: neyther is all that can be sayd out of everie text thereabout, to be applyed to all times. For howsoever hardly at any time, or in any place, things go so well, especially in our dayes (which even they, who are none of the best themselvs, will confesse, yea complayn to be extreamly evill) but that <hi>truth goes with a scratcht face,</hi> lesse, or more; yet the differences of times and state of things must be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and put, this way. Yea further, though the times in the generall should be very <hi>evill;</hi> yet for a person, who himself is wel furnished with earthly good things, wel fed, and glad, and in outward peace, to dwel much upon the <hi>afflictions</hi> of Christians, specially with applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the present state of things, is not to hold <hi>deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> but hath an appearance more oratour, then prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher-like.</p>
               <p>We are never simply to desire <hi>crosses,</hi> because they are naturall evils: nor to abhor from them, because we know they <hi>work together</hi> with our <hi>election, calling, justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:11142:94"/>
and examples of good men: but onely as occasions ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of sanctification to our use, which sins properly are not, as having no good in them, as such; whereas <hi>afflictions</hi> have a morall good in them, as they are of God, and by him inflicted. Though to speak of <hi>cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> most properly, God sanctifies us to them, in giving us grace to make a right use of them. And consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how it is both <hi>good for us to be afflicted,</hi> and that God hath promised, that <hi>no good thing shall be lacking to them</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119. and 34.</note> 
                  <hi>that fear him;</hi> we are thus to make account; that God <hi>afflicts</hi> us, as he doth, not onely in justice for sin, but in <hi>faythfulnes</hi> also; that is, both in mercy, and in truth of promise: and must accordingly confesse with the man of God; <hi>I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are righteous;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> 
                  <hi>and that thou in faithfulnes hast afflicted me:</hi> and so must learn to take our severall <hi>crosses</hi> at Gods hands, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly patiently, but thankfully. We have cause to thank our selvs, and our sins, that wholesom things both for body and soul are for the most part bitter and greivous to our nature: and to thank God, that makes <hi>afflictions</hi> bitter-sweets, by turning deserved curses into fatherly corrections to us.</p>
               <p>It is commonly receaved for truth, that <hi>in all adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>

                  <hi>the greatest miserie is, sometimes to have been happy.</hi> But we must here use a distinction. <hi>If we onely respect the time</hi>

                  <hi>in which we are in miserie</hi> apart from the former time, we are both <hi>more sensible of our present miserie, by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring our former happines;</hi> and also more tender, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, and so lesse able to bear it: But if we consider our whole life together; then the lesse time we are <hi>afflicted,</hi> the lesse our <hi>afflictions</hi> are, in that respect, and so must be mynded of us. It is not nothing, that God hath given us to passe over some part of our dayes in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:11142:95"/>
peace, and with comfort: neyther must we be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull, as to account it no benefit, because it is past: but we must, contrarywise, something quiet ourselvs in our present <hi>affliction</hi> with the remembrance of Gods goodnes in our former peace; as did our <hi>example</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iames 5.</note> 
                  <hi>of patience,</hi> who in the extreamitie of his present <hi>distresse</hi> sayd, <hi>shall we receav good at the hand of God, and shall we</hi>

                  <hi>not receav evill?</hi> Reason teacheth this (except in a case, when God lifts up a man on high, that he may the more violently through him down) how much more, fayth; which perswades the godly mans heart, that the Lord loves him as well, &amp; as much, in his after <hi>afflicted</hi> estate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he did before in his <hi>prosperous;</hi> as the gold-smith esteems his gold as much, though melting in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; as glittering in the shop: and that the same God will both give patience, and strength of fayth, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the tryall; and encrease of strength, if he encrease the <hi>affliction;</hi> as also full deliverance in due time. <hi>He</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>will redeem Israel from all his trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As even good men perform their whole duetie to God, with some corruption mingled among: so God promiseth (and performeth accordingly) the good things of this life, with exception of the <hi>crosse,</hi> and <hi>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> If we could amend the one, God would leav<note place="margin">Mark 10.</note> out the other.</p>
               <p>The Lord who <hi>tryed Abraham in his son Isaak, whom he loved;</hi> and <hi>the rich young man</hi> in his <hi>riches</hi> which he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, knows well in what veyn to strike a man, that the blood may follow. The more we love any earthly thing, we are the more in danger to be <hi>crossed</hi> in, or about it. Not that God envyes our delights, as one man often envyes anothers: but eyther because we do, or lest we should surfet in affections towards it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:11142:95"/>Most men are moved too much with their own <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes</hi> in this world, melting in them, as wax in the sun, so as they are unapt to hold any impression eyther of fayth, or reason: but are too litle moved with other mens <hi>calamities,</hi> not affoarding them so much as a compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection. Yet may, and doth the contrary extream of over pittying others also, prevayl with some. Against both which it is good to consider, that eyther we, and they reap spirituall benefit by our <hi>afflictions,</hi> or no. If the former; that may, and ought to moderate the <hi>greif:</hi> If not; there is cause of greater <hi>greif</hi> for after greater <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to come upon us, and them.</p>
               <p>A man may much encrease, or lessen a <hi>crosse</hi> by the course, which he suffers his mynde to run, in it; seeing all <hi>crosses</hi> have some <hi>conveniencies</hi> joyned with them; as <hi>all commodities have some discommodities.</hi> If a man set his thoughts a work upon the <hi>inconveniencies,</hi> and <hi>discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dityes</hi> alone, which are in it, he shall heap <hi>sorrow</hi> upon <hi>sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> But if, on the contrary, he draw into consideration such <hi>conveniencyes,</hi> as usually fall in with their contraryes; he shall alwaies finde some matter of ease: and sometimes,<note place="margin">Iudg. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <note place="margin">Pacius.</note> 
                  <hi>not done justly.</hi> In one, and the same act may be found both sin against God, and <hi>injurie</hi> against man. And therefore in cases of <hi>wrong</hi> done either by violence, or deceit, the offender, under the law, was bound both to make <hi>restitution to the wronged,</hi> and also <hi>to bring his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Levit. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>trespas offering to the priest, to make an atonement for him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.</hi> Sometimes the sin is taken away, and the <hi>iniurie</hi> remayns; as when the person which hath <hi>wronged</hi> another, truly repents; but is not able to make satisfaction: Sometimes, on the other side, the <hi>injurie</hi> is taken away, and the sin remayns; viz. when the offender makes satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by compulsion, or for shame; but repents not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: Sometimes both are taken away, and sometimes neyther; as both or neyther satisfaction to men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance towards God is performed.</p>
               <p>Between the <hi>injurying,</hi> and offending of a man there is this difference; that we may <hi>injurie</hi> him that is altogether ignorant of it; but can offend onely him that takes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of some evil in truth, or appearance, done by us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>injury,</hi> or not.</p>
               <p>The more power any hath to do <hi>hurt,</hi> without worldly prejudice to himself therein, the more carefull had he need be, that he take not to himself any lawlesse liberty that way; <hi>remembring</hi> alwayes <hi>that he hath also a master in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coloss. 4. Eccles. 5</note> 
                  <hi>heaven;</hi> and <hi>that he who is higher then the highest regardeth:</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:11142:96"/>
who also may with more right, and reason destroy him for ever, then he (how great soever) do the least <hi>hurt</hi> to the sillyest worm, that crawls upon the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They who use injurious dealings themselvs hate them in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
                  <hi>others, and them that offer them;</hi> as do they also who take knowledge of them. For <hi>whom men fear, they hate:</hi> Now there is cause for all to fear him (to his power) that <hi>hurts</hi> any; seeing <hi>in wronging one, he threatens all that he hath power to hurt.</hi> Yet if we will look upon things a litle spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, such persons are more to be pittied, then eyther hated, or feared; as being, (though cruell to others, yet) more to themselvs: <hi>hurting others in their bodies,</hi> and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily<note place="margin">Austin.</note> states; <hi>themselvs in their hearts,</hi> and consciences before the Lord, which is far the greatest damage. And upon this ground it was, that the ancient father desyred <hi>Scapula,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> that he would <hi>pitty himself, if he would not pittie the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, whom he cruelly persequuted,</hi> seeing the most <hi>hurt</hi> came to himself thereby. When therefore we thus suffer any heynous <hi>injuries</hi> of any kinde by any, we must pray the Lord both to deliver us out of their hands, and them out of the divels, whose instruments they are, in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>For any one man whosoever to offer <hi>injurie</hi> to any other whomsoever, is unnaturall, and inhumayn: but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially odious in these four sorts of persons: The first is Magistrates, and men in authoritie, whom God hath therefore furnished therewith, that they might prevent, and redresse <hi>injuries</hi> by others; and <hi>exequute wrath upon</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>evill doers.</hi> Which if they become themselvs, they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the image of the Lords power, and justice, which they susteyn, into the image of Gods enemy, Sathan, whom therein they resemble; and become, after a sort, <hi>wickednesses in high places,</hi> as the divels are. The second are
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:11142:97"/>
freinds, whose office it is by <hi>help, counsayl, riches,</hi> or<note place="margin">Terence.</note> otherwise, to succour their <hi>wronged freinds;</hi> and if no other way, at least, by condoling with them, and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. <hi>A man that hath freinds should shew himself friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 18.</note> (sayth the wise man) and for such a one to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self enemie-like, is very greivous; as we may see in <hi>Iobs,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> case. Now, if it be here demanded, whether <hi>the injuries</hi> offered by freinds, or by others, be lesse tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Answer must be made with distinction; that some <hi>injuries</hi> are such, and so notorious, as cannot stand with a true <hi>freindly</hi> heart, but do plainly discover an evil, and eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious affection: and of these by false <hi>freinds David</hi> (and worthily) complayns, as more greivous then by <hi>strangers.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 55.</note> Some again, are such, as may scape him that truly loveth, through negligence, rashnes, or other infirmitie. Such the heat of love should digest. And they, who, in this kinde will bear more at the hands of others, then of freinds, are unworthy of them. A third sort are men religious, whose professed pietie towards God promiseth honest dealing with men: as on the contrary, <hi>Abraham</hi> looked for all<note place="margin">Gen. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>injurious</hi> dealing <hi>in that place, where the fear of God was not.</hi> The fourth, and last are men themselvs oppressed by others, specially lying under <hi>the injuries</hi> of the times. <hi>When one poore man oppresseth another, it is like a sweeping</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>rayn, which leaveth no food.</hi> Yet is it found by certain expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that it oft rayns from this coast; and that the poore by <hi>oppressing</hi> one another, teach the rich to <hi>oppresse</hi> both: and this not onely in bodily things, but in spirituall also: none being found more <hi>injurious,</hi> and unmercifull, then are some (out of the favours of the times themselvs) to others, that are a litle more in their disgrace, then they. None of the heathens were so cruelly bent against the christians, as the Iews, though themselvs but scattered
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:11142:97"/>
amongst the Heathens, to be tolerated by them. Such should think of <hi>the brethren of Ioseph,</hi> who being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs in danger to be <hi>violently oppressed,</hi> remembred, and bewayled the <hi>violence,</hi> and <hi>wrong,</hi> which they had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Gen. 42.</note> offered to their <hi>brother Ioseph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two things causing inordinate stirring, and indignation at <hi>injuries</hi> offered: the one naturall; the other morall. The naturall is the aboundance of hoat choler boyling in the veyns, by which the blood, and spirits are attenuated, and so apt to be inordinately stirred, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, upon apprehension of a <hi>wrong</hi> done. This cause may something be helped by naturall means, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; and the effect by true wisdom, and government, which represseth all inordinate motions in the minde. The morall cause is pride, and self-love: for men having themselvs in high estimation, make account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if they be a litle <hi>wronged,</hi> some great, and heynous offence is committed, and that at which there is just cause of high indignation. The <hi>injury</hi> to such seems great, because they seem great to themselvs: whereas to him that is litle, and lowly in his own eyes, <hi>injuryes</hi> and wrongs seem lesse: specially if he set this low price, and valuation upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in conscience of his sins against God: as it was with<note place="margin">2 Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>David.</hi> What strange thing is it, if an earthen pot get a crack? or if a silly worme be troden upon? or that he, who is litle, be litle set by?</p>
               <p>It is wisdom, in cases, not to seem to take knowledge of an <hi>injurie:</hi> as eyther, when it is small, and scarse wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the myndeing; and such the stately gravitie of some persons make many to be, which to others seem intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; witnesse <hi>Cato,</hi> who being <hi>asked pardon of him that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
                  <hi>had given him a bob on the mouth, answered, that there was no injurie done, and so no pardon needfull:</hi> or when the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:11142:98"/>
(and mallice withall) of the <hi>injurious</hi> is such, as that to expostulate a <hi>wrong</hi> is to provoke to the doubling of it: to which purpose his answer fitted well, that sayd, <hi>he had grown old in a tyrants court, by thanking men, when he had received an injurie from them.</hi> Sometimes, again, it is wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to let persons know, that we account our selvs <hi>yll used</hi> by them, and that cheifly, when our expostulation is like to prove their warning; by working eyther fear, or shame in them.</p>
               <p>If the commendation given of <hi>Caesar</hi> had not been by<note place="margin">Cicero.</note> him, who was too good a courtjer, that he was wont <hi>to forget nothing but injuries;</hi> he though a pagan, might therein have been a mirrour to all Christians; considering the mischeivousnes of our corrupt nature this way, which is apter to remember a <hi>wrong</hi> done, then any thing els, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially then a benefit; because, as one sayth, we account<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> 
                  <hi>thanks a burden,</hi> and <hi>revenge an ease.</hi> In regard whereof it was not without cause, that Christ our Lord in our <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectorie of prayer,</hi> which we must dayly use, reinforceth<note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> nothing but the condition of the fifth petition: <hi>as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them that trespasse against us;</hi> the petition being, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our trespasses;</hi> adding therein, that <hi>if we forgive not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them that trespasse against us, neyther will our heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgive us.</hi> And <hi>this exhortation,</hi> sayth one, <hi>if we be</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> 
                  <hi>not more hard, then iron, and steel, cannot but soften us, and make us appeasable, and ready to remit offences;</hi> considering how many, and great our <hi>offences</hi> are against the Lord; for which he both so justly might, and so easily could take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengment upon us. And since <hi>vengeance is the Lords, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>that he will repay,</hi> we must beware we take it not further into our hands, then God gives it us: lest medling with edged-tools, in Gods shop, we surely cut our selvs deep, howsoever they scape, against whom we use them. And,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:11142:98"/>
besides the conscience of offending God by <hi>revenge,</hi> in wish, word, or deed, we may take instances of inducement to forgivenes, from circumstances of all the persons that <hi>injurie</hi> us. If it be a meaner person then our selvs, that <hi>wrongs</hi> us; let us forgive him, in pittie of his weaknes: If our <hi>superiour, let us pittie, and forgive our selvs:</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> in charitie; the latter in wisdom. Is he a malicious, and unmerited enemy? why should we marvayl, if he do his kynde? Have we hurt him before? he but gives us our due, and why should we not take it at his hands? Is he a good man? let us be ready to forgive him, whom God forgives. Is he wicked? Alas, we may well forgive him, considering how fearfull vengeance (if he repent not) God will take on him for that, and other his sins.</p>
               <p>Many who think it divelish (as indeed it is) to offer an <hi>injurie,</hi> think it but manly to requite it. But <hi>it is,</hi> (sayth<note place="margin">Lactant.</note> one, <hi>evill as well to requite, as to offer; since God forbids both.</hi> And <hi>there is,</hi> sayth another, <hi>onely this difference between</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> 
                  <hi>them; that he who offers the injury, is before in mischief; and he that requites it, comes after therein, as fast as he can.</hi> With which two joyn a third witnesse saying, that to <hi>render evil</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> 
                  <hi>for evill, is to make two divels for one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not to be revenged for an <hi>injury</hi> done is not alwayes to forgive it. For this may be through want of power, or of courage, or in a kinde of haughtines of mynde, when a man esteems himself above the <hi>wrong</hi> done, or scorns to fyle his fingers with his adversarie. Neyther yet is it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient (though it be a great thing) that we wish him no hurt who hath <hi>wronged</hi> us; but we ought further also so to keep our <hi>hearts,</hi> that they <hi>rejoyce not at his fall, or slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> by any other means; <hi>least the Lord see, and it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please</hi>

Notwithstanding, we may, &amp; have cause to be glad, if the <hi>injurious,</hi> and <hi>oppressours</hi> be restreyned by some work of Gods over-ruling providence; that the fox being chay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up may no more worry the lambs: But this is not to rejoyce for his hurt; but for his good.

God, we do in our afflictions specially exercise the two mayn graces of Fayth, and Hope. Fayth, perswading our hearts, that God loves us as well in our greatest afflictions, as out of them, and will do us nothing but good by them, is as the foundation for this bulwork of <hi>patience.</hi> Hope assureth us of happy issue out of them all; which if we wanted, what would it avayl us though we had the strength of men, and angels to <hi>bear miseries?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Christians have sayd, that <hi>Patience is a miserable remedy.</hi> But how much better said the Heathen <hi>Byas,</hi> that <hi>he onely is miserable that wants patience, for the bearing of his</hi>

                  <hi>misfortunes.</hi> As indeed, he is in a miserable case; consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto how many calamities all mortall men are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: against which they can neyther promise themselvs before hand, nor finde in time, other sufficient remedy, then this of <hi>patience;</hi> which is <hi>a salv for all soars:</hi> and the<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> same also so approved, that though it make not miseries cease to be miseries; yet it keeps the person that hath it, and suffers them, from being miserable. Yea, as deadly poysons may be, and are so mixed, and tempered, as they become, in cases, more wholesom, then meat; so do <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,</hi> deadly in themselvs, tempered with <hi>patience</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come better then their contrarie delights. Sicknes with this is better then health without it; and poverty so tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, then riches otherwise: and so all the works of Gods justice, unto which the faythfull are lyable, are better to them, then any work of his mercy to others. Lastly, so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessarie is this grace, and the use of it, for all Christians, as that the Apostle tels the beleeving <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and other beleevers in them, that they had <hi>need of patience,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note>

                  <hi>perfit, and intire, lacking nothing.</hi> A man would think in reason, that he who hath done the will of God, and been carefull in all things to keep a good conscience towards God, and men, should have <hi>nothing lacking, for the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the promised</hi> reward. But the wisdom of God tels us, that we must first doe our duetie in all things; and then afterwards, suffer evill <hi>with patience,</hi> before we receav the reward promised. In which our <hi>patient</hi> suffering for, or in the way of righteousnes, we please God more (if it may be) then in our former weldoing; as Christ our Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the greatest work of his obedience unto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of our redemption therein, by his innocent, and <hi>patient</hi> suffering of death.</p>
               <p>Of all manner of crosses none are so hard to <hi>bear</hi> by Gods servants, without despayr, as those, wherein the Lord seems, to theyr sense, and reason, to be their <hi>enemy,</hi> by<note place="margin">Iob 19.</note> reason of some strange, and unusuall working against them; as we have <hi>Iob</hi> for an example: Nor any so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly born by them, without inordinate stirring, and spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning again, as those, in which a man must be a meer <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi> using, as they call it, that <hi>passive patience;</hi> and may, or can say, or do nothing in defending himself, or offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an adversarie.

there the flesh and fleshly passions take more libertie. I haue known some, who have atteyned to a good measure of <hi>patient bearing</hi> calamities and crosses by other ordinarie hand of Gods providence; and yet have been most impatient of any prejudice, or damage by mens injurious dealing. And this may seem not to want reason. To be stirred against God for a crosse, is divelish; against unreasonable creatures, brutish; but hath a shew of manlines, for a man to be stirred against a man that injuries him. But be the shew what it will, the truth of the ground, for the most part, is; that pride causeth this swelling of the heart against him, who is deemed to injurie us, specially if we conceav it to be out of contempt; whereof all men are <hi>impatient.</hi> Against the pang of <hi>impatiencie</hi> this way, it is best we labour, not to overvalue our selvs; nor easily to think that others dispise us; and, as we have <hi>Iob for a pattern of patience,</hi> so to follow his steps; who, looking through the violence, and <hi>wrongs</hi> of men (the <hi>Sabeans, and Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi>) beheld, by the eye of fayth, which <hi>sees a far of,</hi> Gods providence, as the soul of the worlds body, and ruling all things in it; and thence took instruction for quiet, and <hi>patient</hi> submission unto the Lord: seeing, &amp; saying in all the outragious practises against him by the divell, and wicked men; that <hi>God</hi> who <hi>had given, had taken away.</hi>

                  </note> with others, when we have it, and to imbrace it when it is offered; but to <hi>pursue</hi> and follow after it, even <hi>when it seems to fly from us.</hi> Many can cry aloud for <hi>peace,</hi> and against <hi>peace-breakers:</hi> and can speak very glorious things in commendation of so profitable, and pleasant a good, whereby to perswade others to it. But what is this <hi>peace,</hi> unto which not a few of those good ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours so earnestly, and eloquently perswade? Surely too often nothings els but eyther a cursed consent in evill, or servile subjection to their, or their masters wils, and lusts, without regard eyther of equitie, or reason. They would willingly have <hi>peace;</hi> that is, they would do what they list, and have others do the same their lists also, how unreasonable soever. But <hi>this</hi> (saith<note place="margin">Hugo.</note> one) <hi>is not to follow peace, but to command it.</hi> The divell himself would have such <hi>peace,</hi> and hath with his; <hi>(when the strong man armed keeps his house, all things that he hath</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 11.</note>

                  <hi>are in peace</hi>) and upon condition that he might rule in, and over them after his wicked will. But to <hi>follow after peace</hi> aright is clean an other, and the same an excellent thing; requiring at the least these three particular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. First, a truely affectioned heart unto it, in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God, and love to men, out of a due valuation of its excellencie; as <hi>Elisha</hi> loving, and reverencing his master <hi>Eliah,</hi> would <hi>follow</hi> after him, and <hi>not leave</hi> him. The second is, to deal justly, and equally with all men, without wronging any. It is double injury to beat men causelesly till they cry, and then to beat them for crying. Thus many breed <hi>strife</hi> by injury, and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and then cry out against it; as <hi>Athalyah cryed</hi> out of <hi>treason. There are two freinds</hi> (sayth the Father) <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 85. <hi>Austin.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and Peace; He that will have the one, must do the other. All would have peace; but all will not do righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But he that puts the one away, and loves not the freind of peace; peace loves not him, nor will come at him.</hi> A third thing, is <hi>forbearance of others,</hi> what may be, though in our own <hi>wrong.</hi> For considering how ready all sorts of<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. Ephes. 4.</note> men are to wrong one another, and withall how apt to think themselvs wronged, when they are not, yea often times, when they themselvs do the wrong: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we mingle with the former two, such modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Christian <hi>forbearance,</hi> as to bear, and tolerate for <hi>peace</hi> sake, persons, and things not intollerable, we follow strife in effect; whatsoever we eyther pretend, or intend otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is ill when good men have not peace, and unity amongst</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Austin.</note> 
                  <hi>themselvs; and as yll, yea worse, when there is peace amongst wicked, and godles persons;</hi> seeing thereby their strength in evill is encreased. It is better the work of God go on weakly, as it doth, when <hi>peace</hi> among the good is
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:11142:103"/>
wanting; then the divels work strongly, as it doth, in <hi>the conspiracie of wicked men.</hi> It is therefore a speciall<note place="margin">Psal. 38.</note> work of Gods good, and powerfull providence to cast a bone amongst such, and to set them one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>a fire may come out from Abimelech, and devour</hi>

assist, within the bounds of the callings in which God hath set them, their brethren, and associates against it: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> to that of the Phylosopher; <hi>He that bears with the vices of his freind makes them his own.</hi> Hence <hi>all Israel</hi> was <hi>punished,</hi> and is sayd to <hi>have sinned,</hi> for not preventing, or reforming one <hi>Achans transgression.</hi> The sin of another,<note place="margin">Iosh. 7.</note> how near soever unto me, cannot defile me, because he doth it: for then that which neyther <hi>goes into a man,</hi> nor <hi>comes out of him might defile him:</hi> but when eyther I doe something for the furthering of it, which I should not do; or neglect something which I should perform in my place for the preventing, or reforming of it; by these means I become accessorie eyther before, or after the fact; and not otherwise.</p>
               <p>Although it be to be desyred, and that, unto which we are bound, as humanitie, &amp; our speciall places, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion will permit; that we converse onely with such, as eyther may make us better, which is wisdom; or which we are like to make better, which is charity: yet will a good, and wise man make good use of all <hi>companies.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the good he will learn to love goodnes the more: amongst the evill (and most amongst the worst) the more to hate evill. But yet notwithstanding, there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. In evill <hi>company</hi> we see what to avoid; which is good: but in good, what to follow; which is better. Besides, there is danger (if of no worse thing) lest the edg of our zeal against evill should be taken of, if we be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned continually to be grateing against it. The spirit of grace, and goodnes had need to be strong in him, that is not tyred with continuall struglings, and stryvings with the mallice of others. He that, at the first, with <hi>righteous</hi>

to be vexed dayly lesse, and lesse, with them, as things growing by custom, more familiar to him. Also there is a second danger, lest living amongst fools, or wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent our selvs with the litle model of goodnes, or wisdom which we have; because we are some body in comparison of them, (as <hi>he that hath but half an eye, is a king amongst them that are blinde:</hi>) whereas amongst the wise, and good, we have still matter of imitation, and provocation to aspire unto greater perfection in goodnes.

               <p>As many, who, if they walked alone, would, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their richer apparrell, be thought men of better estate, then they are: and others meaner then they are, by reason of their russet coats: who yet both are discerned of what condition, and rank they be, by their <hi>companions and consorts:</hi> so the vertuous, or vitious dispositions of men are much discovered by the <hi>company,</hi> which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and with which they sort with most gladnes, and content: For <hi>like will to like,</hi> whether good, or evill.</p>

unto how many dangers, and calamities mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted state hath been exposed, I have counted it a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, that I have not had many such, as were in danger to take excessive sorrow for my miserie that hath, or could befall me.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>freinds,</hi> in this respect, have a very ill, and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freindly</hi> fashion. If any good come to them, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it from their <hi>freinds:</hi> if any hurt, they hasten to fill their ears with that, to the utmost. Such are more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly chyldish, then children. For as they will streight complayn to their mothers, of any hurt that befals them: so, on the other side, if any good come to them, though it be but an apple, or nut; they will as readily run, and acquaynt them with it also. Such persons are commonly lovers of themselvs, envious, and unthankfull. We, on the contrarie, should rayther hasten, and desire to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to our <hi>freinds</hi> matter of gladnes, when good befals us; then of sorrow, in our crosses: and shew therein both our <hi>love</hi> towards them, in procuring their rejoycing with us; and also our wisdom, and strength of fayth, and <hi>patience,</hi> in the silent swallowing of our sorrows, without grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our <hi>freinds</hi> more then needs must. So we read of<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> 
                  <hi>the woman, that had lost her peice; she lighted the candle, swept the house, and sought it diligently;</hi> and all this she did alone: but <hi>when she had found it,</hi> then <hi>she called in her freinds, and neighbours to rejoyce with her.</hi> It is best mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alone; and best rejoycing with companie.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>freinds</hi> are rayther to be used, then trusted: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such as are more able, then entire, or free-hearted: Some agayn are rayther to be trusted, then used, saue in case of necessitie, and then also sparingly: and those are such, as whose truly <hi>loving</hi> affections exceed their abilitie. And in these considerations, the proverb oft times fitteth:

                  <hi>Rich mens purses, and poore mens hearts.</hi>

               <p>Wealth maketh many <hi>freinds,</hi> and povertie tryeth them; as the winde shews which clouds have rayn in them, and which not. And so, though the rich have the more <hi>freinds;</hi> yet the poores better appear to be faythfull, in giving testimony that they love their <hi>freinds</hi> for God, and the persons themselvs: which to know is not a small priveledg, that poore men have above others; who can<note place="margin">Gregorie.</note> 
                  <hi>hardly discern, whether their persons, or riches be loved. A freind</hi> (sayth the wise man) <hi>loveth at all times: and a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

                  <hi>is born for adversity.</hi> He sayth not, A <hi>freind</hi> is born for prosperitie; though it be one end of <hi>freindship,</hi> that we might have with whom to communicate, and rejoyce in a prosperous state of things; but for adversity; this being the more principall end (specially in our sinfull, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull state) for which God hath linked men together in all <hi>societies:</hi> which the wiser sort of the heathen have seen by the dim light of nature, and that it apperteyns spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the office of a true <hi>freind to ease his freinds greif by speach, to affoard him counsayl in doubtfull cases, to drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And for such persons in <hi>societies,</hi> as, in effect, make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that they are onely for other mens prosperitie, and not for their afflicted state; and that others are for their help, and benefit; and they for their own: these are the verie moths, and caterpillers of family, church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth: and so far from deserving the <hi>fellowship</hi> of men, as they are scarse worthy of the flocks, and heards of beasts: of which divers are helpfull to their fellow, as they are able, and the other need.</p>
               <p>As none can sin against the Holy Ghost, and irremissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but they, whom God hath receaved into some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

                  <hi>Ieroboam</hi> known by this brand, <hi>He that made Israel to sin.</hi> But a great <hi>name</hi> so got, and left to posteritie, is like to the great stinck of a lamp, or candle, when it is gone out: whereas <hi>the memoriall of the righteous is blessed;</hi> and<note place="margin">Prov. 10.</note> like <hi>the smell of the costly oyntment of spykenard, wherewith Mary annoynted our Lords feet: the sweet sent whereof filled the whole house.</hi> And this <hi>good name</hi> of the godly, and<note place="margin">Iohn. 12.</note> vertuous, living amongst good men upon earth, when they are dead, is a kinde of pledge of their souls living for ever with God in heaven. This none neglect, but they, who mean to do nothing to deserv it: nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise, but with endangering their own hardning in evill, both against the fear of God, and shame of the world.</p>
               <p>This <hi>good name is rayther to be chosen then great riches,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 22.</note> sayth he, who could well discern what was best.

               <p>This <hi>credit,</hi> and <hi>good name</hi> we may desire, as a good pleasing naturall thing, and for our more comfortable living amongst men: and so <hi>David</hi> prayed sundry times in one Psalm, that God would <hi>turn away reproach from</hi>

better acceptance with them. And them, who thus la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to honour God with the <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>respect,</hi> which he vouch safes them from others, he will surely <hi>honour</hi> with men (so far as is meet) and with himself for ever. Whereas the vaynglorious, and ambitious, that eyther seek <hi>honour</hi> above their desert, or onely thereby to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance themselvs, and theirs, above other men; they lift up themselvs against God, and climbe higher, then that the bow will bear them: and God, first or last, will throw them down into perdition.</p>
               <p>And whereas God would have us seek <hi>good name,</hi> &amp; <hi>fame</hi> by well doing; if any seek it by evill, (as in evill times, and companyes too many do, as <hi>Austin</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth<note place="margin">Austin.</note> of himself, that in the dayes of his vanitie, he oft did evill, <hi>not onely in lust of the thing, but for prayse by it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his consorts;</hi> and sometimes also <hi>slaundered himself with the evils, which he had not done, lest seeming more chast he should be more contemptible then the rest</hi>) such do no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then set the divell in Gods place, and <hi>glory in their</hi>

               <p>As the whitenes of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> teeth is the more remarqueable by reason of the blacknes of his whole body: so are the few vertuous doings of some persons the more noted; and they the more <hi>famous</hi> for the same; by reason of their contrarie course in evill. Things eyther rare in themselvs, or not expected from such or such persons, are most observed: so are the commendable actions, in them, whose ordinarie course in evill gives men litle cause to look for better. And by this means it comes to passe, that divers (specially great men, who have many trumpetters of their few vertues, and scarse any that dare so much as see their vices) get often times a greater name of just, mercifull, and pious, for some one, or a few works of those kyndes (like the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> teeth;) though in a course of injustice, and impietie; then many others do by the constant practise of those, and other vertues.</p>

                  <hi>is hard to be born eyther by wise or good men,</hi> how mean otherwise soever. Even the worm being troden upon will turn again: neyther can any esteem eyther so highly of another, or so meanly of himself, as to think he deservs to be <hi>contemned</hi> by him. And therefore <hi>Ionathan,</hi> though<note place="margin">1 Sam. 20.</note> both wise, godly, and humble-mynded, being <hi>reviled</hi> by king <hi>Saul</hi> his father, scarse kept himself within the bounds of due respect eyther to a Father, or king. <hi>Many,</hi> sayth one,<note place="margin">Ambrose.</note> 
                  <hi>can better endure paynfull stripes, then contumelious words.</hi> And hence it is, that povertie is more greivous unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny then other ordinarie crosses, because it brings with it more <hi>contempt</hi> in the eyes of others. Now, although the fear of God in a person, should, in all equitie, procure him honour, and respect from all: yet as the phylosopher ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, in his time, <hi>Wouldst thou take up the study of wisdom, prepare thy self to become a laughing stock to many,</hi> &amp;c. so in<note place="margin">Epictetus.</note> ours, and all ages, must Gods most faythfull servants much more arm themselvs against <hi>contemptuous,</hi> and <hi>contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> caryages by many; if against any other temptation: following therein the Holy Apostle, who <hi>approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>

               <p>Many buy at a dear rate the use of a few <hi>contemptuous</hi> speaches, and that not onely at the hands of superiours, and equals; but oft times, of meaner persons, then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs: with whom they loose more love, and respect by one <hi>contumelious</hi> passion, then they can recover by many freindly actions. Yea men (so impatient are all of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi>) are better satisfied and contented with a respective denyall of a benefit, then with a <hi>contumelious</hi> graunt of it; yea, I add further, with a playn injurie of some kinde, then with a favour so sauced: because in some injuries persons are thought worthy to be mynded, though not for good towards them: in the other case, worthy to <hi>be despised,</hi> even by them from whom they receav good.</p>

               <p>Considering how greivous a thing, and hard to be born <hi>contempt</hi> is; it is wisdom in a man, not easily to think himself <hi>despised</hi> by others; and that even for his own peace.

For though it be best of all, to judg of others just as they are: yet seeing, that is alwayes hard, and sometimes impossible; we shall lesse offend God in judging of men too well (though sometimes to our own damage) then too ill, with certain injurie to them, and sin in our selvs, in the violation of<note place="margin">1 Corin. 13.</note> the law of <hi>charitie,</hi> which <hi>is not suspicious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The generall cause of <hi>suspicion</hi> is the want of this true <hi>love,</hi> whose propertie is to <hi>beleev all things,</hi> and to <hi>hope all things,</hi> which with reason, can be beleeved, or hoped for: and so men are in danger to presume of, and promise to themselvs more good of their wives, and children, and friends, whom they entirely love, then there is cause; ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then otherwise. Notwithstanding, a very inordinate, and doating affection also breeds causlesse <hi>jealousie.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generall cause of <hi>suspicion</hi> is the knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousnes which persons have of their own inability, and weaknes any way. Of beasts, and birds, hares and doves, and such impotent, and unarmed creatures; and of men &amp; women; the childish; weak, silly, and decrepit are most given to <hi>suspicion,</hi> as being most subject to be circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or oppressed. So it hath been observed, how the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, and other barbarous nations</hi> have laboured to supply<note place="margin">Bodin.</note> their defects of wisdom for prevention of hurt from ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, by excesse of <hi>suspicion.</hi> It is true, that this disease sometimes befals very wise men: But this aryseth from an other, and worse cause, to wit, an evill conscience. <hi>Men muse, as they use:</hi> and <hi>suspect</hi> others by themselvs: as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with all leaud persons. <hi>He that is good himself, doth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chrisost.</note> 
                  <hi>not easily suspect an other to be evill: nor the evill, that an other</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:11142:119"/>
                  <hi>is good.</hi> Besides, an evill conscience accusing men, and women, that they in truth deserv not love, nor respect, nor credit, easily perswades them, that they are not loved, nor respected, nor credited by others. Lastly, it is oftens a punishment from God, that as a man in debt, <hi>suspects</hi> that every bush which he sees, is a sargeant to arrest him; so they which are without true grace, and assurance of the pardon of their sinns from him, should be <hi>suspicious,</hi> that every one would deceav, or hurt them otherwise. It was Gods curse upon <hi>Cain, when he had killed his brother Abel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> to <hi>suspect,</hi> and fear, <hi>that every one that he mett with, would kill him.</hi> Notwithstanding all these things; sometimes <hi>God sends a spirit of jealousie upon interessed persons,</hi> for the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie<note place="margin">Numb. 5.</note> of evils in others formerly hidden; which out of probable <hi>suspicion</hi> come to be searched into, and by search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are found out. And alwaies we must strive for that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and wisdom, as not to take our marks amisse, by censuring any rashly, as <hi>Eli did Hannah for druncken, because her lips went, and her voice was not heard:</hi> nor yet to be so fondly charitable, as not to see the spots of mens leprosie breaking out in their foreheads.</p>
               <p>We are not onely by innocencie to prevent just blame; but withall, by christian care, and wisdom, to provide that we hurt not our good name by coming under colourable <hi>suspicion</hi> of evill. We <hi>provide things honest</hi> before God by preserving innocency: but <hi>before men,</hi> by giving no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable cause of their <hi>suspecting</hi> us. And so doing, if yet God by his providence, so order, that we come under it; we must bear it patiently, as a burden layd upon us by him; eyther to prove us; as it was not the least tryall upon <hi>Iob,</hi> to be <hi>suspected</hi> by his freinds, and others, of hypocrisy: or, it may be, to warn us to take heed of some sin, of which we are in danger, though not guiltie: it may be, for our

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the royall prerogative of Gods infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wisdom to judg of persons, &amp; things, as, in truth, they are. It is mens, yea angels unperfit condition, in comparison, (under which God hath humbled them) to judg of the one, and other, according to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>appearances;</hi> leaving to him alone and the persons themselvs, the hidden things of the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>. To <hi>appear</hi> evill to a righteous judgment, is alwaies evill, whether the person be evill, or good. If evill, his evill <hi>appearance</hi> is but his inward evil manifested to be, as it is; and his inside tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned outward: If good; he slaunders himself in <hi>appearing</hi> evill. He that makes an ill <hi>shew,</hi> we may well account evil, and corrupt, ordinarily; seeing all (save in the case of some speciall temptation) desire to seem, as good, as they are, &amp; to put the fayrest side outward.</p>
               <p>He that is once well known to me for good, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous I will alwayes esteem so, except I come to take cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn knowledg of his after-declyning to evill. So, on the contrarie, if I have once rightly and certeynly branded a
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:11142:120"/>
man for evil, I shall not easily come to think good of him, except his after-repentance as playnly <hi>appear</hi> to me. The reason is, because bare time makes none of evill good; or of good evill: but onely confirms men in that which they are, whether the one, or other.</p>
               <p>Although it be not simply a sufficient warrant for our answerable judgment of, or caryage towards persons, or things, that they <hi>appear</hi> good or evill unto us; because we often err in our judgments about them, through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, negligence, or partialitie: yet is it a certeyn rule, that we must never proceed, eyther in judgment, or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise against <hi>appearances:</hi> for in so doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we condemn our selvs in the thing, which we approve; if it <hi>appear</hi> good, and yet we condemn it: so do we also in the thing which we condemn; by holding any course of approbation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that, which <hi>seems</hi> evill unto us. Notwithstanding, such is the force of outward <hi>appearances,</hi> as that, in cases, they bynde us in conscience, both for judgment, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, to that which indeed is not true, nor due; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are altogether deceaved. As when we receav a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for truth (which yet indeed is not so) upon the clear testimonie of two, or three witnesses worthy of credit, so far as we can discern: or when we esteem an hypocrite (cunningly dissembling) for good and godly, as did <hi>Phillip</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> It is a fortunate sin to suspect him, without <hi>apparent</hi> cause, that dissembles: and an infortunate vertue to be deceaved in him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>appearance of evill</hi> (by the Apostles prescript) <hi>is to be absteyned from.</hi> Which yet we must not understand ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5.</note> of whatsoever <hi>seems</hi> evill unto others: for then we should absteyn from all, or the most good; whereof there is litle, but some, or other misdeem it. But the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is properly, that, in <hi>prophesying</hi> (of which the Apostle
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:11142:120"/>
speaks) as we are to <hi>hold that which is good, and proved so to be;</hi> so <hi>if any thing be delivered, of which we have a sinister</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> 
                  <hi>suspicion, as fearing that some poyson cleaveth to it, though not plainly so discerned by us, we with-hold our assent, till by fayth we can receav it.</hi> And in the generall, that, if a thing <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> amisse, and evill unto others, especially unto wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker brethren, though it be not such of it self, yet we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear it; except eyther conscience of duety simply binde us unto it; or that some greater conveniency appear in doing it, then is the inconveniency of, or to others, in miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaving of us, and our doings.</p>
               <p>If it be a good thing to <hi>appear</hi> good, how much more to be so indeed? It is also the readiest way, and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious for any to <hi>appear,</hi> and be thought wise, vertuous, or godly; to be, in truth, such. For God will both (so far, as it stands with his glory, and the persons good) give occasion of manifestation of that good which is; and also provide, that others may accordingly take knowledg of it. And though many things be secret in the mean while; yet, <hi>when the Lord shall come, he will both bring to light the</hi>

                  <hi>hidden things of darknes, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then shall everie one have prayse of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord bestoweth his graces upon men not onely for their own good, but for the good of others also: and that, as otherwise, so for the <hi>manifesting, and shewing forth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>the vertues of him, who hath called them out of darknes, into his marveylous light.</hi> Who must therefore provide careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both to be, as they <hi>appear,</hi> for their own comfort; and to <hi>appear,</hi> as they are, to the glory of God, and good of men. Yet so as their first, and greatest care herein be, that their <hi>appearances</hi> be not above their existences; and that they make shew of no more then they have. As in the outward estate, it is the high way to povertie, or worse,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:11142:121"/>
for a mans expences to exceed his receipts; &amp; his lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out his comings in: so in the spirituall course, to overstreyn in outward <hi>manifestations</hi> is a way tending to all impudent, and desperate hypocrisie, under <hi>a form of godlynes, without the power thereof.</hi> And for other gifts, as knowledg, wisdom, learning, eloquence, or the like; he that in the <hi>manifestation</hi> of them will streyn above his reach, may easily crack his credit, and make himself ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to others; like the stage-player, who with too much wypeing of his borrowed beard puls it from his face, and so bewrayes his bare chin. And though a forth-putting man play his part so well (as many do) that he not onely satisfy, but draw into admiration his simple spectators, who cannot discern between sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and body; yet shall he hardly, or not at all, escape the censure of vayn-glorious, and arrogant, by more judicious men.</p>
               <p>We are oftens angry, and offended at others, for wronging us, by conceaving a worse opinion of us, then we deserv: whereas, in right, we should be angry at our selvs, for giving them occasion so to judg, by our ill, and suspicious <hi>appearances.</hi> For, albeit thereby, he, whose heart, and way is upright in Gods sight, loose not his comfort with him, who sees the heart: yet by his <hi>misappearances</hi> made in word, or deed, he may justly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyt his credit with men; to whom it apperteyns to judg of the tree by the fruit, or leavs, or any other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mark, or note, rayther then by the sap.

               <p>Some have thought it a wise Christian course in the confession of our secret sius, resydeing in the heart, unto God, not to use the outward voyce, for fear of acquainting Sathan with them thereby, and so of advantageing him <hi>to tempt us, by applying himself to that, wherein he seeth us likest</hi>

               <p>Christ our Lord teaching us to pray, that God would <hi>not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evill one,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> would warn us not to lead our selvs into <hi>temptations,</hi> nor to deliver our souls into Sathans hands: which yet we do by affecting familiaritie with wicked men, which are as it were his brokers; by omitting duties of religion publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or privately, or doing them unfruitfully; by neglecting our speciall callings, and doing nothing, and thereby give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him opportunitie to <hi>tempt</hi> us to do evill; and lastly, by opening too wide the windows of our outward senses towards allureing objects. By these means we not onely <hi>tempt</hi> God to leav us; but the divell, after a sort, to <hi>tempt</hi>

               <p>The larger <hi>conscience</hi> the better, if rightly informed. To know that to be lawfull for me, which indeed is lawfull, is the perfection of understanding, and <hi>strength</hi> of <hi>fayth:</hi>

Some things are so commaunded, as they absolutely bynde <hi>conscience,</hi> as to love God and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, &amp;c. Some things again are so commanded in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:11142:127"/>
as for example, the obedience of the Magistrate, keeping peace with all men, and the like, as yet they have this particular exception. <hi>If we can without sinning on our parts:</hi> for we must not do evill that we may do good. But yet in these cases we are to be as large, as we can, and to go as far, as possibly we can see it lawfull, in <hi>conscience</hi> of the commandement of God. Other things are in their kinde indifferent, and such as we perform for our profit, pleasure, credit, or other worldly commoditie. In these we are to use lesse liberrie of <hi>conscience,</hi> and to take heed that we give not the divell advantage, by some blast of temptation, or other, to blow us into the ditch, if we go to near the side of it. And in observing this difference, we have a <hi>conscionable</hi> use of our <hi>conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a great question, whether an erroneous <hi>conscience</hi> be to be followed, or no: and as ill resolved by many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively, after much dispute. Not to follow it is evill, and to do, or leav undone that wherein the man so doing, or not doing, condemns himself; and therein hath God also condemning him: To follow it, is for the blinde to follow the blinde (the blinde person his blinde <hi>conscience</hi>) into the ditch; and to have God condemning him in his word, though he justifie himself. Besides then the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>conscience,</hi> which is alwayes evill, and a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>path on the left hand; and the following it in evill, as a by-path on the right (which is sometimes worse, then the former, as in sins against the light of nature;) there is a third, and midle way, safe and good; and that is, the informing of the <hi>conscience</hi> better by Gods word, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it accordingly; unto which also every person is bound, for the duties of his generall, and speciall calling. It is the first dutie of a man to inform his <hi>conscience</hi> aright; and then to follow the direction which it gives.</p>

                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:11142:127"/>A good <hi>conscience</hi> is as the ship, in which fayth sayleth to heaven: and which they that <hi>put away, make shipwrack</hi>

And if it so fall out, that by one and the same thing Gods cause, and our own profit, credit, or other worldly advantage be promoted; we had need keep a jealous eye over our selvs, that we serv not our turn on God, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his ends, as it were, a bridg to our own, as <hi>Iehu</hi> did. Secondly, as the fire of the altar came from heaven; so must our coal of <hi>zeal</hi> be fetched thence, as being the work of Gods spirit in our hearts, in the use of prayer, meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the word of God read, and heard, the examples of others godly (as it were, ryding in the <hi>fierie chariot of Elyas</hi>) and the like holy means; by which this divine fire is kindled, and nourished in mens breasts.

And amongst other circumstances we must be carefull so far to have respect to that of persons, as to hate evill most in them whose persons we most love; and so in our wives, children, and friends, more then in stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and in our selvs most of all. And he that hath not

Yea further, as <hi>Iacob</hi> (though for his fathers bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing he covered his hands, and neck very cunningly) was bewrayed by his tongue and voyce: so, hardly can a <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeyt</hi> carry his matters so close, but that oft times, even in one and the same work, there will be found a jarr of the parts one with another; so as eyther the tongue will check the hands, or the hands the tongue, or both mutually; to the shewing, and shaming of all.</p>
               <p>When great <hi>hypocrites,</hi> and deep <hi>dissemblers</hi> are left of God to fall into any grosse, or scandalous evill, they sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or never recover their former shew of religion: <hi>ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (as one sayth) <hi>will the lambs skin, which the wolf wears, being once shorn, ever grow agayn:</hi> but God in judgment leaving them in some speciall temptation to grosse wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, in which they loose their credit in the world, which alone they sought, and so break the hedg which formerly restreyned them, doth punish their former close <hi>dissimulation</hi> with after open profanenes. Young <hi>hypocrites</hi> commonly prove old Atheists.</p>
               <p>It may well be sayd, as it is in the Proverb, that, <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie is spun with a fine thread:</hi> considering how <hi>hypocrites</hi> deceav, and over-reach others; and oft times, weaker per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons those that are wiser then they; how much more, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, how thereby they deceav themselvs. In which latter there is a transgression and evill both in deceaving, and being deceaved. For albeit a man may often without sin be deceaved by another; yet never so by himself: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the spirit of a man</hi> may (if it <hi>do</hi> not) alwayes <hi>know the</hi>

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:11142:135"/>
or from slouth, that they will not take the payns; or from an evill conscience, that they dare not trye, and examine themselvs, and their works, and estates with God, as they ought. Besides <hi>hypocrites</hi> by false appearances getting cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with others, come to <hi>esteem themselvs better then they</hi>

                  <hi>are, because others esteem them so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>hypocrisie</hi> is indeed not onely a base, but a foolish evill. Base in <hi>dissembling</hi> the evill, which it hath, and is ashamed of: and in <hi>counterfeyting</hi> the good, which it hath not, and is ashamed to seem to want: And therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably proud people (scorning, as they use to boast, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble) seldom come under this coat; but do usually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to men, as voyd of grace and goodnes, as they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. Foolish it is, if in nothing els, yet in covering from men that evill, which God seeth, and hateth, and will punish with infinitely greater both losse, and shame, and torment, then any, or all men will, or can: and not onely the evill <hi>dissembled,</hi> but therewith the <hi>dissimulation</hi> also: which men legally do not.

               </p>
               <p>It is one thing to doe a work in <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>hypocrites</hi> doe; and an other thing to do it with <hi>hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;</hi> which is still ready, alasse, to mingle it self with the work of Gods grace in all our best actions; as <hi>Tobyah,</hi> and the rest of the heathen would have mingled themselvs with the Lords people <hi>in the building of his temple.</hi> The same may be sayd of unbelief, indevotion, &amp; the like cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</p>
               <p>It is no marvayl, that Atheist, and Epicures judg all that make shew of pietie and godlynes (specially above the size, &amp; custome of the times) conceipted, fantasticall, and very
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:11142:135"/>
                  <hi>hypocrites;</hi> seeing they measure others by themselvs: And knowing, that if they should make the semblance of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, which the others do, it should be no better in them, then <hi>hypocrisy,</hi> and fancie; they conclude the same round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon others, from their own premises. And of this they are also desirous to perswade both themselvs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Themselvs, for a kinde of envious comfort in evill, that others are as ill as they; and for their own hardning out of that imagination: Others, for their miserable cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, when they are not thought leaud alone. They being themselvs <hi>Sad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cees,</hi> would fayn think others, &amp; have them thought <hi>Pharisees</hi> by others. A tang of this also is to be found even in them, who are not voyd of all goodnes, towards such, as a litle overstep them in the wayes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>hypocrisie</hi> be in it self a verie odious thing, and so evill as it corrupts all good in him, in whom it reigns; making both his works of devotion, and of mercy abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to the Lord: yet considering how litle true good is in the world; it were well (for others, at least) that there were more <hi>hypocrisie</hi> in many, then there is. Which would help both to represse in them many grosse enormities, for shame, and to keep credit with men; which now shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly they practise: and also provoke them to many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good works (for the good of others at the least) which now they wholy, and boldly neglect in professed godlesnes, and dishonesty.</p>
               <p>Besides, <hi>hypocrisie</hi> yeilds, though it intend it not, a full and loud testimonie to true vertue and godlines: seeing no man ordinarily desires to seem but good. Now if it be a thing so desireable, even by their testimonie, who want goodnes, to appear good; how much more to be so in deed: what is the emptie shadow to the solid body? To
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:11142:136"/>
shut up this Head: As the shadow follows the body, so doth the name, and fame of good; true goodnes, with equally-mynded men. And in stead of a thousand compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of devise which men fetch about to obteyn the name of good, and vertuous, this one short, and right-on way of being good indeed would serv the turn for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureing it from all indifferent, and wise judges. <hi>The most compendious way to</hi> this <hi>honour is, that in truth a man be, as</hi>

And look what recompence of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or other reward, this playn, and homely <hi>uprightnes</hi> (which of all other vertues <hi>Laudatur, &amp; alget</hi>) is denyed from men; God who seeth, and loveth it, will plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously supply. <hi>Blessed are the perfit in way: who walk in the</hi>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:11142:136"/>
yea the greatest; yea the onely evill indeed. <hi>Sin</hi> is worse then the divell, as having made him evill, whom God made good: yea then all <hi>punishments,</hi> yea then hell it self, which God <hi>prepared,</hi> and made (and is therefore<note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> good) to <hi>punish sin, and sinners</hi> by.

               <p>This <hi>sin</hi> is incident onely to reasonable creatures: God the creator being above <hi>sin;</hi> and unreasonable creatures beneath it. For the disorders in bruit beasts; they are <hi>not</hi>

               <p>Although <hi>sin</hi> be onely in reasonable creatures, yet is it a most unreasonable thing: otherwise it were not <hi>sin,</hi> save as it crosses true reason, eyther by lust against reason, or shew of reason against truth.

               </p>
               <p>All <hi>sins,</hi> save that first of <hi>Adam,</hi> and mens very last, are both <hi>sins</hi> in themselvs, and effects of former <hi>sin,</hi> and causes

of latter: and that not onely by Gods just, though severe judgment, in punishing one by another; but oft times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by a kinde of naturall, and necessarie coherence, and affinitie. Sometimes one <hi>sin</hi> brings on an other by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking unto it, as rash <hi>anger</hi> unto <hi>strife:</hi> sometimes to<note place="margin">Prov. 15.

                  <note place="margin">Math. 14.</note> And of these commonly a lesser draws on a greater, as lesser sticks set the greater on fire. So also by those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>iniquitie</hi> do men proceed in one and the same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>enormitie:</hi> in which, as in a chayn drawing from heaven to hell, each link moveth his next, from the one, and smaller end, to the other greater. First, there is in a man <hi>concupiscence,</hi> by which he <hi>is drawn away</hi> from God,<note place="margin">Iames 1.</note> unto whom he ought to cleave with the whole heart. And having once let goe his hold on him, the true, and unchangeable good; he is forthwith seazed by some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and counterfeyt good, and thereby <hi>entised;</hi> as the byrd by falling on the ground is taken in the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Vpon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled affection, and deceaved judgment thereby, comes consent of will to have, or do the thing which is <hi>evill,</hi> called by the Apostle the <hi>conception of lust:</hi> which that it may <hi>bring forth sin</hi> in outward act, and exequution, wants nothing but opportunitie. This <hi>sin perfited</hi> by a continued course therein without repentance, <hi>brings forth death</hi> una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydably. He therefore that begins to do evill, or to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake that which is good, in the affection of his heart, is like him that puts his feet into a pit, and lets the hold of

his hands go: and without Gods gratious hand catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of him, can never stay, till he come to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the pit of perdition. And no marvayl of this progresse in evill; seeing everie <hi>sin</hi> (how small soever in degree) hath joyned with it the contempt of God. As therefore the safest way against the flame is to quench the spark, by which it may be kindled; so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this fire of hell, to quench betymes the spark of concupiscence, and lust. This is done partly by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from it the occasions, and incitements of, and unto <hi>sin;</hi> which are as fewell for nourishing it: as if it be the lust of anger, and revenge; <hi>not to give ear to</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>VR <hi>affections,</hi> as love, sorrow, fear, and the rest, are common to us with bruit beasts; which therefore the understanding must order, that they be not bruiteish; and with them, the will, for its yeilding of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to their motions, or withholding it from them. But as the litle sticks set the greater wood a burning: so do they most what set the understanding, and will aworking in sensuall objects. For example. One sees a naturally pleasing good thing, but belonging to another, or not to him, as <hi>Achans wedg of gold:</hi> His <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of love, and appetite is inordinately caryed unto it; and is ready to sollicit the will to consent to the getting, and enjoying of it. But now, if the understanding do its dutie, it steps in, represseth the <hi>affection,</hi> and restreyneth the will, by discerning, and discovering, that the good thing desyred is anothers, and therefore not to be desyred, or had by him. But as the fumes arysing from a corrupt stomack darken, and dim the bodily eyes: so in sensuall persons the understanding is commonly (besides its own
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:11142:141"/>
inherent blyndnes) so corrupted with partiall, and brutish <hi>affections,</hi> as that it neglecteth all due search, and disquisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and unadvisedly judgeth that good, which is pleasing to appetite, and sense: and so being sweyed, and led by the <hi>affections,</hi> as a foolish waggoner by his horses, draws with it the wils consent; which obteyned, the evill is done in Gods account, and wants onely opportunitie for outward effect.</p>
               <p>Although the seat of the <hi>affections</hi> be the soul, whose motions they are, and not the bodyes: yet do they more or lesse vehemently, and efficatiously act, and exercise themselvs, as the blood, and spirits, (the souls immediate instruments) are more, or lesse fitted to their hand. Hence is it, that anger in the heart moved by some occasion, is so vehement in a cholerick body; sorrow, or fear in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick; and so for the rest.</p>
               <p>These our <hi>affections</hi> are eyther merely naturall in us; or sanctifyed by grace; or morally corrupt, and inordinate. <hi>Nature</hi> (and so naturall <hi>affections) is content with a litle:</hi> corruption not with a great deal: as the thirst, which is naturall, is quenched with a draught, or two; but that which is unnaturall, and agueish, not with a whole vessell of drink. This and the reason of it he layes down wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, that sayth, <hi>Naturall desires are finite, but those arysing from false opinion have no limits: as he that goes his right</hi>

                  <hi>way, hath some end of his journey; he that wanders, none.</hi> And as for sanctified <hi>affections,</hi> they, alasse, are too feeble in us: and as <hi>Iehu</hi> was known by his <hi>furtous marching;</hi> so may they be, by their soft, and lazy pace: neyther, if they were excessive, were they sanctified, that is, directed by grace, and good reason: nor are they easily so, if they be any thing vehement; but have commonly too much flesh mingled with them. And no marvayl: for <hi>setting our</hi>

                  <hi>affections above, where Christ is,</hi> and whither the spirit of<note place="margin">Colos. 3.</note> grace advanceth them, we clime up the hill, and withall draw after us the clog of our <hi>flesh, lusting the contrarie</hi> way:<note place="margin">Galat. 5.</note> whereas sensuall men led by their <hi>lusts,</hi> goe down the hill, and are caryed headlong to evill. Besides, sensuall objects are present to the outward senses, by which the <hi>affections</hi> are moved: but things spirituall <hi>are seen a far of,</hi> as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.</note> the direction and discourse of fayth for provokeing of <hi>affection</hi> unto them; which makes their work in this case more weak and slow. Yet being created faculties, they are the greater the better, if rightly ordered. And so it is not unbrobably sayd by some, that Christ had the greatest fear, sorrow, anger &amp;c. upon him, that ever man had, or could have. But as the stronger the horses in the waggon are,<note place="margin">Plato. Lacta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And as for violent, and inordinate <hi>affections;</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, in whom they are found, how wise, or wel meaning soever otherwise, or howsoever bent upon some good course, is no more to be trusted to; then the charyot drawn by unbroken horses, going, for the present, quietly on, and in a good way, but which will quickly take a toy, and indanger the overthrow of all.</p>
               <p>As in a tempestuous sea, the waves, in the same place, are sometimes lifted up; and the depths, at other times, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed: so in an unmortifyed, and <hi>passionate</hi> heart, one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, &amp; inordinate <hi>passion</hi> often breaks into the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as evill, and inordinate, as it: as did <hi>Ammons</hi> inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>love to his sister Thamar</hi> into as excessive <hi>hatred.</hi> So<note place="margin">2 Sam. 13.</note> some of extreamly prodigall become extreamly covetous; of credulous, suspitious; of mad-merry, sad without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:11142:142"/>
lore of reason, or conscience; but caryed headlong by pangs of <hi>passion;</hi> and withall <hi>driven by the divell,</hi> and so must <hi>needs go,</hi> and <hi>run</hi> too; though up, and down the same way; and forward, and backward, after his will.</p>
               <p>As in a fish-pond some one great pike devours both the lesser fish of other kindes, and of its own also; so in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, some one <hi>affection</hi> is so predominate, as it eats up not onely reason, and conscience, but with them, almost all other <hi>affections.</hi> Many are so sowred with discontentment, and sorrow; that they appear to have place left for nothing els in their heart: some are set upon so merry a pin, as if they had the image of laughter which <hi>Licurgus</hi> set up for the Lacedemonians ever before them. Others again are so overgrown with anger; as they seem to have no blood but choller running in their veyns. If any danger be come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards them, (which all reason would teach them to fear specially) they will pick a quarrell at something in, or about it, to set anger, and indignation awork.

as God offers him: and so for other <hi>passions</hi> of the minde. Or if the stream of the affection happ to run so strong, as that we can not well turn it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; it is wisdom to get it upon some such object in the same way, as wherein it may freely take its scope: as the horse that can not be stayed, yet may be guided into such a way, as in which there is no great danger, how fast soever he runs; which may also be so heavie, as will keep him from running fast in it.</p>
               <p>Thus, if sorrow, fear, or anger be like to work inordinately in us, let us set them upon our sins; and so the danger of all excesse will soon be over, for the most part.

But afterwards, when they come to riper years, good fathers are more behooffull for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in vertue, and good manners, by their greater wisdom and authoritie: and oft times also, <hi>by correcting the fruits of their mothers indulgencie, by their severitie.</hi>

               <p>They are a blessing great, but dangerous. They come into the world at first with danger both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of themselvs, as passing sometimes, from the womb to the grave; sometimes being born deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in body, sometimes uncapable of understanding: as also in regard of the Mother; the first day of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world being oftens her last in it. After their coming into the world through so many dangers, they come even into a world of dangers. In their infancie, how soon is the tender bud nipped or bruised by sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or otherwise? In their ventersom dayes, into how many needles dangers do they throw themselvs (in which many perish) besides those into which God brings them, and that all their life long? Above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how great, and many are their spirituall dangers both for nourishing, and encreasing the corruption which they bring into the world with them; and for diverting them from all goodnes, which Gods grace,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:11142:158"/>
and mens endeavour might work in them? These dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and difficulties, howsoever they make not Gods blessings in giving <hi>children</hi> to be no blessings; or deserving to be lightly esteemed; yet should they moderate our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of them, and greif for their want: that none should say eyther to God, or one to another, as <hi>Rahell</hi> did to <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob, Give me children, or els I dye:</hi> specially if we weigh<note place="margin">Gen. 30.</note> withall, that though the Lord give us divers towardly, &amp; good; yet one, or two proving leaud, and wicked will break our tender hearts more, then all the rest will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us: like as in the naturall body there is more greif by the akeing of some one part, though but a tooth; then comfort, and ease in the good, and sound state of all the rest. If <hi>children</hi> considered aright of the carefull thoughts, sorrows, and fears, and, sore peyns withall of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, they would think they ought them more honour, service, and obedience, then, for the most part, they do. We seldom consider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and prize worthily the cares, and peyns of parents, till we become parents our selvs, and learn them by experience.</p>
               <p>Many bodily diseases are hereditarie; and so are many spirituall, in a sort; and that both by naturall inclination, and morall imitation much more: that, as the Lord sayth<note place="margin">Ezec. 16.</note> of <hi>Israell, Thou art thy mothers daughter,</hi> so may it be sayd of many, that they are their fathers and mothers <hi>sons, and daughters</hi> in evill. Yet, if it so come to passe, that God vouchsafe grace to the <hi>childe of a wicked father,</hi> and that <hi>he see the sins which he hath done:</hi> he commonly hates them more vehemently, then if they had been in a stranger: and good reason, considering how they have been his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest parents ruine. Yea further, even where grace is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>child,</hi> oft tymes, by observing, and sometimes by feeling also the evils of his fathers sin, is driven though
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:11142:159"/>
not from his evill way into a good way, yet into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary evill. Thus a covetous father oftens makes a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall <hi>son;</hi> so doth a prodigall a covetous. The <hi>son</hi> of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touse takeing knowledg how odious his fathers covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is to all; and therewith perswading himself, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perswaded by others about him, that there is enough, and, more then enough for him; takes occasion as prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally to pour our, as his father hath mizerly hoarded up: as on the contrarie, the <hi>son</hi> of the prodigall both seeing, &amp; feeling the hurt of his parents lavishnes, is thereby provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to lay the harder about him, for the repayring of his fathers ruines.</p>

                  <hi>Love rayther descends, then ascends;</hi> as streams of water do: and no marvayl, if <hi>men love where they live,</hi> as parents doe in <hi>children,</hi> and not they in them. Hence also is it, that grandfathers are more affectionate towards their <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens children,</hi> then to their immediates; as seeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs further propagated in them, and by their means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding on to a further degree of eternity; which all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire naturally, if not in themselvs, yet in their posteritie. And hence it is, that <hi>children</hi> brought up with their grandfathers, or grandmothers, seldom do well; but are usually corrupted by their too great indulgencie.</p>
               <p>It is much controverted, whether it be better, in the generall, to <hi>bring up children</hi> under the severitie of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the rod; or no. And the wisdom of the flesh out of love to its own, alleges many reasons to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: But say men what they will, or can, the wisdom of God is best; and that sayth, that <hi>foolishnes is bound up in the heart of a child, which the rod of correction must drive out:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 22.

of minde arising from naturall pride, which must, in the first place, be broken, and beaten down; that so the foundation of their <hi>education</hi> being layd in humilitie, and tractablenes, other vertues may, in their time, be built thereon.

               <p>For the beating, and keeping down of this stubbornnes parents must provide carefully for two things: First that <hi>childrens</hi> wils, and wilfulnes be restreyned, &amp; repressed, and that in time; lest sooner then they imagine, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:11142:160"/>
sprigs grow to that stiftnes, that they will <hi>rayther break then bow. Children</hi> should not know (if it could be kept from them) that they have a will in their own, but in their parents keeping: neyther should these words be heard from them, save by way of consent, <hi>I will,</hi> or <hi>I will not.</hi> And if will be suffered at first to swey in them in small, and lawfull things, they wil hardly after be restrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in great, and ill matters, which their partiall conceipt, and inexperienced <hi>youth</hi> with the lusts thereof, and desire of libertie, shall deem small, and lawfull, as the former. And though good <hi>education,</hi> specially the grace of God may afterwards purge out much other evill, and weaken this also: yet will such unbroken <hi>youth</hi> most commonly draw after it great disquietnes in crosses, when they fall; and in the whole course of life, a kinde of unweyldines, inflexibilitie, and obstinacie, prejudiciall to the partyes themselvs, and uncomfortable (at least) to such as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with them. The second help is an inureing of them from the first, to such a meannes in all things, as may rayther pluck them down, then lift them up: as by plain, and homely dyet, and apparrel; sending them to school betimes; and bestowing them afterwards, as they are fit, in some course of life, in which they may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised diligently, and the same rayther under then above their estate: by not abetting them one against another, nor against any, (specially before their faces) without great cause: nor by makeing them men, and women, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they become good boyes, and girls. How oft have I observed, that parents, who have neyther fayled in dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent instructing of their <hi>children,</hi> nor in giving them good example, nor in correcting them duely, have onely by streyning too high this way, eyther endangered, or utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overthrown their <hi>posteritie?</hi> hereby lifting them up in

their vayn hearts, and teaching them to despise both mean things, and persons; and themselvs also, many times, amongst others: thereby drowning them (<hi>Icarus</hi> like) in a sea of mischeif, and misery, by their flying too high a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And this must be the more mynded, because there is in men an inbred desire, and that inordinate usually, to hoyse up their <hi>children,</hi> as high, as may be: so as they half think they do them wrong, if they set them not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or as high, at least, as themselvs; almost whether God will, or no. Yea what place affoards not some such, as make themselvs their <hi>childrens</hi> slaves; not careing how basely they themselvs grovell in the earth, so they may set them on their tiptoes?</p>
               <p>But first of all for <hi>childrens</hi> competent education, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for their disposeing in some particular course (on which all are to settle at last, though some libertie of step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping this way, or that be given them for a while; as <hi>a man</hi>

The difficultie aryseth from the partiality of parents towards their own: for that, as <hi>the crow thinks her own bird fayrest,</hi> so do they commonly their <hi>children</hi> towardlyer, and better then they are, or then any other indifferent judg doth.

And yet is the knowledg of this so necessarie, that we build not eyther upon a vain, or uncerteyn foundation, with great hazzard of losse, both of labour, and expence, in sorting our <hi>childe</hi> to his particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and course of life; as all without it, is but a verie rash adventure. For as none is fit for everie course, nor hardly any for many, in any great degree; so everie one is fit for one, or other: to which if his ability, and disposition be applyed, with any convenient diligence on his part, and helps by others; he may easily come to a mediocritie therein, if not to some rarenes. Hence was it, that fathers in some places, used to lead their <hi>children</hi> to the shops of all kinde of artificers, to try how they could both handle their tools, &amp; like their works; that so they might bestow them accordingly. Some wise men also have wished, that there might be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, by publique authoritie, a course for the due try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and <hi>choyce of wits</hi> for severall sciences. And surely, where there goes not before a naturall aptnes (and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall disposition also for some callings); there will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low nothing but losse: losse of time, losse of labour, losse of charges, and all; as when the seed is cast into the barren ground.

               <p>There is running in the breasts of most <hi>parents</hi> a strong stream of partiall affection towards some one, or other of their <hi>children,</hi> above the rest, eyther for its beautie, or wit, or likenes to themselvs, or some other fancyed good in it; which is alwayes dangerous; and

oft hurtfull. Sometimes the Lord takes away such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rest, to punish the fathers fondnes: And most commonly such if surviveing, prove the worst of all the rest, as growing hereby proud, and arrogant in themselvs, presumptuous upon their fathers love, and contemptuous of the rest of their brethren, and sisters; as we may see in <hi>Esau, Absolom,</hi> and <hi>Adoniah,</hi> their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers darlings; and in many mo, in our dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And though they in themselvs (which they sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are free from) be not corrupted with pride; yet will the rest seldom, or never escape the infection of envy at it; as is to be seen in <hi>Iosephs brethren.</hi> It is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for parents tenderly to love all their <hi>children;</hi> and best for them to be as equall towards all, as may be, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the bestowing of their best and greatest love, till they see, where God bestows his.

How much more, and greater a mercy is it, when they receav the grace to consecrate their <hi>youth</hi> and best dayes to God in holynes? offering their souls, and bodyes as the sacrifices of <hi>young lambs</hi> unblemished, upon the Lords altar. Wicked men, who hate goodnes both in <hi>youth,</hi> and <hi>age,</hi> use to say, <hi>young saints, old divels:</hi> But the truth is <hi>young divels old Beelzebubs,</hi> for the most part. To whom yet, if God, in singular grace, vouchsafe repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in after age; what a corasive will it be to the heart of such a convert, casting back his eyes to his <hi>youth</hi> consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in lusts, and vanitie, to think how great dishonour he hath brought to Gods name, and hindrance to others sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; which he may repent of, but cannot redeem? On the contrarie, sweet is the remembrance in <hi>old age</hi> of a <hi>youth</hi> led in true vertue, and godlynes.</p>
               <p>Some would enjoy both the honour of <hi>age,</hi> and liberty of <hi>youth:</hi> But curled grey hayr is not comely. Eyther state hath its benefit, and burden alotted of God.

               <p>If men should live alwayes in the world, or but so long in our age, as did the first patriarks; to what a height would many come in worldly happines, or misery? How extreamly rich would many be? how many extreamly poore? How mightie, and powerfull some? how dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and depressed many more? But the wise providence of God is to be honoured herein: by which it comes to passe, that the more men are set to drive things to extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, the lesse time should be allowed them for their courses one or other in the world.</p>
               <p>Onely man being both mortall, and reasonable, can think of his <hi>death.</hi> Not the angels; for though they can by understanding conceav of <hi>death,</hi> yet are they by their spirituall state, set without the reach of it: nor bruit beasts, though mortall; because it is not perceaved by sight, or other sense; but being a <hi>privation,</hi> to wit, of life, <hi>is onely</hi>

                  <hi>discernable by understanding.</hi> If a beast see never so many of its own kinde slaughtered before its eyes, it fears not <hi>death,</hi> which it sees not; though it may fear the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which it sees, or other terrible, and sensible object. And hence it comes to passe, that the more brutish men are, they have the lesse thoughts or fear of death for the most part.</p>
