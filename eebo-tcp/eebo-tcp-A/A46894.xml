            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Creation of Heaven

of ADAM.</head>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N <hi>the beginning God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Heaven and the
Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> the Earth being
a meere Chaos, without forme,
and darkenesse was upon the
deepe, and the Spirit of God
moved upon the waters.</p>
            <p>And God commanded there
should bee light, and separated
the light from darknesse, which
was day and night. Then God
commanded a Firmament,
which was made, and called it
<hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After by his power, hee made
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he herbs and trees to bud, and
beare fruit. Then hee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33120:7"/>
to be made the two great
Lights in the Firmament, the
Sunne and the Moone, and it
was so, and there was Morning
and Evening. After, God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the waters to bring forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Creatures of all
kinds, with feathered Fowles.
Moreover he made the Earth to
bring forth Creatures of his
kind.</p>
            <p>After these great workes,
God created Man, even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his owne Image, to rule
over the Earth, and all these
Creatures.</p>
            <p>This wonderfull worke by
Gods power was done in sixe
dayes,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and God rested the seventh
day, and sanctified it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord made this Man, of
the dust of the ground, and
breathed in him life, and then
was he a living soule. Then the
Lord planting a Garden in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
put therein the man whom
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33120:7"/>
he had thus created; that place
being planted with all sorts of
trees of pleasure: and for meat,
the tree of Life, and the tree of
Knowledge, of good and evill,
being in the midst of that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
And out of <hi>Eden</hi> went a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to water the Garden. Then
was the man put into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
by God, to dresse and keep
it, giving him leave to eate of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
tree, only forbad him to eat
of the Tree of Knowledge; the
which if he did, <hi>he should die the
death.</hi> Then the Lord for his
comfort, formed of the Earth
the Beasts of the field, and the
Fowles of Heaven, and brought
them to the man, who named
them. But besides for <hi>Adam,</hi>
he created one of greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and helpe; for the Lord
causing a heavy sleepe to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, took out of his side one
of his Ribs, of which hee made
Woman, and brought her to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33120:8"/>
who called her Woman:
<hi>And they were both naked, but were
not ashamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this Garden was a
Serpent,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> who was more crafty
then any beast of the field, who
said to the Woman, <hi>hath god
said that yee shall not eate of every
tree of the Garden?</hi> Yes, said the
Woman, of every tree, but that
in the middest of the Garden,
God hath commanded, <hi>we should
not touch it, lest we dye.</hi> Then the
Serpent said to the Woman, <hi>ye
shall not die at all: but God doth
know, that when you shall eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
your eyes shall be opened, and yee
shall be as Gods, to know both good
and evill.</hi> So the Woman see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the tree was good to eate,
pleasant to the eye, and a tree to
get knowledg, took of the fruit
thereof, and gave likewise to
her Husband; then both their
eyes were opened, and finding
themselves naked, they sewed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33120:8"/>
fig-leaves together, and made
themselves breeches.</p>
            <p>After this, in the coole of the
day, hearing of the voyce of
God, they hidde themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the trees from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
but the Lord called the
man, who answered. <hi>I heard thy
voyce in the Garden, and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
being naked.</hi> Then the
Lord said unto him, <hi>hast thou ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of the tree I forbad thee?</hi> And
the man said, <hi>the woman thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
me, she gave it me, and I did
eate thereof.</hi> Then said the Lord
to the woman, <hi>why hast thou done
this;</hi> who answered, <hi>the Serpent
did beguile me, and I did eate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then the Lord said unto
the Serpent, because thou hast
done this, thou art accursed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all Cattell, upon thy belly
shalt thou goe, and dust shalt
thou eate all thy dayes. I will
also put enmity betweene thy
seede and her seede, shee shall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33120:9"/>
break thine head, and thou shalt
bruise his heel. And to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
he said, he would encrease
her sorrows, and that in sorrow
should she bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>orth her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and be subject to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
And to <hi>Adam,</hi> for his
disobedience he cursed the earth
for his sake, that thorns and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
should it bring forth, and
that in sorrow hee should eate
his meat all the dayes of his life,
and in the sweate of his face hee
should eate his bread, till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the earth from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
hee was taken: and as hee came
from dust, thither he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne:
and <hi>Adam</hi> called his
Wife <hi>Hevah.</hi> The Lord made
them coates of skins, and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
them; then the Lord sent
him forth from the Garden of
<hi>Eden,</hi> least hee should ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the tree fo Life, sending
him to till the earth from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
he was taken. And being so cast
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33120:9"/>
out, at the East side of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of <hi>Eden,</hi> hee set the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims
with the blade of a sword
to keepe them from the tree of
Life.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Adam</hi> knew <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi>
his Wife, who conceived &amp;
bare <hi>Cain,</hi> who became a tiller
of the ground: and againe, shee
brought forth <hi>Abel,</hi> who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a keeper of sheep.</p>
            <p>After this, when hee was one
hundred and thirty years old, he
begat another child, calling him
<hi>Seth:</hi> and hee lived after that,
eight hundred yeares, and begat
sonnes and daughters. So al the
dayes of <hi>Adam</hi> were nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

he dyed.</p>

an oblation of the
fruit thereof unto
the Lord: and <hi>Abel</hi>
did the like with the encrease of
his Cattell, and of the fatt of
them, unto the which the Lord
had respect: but unto the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of <hi>Cain</hi> he had no regard;
for which he was wroth, and his
countenance fell downe. Then
the Lord said unto him, why
art thou wrath, and why is thy
countenance cast down? If thou
dost well, shalt not thou be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted?
and if thou dost not
well, sinne lyeth at the door.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:33120:16"/>
After this, <hi>Cain</hi> spake to his
brother, and meeting him in the
field, did murther him. Then
the Lord said unto <hi>Cain,</hi> where
is <hi>Abel</hi> thy brother? who answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
I cannot tell, am I my
brothers keeper? Again, the
Lord said, what hast thou done,
the voyce of thy brothers blood
cryeth unto me from the earth.</p>
            <p>Therefore thou art now cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from the Earth, which hath
opened her mouth to receive
thy brothers blood from thine
hand. When thou shalt till the
ground, it shall not henceforth
yeeld unto thee her strength; a
Vagabond, and a Run-agate
shalt thou be in the earth. Then
<hi>Cain</hi> said to the Lord, my pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
is greater then I can
beare; behold, thou hast cast me
out this day from the Earth, and
from thy face, shall I be hid, and
shall be a vagabond, and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
findeth mee, shall slay mee.

Then the Lord said unto him,
whosoever killeth thee, he shall
be punished seven fold: and the

any man finding of him should
kill him. Then hee went out of
the presence of the Lord, and

<hi>Terah</hi> brought <hi>Abraham</hi> with
<hi>Sarah, Lot,</hi> and others from <hi>Ur</hi>
in <hi>Caldea,</hi> to goe into the Land
of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And they came to
<hi>Haran,</hi> where <hi>Terah</hi> dyed, hee
being then two hundred and five

and took their journey towards
<hi>Canaan;</hi> In this his journey he
came to <hi>Sheshem,</hi> and to the
Plain of <hi>Morah,</hi> the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
being then in the Land. There
the Lord appeared to him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
to give his seede that
Land: and in that place did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
build an Altar unto the
Lord.</p>
            <p>From thence hee removed
Eastward from <hi>Bethel,</hi> where he
likewise built an Altar unto the

further South, a great

to sojourn: and when hee drew

fearfull of himselfe by reason of
the beauty of his Wife, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
her to say she was his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
Now after his comming
there, the Aegyptians were

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:33120:27"/>
the Princes of <hi>Pharoah's</hi> Court
acquainted the King therewith.
So shee was brought into his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and for her sake <hi>Abraham</hi>
was kindely used: but the Lord
plagued the house of <hi>Pharoah</hi> for
detaining of her; then was <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi>
angry with <hi>Abraham</hi> for not
telling him she was his wife, and

out of Aegypt,<note place="margin">Gen. 13.</note> with <hi>Sarah,</hi>

had made, and there he worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
(at that time, <hi>Abraham's</hi>
Cattell were so many, as <hi>Lot</hi> and
he could not live together, and
striving there was betweene their

spake to <hi>Lot,</hi> and desired
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33120:28"/>
there might be no strife between
them, they being brethren, and
and left it in <hi>Lots</hi> choise whether
to goe: and <hi>Lot</hi> looking for his
conveniency, hee observed the
Plain of <hi>Jordane</hi> was every way
watered; for before <hi>Sodome</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrah</hi> were destroyed, it was
as the Garden of the Lord, and
thither did <hi>Lot</hi> goe, according to
his owne choise, and so they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one from the other: <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
continuing in the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>
Then it was, that the Lord

            </p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Abraham</hi> removed
his Tent, and dwelt in the Plaine
of <hi>Mamre,</hi> which is <hi>Hebron,</hi> and

            <p>And it came to passe,<note place="margin">Gen. 14.</note> in some

that <hi>Lot</hi> was prisoner, and his

<hi>Abraham,</hi> saying, Blessed art

            <p>After,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.</note> this the Word of the

promised him his owne seed

but that they should be delivered,
and returne with great plenty.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Sarah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham's</hi> Wife,
continuing barren, shee had a
maid-servant, whose name was
<hi>Hagar,</hi> an Aegyptian, whom she
desired <hi>Abraham</hi> to receive, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he might have Issue, the which
hee did; this was ten yeares after
he came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with childe, whereupon
she despised <hi>Sarah</hi> her Mistrisse,
of which her pride, <hi>Sarah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
unto <hi>Abraham;</hi> who lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her to <hi>Sarah,</hi> shee dealt
roughly with her, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shee fled: but in her flying,
comming to a fountaine of water
in the Wildernesse, an Angel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
unto her, enquiring from
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:33120:29"/>
whence shee came, and whether
she intended; who by her being
told the reasons of her journey,
he perswaded her to return to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
her Dame, and to humble her
selfe unto her. Moreover the
<hi>Angel</hi> told her he would increase
her seed, and that it should multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
exceedingly: and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of her tribulation, shee
should call her sonne <hi>Ishmael.</hi>
So when she was deliver'd of this
child, <hi>Abraham</hi> called it <hi>Ishmael,</hi>
himselfe being then fourescore
and sixe yeares old.</p>
            <p>And after <hi>Abraham</hi> being nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and nine yeares old,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note> the Lord
appeared againe unto him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
many blessings unto him,
so he would obey him: and how
he would multiply his seede ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
and he fell upon his
face: Then the Lord called his
name <hi>Abraham,</hi> promising hee
should be a Father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that Kings should proceed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33120:30"/>
from them, and that hee would
give them the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for
an everlasting possession, and to
be their God, they keeping his
Covenant. Then the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Abraham,</hi> that every
man-childe of eight dayes olde
should be circumcised, as well of
his house, as of strangers that
were bought, that his Covenant
might be in their flesh as an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Covenant, and the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
should be cut off from
the people. Then hee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Wife should no more be
called <hi>Sarai,</hi> but <hi>Sarah:</hi> and how
he would give her a son, and shee
should be a Mother of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
then <hi>Abraham</hi> fell upon
his face, and laughed, thinking
it strange, hee being an hundred
years old, and <hi>Sarah</hi> ninety, then
hee desired the Lord that <hi>Ishmael</hi>
might live in his sight: but the
Lord said againe, <hi>Sarah</hi> shall bear
a sonne, and thou shalt call his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33120:30"/>
name <hi>Isaac,</hi> with whom I will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
my Covenant: and thy
prayer for <hi>Ishmael</hi> I have heard,
and him will I blesse and make
fruitfull, twelve Princes shall he
beget, and he shall be a great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that <hi>Sarah</hi> shall beare
<hi>Isaac,</hi> the next yeare. Then
<hi>Abraham</hi> tooke <hi>Ishmael</hi> his son,
with all the men-children that
were borne in his house, 15. and
that were bought with money,
and circumcised them, the selfe-same
day, God had commanded
him, himselfe being ninety nine
years old when hee was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
and <hi>Ishmael</hi> thirteen.</p>
            <p>Now againe,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> the Lord appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Plain of
<hi>Mamre,</hi> about the heat of the day,
as he sate at his Tent doore, and
looking, loe three men stood by
him, whom he ran to meet, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himselfe to the ground, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Lord, if I have found favour
in thy sight, goe not I pray thee
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:33120:31"/>
from thy servant, but wash your
feet under this tree, and I will
bring you some bread to comfort
your hearts, and after you may
goe: and they answered, doe as
thou hast said.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Abraham</hi> made hast unto
<hi>Sarah,</hi> and bade her make some
cakes upon the Hearth; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
hee made his servant kill a
Calfe, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d so with some butter
and milke hee set before them,
standing himselfe by under the
tree, whiles they did eate. Then
they asked for <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife,
whom hee said was in the Tent:
and he said, I will certainly come
again unto thee, according to the
time of life; for <hi>Sarah</hi> shall have
a sonne: <hi>Sarah</hi> heard this being
at the Tent door, and laughed
within her selfe, because she and
<hi>Abraham</hi> being olde. And the
Lord said, wherefore doth <hi>Sarah</hi>
thus laugh; shall any thing bee
too hard for the Lord to doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:33120:31"/>
at the time appointed will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
unto thee, even according
to the time of life, and <hi>Sarah</hi> shal
have a sonne, then <hi>Sarah</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid.</p>
            <p>So the men did rise, and went
towards Sodome, but <hi>Abraham</hi>
stood yet before the Lord, and
knowing of the Lords anger,
he pleaded for that City, desiring
the Righteous might not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
with the wicked: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
that if fifty righteous were
therein, it might not be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for said hee unto the Lord,
shall not the Judge of the world
doe right? but <hi>Abraham's</hi> suite
continued, from fifty to five and
forty, so from forty to thirty,
and so to twenty, and at last to
ten, which not being in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Lord went from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and <hi>Abraham</hi> returned to his
place.</p>
            <p>After this,<note place="margin">Gen. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham</hi> went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the South, and sojourned
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:33120:32"/>
at <hi>Gerar,</hi> and once more said, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
was his sister, and <hi>Abimilech</hi>
the King sent for her, whom
God (before he toucht her,) in a
dream threatned death unto him
for taking another man's Wife;
so with many circumstances, in
the feare of God, very religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
hee delivered her backe to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
blaming him for saying
she was his Sister; the which he
excused, by saying hee thought
them to have been a wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and was affraid of his life
pretending she was his sister, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
both one father, but not of
one mother. Then <hi>Abimilech</hi>
gave them great store of Cattell
&amp; treasure, reproving of <hi>Sarah</hi> for
her dissembling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; he gave them
leave to live in his Countrey,
where they pleased: and by the
prayer of <hi>Abraham, Abimilech</hi>
was heal'd of his Infirmity, with
his Wife, and women-servants,
who before were barren, and now
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:33120:32"/>
brought forth children, before
they being accused for <hi>Sarah's</hi>
cause.</p>
            <p>After this,<note place="margin">Gen. 21.</note> according to Gods
promise, in due season, <hi>Sarah</hi>
conceived, and bare <hi>Isaac,</hi> whom
<hi>Abraham</hi> circumcised at 8. dayes
old, and <hi>Sarah</hi> rejoyced in the
Lord, and wondred at his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>And when he was weaned they
made a great feast, but <hi>Sarah</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Ishmael</hi> mocking, she said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> cast out this bond-woman
and her sonne; for hee
shall not be heire with my sonne
<hi>Isaac,</hi> at which <hi>Abraham</hi> was
troubled: but the Lord com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, by telling him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
he should have by <hi>Isaac:</hi> so
in the morning early hee sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Ishmael,</hi> who went
to the Wildernesse of <hi>Beersheba,</hi>
and God was mercifull to them
in their journey.</p>
            <p>After this there was great
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33120:33"/>
friendship, between <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<hi>Abimilech,</hi> and all differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reconciled, <hi>Abraham</hi> giving
him Beeves and sheep.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Abraham</hi> planted
a Grove in <hi>Beersheba,</hi> and called
there upon the name of the Lord
the everlasting God.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord to prove <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
faith,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> said unto him, take
now thine only son <hi>Isaac,</hi> whom
thou lovest, and goe to the Land
of <hi>Moreah,</hi> and there offer him a
burnt-offering, upon one of the
mountaines I shall shew thee: so
<hi>Abraham</hi> went early away with
<hi>Isaac</hi> his sonne, two servants, his
Asses, with cloven wood for the
sacrifice: and the third day spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the place, he commanded his
servants to stay behind, himselfe
and <hi>Isaac</hi> going on to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to worship, <hi>Isaac</hi> carrying
the wood, himselfe the knife and
the fire. Then said <hi>Isaac,</hi> Father
here is the fire and the wood, but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33120:33"/>
where is the Lamb for the burnt-offring;
then his father answered
that God would provide it: and
comming to the place, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
built there an altar, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the wood on it, and bound
<hi>Isaac</hi> his son, and laid him like-wise
on the Altar upon the
wood: and <hi>Abraham</hi> stretched

to kill his sonne: but an Angell

answered here am I; then he said
lay not thy hand upon the child,
nor doe any thing unto him; for
now I know thou fearest God,
seeing for my sake thou hast not

<hi>Abraham</hi> lifting up his eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
there was a Ramme behind
him, caught by the hornes in a

offered him a burnt-offering in

this day, in the Mount will the

Then turned <hi>Abraham</hi> againe to

and <hi>Abraham</hi> mourned for her:
but hee arising from the sight of
the Corps, talked with the Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
about a place for the bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Sarah,</hi> hee being there a
Stranger, and they proffered him
to bury her in the chiefest of
their Sepulchres: but with much
respect he desired them to speak
for him unto <hi>Ephron</hi> to give him
a Cave called <hi>Maeh Pelah</hi> at the
end of a field for so much money
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33120:34"/>
it was worth for a burying place.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Ephroa</hi> in the hearing of

the field I give thee, and the cave
that is therein, even in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

            <p>Then <hi>Abraham</hi> bowed himself

buryed <hi>Sarah</hi> in that cave,
it being against <hi>Mamre,</hi> the same

            <p>Now <hi>Abraham</hi> being growne

causing him to sweare by the

            <p>Then said his servant, what if
the Woman will not come with

said he began his journey, having
in his charge ten Camels, with
such goods delivered unto him
by <hi>Abraham,</hi> as were fit for his
journey; who journeyed &amp; came
to a City called <hi>Nahur;</hi> where
comming, he there made his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels
to lie downe without the
City, by a well of water, being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventide,
the time that women u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to come for water: and then

he said, O Lord God of my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Abraham,</hi> I beseech thee send

I say, bow downe thy pitcher, I

she say drink, and I will give thy
Camels drink also, let her be she
that thou hast ordained for thy
servant <hi>Isaac;</hi> and thereby shall
I know that thou hast shewed
mercy on my Master.</p>
            <p>Now while hee was speaking,
<hi>Rebeckah</hi> the daughter of <hi>Bethuel</hi>
came out with her pitcher upon
her shoulder, who was very fair,
and a Virgin: and going downe
into the Well, and filling her
pitcher, and comming up, the
servant ran and met her, saying,
let me drinke I pray thee a little
water of thy pitcher. Then she
hastily put the pitcher to her
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33120:43"/>
hand, and gave him to drink, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
moreover, I will draw like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
some water for thy Camels,
that they may drinke: and then
she ran againe to the Well, and
drew water for the Camels: So
the man wondred at her, but held
his peace, to know whether the
Lord had made his journey pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
or not.</p>
            <p>And when the Camels had left
drinking, the man took a golden
<hi>Abilloment,</hi> and two bracelets,
with ten sheckles of gold, and
gave them her: and he asked her
whose daughter she was, saying,
I pray thee tell mee; as likewise
if there be any roome in thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house to lodge in; she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
I am the daughter of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuel,</hi>
whom she bare to <hi>Nahor.</hi>
Moreover she said, we have litter
and provender enough, &amp; room
to lodge in: and the man bowed
himselfe, and worshipped the
Lord, saying, blessed be the Lord
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33120:44"/>
God of my Master <hi>Abraham,</hi>
which hath not with-drawne his
mercie and his truth from him;
for when I was in the way, the
Lord hath brought mee to my
masters brothers house. She then
hearing this, ran straight home,
and told her brother <hi>Laban</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
who came presently to the
man, and said unto him, come in
thou blessed of the Lord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
standest thou without, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I have prepared the roome
for thy selfe and thy Camels: so
he unsadled the Camels, giving
them litter and provender. Then
hee, and the men that came with
him washed their feet, and meat
was set before him: but he would
not eate, untill he had delivered
his message.</p>
            <p>Then hee related how hee was
servant to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and how
God had blessed him exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in goods, money, &amp; servants,
and how he had a sonne by <hi>Sarah</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:33120:44"/>
in her old age, to whom his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

had commanded him as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid;
with such passages as
was between <hi>Rebecka</hi> and him at
the Well, and how he then gave
her the Abiloments and Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</p>
            <p>Then hee said further unto
them, if you will deale merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and truly with my Master, tell
me, &amp; if not, tell me, that I may
turn me to the right hand, or to
the left. Then answered <hi>Laban,</hi>
ct <hi>Bethuel,</hi> that this thing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
of the Lord, wee cannot
therefore say unto thee neither
evill or good. Behold, she is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, take her and goe, that
she may be thy Masters sons wife
as the Lord hath said. Then hee
bowed himself towards the earth
unto the Lord, and gave unto <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becka</hi>
jewels of gold, and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as likewise gifts unto her
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:33120:45"/>
Mother, and her Brother, and
then did eate, tarrying there all
night.</p>
            <p>Now in the morning when he
was ready to depart, they desired
<hi>Rebecka</hi> might stay only ten days
with them: but he said, in regard
God had prospered his journey,
hee desired forth-with to goe to
his Master. Then they desired
to know <hi>Rebecka's</hi> minde, and
have her consent, whose answer
was, she would goe; and so when
they had blessed her, they let her
goe, and her Nurse likewise. So
this servant, with <hi>Rebecka</hi> and her
maid-servants, tooke their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
riding upon the Camels.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Isaac</hi> being walking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in the fields to pray, in the
evening, and looking about him,
see these Camels comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him: and so soon as <hi>Rebecka</hi>
see him, she lighted from her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell:
and asking the servant who
it was that was comming toward
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33120:45"/>
them, he said, it was his Master;
so she tooke a vaile and covered
her selfe. Then the servant tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him what he had, <hi>Isaac</hi> took
her to his Mother <hi>Sarah's</hi> Tent,
and she was his Wife, whom he
loved.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Abraham</hi> dying, <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>
and <hi>Ishmael</hi> buryed him with
<hi>Sarah</hi> his wife, after whose death
<hi>Isaac</hi> dwelt in <hi>Beerlahai Roy:</hi> and

            <p>
               <hi>Isaac</hi> was forty years old when

for a while barren: but hee
prayed to the Lord, who heard
him, and she conceived: and at
the time of birth, being with

bowels, one people shal be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
then the other, and the elder
shall serve the younger. So at
the time of the delivery, the first
that came out was red, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
rough, him they called <hi>Esau:</hi>
and after came the other, whose
hand held <hi>Esau</hi> by the heele, who
was called <hi>Jacob,</hi> and then was <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>
threescore years old.</p>
            <p>Now these two growing into
yeares, <hi>Esau</hi> became a cunning
Hunter, and lived in the fields:
but <hi>Jacob</hi> was a plaine man, and
lived in Tents. And <hi>Isaac</hi> loved
<hi>Esau,</hi> for Venison was his meate:
but <hi>Rebecka</hi> loved <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Esau</hi> comming one day
very hungry &amp; weary out of the
fields, <hi>Jacob</hi> had made some pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
of which <hi>Esau</hi> desired to
eate; for which <hi>Jacob</hi> desired <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau's</hi>
birth-right, who answered,
loe I am almost dead, what is
then this birth-right to mee, so
hee sware unto <hi>Jacob</hi> to give it
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33120:46"/>
him, and contemning of it, hee
sold it; then gave <hi>Jacob</hi> unto him
some bread and Lentill Pottage,
and so went away.</p>
            <p>And alter it came to pass that
there was a Famine in the land,<note place="margin">Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
and by the appointment of God,
<hi>Isaac</hi> he went to <hi>Gerar,</hi> and there
the Lord appeared unto him,
confirming his promise to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
his Father, and to the seede
of <hi>Isaac.</hi> And being at <hi>Gerar,
Rebecka</hi> being very beautifull, the
men thereabouts did much look
after her, insomuch as <hi>Isaac</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
affraid, he said she was his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
            <p>And it came to passe one day,
<hi>Isaac</hi> being sporting with her,
<hi>Abimilech</hi> King of the <hi>Philistines</hi>
looking out of a window did es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
it, and called to <hi>Isaac,</hi> &amp; said
to him, surely she is thy Wife,
and why dost thou say she is thy
Sister; to whom hee answered,
that he was affraid of his life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:33120:47"/>
Then said the King, why hast
thou done this? If any one of my
people had lyen with her, thou
shouldst have brought sin upon
us. Then <hi>Abimilech</hi> charged all
his people, saying, he that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
this man or his Wife shall
dye the death.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Isaac</hi> living in this
Land, and sowing Corne, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
was a hundred fold, and
his Cattell did encrease excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
So having a mighty
houshold, and growing so great,
the <hi>Philistines</hi> did envy him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as they filled up the wels
which were digged in his Father
<hi>Abraham's</hi> time. And being
grown so rich and potent, <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milech</hi>
bade him be gone, saying,
Thou art mightier then wee a
great deal. Therefore <hi>Isaac</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
and pitched his Tent in
the valley at <hi>Gerar,</hi> and there
dwelt, and opened the Wells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
that the <hi>Philistines</hi> had stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33120:47"/>
calling them by the names
that <hi>Abraham</hi> his Father had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them: and his servants dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
in the valley, found there a
Well of living water; for which
there was strife betweene them
and the Herdmen of <hi>Gerer,</hi> they
saying it was theirs.</p>
            <p>After this, they digged ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Well, and there was strife
for that likewise. After this,
they digged another, for which
there was no strife. So from
thence hee went to <hi>Beersheba,</hi>
where the Lord appeared unto
him the same night, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
unto him the blessings and
promise to <hi>Abraham</hi> his Father,
and his seede: and there he built
an Altar, calling upon the name
of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Then came unto him <hi>Abimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi>
with his friend, and a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of his Army, to whom <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>
said, why come ye to me, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you put mee out from you,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33120:48"/>
who answered him, wee saw the
Lord was with thee, and we used
thee kindly, and sent thee away
in peace, and therefore let there
be now a Covenant betweene us,
and let it be done; the blessed of
the Lord doe this.</p>
            <p>Then hee feasted them, and
they arose betimes in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and sware one to another,
departing in peace and amity.</p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Esau</hi> was forty
yeares old, hee took to wife <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</hi>
a Hittite, and <hi>Beshemath</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Hittite likewise, who
were a griefe of minde to <hi>Isaac</hi>
and <hi>Rebecka.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Isaac</hi> growing old,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> and
his sight failing of him, he called
for <hi>Esau</hi> his eldest sonne, who
came unto him, to whom he said
I am now old, and know not the
day of my death; wherefore I
pray thee take thy bow, and goe
into the field and kill mee some
Venison, and make me some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33120:48"/>
meate, and bring it me, that
I may blesse thee before I dye;
the which accordingly <hi>Esau</hi> went
about to doe.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Rebecka</hi> hearing what <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>
had said, after <hi>Esau</hi> was gone
into the field, she told <hi>Jacob</hi> what
<hi>Isaac</hi> had said, and pointed <hi>Esau</hi>
to doe, and how he intended to
blesse him before his death. So
she commanded him, saying goe
to the flocke, and from thence
bring two Goat-kids; to make
pleasant meate for thy Father,
that hee may blesse thee; then
said <hi>Jacob</hi> to his Mother, that
his brother <hi>Esau</hi> was rough, and
himselfe smooth; by which, if
his Father should feel, he should
seeme to mock him, &amp; so should
he bring a curse upon himselfe in
stead of a blessing: but shee said,
let the curse be upon me: So he
went and brought them to his
Mother, who made pleasant meat
thereof, such as <hi>Isaac</hi> loved, then
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33120:49"/>
she put upon him furre cloath's
of <hi>Esau's</hi> which were in the house,
and covered his hands, and the
smooth of his necke with the
skins of the Kids: and so putting
the meat &amp; bread into his hands,
he comming to his Father, said,
my Father, who answered, I am
here; who art thou my sonne:
and <hi>Jacob</hi> said, I am <hi>Esau</hi> thy first
borne, I have done as thou bid'st
mee, arise I pray thee, sit up and
eate of my Venison, that thy soul
may blesse mee; to whom <hi>Isaac</hi>
said, how hast thou found it so
quickly my sonne; who answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
because the Lord thy God
brought it to my hand. Then said
<hi>Isaac</hi> unto him, come neare that
I may feele thee my sonne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou be my sonne <hi>Esau</hi> or
not; then <hi>Jacob</hi> came near him,
who felt him and said, the voyce
is <hi>Jacob's,</hi> but the hands <hi>Esau's,</hi>
wherefore he blessed him. Then
he again asked him if he were <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:33120:49"/>
who answered him hee was;
then hee called for the Venison
to eate, that he might blesse him,
the which was brought by <hi>Jacob</hi>
who did eat; as likewise he drank
wine.</p>
            <p>After which hee called <hi>Jacob</hi>
unto him to kisse him, who did
so; then he smelled the savour of
his garment, and blessed him,
saying, the smell of my sonne is
as the smell of a field, which the
Lord hath blessed: and when <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>
had made an end of blessing
<hi>Jacob,</hi> hee departed from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
After which, <hi>Esau</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from hunting, came to his
Father, who asking whom hee
was, told him it was <hi>Esau</hi> his first
borne sonne, whereat <hi>Isaac</hi> was
struck with great feare; then hee
told <hi>Esau</hi> of what had been done,
and how hee had blessed his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that brought meat unto him
and that hee should be blessed;
then <hi>Esau</hi> hearing this, cryed bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.</p>

and in obedience
to his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
departing from
<hi>Beersheba,</hi> taking his journey to
<hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> comming to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
place, it being night, hee
took a stone, and laying it under
his head, he fell asleepe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into a dreame, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto him a ladder, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
from the earth to heaven,
Angels going up and down upon
it, and the Lord standing above
it, who said, I am the Lord, the
God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of <hi>Isaac</hi> thy
Father, the Land whereupon

multiply exceedingly, &amp; in them
shall the families of the Earth be
blessed, and promising to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
him in all his journeys, and
to bring him again to that Land.
Now <hi>Jacob</hi> awaking, was affraid,
but did thinke the Lord was in
that place, saying to himselfe, it
was the house of God, and that
there was the gates of Heaven.
Then after hee had risen early in
the morning, he took that stone
and set it up as a pillar, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
oyle upon it, called it <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Jacob</hi> made a vow, that
if God would preserve him in
that journey, by giving him
bread to eate, and cloaths to put
on, and to come in safety backe
to his fathers house, that then
the stone which he had set up as a

               </gap> in that place, should bee
God house, and he would serve
him, and pay the tenths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:33120:57"/>
Then <hi>Jacob</hi> travailed towards
the East Countrey: and in his
journey he came to a Well in the
field, where sheep lay fast by to
be watered, and there was a great
stone upon the Well's mouth:
and people being thereby, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
them from whence they
were, who answered, they were
from <hi>Haran;</hi> then he asked them
if they knew <hi>Laban</hi> the sonne of
<hi>Nahor,</hi> who answered yes; then
asking them how hee did, they
said in health: And moreover,
saying, here is comming his
daughter <hi>Rachel</hi> to his sheepe;
then he told them, is it not time
to water the sheep? and they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
they could not, untill the
flocks came together, and till
some came to roll away the stone
from the Wels mouth.</p>
            <p>Now whiles they were talking,
comes <hi>Rachel</hi> with her Father's
sheep; when <hi>Jacob</hi> saw, he row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the stone off from the Wel's
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:33120:58"/>
mouth, and watered her sheepe;
then <hi>Jacob</hi> kis'd <hi>Rachel,</hi> and wept,
telling her he was <hi>Rebecka's</hi> son;
then presently shee ran and told
her father, the which when <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>
heard, in hast he came to him,
and kissed him, bringing him to
his house. Then <hi>Jacob</hi> told him
all the cause of his comming, and
continuing there a moneth with
very much friendship and love;
then <hi>Laban</hi> pretended it was too
much for him to serve him for
nothing, asking him what wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
he would have. Now <hi>Laban</hi>
having two daughters, <hi>Lea</hi> and
<hi>Rachel, Jacob</hi> told him he would
serve him seven yeares for <hi>Rachel</hi>
the younger daughter, for <hi>Jacob</hi>
loved her, the which <hi>Laban</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
unto. And <hi>Jacob</hi> having
served the seven yeares, which
seemed unto him but as a few
dayes, in regard of his love to
her. Then <hi>Jacob</hi> demanded her
of <hi>Laban,</hi> according to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:33120:58"/>
upon which <hi>Laban</hi> called
his neighbours together, and
made a feast: but in the evening
hee put <hi>Leah</hi> his other daughter
into <hi>Jacob's</hi> bed, who went in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her: but in the morning when
<hi>Jacob</hi> spyed it, hee asked <hi>Laban</hi>
wherefore hee had so deceived
him, by giving him <hi>Leah</hi> in stead
of <hi>Rachel;</hi> then <hi>Laban</hi> answered
it was not the manner of that
place to give the younger before
the elder.</p>
            <p>So they came to a new agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was to serve seven
years more for <hi>Rachel,</hi> the which
hee performed, and then <hi>Laban</hi>
gave <hi>Rachel</hi> unto him for his
Wife; yet <hi>Jacob</hi> loving <hi>Rachel</hi>
better then <hi>Leah:</hi> but when the
Lord saw <hi>Leah</hi> was despised, he
made her fruitfull, and <hi>Rachel</hi>
was barren: and <hi>Leah</hi> conceived
and bare a sonne, calling him
<hi>Reuben:</hi> and she again conceived,
and bare a sonne, calling him <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon;</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:33120:59"/>
a third time she conceived
and bare a sonne, and called his
name <hi>Levi;</hi> and conceiving the
fourth time, she bare a son, and
called him <hi>Iduah,</hi> and praised the
Lord, then she left bearing.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Rachel</hi> envyed this her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and said unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> give me
children, or else I dye. Then was
<hi>Jacob</hi> angry with <hi>Rachel,</hi> saying,
am I in Gods stead which hinders
thee from fruit? then she recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
her maid <hi>Bilhah</hi> unto
him, who went in unto her, by
whom he had a sonne, who was
called <hi>Dan:</hi> and shee conceived
a second time, and bare a sonne,
who was called <hi>Nepthali:</hi> and
when <hi>Leah</hi> saw shee had left bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
shee gave her maid <hi>Zilpah</hi>
unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> who bare him a son,

she bare another, calling him
<hi>Ashur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Reuben</hi> went into the
fields in the time of wheate Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33120:59"/>
&amp; found Man-drakes, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to his mother <hi>Leah,</hi> the
which <hi>Rachel</hi> hearing of, she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
her to give her some of her
son's Man-drakes, but shee refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
her; Then <hi>Jacob</hi> comming
out of the field in the Evening,
<hi>Leah</hi> met him, saying, come in
unto me, for I have bought my
son's Man drakes: so hee slept
with her that night, and she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
brought forth a 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> son,
whose name was called <hi>Issachar.</hi>
And after this shee bare another
sonne, calling him <hi>Zebulon,</hi> and
likewise a daughter after that
called <hi>Dinah.</hi> Then God loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
upon <hi>Rachel,</hi> and she concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and brought forth a son, and
she called his name <hi>Joseph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Jacob</hi> was wondrous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to depart from <hi>Laban</hi>
with his Wives and Children to
goe back into his own countrey,
but <hi>Laban</hi> was loth to part with
him, in regard he had prospered
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33120:60"/>
so well by his company and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jacob</hi> was loth to stay with
him; then <hi>Laban</hi> offered him
what wages hee would demand,
the which he refused: but said he,
give me all the black-spotted and
blacke sheep in thy flocke, and I
will serve thee, and thus they
were agreed: so <hi>Jacob</hi> kept one
part, and <hi>Laban's</hi> sonnes kept the
other, being three dayes journey

            <p>Then <hi>Jacob</hi> tooke the rods of

in them, putting them in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Troughs, when the sheep
came to drinke: and drinking
there when they were hot, which
after made them bring forth
spotted Lambs: so he encreased
exceedingly, whereat <hi>Laban</hi> and
his sonnes were not well pleased.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord spake unto <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>

               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:33120:60"/>
upon which he sent for his
two wives, <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> into
the fields, telling them of the
bad countenance their father
shewed him: and how Gods plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
was, he should return to his

of Gods wonders &amp;
mercies to him, and of the great
commands from God he had to
return to his own Land.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Jacob</hi> rose up, and set his
sons and his wives upon Camels,
and carried away al his flocks and
substance he had gotten, &amp; took
his journey to <hi>Isaac</hi> his father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

which, when <hi>Laban</hi> was gone to
his sheep-shering, <hi>Rachel</hi> tooke

towards <hi>Gilead,</hi> then <hi>Laban</hi>
with his brethren followed him
seven days journey, and overtook
him at <hi>Mount-Gilead.</hi> There God
came to <hi>Laban</hi> in a dreame by

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33120:61"/>
spake any thing but good to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob:</hi>
so hee overtooke him, and
they pitched both their Tents
neare one another.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Laban</hi> said to him, thou
hast stoln away mine heart (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his Idols) and carried away
my daughters; telling of him,
how hee intended to have sent
them away with the mirth of
Songs, Timbrels, &amp; Harps, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
him for his foolish doings,
and taxing him for stealing his
gods; withall, letting him to
know how he could be revenged

the night before had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto him, who bid him take
heed that he spake any other but
good nnto him. More hee said,
because thou longest so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thy father, thou needest not
so to haue gone away, and to steal
my gods. But <hi>Jacob</hi> told him how
he feared that hee would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
his daughters from him: and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:33120:61"/>
for his Gods hee wisht him to
make a search for them, and with
whom he found them that party
should die: but <hi>Jacob</hi> did not
know that <hi>Rachel</hi> had stolen
them; then <hi>Laban</hi> came and
searched in <hi>Jacob's, Leah's,</hi> and the
maids Tents, out there could not
finde them, and so came to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chels,</hi>
but she had put them in the

Lord be not angry that I cannot
rise up before thee, for the
custome of women is upon me,
so after his search he could not
finde his Idols.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Jacob</hi> was angry with
<hi>Laban</hi> for persuing after him in
that manner, telling him of the
hard service he had under him,
even for twenty yeares, and of
the increase of his wealth by his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:33120:62"/>
care, withall how hardly he had
far'd, and what strict accompt
he gave unto him, that if the least
by mis-chance were given, he had
made it good, if they were stolen
by day or by night he did the
like; how in the day he had been
consumed with the heat, and in
the night with frost, and was
kept from sleep, and how he had
served fourteen yeares for his
two Daughters, and six yeares
for his sheep; and how hee had
changed his wages ten times, and
but that the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi>

of them did sweare, <hi>Laban</hi> swear
by the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor</hi>
his father; but <hi>Jacob</hi> by the
feare of his father <hi>Isacc:</hi> Then
<hi>Jacob</hi> offered sacrifice upon the
mounte, calling his brethren to
eate, who did so, and stayed upon
the mounte all night; and early
in the morning <hi>Laban</hi> roase up
kissed his sonnes and daughters,
blessing them, departed, and went
to his place againe.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Jacob</hi> going on his
journey, the Angels of God met
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:33120:63"/>
him, whom he called the hoste of
God: But being in great feare
of his brother <hi>Esau,</hi> he sent
messengers before unto him,
with messages of great respect,
and humiliation: but they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
told him that <hi>Esau</hi> was
coming against him with foure
hundred men, at which he was
sore troubled, and divided his
people and cattell into compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
thinking if the one were
taken the other might escape,
and then <hi>Jacob</hi> prayed unto the
Lord saying, O God of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isacc,</hi> which
said unto me, returne unto thy
countrey and to thy kindred; I
am not worthy of the least of thy
mercies, which thou hast shewed
unto me, for with my staffe came
I over this <hi>Jordan,</hi> I pray thee
deliver me from the hands of my
brother <hi>Esau,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So he tarried there that night,
and preparing a present for <hi>Esau</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:33120:63"/>
of severall cattell, sending his
servants before with them in two
droves, himself following, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them to say if <hi>Esau</hi> met
them and inquired whose cattell
they were, there answer should
be they were presents sent from
<hi>Jacob</hi> to him, and himself fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
so they went before and
he stayed that night with the
company, but in the night hee
aroase, taking his two wives his
two maides, and his eleven chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
sending them over the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Jabhek</hi> with all his goods.</p>
            <p>Now after they were gone
there was a man wrestled with
him untill break of the day, who
seeing he could not prevaile, hee
touched the hollow of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s
thigh, which was loossed, but <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
would not let him go without
a blessing, then he asked his name,
and he told him <hi>Jacob,</hi> then said
he thy name shall be called no
more <hi>Jacob</hi> but <hi>Israel,</hi> because
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33120:64"/>
thou hast had power with God,
thou shalt also prevaile with
men, and so blessed him, and as
he parted the Sun aroase, and he
halted upon his thigh; therefore
the children of <hi>Israel</hi> eat not the
sinewe that shrank in the hollow
of the thigh unto this day.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Jacob</hi> going on in
his journey, he espyed <hi>Esau</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards him with his foure
hundred men; then hee divided
his children to <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah,</hi>
and to the two maides, putting
the maides and their children
foremost, <hi>Leah</hi> and her children
next, and <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
and he going before them
meeting <hi>Esau</hi> bowed himselfe to
the ground seven times, untill he
came neare him, then <hi>Easu</hi> ran to
him, and did imbrace him, and
kisse him, and they both wept,
and seeing the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<hi>Esau</hi> asked who they were,
who answered, they were the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33120:64"/>
children God hath given to thy
servant, and so in order the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and their children came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, and bowed with great
reverence, then <hi>Esau</hi> asked him
what he meant by all them drovs
of cattell he met, hee told him
I have sent them to thee, that I
may finde favour in the sight of
my Lord, then <hi>Esau</hi> said I have
enough my brother, keep them
to thy self, but <hi>Jacob</hi> answered,
nay, I pray thee if I have found
grace in thy sight, then receive
my present, for I have seen thy
face as though I had seen the
face of God, because thou hast
accepted me therefore take my
blessing, for God hath had mercy
on me, and so <hi>Esau</hi> tooke it; then
<hi>Esau</hi> said, let us take our journey
and I will goe before thee, but
<hi>Jacob</hi> said, my Lord thou know'st
the children are tender, and the
cattel with young, and it were
dangerous to go too fast, but go
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:33120:65"/>
my Lord before thy servant, and
I will drive softly untill I come
to my Lord unto <hi>Sier,</hi> and so they
parted, <hi>Esau</hi> going that day to
<hi>Sier.</hi> And <hi>Jacob</hi> going towards
<hi>Succoth,</hi> where coming he built a
house, and made provision for
his cattell, after he came to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi>
in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and
pitched before that Citie, there
he bought a parcell of Land, of
the sonnes of <hi>Hamor,</hi> where hee
set up an Altar, and called it the
<hi>mighty God of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it came to passe, that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>
the daughter of <hi>Jacob</hi> by <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 43.</note>
going to see the daughters of
that countrie, <hi>Shechem</hi> whom the
sonne of <hi>Hamor</hi> Lord of that
country seeing took, and defiled,
and after loved her exceedingly,
desiring his father to obtaine
her for his wife, who according
to his sons desire went to speake
unto <hi>Jacob</hi> about it, but <hi>Jacob</hi> and
his sonnes having heard of this
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33120:65"/>
wronge done to <hi>Dinah,</hi> were
much displeased thereat, because
he had wrought such villany in
<hi>Israel;</hi> Now <hi>Hamor</hi> coming to
<hi>Jacob</hi> told him how the soule of
his sonne loved <hi>Dinah,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
she might be his wife, and
how by that there should be a
continuall freindship betweene
them, their children, and people,
with great expressions of what
love &amp; happines this would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce;
now they seem'd to likewel
of those Propositions, only they
would not marry with an uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
people: but if they
would be circumcised they
would approve thereof, all which
<hi>Hamor</hi> and his son <hi>Shechem</hi> liked
well of, consenting there unto,
and <hi>Shechem</hi> deferred not the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, his love was such to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah;</hi>
so the father and the sonne
acquainted the Citie therewith,
who considering of the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
and neighbour-hood that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:33120:66"/>
hereby might come; so they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
and all the men children
were circumcised, even as they
went out at the gate of the City:
But on the third day after when
they were sore, two sonnes of
<hi>Jacob, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> took each
of them a sword, and going bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the Citie, killed every
male, as likewise <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi>
taking <hi>Dinah</hi> out of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem's</hi>
house and so went away,
and the other sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> came
up and spoiled the City, taking
all their goods, because of this
wrong done to their sister <hi>Dinah:</hi>
But <hi>Jacob</hi> was troubled at this act
of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> saying, they
had made him stinck among the
Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>After this God commanded
him to arise,<note place="margin">Gen. 35.</note> and goe to <hi>Bethel,</hi>
and there to make an Altar unto
him, the which he did before,
commanding all his house-hold
to put away their false Gods
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:33120:66"/>
whose counsell they observed,
giving him all their Gods, or,
Idols, and there eare-rings, and
buryed them under an Oake. So
they went towards <hi>Bethel,</hi> and
there built an Altar, and after
many promises there of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and his seed, with his
worship, and testimonies of
thanksgiving unto God, for all
his mercies, he departed from <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi>
and in their journey <hi>Rachel</hi>
travel'd in child-birth, and was in
danger: but the Midwife did
comfort her, telling her shee
should have a son, and in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity,
before she died, being
delivered, called the child <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
and so gave up the Ghost, &amp;
was buried at <hi>Bethlehem, Jacob</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nding
a Pillar to be set upon her
grave. Then <hi>Jacob</hi> went on his
journey, and came to <hi>Isaac</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to <hi>Mamre,</hi> where <hi>Isaac</hi> died.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Jacob</hi> lived in the
Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where after his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:33120:67"/>
other sonnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sold <hi>Joseph</hi> into
<hi>Egypt,</hi> unto which Land in the

to uncertainties as <hi>Jacob</hi> was, for
twenty years, with so many changes
of his wages.</p>
            <p>And let not the allurements and
vain promises of this world detaine
mee, either for the enjoying the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
profits therein, or to stay in the
vanities thereof, with such hopelesse
and helplesse promises as <hi>Laban</hi> did
intend to him. But let me with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
and sincerily follow thy good
directions, &amp; break from such things
as may offend thee to the hurt of my
soule.</p>
            <p>Deliver me O Lord from the fears
and jealousies, so subject to the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of flesh and blood, &amp; from the
danger of my enemies, as thou did'st
<hi>Jacob</hi> from his brother <hi>Esau;</hi> let
thy protection be with me, and thy
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33120:72"/>
holy Angels to guard me. And as
<hi>Jacob</hi> sent his wives, children, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and goods in order and came
before him, with such Presents and
directions as might appease the fury
of his brother <hi>Esau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So O Lord in my progres towards
thee by a true faith and humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence;
give me a holy care &amp; pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to send unto thee before-hand,
my heart and good intentions, with
my goods of piety and good workes
that in mercy thou maist receive me,
so shall I escape thy judgements so
justly due to me for my sins.</p>
            <p>O Lord keep me from a wandring
spirit, and a loose condition, so shall
I avoid evill, and all occasions of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.
Let me not doe like <hi>Dinah,</hi>
who went a gadding to see the
daughters of <hi>Shechem,</hi> whereby she
was entrap'd and brought to solly, so
shall I avoid sin to my selfe, and the
punishment of others, as it befell to
that unhappy Prince and Citie of
<hi>Shechem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:33120:73"/>
And O Lord preserve mee from
the like cruelty that was in <hi>Simeon</hi>
and <hi>Levi,</hi> whose revenge was impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
and transcendent, being odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the eyes of their Father and to
all good people; yet by this terrible
judgement, teach mee to know thy
displeasure against sinne, and leave
such severe punishments to thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
judgements.</p>
            <p>O thou my Creator, Redeemer, &amp;
Preserver, or wonderfull in my crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
infinitely good in my redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and most mercifull in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation;
the great strength, guide,
and directer of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Jacob,</hi> in all their passages, through
the Desarts, and Labyrinths of this
crooked world; which mercies of
thine O Lord have beene most boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
and mercifully extended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, a most miserable sinner. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as they at all times, and upon all
occasions, in their severall stations,
for thy mercies &amp; deliverances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, did build Altars; and offer
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33120:73"/>
Sacrifices of thankesgiving unto
thee for thy goodnesse: and Jacob ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his vow, at the beginning
of his perigrination, where he set up
that stone, did now at his returne in
that very place pay his vows even at
<hi>Bethel,</hi> with much solempnity and
piety.</p>
            <p>So O Lord, let it enter into my
heart, duly to consider of thy great
mercies unto me from time to time,
let me not cast them behind mee, but
call them to minde: and as <hi>Jacob</hi> by
finding thy mercies, did not forget
them, when he came backe to <hi>Bethel,</hi>
but there did performe his duty and
promise unto thee: so let me alwayes
remember thy deliverances unto me,
and how in my severall distresses I
have so seen and found them, as they
having moved good thoughts and

good Lord, let not my dulnesse and
fleshly vanity dispossesse me of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33120:74"/>
thou hast begunne in me by thy good
motions, so continue them and thy

of thy grace and good Inspirations,
I may persevere in all good purposes

then all his children,<note place="margin">Gen. 37.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was the sonne of
his old age; and he made
him a coat of many colours: and
<hi>Joseph</hi> dreamed certain dreames,
the interpretation whereof much
displeased his brethren, and they
hated him, and conspired to slay
him. But <hi>Reuben</hi> his brother heard
it and delivered him out of their
hands. But it came to passe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that they stript him, and took
and cast him into a pit where was
no water; and they sitting downe
to eat bread, a company of <hi>Ishma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
came from Gilead with their

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:33120:75"/>
And <hi>Judah</hi> did perswade his
brethren not to kill <hi>Joseph</hi> that his
blood might not be upon them,
but to sell him to these <hi>Ishmaelites:</hi>
and they sold him to a Midianite
Merchant for twenty pieces of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and he carried <hi>Joseph</hi> into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</p>
            <p>And his brethren took <hi>Josephs</hi>
coat, and killed a kid and dipped
the coat in the blood, and brought
it to their father who knew it, and
said, It is my sonnes coat, and some
beast hath devoured him: and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
rent his clothes and mourned for
him many dayes.</p>
            <p>And all his sonnes and daughters
rose up to comfort him, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to be comforted: after the
Midianites sold <hi>Joseph</hi> into Egypt,
unto <hi>Potiphar</hi> an officer of King
<hi>Pharaohs,</hi> who was Captaine of his
guard.</p>
            <p>Now the Lord was with <hi>Joseph,</hi>
and he was a prosperous man, and
found favour in the sight of <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phar,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:33120:75"/>
who made him overseer of his
house, and all that he had he put
into his hand; and the Lord blessed
the Egyptians house for his sake,
and <hi>Joseph</hi> was a goodly person
and well favoured.</p>
            <p>It came to passe that <hi>Potiphars</hi>
wife grew in love with him, tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to lye with her; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
and said unto her, My Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
hath beene kinde unto me, and
committed all to my charge: and
how then can I doe this great wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
and sinne against God?</p>
            <p>But she daily solicited <hi>Joseph:</hi>
and one day coming into the house
she caught him by the garment,
saying, lye with me, and he left his
garment and fled: then she called
aloud unto the men of her house,
and said, An Hebrew is brought
unto us to mock us, he came and
urged to lye with me, and I cryed
with a loud voice: and when he
heard me cry he left his garment
and fled: and when her lord came
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33120:76"/>
home she told him of this passage:
and his wrath was kindled against
<hi>Joseph,</hi> and put him into prison.
But the Lord was with <hi>Joseph,</hi> and
shewed him mercy, giving him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with the keeper of the prison.</p>
            <p>And it came to passe that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
King of Egypt was wroth with
his principall Butler and Baker,<note place="margin">Gen. 40.</note> and
they were committed to the prison
where <hi>Joseph</hi> was; and they dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
dreams both of them one night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joseph</hi> coming unto them in the
morning, they were sad: and he
said unto them, Wherefore looke
you so sadly? and they told him
their dreames, the which he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted;
that the Butler within three
dayes should be released and in
King <hi>Pharaohs</hi> favour, and deliver
the cup into his hand as he former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did: and <hi>Joseph</hi> desired him to
remember him with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> when
he was thus advanced.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Joseph</hi> interpreted the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
dreame, that within three
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33120:76"/>
dayes he should be hanged on a
tree: and it came to passe the third
day was <hi>Pharaohs</hi> birth-day, that
he made a feast to all his servants:
and he restored the chiefe Butler to
his place, and he gave the cup into
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> hand, but he hanged the
Baker: yet did not the Butler re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>Joseph,</hi> but forgat him.</p>
            <p>And it came to passe after two
yeares that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> dreamed that
he stood by the river,<note place="margin">Gen. 41.</note> and there
came out of the river seven well fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
kine, fat, and they fed in a
medow; and seven other kine came
out of the river ill favoured, and
leane, and stood by the other kine,
and did eat them up: and he dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a second dream, that seven ears of
corn came up upon one stalke, rank
and good; and seven thin ears and
blasted with the East winde sprung
up after them, and the seven thin
ears devoured the seven ranke and
full ears.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharaoh</hi> being troubled at these
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33120:77"/>
dreams, sent for the Magicians of
Egypt, but none of them could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
these dreams.</p>
            <p>Then spake the cheife Butler un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> saying, <q>I do Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
my faults this day, thou wast
wroth with me and thy chief Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
and put us in prison; and we
dreamed both in one night, and
there was in the prison with us a
young man an Hebrew that did
interpret our dreames, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his interpretation, I
was restored to favour, and the
Baker hanged.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> sent for <hi>Joseph</hi> out
of the dungeon, and he shaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and changed his raiment, and
came in unto <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
said unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> I have dreamed a
dreame, and no man can interpret
it: and <hi>Joseph</hi> answered <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
saying, It is not in me. God shall
give <hi>Pharaoh</hi> an answer of peace.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> related his dream,

kine that came up after
them, are seven years; and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
empty ears blasted with the
East winde, shall be seven years of
famine; this is the thing that God
is about to doe. Behold, there shall
come seven years of great plenty
thoroughout all the land of Egypt;
and there shall be seven years of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and the famine shall consume
the land. Now therefore let <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
look out a man discreet and
wise, and set him over the land of
Egypt, to provide in the seven years
of plenty, for the famine that shall
follow: and the counsell was good
in the eyes of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> for
as much as God hath shewed thee
all this, there is none so discreet
and wise as thou art: therefore thou
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33120:78"/>
shalt be over my house, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto thy word shall all my
people be ruled: only in the throne
will I be greater then thou: and
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> set him over the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:
and took off his Ring from
off his hand, and put it upon <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi>
hand, and arrayed him in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
of fine linen, and put a gold
chaine about his neck.</p>
            <p>And he made him ride in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Chariot which he had; and
they cryed before him, Bow the
knee: he made him Ruler over all
the land of Egypt, and he gave him
to wife <hi>Asenath</hi> the daughter of
<hi>Poti-pherah</hi> Priest of <hi>On.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then was <hi>Joseph</hi> thirty years
old.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Joseph</hi> went out from the
presence of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and went
throughout all the land of Egypt,
and gathered provision in the seven
years of plenty, for the seven years
of famine that was to follow: and
unto <hi>Joseph</hi> was borne two sonnes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33120:78"/>
before the years of famine came:
and he called the name of the first
<hi>Manasseh,</hi> and the name of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Ephraim.</hi> After the famine
was over the land of Egypt, the
people cryed to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for bread,
and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> sent them to <hi>Joseph;</hi>
then <hi>Joseph</hi> opened all the store-houses,
and sold unto the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
and all Countries came into
Egypt to <hi>Joseph</hi> for to buy corne,

at home with <hi>Jacob:</hi> and the sonnes
of <hi>Israel</hi> came into Egypt unto <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
who sold the corne, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
downe themselves before him
with their faces to the earth: and
<hi>Joseph</hi> knew them to be his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33120:79"/>
but made himselfe strange
unto them, and spake roughly unto
them: and he said unto them,
Whence come ye? they said, From
the land of Canaan to buy food:
then said <hi>Joseph</hi> unto them, Ye
are spies: to see the nakednesse of
the land you are come: and they
said unto him, Nay, my lord, but
to buy food are thy servants come:
we are all one mens sonnes, we are
true men, thy servants are no spies:
and they said, Thy servants are
twelve brethren the sonnes of one
man in the land of Canaan, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
the youngest is this day with
our father, and one is not living.
And <hi>Joseph</hi> said unto them, Ye are
spies, hereby ye shall be proved:
By the life of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ye shall not
goe forth hence, except your
youngest brother come hither: and
he put them altogether three dayes
into prison, and <hi>Joseph</hi> said unto
them the third day, If ye be true
men, let one of your brethren stay
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33120:79"/>
here in prison, and goe ye and carry
corne for the provision of your
houses, and bring your youngest
brother to me, and they did so:
and they said, one to another, We
are verily guilty concerning our
brother <hi>Joseph,</hi> in that we saw the
anguish of his soul whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he besought
us, and we would not heare: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is this distresse come upon us.
And <hi>Reuben</hi> answered them saying,
spake I not unto you, saying do not
sin against the childe, and ye would
not heare, therefore behold all his
blood is required; and they knew
not that <hi>Joseph</hi> understood them,
for he spake unto them by an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter:
and he turned himself about
from them and wept, and returned
to them again, communing with
them, and tooke from them <hi>Simeon</hi>
and bound him before their eyes: so
<hi>Joseph</hi> dispatched them away with
their provisions, and commanded
their money to be put in their sacks:
and they laded their asses with corn

departed thence: and opening their
sacks and there finding their money
they were afraid, saying one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what is this that God hath
done unto us?</p>
            <p>And they came unto <hi>Jacob</hi> their
father, unto the land of Canaan, and
told him of that befell unto them:
but Jacob was troubled to part
with <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and said unto them
me have ye bereaved of my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>Joseph</hi> is not living, and <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

his father saying, kil my two sonnes
if I bring him not to thee: and he
said my sonne shall not goe downe
with you; for his brother is dead, if
mischiefe befall him in the way,
then shall ye bring down my gray
haires with sorrow to the grave.</p>
            <p>But the famine continuing sore in
the land,<note place="margin">Gen. 43.</note> and having spent that
which they brought out of Egypt,
<hi>Jacob</hi> said unto his sonnes go againe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33120:80"/>
and buy us some food in Egypt:
and <hi>Judah</hi> spake vnto him saying,
the man did solemnly protest unto
us, saying, Ye shall not see my face
except your brother be with you;
and <hi>Israel</hi> said, Wherefore dealt
you so ill with me, as to tell the

And they said, The man did aske us

and <hi>Judah</hi> said unto <hi>Israel</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Send the young man with me,
and we will arise and go, that we

him: if I bring him not to

for ever: and then father <hi>Israel</hi> said
unto them, If it must be so, Now
then doe this; Take of the best
fruit of the land in your vessels, and
carry downe the man a present: a

Spices and Myrrhe, Nuts and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds;

and take double money in

it was an oversight: take
also your brother and goe againe
unto the man; and God Almighty
give you mercy before the man,
that he may send away your other

            <p>And they took that present, and
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> and went downe to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
and stood before <hi>Joseph:</hi> and
when <hi>Joseph</hi> saw <hi>Benjamin</hi> with
them, he said to the Ruler of his
house, Bring these men home, kill
provision and make ready, for they
shall dine with me: and they were
brought thither, but were afraid by
reason of the money they carried
back in their sacks: and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned
with the Steward, and told
him of it: and he said, Peace be to

your money: and he brought <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi>
unto them: and he bringing
them into <hi>Josephs</hi> house, gave them
water to wash their feet, and he
gave their Asses provender.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Joseph</hi> came home
they brought him the present, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves to him to the earth:
and he asked them of their welfare,
and said, Is your father well, the

yet alive: and they answered, They

he is yet alive: and they bowed
downe their heads and made obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance;
and he lift up his eyes and
saw his brother <hi>Benjamin</hi> his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

spake unto me? they said, Yes: and
he said, God be gracious to thee
my sonne.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Joseph</hi> made haste, for his
bowels did yerne upon his brother,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33120:82"/>
and he sought where to weepe; and
he entered into his chamber and
wept there; after he washed his
face and came out, and refrained
himselfe; and said, set on bread:
and they set on for him by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and for them by themselves,
and the Egyptians that did eat with
him by themselves; because the
Egyptians might not eate bread
with the Hebrews: and they sate
in order according to their age, and
they sent messes unto them from

was five times as much as any of
theirs: and they dranke and were
merry with him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Joseph</hi> commanded his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

and to put in every sack their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
and to put a cup of silver in

saith my Lord these words? God
forbid that thy servants should doe
according to this thing. Behold,
the money which we found in our
sacks mouthes we brought againe
unto thee out of the land of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:
how then should we steale out
of thy Lords house, silver or gold?
with whomsoever of thy servants
it be found, both let him dye, and
we also will be my Lords bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Then they speedily tooke
downe their sacks, and opened eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man his sack; and he searched,
beginning at the eldest, and left at
the youngest; and the Cup was
found in <hi>Benjamins</hi> sack: then they
rent their clothes, and laded every
man his Asse, and returned to the
City.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:33120:83"/>
And <hi>Judah</hi> and his brethren
came to <hi>Josephs</hi> house, and they
fell before him to the ground: then
<hi>Joseph</hi> said unto them, What deed
is this that ye have done? wot ye
not that I can divine? and <hi>Judah</hi>
said, What shall we say unto my
Lord, what shall we speake? or
how shall we cleare our selves?
God hath found out the iniquity
of thy servants: Behold, we are
my Lords servants, both we and he
also with whom the Cup is found.
and he said, God forbid I should
doe so: but the man in whose hand
the cup is found, he shall be my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
and as for you, get you up
unto your father: then <hi>Judah</hi> came
neare unto him, and said, O my
Lord, let thy servant I pray thee,
speake a word in my Lords eares,
and let not thine anger burn against
thy servant; for thou art even as
<hi>Pharaoh:</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> said, our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was loath to part with <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi>
saying unto us, Ye know that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33120:83"/>
my wife bare me two sonnes, the
one is dead, and surely he is torne
in pieces for I saw him not since;
and if ye take this also from me,
and mischiefe befall him, ye shall
bring downe my gray haires with
sorrow to my grave: Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when I come to thy servant
my father, and the young man our
brother be not with us: seeing that
his life is bound up in the youths
life, that he will dye; for thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
became surety for the young
man unto my father, saying, If I
bring him not unto thee, then I
shall beare the blame to my father
for ever. Now therefore I pray
thee, let thy servant abide in stead of
<hi>Benjamin</hi> a bondman to my Lord:
and let the young man goe up with
his brethren: for how shall I goe
up to my father and this <hi>Benjamin</hi>
be not with me, lest peradventure I
see the evill that shall come to my
father.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Joseph</hi> could not refraine
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33120:84"/>
himselfe before all them that stood
by him: and he cryed, Cause eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man to goe out from me, and
there stood no man with him while
he made himselfe knowne to his
brethren, and he wept aloud; and
he said unto his brethren, I am <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
doth my father yet live; and
his brethren could not answer him,
for they were troubled at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
and <hi>Joseph</hi> said unto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
Come neare unto me I pray
you and he said: I am <hi>Joseph</hi> your
Brother whom you sold into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:
be not angry with your selves
that ye sold me hither, for God did
send me before you to preserve life:
for there is and shall continue a
great famine, And God sent me
before you to preserve you a poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
upon earth, and to save your
lives by a great deliverance. So it
was not you that sent me hither,
but God; he hath made me father
to King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and a Ruler in
Egypt: Haste you and goe up to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33120:84"/>
my father, and say unto him, thus
saith thy son <hi>Joseph,</hi> Come downe
to me and thou shalt dwell in the
land of Goshen, thou and thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and thy childrens children,
and thy flocks, and thy herds, and
all that thou haste.</p>
            <p>And you shall tell my father of
all my glory in Egypt, and of al that
you have seene; and ye shall haste
and bring downe my father hither.</p>
            <p>And he fell upon his brother
<hi>Benjamins</hi> neck and wept, and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi>
wept upon him: moreover,
he kissed all his brethren and wept
upon them: and after that his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
talked with him: and the
fame thereof came to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and
it pleased him and his servants: and
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> said <hi>Joseph,</hi> Bid your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
load their beasts and goe into
Canaan and bring your father and
all his families, and take wagons to
bring them, and all they have; for
they shall have the good of the land
of Egypt, and eat the fat thereof:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33120:85"/>
and <hi>Joseph</hi> gave them wagons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the commandment of
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and provision for the way,
with changes of raiments: But to
<hi>Benjamin</hi> he gave three hundred
pieces of silver, and five changes of
raiment: and to his father he sent
twenty Asses laden with good
things of Egypt: and provision for
his journey into Egypt: and they
went up out of the land of Egypt
unto the land of Canaan unto <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
their father, and told him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Joseph</hi> is yet alive, and he is
Governour over all the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:
and <hi>Jacobs</hi> heart fainted, for
he beleeved them not: and they
told him all the words of <hi>Joseph</hi>
which he had said unto them: and
when he saw the wagons which
<hi>Joseph</hi> sent to carry him, the spirit
of <hi>Jacob</hi> their father revived: and
Israel said, It is enough, <hi>Joseph</hi> my
sonne is yet alive, I will goe and see
him before I die.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Israel</hi> took his journey with<note place="margin">Gen. 46.</note>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:33120:85"/>
all that he had, and came to <hi>Beer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba</hi>
and offered sacrifices unto the
God of his father <hi>Isaac:</hi> and God
spake unto <hi>Israel</hi> in the visions of
the night, and said, <hi>Jacob, Jacob,</hi>
I am God, the God of thy father,
feare not to goe downe into Egypt,
for I will make thee a great Nation:
I will goe downe with thee into
Egypt: and I will also bring thee
surely up again, and <hi>Joseph</hi> shall
put his hands upon thine eyes.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Jacob</hi> departed from <hi>Beer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba</hi>
with all his families: with all
their cattell and goods, and came
into Egypt, <hi>Jacob</hi> and all his seed
with him: all the souls of the house
of <hi>Jacob</hi> which came into Egypt
were threescore and ten: and he
sent <hi>Judah</hi> before him to <hi>Joseph</hi> to
direct his face to <hi>Goshen:</hi> and they
came to the land of <hi>Goshen:</hi> and
<hi>Joseph</hi> made ready his chariot and
went up to meet <hi>Israel</hi> his father,
and presented himselfe unto him,
and he fell on his neck and wept;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33120:86"/>
and <hi>Israel</hi> said unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> Now
let me die since I have seene thy
face. And <hi>Joseph</hi> said unto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and to his fathers house, I
will goe up unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and tell
him, my father and you are come
hither: and when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> shall aske
you, What is your occupation?
Ye shall say, Thy servants trade
hath beene about cattell; that ye
may dwell in the land of <hi>Goshen:</hi> for
every Shepherd is an abomination
unto the Egyptians.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Joseph</hi> told <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of his
fathers coming into Egypt:<note place="margin">Gen. 47.</note> and
presented five of his brethren unto
him: and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said unto his
brethren, What is your occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
and they said, Thy servants

The famine is great in Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
now therefore we pray thee, let
thy servants dwel in the land of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shen.</hi>
And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> spake to <hi>Joseph,</hi>
saying, Thy father and thy brethren

            <p>And <hi>Joseph</hi> brought in <hi>Jacob</hi> his

and <hi>Jacob</hi> blessed <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>

            <p>And <hi>Jacob</hi> went out from before

               <hi>Joseph</hi>

was told of their coming, and he
strengthened himselfe and fate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<hi>Joseph,</hi> called for his two sonnes
to blesse them. Now the eyes of
<hi>Israel</hi> were dim for age so that he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:33120:87"/>
could not see: and <hi>Joseph</hi> brought
them neare unto him, and he kissed
them, and imbraced them: and <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
said unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> I had not
thought to see thy face, and loe
God hath shewed me also thy seed:
and <hi>Joseph</hi> brought them out from

himselfe with his face to the earth,
and <hi>Joseph</hi> tooke them both, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi>
in his right hand, towards
<hi>Israels</hi> left hand, and <hi>Manasseth</hi> in

him: and <hi>Israel</hi> stretched out his
right hand and laid it upon <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims</hi>
head who was the younger;
and his left hand upon <hi>Manassehs</hi>
head, guiding his hands wittingly,
and he blessed <hi>Joseph,</hi> and said,
God before whom my fathers <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>

my sonne, I know it: he also shall
become a people, and he also shall
be great: but truly his younger
brother shall be greater then he, and
his seede shall become a multitude

that day saying, in thee shall <hi>Israel</hi>

unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> Behold, I die, But God

Moreover, I have given to thee one

            <p>And <hi>Jacob</hi> called all his sonnes,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.</note>

and said, I am to be gathered unto

in the cave that is in the field
of <hi>Ephron</hi> the Hittit in the land of
Canaan, which <hi>Abraham</hi> bought
for a possession of a burying place:
there they buried <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
his wife: there they buried <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>

            <p>And <hi>Joseph</hi> fell upon his fathers

him: And <hi>Joseph</hi> commanded his
servants the Physicians to embalme
<hi>Israel:</hi> and fourty dayes were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
for him, (for so are fulfilled
the dayes of those which are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed)
and the Egyptians mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for him threescore and tenne
daies: and when the dayes of
mourning were past, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said
unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> Goe up and bury thy

<hi>Joseph</hi> went up to bury his father,
and with him went up all the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

land of Egypt; and all the house of
<hi>Joseph</hi> and his brethren, and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

they left in the land of <hi>Goshen:</hi> and
there went up with him both Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets
and Horsemen, and it was a
very great company: and they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33120:89"/>
came to the threshing floore of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad</hi>
which is beyond Jordan, and
there they mourned with a great

a mourning for his father seven
dayes: and his sons did unto him
according as he commanded them,
and carried him into the land of
Canaan, and buried him in the

            <p>And <hi>Joseph</hi> returned into Egypt,
he and his brethren, and all that
went up with him: and when <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi>
brethren saw their father was
dead, they said, Peradventure <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
will hate us, and will certainly
requite us all the evill which we
did to him: and they sent a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> saying, Thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did command before he died,
saying, so shall ye say unto <hi>Joseph,</hi>
Forgive, I pray thee, now the tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe

for they did unto thee evil: and
now we pray thee, forgive the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasse
of the servants of the God of

thy father: and <hi>Joseph</hi> wept when
they spake unto him: and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
also went and fell downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his face, and they said, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
we be thy servants: and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
said unto them, Feare not, for
I am in the place of God: but as for
you, ye thought evill against me,
but God meant it unto good to
bring to passe as it is this day, to
save much people alive. Now
therefore feare you not, I will nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
you and your little ones: and
he comforted them.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Joseph</hi> dwelt in Egypt he
and his fathers house, and lived
one hundred and ten yeares, and
saw <hi>Ephraims</hi> children of the third
generation: and the children of
<hi>Machir</hi> the sonne of <hi>Manasseh,</hi>
were brought up upon <hi>Josephs</hi>
knees.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Joseph</hi> said unto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
I die; and God will surely
visit you, and bring you out of this

to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> and
<hi>Joseph</hi> took an oath of the children

            <p>So <hi>Joseph</hi> died, being one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

Pilgrimage, to the Rules of Jesus
Christ, and the governors of his holy
Church, as thou O Lord, hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
not following my owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
nor the suggestions of my spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
enemy that cloaths himselfe like an
Angel of light, to deceive, and fill my
soule full of spirituall pride, the sin that
cast downe the Angels from heaven:
from which most dangerous rock, O
Lord, deliver thy servant, that puts
his trust under the shadow of thy wings
of mercy: that at last I may come with
humblenesse of heart and soule, through
the wildernesse of this world, so full of
cares, troubles, and temptations, to the
land of promise, that heavenly <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
which thou hast prepared for
them that love and feare thee, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33120:93"/>
fight a good fight through this desart
of danger and diffidence; let me not
in this passage, O Lord, leane to the
pleasures and plenty of <hi>Goshen,</hi> but
obey thy lawes delivered at Mount
<hi>Sinai,</hi> and chearfully goe on like a good
<hi>Israelite,</hi> in this my passage the which
so much concerns my soule, so that, good
Lord, by a true faith and confidence in
thee, with a happy perseverance in the
obedience of thy Commandements, at
last I may arrive amongst them, that
live and feare thee, in that heavenly
feast of tabernacles, and receive the
comfort of that blessed saying, Come
ye blessed of my Father; and in that
heavenly and eternal habitation, where
all teares shall be wiped away, and all
afflictions and temptations cease, sing
Halleluiah, and praise, and honour,
and glory, and worship, unto
the Lambe that sits
upon the throne
for ever.</p>

the children of Israel
did increase exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
in Egypt, and
grew very mightily:
and another King reigning after the
death of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he was jealous of
their greatnesse and strength, and
therefore set task-masters over
them to afflict them with their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
and to keepe them under, in
so much as they made their lives
bitter with hard bondage by work
in morter and brick, and all manner
of service in the field with much
rigour: and the King in his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
of them, commanded the
Midwives to kil the male children,
and to save the daughters, that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:33120:95"/>
should be borne of the Israelites:
but the midwives feared God, and
would not doe his commands: but
excused it to the King.</p>
            <p>And there was a man of the
house of <hi>Levi</hi> that took to him a<note place="margin">Exod. 2.</note>
wife of his owne tribe, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and bare him a sonne being
a goodly childe, whom for fear she
hid three moneths: but when she
could not longer hide him, she
made for him an arke of bulrushes,
daubing it with slime and pitch,
putting the childe therein, and laid
it amongst the flags by the rivers
side.</p>
            <p>And his sister stood a farre off to
see what would become of the
childe. And <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter
coming downe the river with her
maides to wash her selfe, found the
arke, and sent her maids to fetch it:
and opening of it found the childe,
who wept, and she had compassion
on him, and said, This is one of
the Hebrews children: and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:33120:95"/>
daughter commanded the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
that watcht the childe, to call
an Hebrew woman to nurse it; and
she went and called the childes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter said
unto her, Take this childe and
nurse it for me, and I will give thee
thy wages: and the woman tooke
the childe and nursed it: and the
childe grew, and she brought him
to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, who took
him for her son, and called his name
<hi>Moses;</hi> because she drew him out
of the water.</p>
            <p>Now after he grew to yeares,
when the Israelites had hard bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
upon them, he went out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, and seeing an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian
strike an Hebrew, one of
his brethren, who warily looking
about him, and seeing no body,
he slew the Egyptian and hid him
in the sand.</p>
            <p>And the second day going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
he saw two Hebrews at strif:
and he said to him that had done
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33120:96"/>
the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou
thy fellow? who answered, Who
made thee a Judge over us? Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thou to kill me as thou didst
the Egyptian? then <hi>Moses</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
and when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> heard of
it, he sought to kill <hi>Moses,</hi> but he
fled from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and dwelt in the
land of Midian: and there sitting
downe by a well, came seven
daughters of the Midian Priest,
who drew water into troughs to
water their fathers flock: but there
came other shepherds and drave
them away: But <hi>Moses</hi> stood up
and helped them, and watered their
flock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> who returning to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he asked the reason they came
so soone back, and they told him,
that a certaine Egyptian had help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them: and he commanded to
call him to his house to eate bread:
who came and dwelt with him:
and he gave <hi>Moses Zipporah</hi> his
daughter to wife, by whom he had
a sonne called <hi>Gershom.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:33120:96"/>
Now after this <hi>Pharaoh</hi> died, and
the children of Israel were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
grieved by reason of their
great bondage; and they cryed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, who heard them, and
remembred his covenant with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Moses</hi> keeping the flock
of his father in law,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> and leading
them to the back side of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
he came to Horeb the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of God: where appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him an Angel of the Lord in a
flame of fire in the middle of a
bush: and <hi>Moses</hi> turned towards it,
to see why the bush was not burnt:
then God called unto him out of
the middest of the bush, and said,
<hi>Moses, Moses,</hi> draw not nigh hither:
put off thy shooes from off thy feet,
for the place whereon thou standest
is holy ground: and told him, I am
the God of thy father, the God of
<hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> Then
<hi>Moses</hi> hid his face, for he was afraid
to looke upon God: and God said
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:33120:97"/>
unto him, I have seene the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of my people which are in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
and have heard their cry, by
reason of their task-masters: and
told <hi>Moses</hi> that he would send him
to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to bring his people
of Israel out of Egypt: and <hi>Moses</hi>
said unto God, Who am I that I
should goe unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and
that I should bring forth the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel out of Egypt? and
God told him he would be with
him, and that for a token thereof,
after he had brought them out of
Egypt, they should serve God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that mountaine: and <hi>Moses</hi>
said unto God, When I come unto
the children of Israel, how shall
they beleeve me? then said the
Lord, Say unto them, <hi>I am,</hi> hath
sent me unto you.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Moses</hi> answered and said,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
they will not beleeve me, nor
hearken unto my voyce: and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
having a Rod in his hand, the
Lord commanded him to cast it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33120:97"/>
upon the ground; and it became a
serpent, and <hi>Moses</hi> went from it.</p>
            <p>And the Lord said unto him, Put
forth thy hand and take it by the
taile: the which he did, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Rod againe.</p>
            <p>And the Lord said more to him,
Put thy hand into thy bosome, the
which he did, and when he tooke
it out, his hand was leprous as
snow: and he said, put thy hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy bosome againe, the which
he did, and it became as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
yet neverthelesse <hi>Moses</hi> was
very scrupulous to goe: Excusing
himselfe that he wanted eloquence
and was slow of tongue: and the
Lord said unto him, Who hath
made mans mouth, who maketh
the dumbe, or deafe; the seeing, or
the blind, but I the Lord? and the
anger of the Lord was kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Moses,</hi> and then he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Aaron</hi> to joyne with him, and to
assist him in this great worke, for
the deliverance of the children of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33120:98"/>
Israel out of Egypt. And so <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
returned to <hi>Jethro</hi> his father in
law, to desire leave to go into Egypt
to see his brethren, who bid him
goe in peace. And <hi>Moses</hi> returned
towards Egypt with his wife and
children, and the Rod in his hand,
with command from God to doe
wonders before the King of Egypt:
And <hi>Aaron</hi> met <hi>Moses</hi> in the mount
of God, and kissed him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> telling him, all the words
of the Lord who had sent him: and
all the signes he had commanded
him: And then they two gathered
all the Elders of Israel together, and
did the signes in sight of all the
people, who beleeved them, and
worshipped God, for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>After that they went to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
desiring they and the children of
Israel might hold a Fast unto the
Lord in the wildernesse. But he
would not obey the message and
voice of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:33120:98"/>
And they said againe, The God
of the Hebrews hath met with us,
let us go, we pray thee, three dayes
journey into the Desert, to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
unto our God lest he lay his
plagues upon us, of pestilence and
sword: but <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart was
hardned, and would not let them
goe, and added more to their work,
whereof they complained mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> But he said, Ye are
now idle, therefore ye say, Let us
goe and doe sacrifice to the Lord:
and the people murmured at <hi>Moses</hi>
because their task was greater since
his coming to them; and <hi>Moses</hi> was
much troubled thereat.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord spake unto <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 6.</note>
and told him of all his promises
unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, to give
the land of Canaan; and of the
bondage of Israel in Egypt, and his
Covenant, and sent him againe to
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let the children of Israel
goe out of his land: but all this
while the children of Israel did
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33120:99"/>
mightily murmur against <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron; Moses</hi> was then fourescore
yeares old, and <hi>Aaron</hi> fourescore
and three.</p>
            <p>And they went both unto <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
againe, and <hi>Aaron</hi> cast down
his Rod before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a serpent: and the sorcerers
of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did the like with their
inchantments: But <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod
swallowed up all theirs.</p>
            <p>And as God commanded, <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron</hi> in the morning they met
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> at the water, and at the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
side, and desired that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Israel might goe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God in the wildernesse.</p>
            <p>But he refused, then he smote
the waters in the sight of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
and they were turned into
blood; and the fish died, and the
river stanke; yet <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart was
hardened: this continued for seven
dayes, in which time they digged
for water to drinke.</p>
            <p>And the Lord commanded <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 8.</note>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:33120:99"/>
to goe againe unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to
let the people of Israel goe, and still
his heart was hardened: and <hi>Aaron</hi>
stretched forth his hand with the
Rod over the ponds, and caused
frogs to come over the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;
and the Magicians did th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
like: then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> called for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and said Intreat the
Lord that he may take away the
frogs from me and my people, and
I will let the people goe that they
may doe service unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> said, That thou mayst
know that there is none like the
Lord our God, the frogs shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
but onely they shall remaine
in the rivers; and the Lord did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the word of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Lord commanded to
say unto <hi>Aaron</hi> to stretch out his
Rod and smite the dust of the land,
that it may be lice thorowout all
Egypt, and it was so: and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
attempted to doe the like but
could not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:33120:100"/>
And they told the King it was
the finger of God; yet he hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not unto them.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord commanded <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
to goe early in the morning unto
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> as he came forth and speak
to him, that the people of Israel
might goe to serve him; and to tell
him what plagues otherwise would
follow; but still his heart was har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened:
then there came a grievous
swarme of flies into the house of
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and into all the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;
and the land was corrupted
by reason of the flies.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> called for <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and said, Goe ye sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to your God in the land: But
<hi>Moses</hi> said, they desired to go three
dayes journey; for it was an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to the Egyptians to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in their land; and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> let
them goe; desiring <hi>Moses</hi> to intreat

did, and the flies departed out of
the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:33120:100"/>
Yet againe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hardened his
heart and would not let them goe:<note place="margin">Exod. 9.</note>
then all the cattell of the land of
Egypt died; but of the cattell of the
children of Israel died not one: yet
was <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart hardened, and
would not let them goe.</p>
            <p>Then as the Lord commanded,
<hi>Moses</hi> took ashes of the furnace and
stood before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and sprinkled
it up towards heaven, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
boiles and blames upon man
and beast, and upon the Magicians.</p>
            <p>And stil was the heart of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
hardened, and would not let
the children of Israel goe: and
<hi>Moses</hi> stretched forth his Rod,
and the Lord sent thunder and
haile, and the fire ran along upon
the ground; so there was fire and
haile mingled together, such as was
not since the land of Egypt became
a nation: and it smote both man
and beast, and every herbe, and
brake downe the trees: onely in
the land of <hi>Goshen</hi> where the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:33120:101"/>
of Israel were, was none.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> sent for <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron,</hi> and said unto them, I have
sinned, the Lord is righteous; I
and my people are wicked: Intreat
the Lord for me, and I will let
ye goe.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> went out of the city,
and spread his hands unto the Lord,
and the thunder and haile ceased:
yet neverthelesse <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart
was again hardened; neither would
he let the children of Israel goe.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 10.</note> and said thus
unto him: Thus saith the Lord
God of the Hebrews, How long
wilt thou refuse to humble thy selfe
before me? let my people goe that
they may serve me: and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
perswaded him to let them
goe, but he refused to heare them.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Moses</hi> stretcht forth his
Rod, over the land of Egypt, and
there came an East winde which
brought in Locusts which went
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33120:101"/>
over the land of Egypt, and the
land was darkened: and they left
no greene thing upon the land.
Then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> called againe for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron</hi> in haste, and said, I
have sinned against the Lord your
God, and you: forgive my sinne,
and entreat the Lord for me.</p>
            <p>The which <hi>Moses</hi> did, and the
Lord sent a mighty West winde
which did drive the locusts into the
Red Sea: but yet would not <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
let the children of Israel goe.
Then the Lord commanded <hi>Moses</hi>
to stretch forth his hand towards
heaven; and there was a thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
throughout the land of Egypt
three dayes; but all the children of
Israel had light in their dwellings.
Then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> called unto <hi>Moses,</hi>
and said to him, Goe ye, and serve
the Lord, onely let your flocks and
herds stay here: but <hi>Moses</hi> refused
that, and said, they must have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
for the Lord and all their

them goe, but bid <hi>Moses</hi> to see his
face no more.</p>
            <p>And the Lord commanded <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
to speake to all the children of
Israel,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> upon the tenth day of the
moneth, to take every house a
lambe, a male lambe without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,
and to keep it untill the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth

evening, and to take the blood with
a bunch of hyssop and strike it on
the two side posts, and upon the
upper post of the doore; and that
they shall eat the flesh that night
rosted with unleavened bread, and
bitter herbs: That they shall eat it
with their loins girded, shooes on
their feet, and staves in their hands,
and in haste, for it is the Lords
Passeover.</p>
            <p>For the blood upon the posts shall
be a token that the Lord would
passe in mercy by them, when the
Egyptians should be destroyed.</p>
            <p>And after the performance of
many other ceremonies before the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33120:102"/>
eating of the Passeover, it came
to passe that at midnight the Lord
smote all the first-borne of Egypt;
and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> rose up in the night,
and all the Egyptians, and there
was a great cry: then the children
of Israel, according as they were
commanded, departed, taking their
dough before it was levened, and
the kneading troughes upon their
shoulders, with great store of Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
they had from the Egyptians.
And they journied towards <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coth,</hi>
being in number about six
hundred thousand on foot, besides
children: after they had beene in
Egypt foure hundred and thirty
yeares.</p>
            <p>But they went not the nearest
way by the land of the Philistines:
but about through the wildernesse
of the Red Sea.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> took the bones of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
along with him: and they
came from <hi>Succoth</hi> in <hi>Ethem</hi> in the
edge of the wildernesse, and there

encamped: and the Lord went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them by day in a pillar of a
cloud; and by night in a pillar of
fire.</p>
            <p>And when King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> heard
they were gone,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> he made ready six
hundred chosen Chariots, &amp; all the
Chariots of Egypt and Captains
over them, and a great army, and
the children of Israel coming neare
the Red Sea, the Egyptians over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
them: and they were afraid,
and cryed unto the Lord, and did
murmur against <hi>Moses</hi> exceedingly:
thinking it better to have staid in
Egypt: but <hi>Moses</hi> comforted them:
then the Lord commanded them
to march, and <hi>Moses</hi> to lift up his
Rod, and to stretch out his hand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Sea, and the Angel, and the
pillar of the Cloud which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
removed and stood behinde
them: and the Lord caused the Sea
to go back by a strong East winde,
and it was dry land, and the waters
were divided, and the children of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33120:103"/>
Israel went into the middest of it
upon the dry ground, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were as a wal on every side; and
the Egyptians followed them: but
by Gods will, when they were in
the middle of the water their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
wheels fell off: in the morning
when all Israel was over, <hi>Moses</hi>
stretched forth his hand and the
waters closed up, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and
all his Army were drowned: and
when Israel saw this great worke
they feared the Lord, and beleeved
him, and his servant <hi>Moses:</hi> and
<hi>Moses</hi> and the children of Israel
sang praises unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>After which <hi>Moses</hi> brought the
children of Israel three dayes into
the wildernesse and found no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;<note place="margin">Exod. 15.</note>
and when they came to Marah
the water was bitter, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
murmured against <hi>Moses:</hi> and
hee prayed unto the Lord, and
the Lord shewed him a tree the
which he cast into the water and
they were made sweet. And then
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33120:104"/>
they came to Elim, where were
twelve wells of water, and seventy
Palme trees, and there incamped:
from thence they came to the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
of Sin, which is betweene
Elim and Sinai, being the fifteenth
day of the second moneth, there the
people of Israel did murmur at
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> repenting they
came from the flesh pots of Egypt;
then <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> said unto
them, At even ye shall know that
the Lord hath brought you out
from the land of Egypt; and what
are we that ye murmur thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us?</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Aaron</hi> was speaking to
them, they looking towards the
wildernesse, the glory of the Lord
did appeare in the cloud: and it
came to passe that in the evening
the Quailes came up and covered
the Campe, and in the morning the
dew lay round about the host.</p>
            <p>And after the dew was gone,
there lay a small round thing like
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33120:104"/>
the frost of the ground, and they
said one to another, It is Manna.
And <hi>Moses</hi> said unto them, This is
the bread the Lord hath given you
to eat, gather thereof: and he that
gathered much had nothing over,
and he that gathered little had no
want.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> commanded them to leave
none untill the morning: but some
of them did not hearken to him,
but kept of it till morning and it
bred wormes and stanke: and this
Manna was not to be found upon
the seventh day.</p>
            <p>It tasted like wafers made with
hony.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> spake unto <hi>Aaron</hi> to
keep in a pot an Omer full of it
therein, and lay it before the Lord
to be kept for their generations. So
<hi>Aaron</hi> laid it up before the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to be kept: the children of
Israel did eat Manna fourty years,
untill they came to the borders of
Canaan.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:33120:105"/>
And the children of Israel jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
from Sin, and came to Rephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim,
and there was no water to
drinke: wherefore the people did
chide with <hi>Moses,</hi> and murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> cried unto the Lord,
saying, What shall I doe with this
people? they be almost ready to
stone me: and the Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to call the Elders of Israel
and goe to the Rock in Horeb; and
smite the Rock, and there shall
come water out of it for the people
to drink: and <hi>Moses</hi> did so in the
sight of the Elders of Israel.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Amalek</hi> came to fight with
Israel, and <hi>Moses</hi> bade <hi>Joshua</hi> goe
and meet them with a chosen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and <hi>Joshua</hi> did so, and fought
with him: and <hi>Moses</hi> stood upon
an hill with <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> and had
his Rod in his hand, and in the
fight whiles he held up his hand the
men of Israel prevailed, but when
he let it downe <hi>Amalek</hi> prevailed.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33120:105"/>
But <hi>Moses</hi> hands being heavy they
took a stone and put it under him,
and he sate thereon, and <hi>Aaron</hi>
and <hi>Hur</hi> staid up his hands of each
side; and they were steady untill
the going down of the Sunne: and
<hi>Joshua</hi> discomfited <hi>Amalek.</hi> There
<hi>Moses</hi> built an Altar and called it
<hi>Joshua Nissi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Jethro</hi> father in law to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 18.</note>
his wife with his two sonnes,
came unto Moses into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
where he encamped at the
mount of God, where they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
one another with great love:
<hi>Moses</hi> telling him of all what God
had done for Israel, by delivering
them from the hands of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi>
and <hi>Jethro</hi> sacrificed to the Lord,
and blessed the Lord God of Israel:
and <hi>Aaron</hi> came, and all the Elders
of Israel to eate bread with <hi>Jethro:</hi>
but <hi>Jethro</hi> seeing <hi>Moses</hi> sit in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amongst the people from
morning to evening: he perswaded
<hi>Moses</hi> to take some helpers, and not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33120:106"/>
to weare himselfe out: which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
he followed; onely when mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of great difficulty came to be
heard, <hi>Moses</hi> heard them: and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro</hi>
departed from <hi>Moses</hi> and went
into his owne land.</p>
            <p>After this the children of Israel
removed,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> and came to the desart of
Sinai, and encamped before the
mount: and <hi>Moses</hi> went up unto
God, who spake unto him, and
bad him tell the sonnes of <hi>Jacob</hi>
what he had done for them; and if
they served him, he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his mercies exceedingly unto
them: and <hi>Moses</hi> told the people
what the Lord said, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
answered together: We will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the Lord. And <hi>Moses</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the words of the people unto the
Lord: then he commanded him to
sanctifie the people unto the Lord,
and to be ready against the third
day, for then he would come down
in the sight of all the people upon
mount Sinai: but commanded
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33120:106"/>
bounds to be set about the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that the people should not
come upon the Mount, nor touch
the borders of it lest they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed;
onely <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
were to goe up: and <hi>Moses</hi> sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ied
the people, and bid them be
ready the third day; and that day
in the morning was thundering and
lightning, and a thick cloud upon
the mount, and the voice of the
trumpet exceeding loud, so that all
the people trembled.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> brought forth the
people to meet with God, and they
stood at the bottome of it: and the
mountaine was altogether on a
smoke, for the Lord descended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it in fire: and the whole mount
quaked greatly: and the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Moses</hi> unto him to the top of
the mount: and the Lord said unto
<hi>Moses,</hi> Goe downe, charge the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
lest they breake thorough to
gaze, and perish: so <hi>Moses</hi> did as
the Lord commanded: and then
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33120:107"/>
God commanded <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
to come up: then was delivered
unto them by word from God, the
Ten Commandements.</p>
            <p>And the people being much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of the thundrings, lightnings,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note>
and sound of trumpet; and smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the mountaine, they remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and stood afarre off: and they
said unto <hi>Moses,</hi> Speake thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, and we will heare: but let
not God speake with us lest we die.
And <hi>Moses</hi> said unto the people,
Feare not, for God is come to prove
you, and that his feare may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your faces, that ye sinne not:
and the people stood afarre off, and
<hi>Moses</hi> drew neare unto the thick
darknesse where God was, and
there the Lord taught unto <hi>Moses</hi>
his lawes and ordinances to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the people.</p>
            <p>After this the Lord commanded
<hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 24.</note> with <hi>Aaron, Nadab</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bihu,</hi>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33120:107"/>
to worship a farre off; and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
above came neare the Lord.</p>
            <p>And returning from the Lord,
<hi>Moses</hi> wrote all the words of the
Lord, and rose up early in the
morning, and built an Altar under
the hill, and twelve pillars accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the twelve Tribes of Israel.</p>
            <p>And he sent young men of the
children of Israel, which offered
burnt offerings, and sacrificed
peace offerings of oxen unto the
Lord: and the Lord again said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Moses,</hi> Come up to me into the
mount and I will give thee Tables
of stone, and the Law and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
which I have written
that thou mayest teach them: and
<hi>Moses</hi> with <hi>Joshua</hi> his minister went
up to the mount of God; and said
unto the Elders, Tarry ye here for
us, untill we returne: <hi>Aaron</hi> and
<hi>Hur</hi> are with you: If any man have
any matters to doe, let him come
unto them.</p>
            <p>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Moses</hi> went up into the mount
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:33120:108"/>
and a cloud covered it: and the
glory of the Lord abode upon
mount Sinai: and the cloud cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it six dayes, and the seventh day
he called unto <hi>Moses</hi> out of the
middest of the cloud, and the sight
of the glory of the Lord was like a
devouring fire on the top of the
mount, in the eyes of all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> was in the mount
fourty dayes, and fourty nights.</p>
            <p>And after his returne, he by
Gods appointment, set downe
Lawes, and Ordinances, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
for the people of Israel
to keepe.</p>
            <p>Now whilest <hi>Moses</hi> was in the
mount,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> the people gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
together to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and said,
Make us gods to goe before us: for
as for this <hi>Moses</hi> that brought us
out of Egypt, we wot not what is
become of him: and <hi>Aaron</hi> to
please them, bade them breake off
their eare-rings, which they did,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33120:108"/>
and of them did make a Calfe, and
did worship it: and the people sate
downe to eate and to drinke, and
rose up to play.</p>
            <p>And the Lord said unto <hi>Moses,</hi>
Goe, get thee downe, for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
thou broughtest out of Egypt
have corrupted themselves, and are
quickly turned aside, out of the
way which I commanded: they
are a stiffe-necked people, and the
Lords wrath was growing hot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them to consume them. But
<hi>Moses</hi> besought the Lord his God
to spare this people, whom he had
brought out of the land of Egypt
with such power and might: and
to be mercifull unto them for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> sake: and
the Lord heard the prayers of <hi>Moses</hi>
for them.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> coming downe from
the mount with the two Tables of
the Law, the worke and writings
of God: <hi>Joshuah</hi> hearing the noise
of the people as they shouted, he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33120:109"/>
said unto <hi>Moses,</hi> There is a noise
of warre in the Campe: but <hi>Moses</hi>
said, No, it is the noise of them that
sing: and as hee came neare the
Campe he saw the Calfe and the
dancing, and <hi>Moses</hi> anger waxed
hot; and he cast the Tables out of
his hands and brake them beneath
the mount: and he took the Calfe
which they had made, and burnt it
in the fire, and ground it to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and strewed it upon the water,
and made the children of Israel
drinke of it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> said unto <hi>Aaron,</hi>
What did this people unto thee
that thou hast brought so great a
sinne upon them? and <hi>Aaron</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
Let not the anger of my
lord waxe hott, thou knowest the
people that they are set on mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Moses</hi> stood in the gate of
the Campe, and said, Who is on
the Lords side? and goe in and out
from gate to gate thorough the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33120:109"/>
Campe, and slay every man his
brother, and every man his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
and every man his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
and the children of <hi>Levi</hi>
who were consecrated, did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the word of <hi>Moses:</hi> and
there fell of the people that day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three thousand men.</p>
            <p>And on the morrow <hi>Moses</hi> said
unto the people, You have sinned
a great sinne, and now I will goe
up unto the Lord, peradventure I
shall make an attonement for your
sinne: and <hi>Moses</hi> went up and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the people: and the Lord
commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to leade the
people forth, and sent his Angel
with him.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Moses</hi> tooke the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
and pitched it without the
Campe a farre off,<note place="margin">33.</note> and every one
that sought the Lord went out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Tabernacle: and when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
went unto the Tabernacle, the
people rose up, and stood at their
tent doores looking after <hi>Moses</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33120:110"/>
he went into the Tabernacle;
and the cloudy pillar descended
and stood at the doore of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
whiles the Lord talked
with <hi>Moses;</hi> then every man rose
up and worshipped in his tent
doore.</p>
            <p>The Lord commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to

morning to come unto mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,<note place="margin">34.</note>
but not any man to come up
with him; neither any man to be
seene thorowout all the mount:
neither that the flocks or herds
should feed before the mount: the
which was done, and <hi>Moses</hi> went
up unto the Lord; and it came to
passe when <hi>Moses</hi> came down from
the mount with the two Tables of
the Testimony, his face shone, and
and <hi>Aaron</hi> and the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
were affraid to come near him,
but he put a vaile over his head, and

            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:33120:110"/>
Then the children of Israel migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily<note place="margin">35.</note>
gave themselves to the adoring

of Israel thorowout all their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Moses</hi> consecrated <hi>Aaron</hi>
and his sonnes,<note place="margin">Levit. 8.</note> and girded them
with girdles, clothed them with
robes, and put the Ephod upon
them; and the Brest-plate of Urim

            </p>
            <p>In the wildernesse of mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,
in the Tabernacle the Lord
commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to take the
number of the children of Israel:<note place="margin">Numb. 1.</note>
their males by name, every one by
the poll from twenty yeares and
upward, fit for warre: and the
whole number was six hundred

who were appointed over the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
of the Testimony, to bear
the Tabernacle and the vessels

            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe

all the first borne among the

children of Israel; the males from

were twenty two thousand two

            <p>And the Lord commanded <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
to make two silver Trumpets to
call the people together,<note place="margin">10.</note> and for
their marches.</p>
            <p>And the cloud being by God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up from off the Tabernacle of
the Testimony, the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
tooke their journeys out of the
wildernesse of Sinai, and the cloud
rested in the wildernesse of Paran,
the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> marching first
with their Standard; and after them
the Tribes in order.</p>
            <p>And they departed from the
mount of the Lord three dayes
journey,<note place="margin">11.</note> and the Arke of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of the Lord went before
them to search out a resting place
for them: and when the Arke went

               </gap>ested he said, Returne, O Lord,

            <p>After this the children of Israel
did murmur and long after the flesh
pots of Egypt.<note place="margin">11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> heard the people
weepe every man in the doore of
his tent, and the anger of the Lord
was greatly kindled; and <hi>Moses</hi> was
much grieved, by reason of the
great burthen that was upon him,
of so great a people.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord commanded se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
of the Elders of Israel to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him, upon whom was the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

murmuring: and <hi>Moses</hi> with the
Elders came into the Campe, and
there went forth a winde from the
Lord which brought Quailes from
the Sea, which fell by the Campe
in very great plenty, and the people
gathered abundantly of them: and
whiles the flesh was betweene their
teeth, the wrath of the Lord was
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33120:112"/>
kindled against them, and smote
them with a great plague.</p>
            <p>And it came to passe that <hi>Miriam</hi>

he married an Ethiopian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and the anger of the Lord
was against them; and <hi>Miriam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
leprous.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Aaron</hi> said unto <hi>Moses,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,

the sinne upon us wherein we have
done foolishly. And <hi>Moses</hi> cryed
unto the Lord. Then <hi>Miriam</hi> was
sent out of the Campe 7. dayes, the
people journeying not, but after
that time she returning, the Campe
removed and pitched in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Paran.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord commanded

pomegarnets and figges, and did
give relation of the land: and some
of them spake very doubtfull of the
land, and put the people in feare.</p>
            <p>Insomuch as the Congregation
wept and murmured against <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi>
               <note place="margin">14.</note> and wished they had
died in the land of Egypt, or in the

into Egypt: then <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
fell on their faces before all the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of the Congregation of
Israel; and <hi>Joshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> who
had searched the land, rent their
clothes, and commended the land
exceedingly to the people, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
them not to rebell against the
Lord. But they bade stone them
with stones, and the wrath of the
Lord was kindled against them:
But <hi>Moses</hi> prayed earnestly to the
Lord for this people, and he heard
him, and pardoned them.</p>
            <p>But the Lord said, Because all
those men which have seene my

did in Egypt and in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and have tempted me now
these ten times, and have not

<hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi> because they have
followed me, them will I bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the land whereinto they went,

the children of Israel, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
murmured exceedingly, and
contrary to the command of <hi>Moses,</hi>
got up into the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
repenting and being ready to
goe to the place the Lord had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised:
but the Arke of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
staid behinde in the Campe;
then the Amalekites, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites

them.</p>
            <p>It came to passe afterwards Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,<note place="margin">16.</note>
Dathan and Abiram, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the children of Israel, with
two hundred and fifty of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the assembly, men of fame
and renoune gathered themselves
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:33120:114"/>
against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> saying
unto them, Ye take too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, seeing all the congregation
is holy: wherefore then lift ye up
your selves above the congregation
of the Lord: then <hi>Moses</hi> said unto
them, even to morrow the Lord
will shew who are his, and who are
holy: and <hi>Moses</hi> said unto Korah,
Heare I pray you, ye sons of Levi.</p>
            <p>Seemeth it but a small thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you that the God of Israel hath
brought you so neare himselfe to
doe the service of the Tabernacle of
the Lord, and to stand before the
congregation to minister unto
them; and seeke ye the Priesthood
also? And <hi>Moses</hi> sent for Dathan
and Abiram, but they would not
come up; but murmured against
<hi>Moses,</hi> for bringing them out of the
land of Egypt.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> was much troubled,
and said unto Korah, Be thou and
all thy company before the Lord
with <hi>Aaron</hi> to morrow, and bring
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33120:114"/>
each of you your Censer, putting
Incense therein: and they did so,
putting fire in them, and stood in
the doore of the Tabernacle of the
congregation with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;</hi>
and the glory of the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
unto them: and the Lord
spake unto <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Separate your selves from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
this congregation that I may
consume them in a moment. And
they fell upon their faces, and said,
O God, of the spirits of all flesh,
shall one man sin, and wilt thou be
wroth with all the congregation?
And God commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to
bring the people from the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of Korah, Dathan and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,
and he did so. And all the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Israel followed him: and he
spake unto them, saying, Depart I
pray you from the tents of these
wicked men, and touch nothing of
theirs lest ye be consumed.</p>
            <p>And so they departed and stood
in the doores of their Tents, their
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33120:115"/>
wives and their children: and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
said, Hereby ye shall know that
the Lord hath sent me to doe all
those workes, for I have not done
them of my owne minde; if these
men die the common death of all
men, or if they be visited after the
visitation of all men, then the Lord
hath not sent me: but if the Lord
make a new thing, and the earth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
her mouth and swallow them
up, with all that appertaine to
them, and they goe downe quicke
into the pit, then shall ye under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that these men have provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

               </gap>ord.</p>
            <p>And it came to passe as he had
made an end of speaking all these
words, that the ground clave asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that was under them, and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them up, their houses and
their goods: and the earth closed
upon them, and they perished from
among the congregation; and there
came a fire out from the Lord, and
consumed the two hundred and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33120:115"/>
fifty men that offered incense; and
as God commanded, <hi>Eleazer</hi> the
sonne of <hi>Aaron</hi> tooke the censers
out of the fire, and made of them
broad plates to cover the Altar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were formerly hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and to be a memoriall to all
the children of Israel, that no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
which is not of the seed of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
come neare to offer incense be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, that he be not as
Korah and as his company.</p>
            <p>But on the morrow after this
great judgement fell upon Korah,
the congregation murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> saying,
They had killed the people of the
Lord. And they being gathered
together, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> looked
towards the Tabernacle, and the
cloud covered it, and the glory of
the Lord appeared. And <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron</hi> came before the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of the congregation: and the
Lord spake unto <hi>Moses</hi> saying,
Get you up from among this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33120:116"/>
that I may consume them
in a moment; and they fell upon
their faces, and <hi>Moses</hi> bade <hi>Aaron</hi>
to take a Censer, and put fire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
from of the Altar, and put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
and go quickly unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and make an attonement
for them, for that wrath was gone
out from the Lord, and the plague
was begun: and <hi>Aaron</hi> did as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
commanded, and ran into the
middest of the congregation, but
the plague was begun among the
people; and then he put on incense
and made an attonement for the
people, and stood betweene the
dead and the living, and the plague
ceased. Now they that died of the
plague were foureteene thousand
and seven hundred, besides them
that died about the matter of Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah:
and <hi>Aaron</hi> returned unto
<hi>Moses</hi> to the doore of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
and the plague stayed.</p>
            <p>And the Lord commanded <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
to speake unto the children of<note place="margin">Num. 17.</note>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:33120:116"/>
Israel, to bring twelve rods, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Tribe one, and thereon to
write their names, and to write <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi>
name upon the rod of Levi;
and to lay them up in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
before the Testimony: and
the Lord said, That the mans rod
whom he shall chuse, shall be the
chiefe, and shall blossome, thereby
to make the children of Israel cease
from murmuring against <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron;</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> did as the Lord
commanded, and every one of the
Princes gave him a rod according
to their fathers houses, <hi>Aarons</hi> rod
being amongst them: and <hi>Moses</hi>
laid the rods before the Lord in the
Tabernacle of witnesse: and going
on the morrow into the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
the rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> for the
house of <hi>Levi</hi> was budded, brought
forth buds bloomed, and yielded
Almonds: and <hi>Moses</hi> brought them
forth, and they tooke every man his
rod: but the Lord bade <hi>Moses</hi> to
bring back <hi>Aarons</hi> rod before the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33120:117"/>
Testimony to be kept for a token
against the Rebels, and take away
their murmurings lest they die;
and <hi>Moses</hi> did so as God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
and the children of Israel
spake unto <hi>Moses,</hi> saying, Behold,
we dye, we perish, we all perish:
Shall we be consumed with dying?</p>
            <p>And the Lord commanded the
Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> to be joyned unto
<hi>Aaron</hi> to minister unto him,<note place="margin">18.</note> and
onely that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes
should minister before the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of the witnesse, and that the
<hi>Levites</hi> should keepe the charge of
the Tabernacle, but they should
not come nigh the vessels of the
Sanctuary and the Altar lest <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
and they should die: and that
no stranger should come near them:
and gave them many other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
to observe.</p>
            <p>Then came the children of Israel
unto Zin,<note place="margin">20.</note> and abode in Kadesh
where <hi>Miriam</hi> died and was there
buried: and in that place was no
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:33120:117"/>
water, in so much as they gathered
themselves together against <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the people did
chide with <hi>Moses,</hi> and wished they
had died with their brethren.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> went
from them unto the doore of the
Tabernacle, and fell upon their
faces: and the Lord bade <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> take the Rod and assemble
the people together, and speake
unto the Rock before them, and it
should give forth water; and they
gathered the congregation together
before the Rock, and <hi>Moses</hi> said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, Heare now ye Rebels,
must we fetch you water out of this
Rock?</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Moses</hi> lift up his hand, and
with his Rod he smote the Rock
twice, and the water came out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly:
and the congregation
dranke, and their beasts also. And
the Lord spake unto <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
Because ye beleeve me not to
sanctifie me in the eyes of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33120:118"/>
of Israel; therefore ye shall
not bring this congregation into
the land which I have given them.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Moses</hi> sent messengers
to Kadesh to the King of Edom,
letting him know of all their passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in Egypt, and of the wonders
that God had done; desiring to
passe through his Countrey onely
to goe by the Kings high way, and
pay for what they tooke: but the
King of Edom refused it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Israel turned another way, and
came to mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Hor, where the Lord
spoke unto <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Aaron</hi> shall be gathered to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the land which I have given unto
the children of Israel, because ye
rebelled against my word at the
water of Meribah: take <hi>Aaron</hi> and
his sonne Eleazar and bring them
up unto mount Hor; and <hi>Moses</hi>
brought them up, and as the Lord
commanded, <hi>Moses</hi> stripped <hi>Aaron</hi>
of his garments and put them upon
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33120:118"/>
Eleazar his sonne, and <hi>Aaron</hi> died
there, in the top of the mount, and
<hi>Moses</hi> and Eleazar came downe
from thence, and when the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Israel saw that <hi>Aaron</hi> was
dead, even all the house of Israel
mourned for him thirty dayes.</p>
            <p>And they journied from mount
Hor by the way of the Red sea,<note place="margin">21.</note> and
compassed the land of Edom, but
they were much discouraged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the way, and the people
spake against God and <hi>Moses,</hi> then
the Lord sent fiery serpents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the people, who bit them,
whereof many died, and then they
confessed their sinnes unto <hi>Moses,</hi>
and desired him to pray to the
Lord for them; the which he did.</p>
            <p>And the Lord commanded <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
to make a fiery serpent, and set
it upon a pole, that every one that
is bitten, when he looketh upon it
shall live: and <hi>Moses</hi> did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make a brazen serpent; and they
that were bitten when they beheld
it, lived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:33120:119"/>
And the children of Israel then
journeyed faster and came to Beor
unto a place,<note place="margin">21.</note> where the Princes and
Nobles digged it by the directions
of the Lawgiver, and went further,
where they sent to Sihon the King
of the Amorites to let them passe
thorough his land, paying for what
they had, and onely to goe the
Kings high way while they were
past his borders, but he would not
suffer them to passe; but gathered
his people together, and fought
with Israel; where the Amorites
were overthrowne, Israel taking all
their cities and dwelt in them, and
the Countrey thereabouts; and
<hi>Moses</hi> sent to spy out Jaazer, and
drave the Amorites from thence
and possessed it.</p>
            <p>And after they marched, and
Og King of Bashan raised his

set forward and pitched in the
plaines of Moab: and Moab was
affraid: Balak the sonne of Zippor
was King of the Moabites at that
time, who sent messengers unto
Balaam to come to him, letting
him know, how the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
who came out of Egypt came
neare him; praying him to curse
them.</p>
            <p>And he bade the messengers sent
lodge there that night, but God
said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not
goe with them: neither curse them
for they are blessed: and Balaam
told the messengers, Get ye home,
for the Lord refuseth to give me
leave to goe with you: and the
Princes returned to Balak, saying,
Balaam refuseth to come with us:
then Balak sent Princes more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
then they with proffers
unto Balaam of great preferments
and honour unto him: but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
If Balak would give me his
house full of silver and gold, hee
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33120:120"/>
could not goe beyond the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, to doe lesse or more:
but desired them to stay that night,
that he might know the will of the
Lord: and that night the Lord said
unto Balaam, If they call, goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them, but doe that which
I shall say unto thee.</p>
            <p>Then Balaam rose up in the
morning and sadled his Asse, and
went with the Princes of Moab:
and the Angel of the Lord stood in
the way, and as he was riding with
his two servants, the Asse seeing the
Angel of the Lord, with his sword
in his hand, he turned out of the
way, and Balaam smote her, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
betweene two wals: the Asse
thrust her selfe upon the wall, crusht
Balaams foote against the wall, and
then he smote her againe; then the
Asse fell down under Balaam; and
then he smote the Asse againe, and
the Lord opened the mouth of the
Asse, and she said unto Balaam,
What have I done unto thee that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33120:120"/>
thou hast smitten me these three
times? and Balaam said unto the
Asse, Behold, thou hast mocked
me, if I had a sword I would kill
thee: and the Asse said unto Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
Am not I thine Asse, upon
which thou hast ridden ever since
I was thine unto this day? was I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wont to doe so unto thee? and
he said, Nay: then the Lord open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the eyes of Balaam and he saw
the Angel of the Lord, and he bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
downe his head, and fell flat on
his face, and said, he had sinned.
Now therefore, if it please thee, I
will returne back: but the Angel
said, Goe on with the men, but
onely speake that word I shall speak
unto thee: and so he went with the
Princes, and Balak hearing of his
coming he went to meet him, and
said unto him, Wherefore diddest
thou not come sooner? am not I
able to promote thee to honour?
but Balaam said, The word that
God putteth into my mouth will I
speake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:33120:121"/>
And they offered burnt-offerings,
and he said unto Balak, How shall
I curse, whom God hath not cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
or how shall I defie whom the
Lord hath not defied? at which Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lak
was offended, but he answered;
must I not take heed to speake that
which the Lord hath put into my
mouth? and after other burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
at Zophim, his answer was to
Balak, Behold, I have received
commandement to blesse, and he
hath blessed, and I cannot reverse
it; he hath not beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Jacob,</hi> neither hath he seene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versenesse
in Israel; the Lord his
God is with him, and the shout of
a King is among them: then Balak
said, Neither doe thou blesse them
nor curse them: but he answered,
All that the Lord speaketh, that I
must doe: but Balaam seeing it was
Gods will to blesse Israel, he left af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
looking to enchantments, but
set his face towards the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and he saw Israel abiding in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:33120:121"/>
their tents according to their tribes;
and the Spirit of God came upon
him, and he said, How goodly are
thy tents, O <hi>Jacob,</hi> and thy taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,
O <hi>Israel,</hi> &amp;c. then Balaks
anger was kindled against him; but
Balaam prophesied, saying, I shall
see him, but not now: I shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
him, but not nigh: There
shall come a Star out of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and
a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and
shall smite the corners of Moab,
and destroy all the children of

that shall have dominion, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Balaam</hi> rose up and went
and returned to his place, and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lak</hi>
also went his way.</p>
            <p>And Israel abiding in Shittim
the people beganne to commit
whoredome with the daughters of
Moab and bowed towards their
gods;<note place="margin">25.</note> and the anger of the Lord
was kindled against them.</p>
            <p>One of the children of Israel
came and brought unto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:33120:122"/>
a Midianitish woman in the

and when <hi>Phineas</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azar</hi>
the sonne of <hi>Aaron</hi> the Priest
saw it, he rose from amongst the
congregation, and tooke a Javelin
in his hand and went after the man
of Israel into the tent, and thrust
both the man and the woman, <hi>Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi>
and <hi>Cozbi,</hi> through; so the plague
was stayed in Israel: and those that
dyed of the plague were twenty and
foure thousand.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> desired of the Lord
to set a man over the congregation,<note place="margin">27.</note>
to goe in and out before them, that
they may not be as sheep that have
no shepherd; and the Lord said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Moses,</hi> Take thee <hi>Joshuah</hi> the
sonne of <hi>Nun,</hi> a man in whom is
the Spirit, and lay thine hand upon
him, and set him before Eleazar
the Priest and before all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and give him a charge
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33120:122"/>
in their sight; and thou shalt put
some of thine honour upon him,
that all Israel may be obedient;
and he shall stand before Eleazar
the Priest who shall aske counsell
for him, after the judgement of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim
before the Lord: and <hi>Moses</hi>
did as the Lord commanded him,
and he tooke <hi>Joshua</hi> and set him
before Eleazar the Priest and the

            </p>
            <p>After this the children of Israel
warred against the Midianites, and
they slew the King of Midian, and
burnt their cities, and their goodly

            <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> growing old,<note place="margin">Deut. 31.</note> he

Upon some parts of the
History of Moses.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Lord direct my meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and assist me humbly
and truely to contemplate
this thy great work of the
deliverance of thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel out of Egypt by <hi>Moses,</hi>
after they had sojourned there foure
hundred and thirty yeares; after which
time, according to thy promise, thou
diddest deliver them, and brought
them to the land of promise.</p>
            <p>This great deliverance, O Lord, is
the true type of a great mercy that did
follow, which was by our <hi>Moses</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, who redeemed, and brought
us that were Gentiles, and under the
bondage and slavery of sinne, to serve
and follow him out of the darknesse
wherein we were inthraled; being far
worse then the Egyptian yoke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:33120:125"/>
O Lord my God, let it enter into my
heart, most humbly and seriously to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of this inestimable mercy of my
redemption, and of thy wonderfull and
unvaluable goodnesse towards me a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
by sending into this Egypt of the
world, such a guide, such a deliverer,
and such a Redeemer as all the Angels
and powers in heaven doe adore, even
thy onely Sonne.</p>
            <p>Let me be astonished, O Lord, with
wonder at this thy so great mercy, and
be confounded in my selfe for offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thee, so glorious and so gracious
a God.</p>
            <p>And let my sinfull soule be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
unto thee, to serve thee with
all humblenesse of heart. O Lord, how
sutable in mischiefe were <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
and <hi>Herod,</hi> by giving way to Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Jealousie, and the reignes to
commit cruelty to an unlimited height,
for the murdering of innocent Infants.
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> ambition was to destroy the
Hebrew children, amongst whom was
<hi>Moses,</hi> which thou, O God, preservedst
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:33120:125"/>
to deliver the people of Israel out of
Egypt: and <hi>Herods</hi> designe to destroy
the children in <hi>Jury,</hi> amongst whom
was that immaculate Lambe Christ
<hi>Jesus:</hi> even to destroy him who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the Gentiles, and was after cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
to deliver and redeeme both Jew
and Gentile.</p>
            <p>O Lord, how wonderfull are thy
workes and all thy goodnesse: for flesh
and blood could not prevaile against thy
providence: for the cruelty of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
could not prevent thy goodnesse,
for thou diddest multiply and blesse thy
children of Israel: and preservedst
<hi>Moses</hi> in a poore basket of bulrushes
to doe thy great worke to deliver thy
people out of the thraldome of Egypt.</p>
            <p>And O wonder of wonders, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of mercies, out of the manger at
Bethlehem came our blessed Saviour
who redeemed the world: and how
wonderfully, O Lord, hast thou preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thy Church for whom he died, and
multiplied thy servants through the
persecutions of this world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:33120:126"/>
As it was thy great mercy and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
O Lord, to preserve <hi>Noah</hi> and
his family in that great Arke whereby
mankind was preserved upon earth:
So it was thy mercy to preserve thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<hi>Moses</hi> in that little arke amongst
the watery flags of danger, to preserve
and bring thy children of Israel descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from <hi>Noah,</hi> out of Egypt to the
land of promise, from which stock so
preserved, came my Saviour Jesus
Christ: as these have beene thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
O God, to preserve thy people of
Israel by thy Prophet <hi>Moses</hi> the type
of Christ: and to redeeme the world
by thy Sonne my Saviour Jesus; So O
Lord, many have beene thy mercies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me a sinner, by thy manifold mercies
and deliverances even since my infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
hitherto, both by sea and land. Good
Lord, in thy mercy take from over me
this thick and mysty cloud of stupidity,
that so much darkens my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that I may discerne these thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and feare, love, and serve thee
with all the faculties of soule and body:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:33120:126"/>
and good Lord grant that I may love
my kinred and neighbours, as <hi>Moses</hi>
did love his Nation the Hebrews, with
kindnesse and affability to all men, as he
used to the daughters of <hi>Jethro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the soule of thy servant know,
that in the places of peace, quietnesse,
and retirednesse from the eye of this
world so full of vanity and pleasures,
there art thou to be found, for in the
desart behinde the mountain and neare
Horeb thou wast with <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Lord, bring my soule from these
worldly cares, afflictions, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
amongst which I live; and lead
me with thy saving grace toward thy
holy mountaine: with contemplations
of holinesse and penitency for my sins,
and there let me rest in thee and be
freed from the thorny and scorching
passages of this world.</p>
            <p>As thou, O God, didst wonderfully
appeare unto <hi>Moses</hi> in the Bush by a
flame of fire which did not burne nor
consume it: so I doe most humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee, enter into the heart of thy
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33120:127"/>
servant, and enflame it with holy love
and zeale towards thee: and enlighten
it, O Lord, that it may discerne thy
wonderfull goodnesse: and that I may
have alwayes such a burning desire to
serve thee, as no overflowings of the
waters of this world may quench it: let
me with <hi>Moses,</hi> put off my shooes of
worldly thoughts, cares, and sinfull
imaginations, when I shall presume to
come before thee, for the place where
thou art is holy: and places consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto thee and thy service, in the
assembly of Saints, are not to be propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by any kinde of unholy actions; for
we must worship towards thy holy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and enter into it with reverence;
for so, O Lord, thou didst command all
thy people in all nations of the world.</p>
            <p>Give me grace to obey thy good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations
as <hi>Moses</hi> did obey thee, by
going unto <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> Lord, let thy
wonderfull works, that thou hast done
and that I daily see, strengthen my faith
and confidence in thee; and not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
thy power and goodnesse, but that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33120:127"/>
I may resolutely goe on to serve thee
with a blessed perseverance, untill my
soule shall be delivered out of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian
bondage, be freed from the
taskmasters of afflictions, and the
fleshpots of the pleasures of this world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> was slow in speech, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of himselfe, yet God did worke
mightily by him. By his example let
us master our fleshly opinions, and know
that God hath his owne work; and not
to judge of the defects of other men.</p>
            <p>And good Lord, teach me to looke
into my selfe, for if I have received
that which others want, it is thy meere
mercy and goodnesse: and as I ought
alwayes to be thankfull for thy gifts,
yet let me not be proud of them; for as
thy goodnesse gives them, so thou canst
take them away as thou pleasest; for the
foot of pride brings downe thy wrath
upon us the chiefe of men; and though
<hi>Moses</hi> had that defect, yet by thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
he did greater matters then either
<hi>Absolon</hi> or <hi>Achitophel</hi> could bring
to passe; for thou makest our speaking,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:33120:128"/>
and hearing, and all our senses to serve
thy commands; and my Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eemer made
the dumbe to speake, and the lame to

delivered me from the Egyptian
plagues which the hardnes of my heart
hath deserved; so prepare me I do most

ready to goe out of this Egypt of the
world, and to be obedient unto my Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and Governours, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
in the midst of all perversenesse
and perverse men whomsoever.</p>
            <p>In the darknesse of this world en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
me, and as thou diddest send a
distinct light to the children of Israel
in Goshen; so enlighten, O Lord, my
inward soule with the light of thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
spirit, to discerne thy wonderfull
mercies towards me; and grant that I
may praise thee for thy goodnesse, and
obey thee as a man separate from all
the world: prepare me, O God, to be
ready for my passage to the Celestiall
Countrey of eternitie as the Israelites
were; with my loines girt in c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aritie,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33120:128"/>
my shooes on in mortification, and my
staffe in confidence: sprinkle the posts
and lintles of my heart with the hysope
of thy grace, and the precious bloud of
thy salvation; that I may be knowne
to be thine, and be received into thy
mercy when thou shalt come to visit me,
and to bring me through the Red Sea
of that dangerous passage to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Canaan of eternitie.</p>
            <p>Keepe me at that time, O Lord, from
distrust and diffidence; strengthen me
in the narrow passage, betweene the
two wals of that dangerous water of
presumption and despaire, that I be not
drowned with the Egyptians of this
world, whose trust is in their chariots
and not in thee; and whose hardnesse
of heart and contempt of thee, brought
them to destruction.</p>
            <p>O Lord, be mercifull to my thirsty
soule, and preserve me from murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against thee, thou which diedst
upon the tree of the Crosse, take all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
from my soule, and quench my
thirst with the holy water of thy grace,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:33120:129"/>
and grant that I may cheerefully goe
on towards the land of promise.</p>
            <p>Without thy continuall helpe how
fraile and perverse are we? as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Israelites ever murmuring and
repining against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi>
send therefore that heavenly Manna
unto me that may strengthen my soule
and preserve it unto thee in faith, and
obedience.</p>
            <p>Thou knowest my frailty, O God, and
how feeble I am, as likewise my unruly
and unbridled conditions, my stubbornes
and hardnesse of heart: therefore I doe
most humbly beseech thee for thy mercy
sake in Jesus Christ, with thy miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and mercifull Rod of grace to
strike upon my stony heart, that from
that rock may ascend unto mine eyes a
fountaine of teares, with such a true
and perfect contrition as may come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, and by thy mercy my sinnes
may be washed away, and that I may
thirst no more after vanity.</p>
            <p>O Lord, how weake is the arme of
the strongest man without thy help:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:33120:129"/>
for <hi>Moses</hi> could not hold up his hand
with the Rod without assistance from
thee where <hi>Amalek</hi> fought with <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
but <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> assisted him.</p>
            <p>I do most humbly beseech thee, in the
fight that I have against the <hi>Amalek</hi>
of sin and impiety: give me thy Rod of
grace and strengthen me, and make me
able to hold up my hands &amp; heart unto
thee, and in my weaknesse and distresse
send me, O Lord, spirituall comforters,
which may assist and strengthen my
faith, that I may hold out untill the
sunne of my age be set, and obtain vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over all my spirituall enemies.</p>
            <p>With what wonderfull feare diddest
thou, O Lord, deliver thy holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
unto <hi>Moses,</hi> and with
what reverence and feare did the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel stand without the bounds
of Mount Sinai; and onely <hi>Moses,
Aaron, Nadab, Abihu,</hi> and seventy
Elders of Israel went into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
who worshipped a far off, onely
<hi>Moses</hi> came neare the Lord.</p>
            <p>Good Lord, make me to feare and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:33120:130"/>
tremble to break these thy holy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
which thou diddest deliver
with such circumstances of glory and
terrour: and with thy children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
let me keepe without the bounds of
mount Sinai as thou appointedst them,
and out of all humane curiosity humbly
waite to receive thy lawes from the
hands of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets and
Ministers of thy Church.</p>
            <p>Keepe rash presumption from the
soule of thy servant: for though <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> and the
seventy Elders were good and holy
men, yet they kept their distance in
their worship towards thee O God, and
at the writing of the Law.</p>
            <p>So good Lord, give me lowlinesse, to
stand before thee without the bounds of
Sinai, with such as are humble of
heart, and there worship and waite thy
leisure for what thou shalt command
me by <hi>Moses,</hi> my spirituall guide, by
whom I must be directed; for I must
not be my owne director.</p>
            <p>Without this continuall helpe of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:33120:130"/>
thine, O Lord, and by thy Ministers
and Shepherds thou appointest over us,
how dangerously doth that Wolfe the
devil assault and prevaile against this
britle and corrupt flesh of ours: for
<hi>Moses</hi> being absent but for a few daies
the people went a whoring after their
owne inventions.</p>
            <p>Into what extreme folly did they
runne headlong even to worship a
calfe, and to give that which was most
precious unto them to make an idol, and
their jewels to make a calfe: O Lord
Jesus looke upon me, and helpe me, in
this time of danger to my soule: how at
this time doe the most of this world
wherein I live go a whoring after their
owne waies, as though neither <hi>Moses</hi>
nor any Prophet were amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: how
have they consumed the land, &amp; given
their jewels to raise up the idol of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy
and pride: and what doe we
else but sit downe to eate and drink, and
rise up to play: and no man mournes
for the misery of the land. O Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
strengthen my faith and beliefe in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:33120:131"/>
this dangerous Sea wherein are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rocks and quicksands, of Error and
Innovations. Be thou my Pilot, and
grant that I may steere a right course
towards thee in this sea, so covered with
the mists and fogges of Heresie and
Schisme; that by a true faith I may
arrive unto the harbour of my hoped for
happinesse, and with speed send some in
the spirit of <hi>Moses</hi> to us againe; and
deliver us from the like punishment
that fell upon the Israelites for that
their sinne; and that peace may be in
our Land, that thy Tabernacle, O Lord,
may be raised up, and that we may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
towards it, every man with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
at the doore of his tent with the
children of Israel so humbled and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate;
and that we may doe as they
did, give our selves to adorne the Ark
of the Church wherein is the Arke of
the Covenant, and reare it up with
<hi>Moses</hi> in the solemnitie of spirituall
and divine worship, for there is the
glory of the Lord and of all God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:33120:131"/>
O Lord, let me know that <hi>Aarons</hi>
worship before thee in his robes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
the ornaments of honour, the
mitre and crowne, upon his knees hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
before thy Altar in the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
being according unto thine owne
holy order, was more pleasing unto thee
then the confusion of such who step up
without order or ornament, spirituall
or corporall into the Church, not so
much as looking with reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thy place of worship.</p>
            <p>For doubtlesse, O Lord, thy Sonne
and our Saviour the great example of
humility, did come into this world to
teach us humilitie, and that by his
grace working in us humilitie, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
and devotion should encrease
and continue in this world.</p>
            <p>Therefore let me not, O Lord, with
the proud spirituall Pharisees of these
times, being blasted with boldnesse
presume to step into thy house the place
of worship but with reverence, and in
imitation of thy children of Israel who
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:33120:132"/>
worshipped and wept at the doore of the
Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>O Lord, the children of Israel though
they provoked thee unto anger by their
murmuring distrusts and iniquities in
their journeys, even ten times: when
I looke into my selfe, O Lord, I finde
and must needs confesse to my owne
shame and confusion, that in this my
pilgrimage I have exceeded them in
impietie, both in number and degree:
for indeed my sinnes are numberlesse,
having murmured exceedingly in my
journeys at the crosses of this world, as
never considering from what hand
they came, nor how justly I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
them: I have for most part of
my time eaten, drunk, and rose up to
play, and thirsted after the flesh-pots
and pleasures of this world: I have
neglected thy service and have not
humbled my selfe before the doore of
thy Sanctuarie to bewaile my sinnes as
I ought to have done: the due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
that I owe to my Superiours and
Pastours of thy Church have I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33120:132"/>
following mine owne inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and opinions, and have wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like a sheepe out of the fold, whereby
I have fallen into by pathes and crooked
waies; leaving that good way thou hast
appointed: and thereby have drawne
thy just displeasure upon me. O Lord,
my God, standing in this sad and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
condition, give me grace true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to humble my selfe before thee: and
as thou didst heare the prayers of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
thy servant who mediated for thy
children of Israel, and was mercifull
unto them: So I doe most humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee by the merits of thy Sonne
and my Saviour Jesus Christ my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,
for his sake be thou mercifull
to me, and deliver me from finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
denounced against me.</p>
            <p>How endlesse, O Lord, are our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties,
when we grow proud and stiffe-necked,
and how rebellious then doe we
grow against thee and thy Ministers
whom under thee we should obey.</p>
            <p>O Lord, deliver me thy servant
from a rebellious spirit, and teach me,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:33120:133"/>
not to spurne against them that thou
hast appointed over me with <hi>Korah,
Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> so spitefull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> thy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
nor to cover my rebellious impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with the specious cloake of holinesse
as they did, when nothing was in their
heart but ambition and desire to rule,
and to bring that out of order which
thou, O Lord, hadst established in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How wonderfull are thy judgements,
O Lord, and how unsearchable are thy
wayes! Let the example of these men,
and the just and terrible punishment
that fell upon them, make me feare to
breake thy Ordinances, or disobey my
Governours that thou hast appointed:
for what are we, O Lord, in a head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
government, and what mischiefe
shall not betide us?</p>
            <p>O Lord, preserve me from the fiery
stings and punishments of that old ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
which mine iniquities deserve,
and in these afflictions that I may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for my sinnes, give me grace to look
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:33120:133"/>
up towards him that died for me upon
the Crosse, that by his merits I may be
healed, and praise thee for thy mercies,
and live to goe in my pilgrimage by a
true obedience unto thee: and that I
may no more murmur against thee, nor
be weary of the Manna of thy blessings:
and O Lord, as <hi>Moses</hi> saw the Land
of promise before his death, upon the
top of the mountaine: so good Lord,
raise up my thoughts, before I dye, from
these earthly things to contemplate the
eternity hereafter; and give me a taste
and faithfull apprehension of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Countrey which I doe expect;
that with joy of heart, and comfort to
my soule, I may leave this earthly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
and ascend unto that place of
happinesse where <hi>Moses</hi> and other thy
Prophets, Apostles, Saints, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
sing praise unto thee that sits upon

were.</p>
            <p>And in the evening the King sent
out Scouts to pursue them: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <hi>Rahab</hi> had hid them in the top of
her house, and covered them with
the stalkes of flaxe: after the Scouts
were gone out, she came unto the
men, and said unto them: I know
the Lord hath given you the land,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33120:135"/>
for terors are fallen upon us: and
the whole land are afraid of you,
for we have heard how the Lord
dryed up the water of the red sea
for you when you came out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
and what you did to the two
Kings of the Amorites <hi>Sihon</hi> and
<hi>Og</hi> whom you vtterly destroyed,
and therefore your Lord is the true
God of heaven, therefore in regard
of my kindnesse unto you, shew
kindnes unto my fathers house: and
give me a token to save alive my

and they answered her, giue ns safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and when the Lord gives vs this
Land we will deale kindly and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
with thee: and her house
standing vpon the towne wall, she
let them down by a cord: and bade
them be gone to the mountaine
and hide themselves three dayes
vntill the scouts returne and then
go their way; &amp; they said vnto her,
that we may remember thy love
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:33120:136"/>
and our promise, when we come
unto this place: tye this scarlet cord
thou letst us down withall vnto thy
window, and thou, thy father, thy
mother brothers sisters and all they
have shall be safe. But if any goe
out of thy house at that time, let his
bloud be vpon his owne head: for
all shall be safe within: but if thou
utter this to any we will be quit of
our promise and oath: and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted:
and they did observe her
counsell hiding themselves three
dayes, and after came to <hi>Joshua</hi> and
told him the state of things and of
the feare of the Inhabitants about
<hi>Jericho.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Joshua</hi> hastened and came to
Jordan with the children of Israel,
and after three dayes the officers of
the hoast commanded the people
that when they see the Arke of
the Covenant of the Lord remove,
the Priests and Levites bearing it,
they should remove and go after it,
and to keepe a distance from it, to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33120:136"/>
know the way they must goe, and
<hi>Joshua</hi> said unto the people sanctifie
your selves, for to morrow the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Joshua</hi> spake vnto the Priests to take
up the Arke and go before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the which they did, and the
Lord said vnto <hi>Joshua</hi> this day will
I begin to magnifie thee in the sight
of Israel, that they may know that
as I was with <hi>Moses,</hi> so will I be
with thee. Command the Preists
that beare the Ark when they come
to the brink of Iordan to stand still;
and he said to the children of Israel
hereby ye shall know that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God is amongst you to driue
out the heathen before you; behold
the Arke of the Covenant even the
Lord of all the earth passeth over
before you into Iordan. Then the
people removed from their tents to
passe over Iordan, the Priests bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ark of the covenant before
them: and when they dipped their
feet in the river, the water rose on a

command them to take out of the

them ouer and leaue them where

<hi>Joshua</hi> did accordingly, and they
brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> upon their shoulders,
and left the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be a sign to after ages
that the water of Iordan was cut off
before the Arke of the covenant
of the Lord when it passed over,
and the Arke stayd in Jordan vntill
the people were passed over and
that <hi>Joshua</hi> had commanded twelve
stones in the river of Jordan where
the Priests had set their feet to be
placed: but the children of Reuben
and Gad and halfe the tribe of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh
passed over armed before the
children of Israel unto the plaines
of Jericho being about 40000. and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:33120:137"/>
the Priests that bare the Ark of the
Covenant were come out of Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
the water returned to his place:
and those stones which they tooke
out of Jordan did <hi>Joshua</hi> pitch in
Gilgal for a token unto their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
children that they came on
dry land over Jordan as he did the
red sea: that all the earth might
know the power of God and feare
him for ever.</p>
            <p>And all the Kings of the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
and the Amorites that dwelt
thereabout, when they heard of this
wonderfull worke were astonished,
and their hearts failed them: and
the Lord commanded <hi>Joshua</hi> to
make sharpe kniues to circumcise
the Israelites the second time, the
which he did performe at the hill
of foreskins, now all the people
that came first out of <hi>Egipt</hi> were
circumcised: but they that were
borne by the way as they came out
of <hi>Egipt</hi> them they had not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
vntill now: and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:33120:138"/>
in the campe untill they
were whole: and the children of
Israel encamped in Gilgal, and
kept the Passeover in the evening
in the plaines of Jericho: and they
did eate of the old corne of the land
the morrow after the Passeover un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened
cakes and parched corne,
and the Manna ceased; but they
did eat of the fruit of the land of
Canaan.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Joshua</hi> coming towards Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo,
there stood a man over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him with his sword drawne
in his hand, and <hi>Joshua</hi> went unto
him and said, Art thou for us, or
for our enemies, and he said, Nay,
but as a Captaine of the hoste of
the Lord am I now come: and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
fell on his face to the earth, and
did worship, saying unto him,
What saith my Lord unto his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:
and the Captaine of the

thy shooe from off thy foot, for the

place whereon thou standest is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and <hi>Joshua</hi> did so.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Joshua</hi> straightly besieged
Jericho,<note place="margin">6.</note> so that none could goe out
or come in: and the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Joshua</hi> with his army and

seventh day to compasse the city 7.
times, and the Priests to blow the
trumpets, and the people to shout
with a great shout: and <hi>Joshua</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them so to doe, and they
did accordingly: and the seventh
day they rose up early and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the City seven times, and at the
seventh time when the Priests blew
the trumpet <hi>Joshua</hi> commanded the
people to shout for the Lord hath
given you the City: and it shall be
accursed, even it and all that is
therein: onely <hi>Rahab</hi> the harlot
shall live, she and all that are with
her, because she hid our messengers:
but let all the gold and silver, and
vessels of brasse and iron be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:33120:139"/>
to the Lord, they shall
come into the treasury of the Lord.
So when the Priests sounded the
trumpets the people shouted, and
the wals of Jericho fell flat downe
and they tooke the City: and they
utterly destroyed the City, and put
them to the sword man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
young and old, oxe, sheepe,
and asse; but <hi>Joshua</hi> sent the two
spies unto <hi>Rahabs</hi> house, those men
whom she had entertained: and
they brought her safe forth of her
house with her father and mother,
her brethren and all she had, and her
kinred, and left them in safety with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Campe of Israel, and they
burnt the City: and <hi>Rahab</hi> lived
long after amongst the Israelites:
and <hi>Joshua</hi> cursed the man that
should build Jericho againe: and
<hi>Joshua</hi> was famous throughout the
land.</p>
            <p>But the children of Israel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a trespasse in the accursed
thing,<note place="margin">7.</note> even <hi>Achan</hi> one of the tribe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:33120:139"/>
of <hi>Judah,</hi> for which the anger of
the Lord was kindled.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Joshua</hi> sent spies from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo
to Ai, to view the Countrey,
and they viewed Ai: and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Joshua,</hi> and told him, that
in Ai were but few people. <hi>Joshua</hi>
upon their report sent thither about
three thousand men and they fled
before the men of Ai, being migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
discomfited: the which did
much dishearten the people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:
and <hi>Joshua</hi> rent his clothes,
and fell to the earth upon his face
before the Arke of the Lord untill
the evening, he and all the Elders
of Israel, and put dust upon their
heads: and they did grieve exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
And the Lord said unto <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,</hi>
Get thee up, wherefore lyest
thou thus upon thy face, Israel hath
sinned and transgressed my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
for they have taken of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
thing, they have stollen and
dissembled; therefore could not
the children of Israel stand before
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:33120:140"/>
their enemies, neither will I be with
you any more, except ye destroy
the accursed from you.</p>
            <p>And the Lord commanded them
to sanctifie the people against the
next day, that the accursed thing
may be taken from amongst them:
and in the morning <hi>Joshua</hi> rose up
early and brought Israel by their
tribes: and the tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> was
taken by lot, and every houshold of
that tribe was examined, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi>
was found to have stolne the
accursed thing: and <hi>Joshua</hi> coming
to <hi>Achan,</hi> said unto him, <hi>Achan</hi>
my sonne, give I pray thee, glory
unto the Lord God of Israel, and
make confession unto him; and tell
me now what thou hast done, hide
it not from me: And <hi>Achan</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the fact, saying, I have sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Lord God of Israel: for
when I saw amongst the spoiles a
goodly Babylonish garment, and
two hundred shekels of silver, and
a wedge of gold of fifty shekels
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:33120:140"/>
weight, I tooke and hid them in
my tent: and <hi>Joshua</hi> presently sent
for them, and being brought unto
him, and before the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
he laid them before the Lord,
and <hi>Joshua</hi> and all Israel with him
brought <hi>Achan,</hi> the silver and the
gold, and the Babylonish garment,
his sonnes and daughters, his oxen
and his asses, his sheepe, and his
tent, and all that he had unto the
valley of Achor, and all Israel
stoned him with stones and after
burnt them; and raised over him
a heape of stones, so the Lord turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his fierce anger.</p>
            <p>And the Lord commanded <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
to go a second time to Ai,<note place="margin">Josh. 8.</note> with
a great army: and he chose thirty
thousand of the most valiant men,
giving them directions what to doe
and sent them away by night, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them to lye in ambush
neare the City of Ai: and they lay
before Bethel and Ai: and <hi>Joshua</hi>
rose early in the morning, and with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:33120:141"/>
all the Elders of Israel, and a great
strength he marched towards Ai
and drew near the City: and when
the King of Ai saw it, hastily came
forth with his whole strength to
give battell to Israel: but he knew
not of the ambush: and <hi>Joshua</hi> and
all Israel seemed to fly before them:
and the whole strength of Ai and
Bethel pursued them towards the
wildernesse: then they which were
in ambush speedily made towards
the City, and took it: and instantly
set it on fire.</p>
            <p>The men of Ai looking back and
seeing their City on fire they were
astonished and disheartened: and
being scattered and in disorder, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
and his army fell upon them
one way, and they that tooke Ai
issued out another way, and so cut
them off every man: and they took
the King of Ai alive and brought
him to <hi>Joshua:</hi> and the Israelites
returning to Ai put all within it to
the sword; so there fell that day of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33120:141"/>
men and women twelve thousand.
And <hi>Joshua</hi> burnt Ai downe to the
ground; and the King of Ai he
hanged upon a tree: and after the
Sunne was down commanded to
take him downe, and his carkasse to
be cast at the entry of the gate of
the City, and raised thereon a great
heape of stones.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Joshua</hi> built an Altar unto
the Lord God of Israel in mount
Eball, as <hi>Moses</hi> had commanded,
and there they offered sacrifice, and
writ the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> upon the
stones: and there the Arke of the
covenant being brought, all Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
and the Elders, Officers, and
Judges stood before it, and before
the Priests and Levites that bare it:
and the whole Law was read unto
them.</p>
            <p>And when all the Kings on this
side Jordane heard of these things,<note place="margin">Josh. 9.</note>
they joyned together to fight with
<hi>Joshua:</hi> but the Gibeonites had
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:33120:142"/>
heard what they had done to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo
and Ai; they cunningly came
unto <hi>Joshua</hi> in poore habite and
great humiliation unto the campe
at Gilgal: and there made their
peace with <hi>Joshua</hi> and the Princes
of the Congregation who sware
unto them. But after the Princes
finding they had deceived them, for
their oath sake they would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them: and <hi>Joshua</hi> called them
before him, and said, Wherefore
have you beguiled us, saying, you
dwelt a farre off when ye dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us? for this deceit ye shall
be bondmen and hewers of wood
and drawers of water for the house
of my God: and they said, It was
told us that <hi>Moses</hi> commanded we
should be wholly destroyed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we were afraid and did this
thing, and doe with us as thou
pleasest: and <hi>Joshua</hi> saved their
lives, and made them hewers of
wood and drawers of water for the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:33120:142"/>
congregation, and for the altar of
the Lord; and so they did continue
to doe.</p>
            <p>Now the King of Jerusalem and
the other Kings understanding that
the Gibeonites had made peace
with Israel;<note place="margin">Josh. 10.</note> and Gibeon being a
great City they feared greatly;
therefore five Kings and all the
strength they could make came and
encamped before Gibeon, they of
the City having made their peace
with <hi>Joshua,</hi> sent presently for aid
unto him: then presently <hi>Joshua</hi>
marched with a mighty army from
Gilgal toward Gibeon all night,
and falling suddenly upon them
gave them a great defeate: and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before Israel the Lord cast great
stones from heaven upon them, and
kil'd more of them then the sword,
and the Sunne and Moone stood
still that day, untill the people had
destroyed their enemies: and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
and all Israel returned to Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal;
but the five Kings fled and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:33120:143"/>
hid them in a cave: afterwards <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
commanded they should bee
brought forth, then <hi>Joshua</hi> called
for all the men of Israel, and said
unto the Captaines, Come neare
and put your feet upon the necks
of these Kings, and they did so: and
after <hi>Joshua</hi> commanded them to
be hanged upon five trees, and there
they did hang untill the evening:
and being taken down, <hi>Joshua</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
they should be cast into
the cave where they were found
and laid great stones to the caves
mouth: and <hi>Joshua</hi> conquered all
the Countrey and put them to the
sword:<note place="margin">Josh. 11.</note> for the Lord God of Israel
fought for Israel: and <hi>Joshua</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
and all Israel with him unto
the campe to Gilgal.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Jabin</hi> King of Hazar,
<hi>Jahab</hi> King of Madon, and all the
Kings north of the mountaines, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
themselves together and
raised a marvellous great host: and
pitched themselves together by the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:33120:143"/>
waters of Merom to fight against
Israel: and <hi>Joshua</hi> came and all his
people of war with him, and came
suddenly upon them by the waters
of Merom, and put them to a very
great slaughter, and chased them
unto great Zidon and Mizpeh,
houghing their horses, and burning
their chariots: and <hi>Joshua</hi> returned
and took Hazor and kill'd the King
thereof, and did all things as the
Lord commanded <hi>Moses</hi> his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
so did <hi>Moses</hi> command <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,</hi>
and so did <hi>Joshua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Joshua</hi> took the whole land
according to all that the Lord said
unto <hi>Moses:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Josh. 13.</note> and <hi>Joshua</hi> gave it
for an inheritance unto Israel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their divisions by their
tribes: and the land rested from
warre, <hi>chap.</hi> 18. And the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of the children of Israel
assembled together at Shiloh, and
set up the tabernacle of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
there for the land was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
before them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:33120:144"/>
And the Lord appointed them
by <hi>Joshua</hi> Cities of refuge,<note place="margin">Josh. 15.</note> that he
that killeth a man unawares and

and coming to that Citie he

cause to the Elders of that Citie,
and they shall receive him in: and
if he be followed thither they shall
not deliver him back, because he
did the act unwittingly and hated
him not before time.</p>
            <p>And they appointed Kedesh in
Gallole in mount Nepthale, and
Shechem in mount Ephraim, and
Hebron in the mountaine of Judah:
and on the other side Jordan by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo
Bezer in the wildernesse out

            <p>These were the Cities appointed

            <p>Now after the land was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
and every tribe settled in
their severall divisions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joshua</hi> called for the Reubenites,
the Gadites, and the halfe tribe of
Manasseh, and commended them
for their valour, and obedience to
the Commandment of their Lord:
and said unto them, Now the Lord
hath given rest unto your brethren,
returne you unto the land of your
possession which <hi>Moses</hi> the servant
of God gave you on the other side
of Jordane, but be carefull to doe
the commandements and the Law
which <hi>Moses</hi> gave you, and love the
Lord your God and serve him with
all your heart, and with all your
soules; so <hi>Joshua</hi> blessed them and
sent them away, and they departed
from the children of Israel out of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:33120:145"/>
Shiloh:<note place="margin">Josh. 22.</note> to go unto Gilead the land
of their possession formerly by the
hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> and when they came
to the borders of Jordan, there they
built an altar by Jordan, and when
the children of Israel heard thereof
they gathered themselves together
at Shiloh to goe and warre against
them, and they sent unto them <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
the sonne of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Priest,
and with him ten Princes of each
tribe of Israel one, and coming unto
the children of <hi>Reuben, Gad</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh</hi>
unto Gilead, and said unto
them, Thus saith the congregation
of the Lord: What trespasse is this
that ye have committed against the
God of Israel, to turne away from
following the Lord in that ye have
built you an altar? Is the iniquitie
of Peor too little for us, from
which we are not cleansed untill
this day although there was a
plague in the congregation of the
Lord? if the Land you possesse be
uncleane then come over to us
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:33120:145"/>
where the tabernacle dwelleth and
take possessions amongst us, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
not against the Lord, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
against us in building you an
altar beside the Altar of the Lord
our God. Did not Achan commit
a sinne in the accursed thing, and
wrath fel on all the congegation of
Israel, and that man perished not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in his iniquitie? then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Reuben, Gad and Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seh
answered them: The Lord
God of gods, The Lord God of
gods, and Israel shall know that this
is no rebellion in building this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar:
being not intended to offer
thereon burnt offerings, or meat
offerings, or peace offerings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but onely our reason was to set
up a monument for feare of the
time to come, that your children
might speake to our children, What
have you to do with the Lord God
of Israel? because the river Jordan
hath divided us, and so your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
make our children cease from
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:33120:146"/>
fearing the Lord: and therefore we
raised that altar, not for burnt-of-ferings,
but that it may be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
betweene us and you and our
generations after us, that we may
doe the service of the Lord before
him with our burnt offerings and
with our sacrifices, and with our
peace offerings that your children
may not say to our children in time
to come, Ye have no part in the
Lord, and therefore this altar we
have made is a witnesse unto you
and to your children hereafter.</p>
            <p>God forbid that we should have
any altar but that Altar of the Lord
our God that is before the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle:
and when Phineas the Priest,
the Princes of the congregation,
and the Elders of Israel heard this
from them, Phineas said unto them,
This day we perceive that the Lord
is among us because ye have not
committed this trespasse against the

she brought her along with

where <hi>Naomies</hi> deceased husband
had a Kinsman of great power,
whose name was <hi>Boaz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Ruth</hi> desired her Mother
in Law, that she might goe with
others to gleane, who giving of
her leave, she went and gleaned
after the Reapers, and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to be in the field of <hi>Boaz,</hi>
who coming from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> he
said to the Reapers, the Lord be

Then said <hi>Boaz</hi> unto <hi>Ruth,</hi> my

hee told he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> he heard what shee

God of <hi>Israel,</hi> under whose wings
thou art come to trust; then she
said let me finde favour in thy

            <p>Then <hi>Boaz</hi> bad her come at
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:33120:160"/>
meal-times to eate bread, and so
shee sat by the Reapers, and hee
reached her parched Corne and
she did eate, and he commanded
she should gleane amongst the
sheaves; and so returning in the
Evening with plenty to her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Law, shee asked her with
whome she did gleane, who told
her it was in the Field of <hi>Boaz,</hi>
then said <hi>Naomi,</hi> blessed be the
Lord for hee ceaseth not to doe
good, to the living and to the
dead, telling <hi>Ruth</hi> hee was of her
husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds kindred, &amp; did wish her
not to gleane in any other place,
but with the Maides of <hi>Boaz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Naomi</hi> did love <hi>Ruth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ruth 3.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
she finding her good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

her, shall not I seek rest for
thee my Daughter, that thou
maiest prosper, saying is not <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>az</hi>
out Kinsman, and this night
hee winnoeth Barly, wash and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
thy selfe, and put on thy

Raiment, and get thee down thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp; let him not know of thee
untill hee have left eating, and
drinking, and when he shall sleep
mark where he lyeth downe, and
uncover the place of his feete, &amp;
lie thee down, and hee shall tell
thee what thou shalt doe. And
<hi>Ruth</hi> did according to her dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
Now when <hi>Boaz</hi> had eat,
drunk, and cheared his heart, he
lay down by the heap of corn, &amp;
she came softly, and uncovering
his feet, lay downe: and he awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
about midnight, and feeling
one, he was affraid. Then he said,
who art thou; she answered, <hi>Ruth</hi>
thy hand-maid, spread therefore
the wing of thy garment over me
for thou art the Kinsman. Then
said hee, Blessed be thou of the
Lord my daughter, thou hast
shewed more goodnesse in the
latter end then at the beginning,
inasmuch as thou followedst not
young men, were they poore or
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:33120:161"/>
rich. And now my daughter fear
not, I will doe what thou requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
for all the City of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
know thee, that thou art a
vertuous woman. Telling her,
that true it was, he was her kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
but there was one nearer,
so bade her lye there all night:
and if in the morning hee would
doe the duty of a Kinsman, to
marry her, well and good: but if
he would not, he would then doe
the duty of a Kinsman himselfe:
So she lying at his feet untill the
morning, she arose early, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
that none should know
that any woman had been there:
so he calling for her sheet, giving
her fix measures of barley, and
returning to the Citie, she came
to her Mother in law, and gave
her the corne, telling her all the
passages betweene <hi>Boaz</hi> and her
selfe. So shee bade <hi>Ruth</hi> sit still
untill shee heard further of the
thing, telling her how hee would
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:33120:162"/>
not rest untill the thing were
done.</p>
            <p>Then without delay,<note place="margin">Ruth 4.</note> 
               <hi>Boaz</hi> went
up to the gate of the City, to
whom came this Kinsman na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
to <hi>Ruth, Boaz</hi> desiring him
to sit down; likewise ten Elders
of the City came and sate downe
with them. Then said <hi>Boaz</hi> to
this Kinsman, <hi>Naomi</hi> is come
out of the country of <hi>Moab,</hi> who
will sell a parcell of land that was
our brother <hi>Elemelicks,</hi> and so
proffered it unto him, being of
nearest in kindred, to redeem it,
before them Elders. If he would
not, that himselfe being the next,
he would. Then he said he would
redeem it. Then said <hi>Boaz,</hi> if thou
buyest it of <hi>Naomi,</hi> thou must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
buy it of <hi>Ruth</hi> the <hi>Moabitis,</hi>
the wife of the dead, to stirre up
the name of the dead upon his
inheritance; the which this Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
refused, saying, if hee did so,
he should destroy his owne, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:33120:162"/>
so put off that his right to <hi>Boaz,</hi>
and to confirme it according to
the custome, then he put off his
shooe, and gave it to him, which
confirmed the agreement.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Boaz</hi> called them all to
witnesse of this contract, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he likewise did buy <hi>Ruth</hi> the
Wife of <hi>Mahlon</hi> to be his Wife,
to stir up the name of the dead.
All which the Elders did witnes,
who prayed unto God that <hi>Ruth</hi>
might be to him like <hi>Rachel</hi> and
<hi>Leah,</hi> which two did build the
house of <hi>Israel,</hi> and that he might
be famous in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and that
by the seede of <hi>Ruth,</hi> his house
might be like <hi>Pharez,</hi> whom <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>

            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Boaz</hi> took <hi>Ruth</hi> to his wife,
and the Lord gave her a son: and
the women said to <hi>Naomi,</hi> blessed

thee this day without a kinsman.
And his name shall be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

which loveth thee hath born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, &amp; she is better unto thee
then seven sons.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Naomi</hi> tooke the child,
and laid it in her lap, and became
nurse unto it, and the women
gave it a name, calling it <hi>Obed,</hi>
which after was the father of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shai,</hi>

for their spirituall welfare, both in

            <p>And O Lord, no less was thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary

unto <hi>Moab,</hi> with her husband and

Therefore open thou mine eyes that I

            <p>The constant resolution and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p>O Lord furnish me with such happines

which are so inbred in mee, by thy

into Judah and tooke

then came forth unto him

saith the great King of Assyria,
What confidence is this wherein

            <p>Then said <hi>Eliakim</hi> unto him, I

with their clothes rent, and told

<hi>Rabshakeh</hi> hath blasphemed me:
Behold, I will send a blast upon

read it, he went into the house of
the Lord and spread it before the

O Lord of hosts God of Israel that

will I sing my song to the

and <hi>Isaiah</hi> gave order to apply unto

the sonne of <hi>Baladan</hi> King of

            <p>Then came <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet

answered, I have shewed

have I hid from them: then
said <hi>Isaiah</hi> unto him, Heare the

thy fathers have laid up in store un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

nothing shall be left, saith
the Lord: and of thy sonnes which
shall issue from thee shall they take

Jerusalem,<note place="margin">Isa. 37.</note> he told them what
would befall: but the Princes were
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:33120:172"/>
wroth with him and put him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
after he had beene there many
dayes <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the King sent and
tooke him out, and the King ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him secretly, Is there any word
from the Lord? and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> said,
There is: for thou shalt be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the hand of the King of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
therefore heare me, O my
lord the king, let my sute come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, that I may not returne to
prison where I was, lest I dye there:
then the King commanded he
should be committed into another
prison, and that he should have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him daily a piece of bread out
of the Bakers street, whiles the
bread lasted: but still the Prophet
persisted, and told them, Thus saith
the Lord, This city shall surely be
given into the hand of the King of
Babylons army: therefore the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were incensed against him, and
said unto the King, We beseech
thee, let this man be put to death,
for thus he weakeneth the hands of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:33120:173"/>
the men of warre and all the people
in this city in speaking thus unto
them.</p>
            <p>And the King said, He is in your
hands, doe with him what you
please: and they tooke <hi>Jeremiah</hi>
and cast him in a dungeon, and
they let him downe by a rope, and
in the dungeon was no water but
myre that he sunke in: and some
men complained of this cruelty
done to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> unto the King,
who commanded thirty men to
goe and take up <hi>Jeremiah</hi> out of the
dungeon: and they tooke old rags
and cast them downe into the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
the which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his arme pits, and so they drew
him up: and <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the King
sent for <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and said unto
him, I will aske thee a thing, hide
nothing from me: and <hi>Jeremiah</hi>
said unto the King, If I declare it
unto thee, wilt thou not put me to
death? and if I give thee counsell
wilt thou hearken to mee? so the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:33120:173"/>
king sware secretly unto <hi>Jeremiah</hi>
saying, as the Lord liveth that
made us this soule, I will not put
thee to death, nor give thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of these men that seek
thy life.</p>
            <p>Then he said unto the king,<note place="margin">Jer. 38. 17.</note> thus
saith the Lord God of hosts the God
of Israel, if thou wilt goe forth to
the Princes of the king of Babylon,
then thy soule shall live; and this
city shall not be burnt with fire,
and thou and thy house shall live.
But if thou wilt not goe forth unto
them, then shall this city be given
to the Chaldeans, and they shall
burn it, and thou shalt not escape
out of their hands, and the king
said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of
the Jewes that are fallen to the
Chaldeans, least they deliver me
to their hands, and they mock me.</p>
            <p>But the Prophet said, they shall
not deliver thee, obey I beseech
thee the voice of the Lord, so shall
it bee well with thee. But if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33120:174"/>
to goe forth, this is the word
that the Lord hath shewed me. Then
said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, let
no man know of these words, and
thou shalt not die; the which he
did: so Jeremiah after, abode in the
Court of the prison, untill the day
that Ierusalem was taken.</p>
            <p>And it came to passe on the ninth
year of Zedekiah king of Iudah,
Nebuchadnezzer king of Babilon,
and his army came before Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
and besieged it, and in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
yeare of Zedekiah the city
was taken, and all the Princes of
the king of Babilon entered the
city, at which time Zedekiah
and all his men of warre fled out
of the city by night, by the way
of the kings gardens, but the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the Chaldeans pursued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, and overtook Zedekiah
in the plaines of Iericho, and took
him &amp; brought him to Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar
king of Babilon, who gave
judgement upon him, and caused
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:33120:174"/>
his sonnes to be slaine before his
face, and all the Nobles of Judah,
and he put out the eyes of Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,
and bound him in chaines to
carry him to Babilon, and they
burnt Ierusalem, and brake down
the walls thereof, and carried cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to Babilon all the remainder of
the people that were within the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but left the poorer sort that had
nothing, and gave them vineyards
and fields; and the king of Babilon
gave charge concerning Jeremiah
to take him, and doe him no harm,
but use him with all kindnesse, so
they took Jeremiah out of the
Court of the prison, and sent him
home, so he dwelt among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

proud and confident of my selfe, and of

their bad carriage,
men abhorred the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of the Lord, and they lay
with the women that assembled at
the door of the Tabernacle of the
congregation. <hi>Eli</hi> then being old,
and hearing all that his sonnes had
done in Israel, with too much
mildnesse he said unto them, why
doe you such things? I hear of your
evill dealings by all the people, it is
no good report I hear of you, my
sonnes, ye make the Lords people
to transgresse; but they hearkened
not to the voice of their father, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:33120:180"/>
there came a man of God unto <hi>Eli,</hi>
and told him of all the mereies
that God had done unto his house,
to sacrifice and wear an Ephod be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, telling him of his too
much adhering to his sonnes, and
threatned the judgement of God
upon his house, and that <hi>Hophni</hi>
and <hi>Phineas</hi> his two sonnes should
dye both in one day, and that God
would raise up another faithfull
Priest to sacrifice before him, and
that the remainder of <hi>Elies</hi> house
should come and crouch to him for
a morsell of bread, and shall say, put
me I pray thee into one of the
Priests offices, that I may eat a
piece of bread.</p>
            <p>And the Lord said to <hi>Samuel</hi> the
Prophet, I will doe a thing in Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
at which both the eares of every
one that heareth it shall tingle, for
what I shall doe against <hi>Eli;</hi> when
I begin I will also make an end, for
his iniquity which he knoweth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his sonnes were wicked, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:33120:180"/>
he restreined them not; <hi>Samuel</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to shew <hi>Eli</hi> that vision, but <hi>Eli</hi>
called <hi>Samuel</hi> and said, my sonne
what is the thing that the Lord
hath said unto thee. I pray thee hide
it not from me, and <hi>Samuel</hi> told
him every whit, hiding nothing

            <p>Now the Israelites went out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Philistines to battell, and
pitched by Eben-ezer, and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines
met them, and they joyned
in battell, and Israel was smitten,
and 4000 of them was slain.</p>
            <p>And the Elders of Israel coming
into the Camp, they said, let us
fetch the Ark of the Covenant of
the Lord out of Shiloh unto us,
that when it cometh among us, it
may save us out of the hands of our
enemies; so the people sent to Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh
to bring from thence the Ark of
the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth
between the Cherubins, and the
two sonnes of <hi>Eli, Hophni,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi>
were there with the Ark of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:33120:181"/>
God, and when it was brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Camp, all Israel shouted
with a great shout, so that the earth
rang againe. When the Philistines
heard thereof, and that the Ark was
come into the Camp, they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
saying, God is come into the
Camp of Israel, and woe unto us,
who shall deliver us from this
mighty God, this is the God that
smote the Aegyptians with all the
plagues, but they neverthelesse en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
one another to quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
like men, that they might
not be servants to the Hebrewes,
and after fighting with Israel, they
overthrew them, and they fled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man to his own tent, and there
fell of Israel that day thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
and the Ark of God was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and the two sonnes of <hi>Eli,
Hophni,</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> were slain; and
there ran a man of <hi>Benjamin</hi> out of
the Army, and came to Shilo the
same day with his clothes rent, and
with earth upon his head; and when
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:33120:181"/>
he came, <hi>Eli</hi> sate upon a seat by the
way side watching, for his heart
trembled for the Ark of God, and
when it was told unto the city,
they all cryed out, and the man
came to <hi>Eli,</hi> telling him hee came
out of the Army; then said <hi>Eli,</hi>
what is done there my sonne? the
messenger answered, Israel is fled
before the Philistines, and there
hath been a great slaughter; thy
two sonnes <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> are
dead, and the Ark of God is taken;
and when <hi>Eli</hi> heard mention of the
Ark of God, he fell backward from
his seat by the side of the gate, and
brake his neck and died, he was
then 98 yeares old and blind, and
heavy of body, and he had judged
Israel forty yeares; and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in law the wife of <hi>Phineas</hi> being
with child, and near her time, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Ark of God was taken, fell
into travaile, and being delivered
of a sonne a little before her death,
they would have comforted her
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:33120:182"/>
herewith, but she did not regard
it; but she named the child <hi>Jehabod</hi>
saying, the glory is departed from
Israel, for the Ark of God is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>And the Philistines took the
Ark of God and brought it to <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dod,</hi>
and set it in the house of <hi>Dagon,</hi>
and set it by <hi>Dagon,</hi> and when they
came in the morning into the
house, they found <hi>Dagon</hi> fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
his face to the earth, before the
Ark of the Lord, and they set him
up in his place again, &amp; coming the
next morning early, <hi>Dagon</hi> was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
upon his face againe to the

was left, for which the Priests
of <hi>Dagon,</hi> nor the people ever after
did tread on the threshold of <hi>Dagon</hi>
in Ashdod; but the hand of the

and all the coastes thereabout,
and they were destroyed and smote
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:33120:182"/>
with Emrods, and when they saw
the judgement upon them, they
said the Ark of the God Israel shall
not abide with us, for his hand is
sore upon us, and upon <hi>Dagon</hi> our
God, and they assembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
together, and concluded to
carry the Ark of the Lord unto
Gath, and they carried it about thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that city was likewise
smitten with the hand of God,
with a great destruction, and they
had Emrods in their secret parts;
therefore they sent the Ark of God
to Ekron, and they cryed out say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
you have brought the Ark of
the God of Israel to us to destroy
us and our people, and all the Lords
&amp; people of the Philistines gathered
together, &amp; said, send away the Ark
of the God of Israel, and let it goe
again to his own place, that we be
not utterly destoyed, for there was
a deadly destruction throughout all
the city, and the men that died not,
were smitten with Emrods, and the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:33120:183"/>
cry of the city went up to heaven,
and the Ark of the Lord was with
the Philistines 7 months, and they
called their Priests and Divines
together, to conclude how they
should send the Ark away, and
they said, send it not empty, but in
any wise return unto the God of
Israel a trespasse offering, then yee
shall be healed; then said they what
shall be the trespasse offering w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we
shall return to him? they answered,
five golden Emrods, and five golden
mice, according to the number of
the Philistine Lords, for one plague
was on you all, and on your Lords,
and you shall make Images of your
Emrods, and Images of the mice
that hurt the land, and give glory
unto the God of Israel, to take his
hand off you, your Gods and your
land, and doe not you harden your
hearts, as the Aegyptians and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
hardened their hearts when he
wrought wonderfully among them
did they not let the people goe, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:33120:183"/>
they departed? Now therefore make
a new cart, and take two milch
kine, on which there hath come no
yoke, tye the kine to the cart,
and bring the claves home from
them, and take the Ark of the Lord
and lay it upon the cart, and put the
jewels of gold which ye return for
a trespasse offering in a coffer, and
tye, by the side thereof, and send it
away; and see if it goe by the way
of his own coaste to Bethshemesh, if
so, then he hath done us the great
evill. But if not, and that it goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
way, we will take it as a
chance that happened to us; and
they did do what was commanded
them, and laid the Ark upon the
cart, and the coffer, with the Jewels;
and the kine took the streight way
of Bethshemesh, and went lowing
along the high way, and turned not
aside; &amp; the Lords of the Philistines
went after them; and they of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shemesh
were reaping their wheat,
and seeing the Ark they rejoyced
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:33120:184"/>
to see it, and the cart came into the
field of <hi>Joshuah,</hi> a Bethshemite,
and stood there where there was a
great stone, and they clave the
wood of the cart, and offered the
kine a burnt offering unto the Lord,
and the Levites took downe the
Ark of the Lord, and the coffer,
with the Jewels, and put them on a
great stone, and the men of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shemesh
offered burnt offerings, and
sacrificed the same day unto the
Lord.</p>
            <p>And when the Lords of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines
had seen those things, they
returned to Ekron, and the stone
whereon they set the Ark, is called
the great stone of <hi>Abell</hi> which is in
the field of <hi>Joshuah</hi> the Bethshemite,
and the Lord smote the men of
Bethshemesh, because they had
looked into the Ark of the Lord,
even fifty thousand men, and the
people lamented, and they sent
messengers to the inhabitants of
Kiriath-jearim to fetch up the Ark
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:33120:184"/>
unto them, and they came and
fetched the Ark of the Lord unto
them, and brought it into the house

<hi>Eleazer</hi> his sonne to keep the
Ark of the Lord, and there it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

            <p>And long after twenty yeares,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 6.</note>
               <hi>David</hi> gathered all the chosen men

from <hi>Baal</hi> of Judah to bring up the
Ark of the Lord of hosts that
dwelleth between the Cherubins,
and they set the Ark of God upon

the house of <hi>Abinadab,</hi> and <hi>Uzzah,</hi>
and <hi>Ahio</hi> the sonnes of <hi>Abinadab</hi>
drove the cart, and <hi>Ahio</hi> went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Ark, and <hi>David</hi> and all the
house of Israel played before the
Lord on all manner of instruments
made of firre wood, on Harps, and
Psalters, Timbrels, Cornets, and
Cimbals, and when they came to

               <hi>Nachons</hi> threshing floore, <hi>Uzzah</hi> put
forth his hand to the Ark of God
and took hold of it, for the Oxen
shook it; and the anger of the Lord
was kindled against <hi>Vzzah,</hi> and
God smote him there for his error,
and he died by the Ark of God,
and <hi>David</hi> was afraid of the Lord,
upon the death of <hi>Uzzah,</hi> and
would not remove the Ark of the
Lord unto the city of <hi>David,</hi> but
carried it into the house of <hi>Obed-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
the Gittite, where it continued
three months, and the Lord blessed
<hi>Obed,</hi> and all his houshold; and
when <hi>David</hi> understood how God
had blessed them, because of the
Ark of God, <hi>David</hi> went and
brought the Ark of the Lord from
thence unto the city of <hi>David</hi> with
much gladnesse; and after, they that
bare the Ark had gone six paces, he
sacrificed Oxen and fatlings to the
Lord, and <hi>David</hi> danced before the

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:33120:185"/>
by <hi>David</hi> and all the hoste of Israel,
with shoutings, and with the sound

but <hi>Michall, Sauls</hi> daughter, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

type of heresie and innovations.</p>
            <p>By this O Lord, let thy servant to see
that there was alwayes a knowne and
certain way of worship, and a visible
Church to thy children of Israel, even
in the middle of the red Sea, and Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan
of danger and drowning, being
pursued by the Egypt of this world,
and still from time to time, this people
of thine, and in thy Church, there were
guides and governours for them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
to preserve them from by-paths,
and in the right rule of thy Church,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:33120:189"/>
and saving truth, which Church and
worship was hid from the Gentiles for
their great abominations, and by thy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
judgements; yet out of thy great
and wonderfull mercy to mankind, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thy promise, and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
a Messias did come to redeeme
the Gentiles, and to bring them unto
thee, and that great mercy of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
which wonderfull mercy was
by my blessed Redeemer and Saviour
Iesus Christ, the long hoped for Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
descended from the roote of <hi>Jesse</hi> the
great deliverer of the Gentiles, from
the thraldome and bondage of sinne,
whom no creature could redeeme, but
that immaculate lamb the sonne of God,
descended from that blessed root, of
whom all the Prophets have so much
prophesied; and above all, the Prophet
Esaiah of the calling of the Gentiles,
and the great visibility of the Church,
that should be at his coming, for all the
world to see and follow; and by which
they should learn to leave all blind cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and crooked by-paths of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:33120:190"/>
and wilfulnesse, and all good and
humble soules thither to repaire both
Jewes and Gentiles, even to this
Church, placed upon an open mountain,
that every one might see the light
thereof, thither repaire for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and care of their soules; for there
are the true Physitians, and the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
balsames, to cure the festred sores
of sin, and there is safety for the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of heart, and there is ever light pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them.</p>
            <p>Thus with humility of heart, ascend
up into that mountain of the Lord, and
Thus O Lord by thy incomprehensible
mercy, thou hast given us a way to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
confirmed to us and the truth
thereof, by the great example of thy
servants in the primitive Church; the
Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors and
Virgins, and other thy Saints, by their
great sufferings and persecutions in the
spirituall progresse of this world, before
the Ark thy Church could come to
rest, from that deluge and troublesome
waters of afflictions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:33120:190"/>
In all their sufferings and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
following the Example of their
Pilot and Redeemer, being humble and
meek, and obedient to their temporall
Lords, and giving unto Caesar, that
was Caesars, onely their faith and a
good conscience, they preserved unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before thee O Lord, desiring rather
to submit their lives, then hold up their
hands, and prayed for their persecutors,
rather then they would shed the blood of
any man, that had the least stamp of
Gods Image upon him.</p>
            <p>Let me not therefore O Lord spurne
against authority, nor laugh at devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as <hi>Michall</hi> that proud Dame did
scoffe at <hi>David</hi> for dancing before the
Ark, nor think it superstition to follow
thy holy Ark seven times about Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,
if it be commanded by Scripture,
or men of divine authority have so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
for there is a blessing goes
along with this Ark of thy Covenant,
and happines is a reward to the humble
and devout soule, that attendeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reluctation upon thy ordinances,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:33120:191"/>
and the discipliue of thee O God,
whiles this Ark of truth stood with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
that Idoll fell down and was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssen,
for truth and falshood cannot
stand together; let the soule of thy fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
know this (O Lord) and let mee
not think to serve thee but with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
sincere, and an humble heart, and
not to mix it with my own foolish fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but to serve thee by that rule as thou
hast appointed; and good Lord let the
<hi>Dagon</hi> of sinfulnesse that is raised up
in my corrupt heart, fall downe and be
broken in peices, and place in steed
thereof thy holy Covenant and truth;
Lord cleanse and purge me, and make
me worthy to receive the Arke of thy
Covenant, thy saving truth, and holy
spirit; that by my corruptions and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse
of life, it may not he with mee,
as it was with them of <hi>Ashdod,</hi> and
Ekron, whiles the Arke was amongst
them; to bring punishments and
plagues upon me, for my iniquity and
prophanesse, and inordination. But
sanctifie my soule O Lord, and give the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:33120:191"/>
blessing unto me, that thou diddest
give unto <hi>Abinadab</hi> and <hi>Obed-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
with whom the Ark did rest;
and make me a happy vessell to receive
thy holy spirit, and then will all things
be happinesses and blessings unto me,
both in this life, and in the life to come.</p>
            <p>O Lord, though <hi>Eli</hi> and his sonnes
did unrighteously before thee, to the bad
example of the Israelites, yet let not the
bad example that I may see by some bad
members in thy Church, make me to
stumble in my way, but still to follow
the Ark of thy Covenant, and mourn
after it as the children of Israel did
mourn and rejoyce in the prosperity of
thy Church, when there shall be any
joyfull remembrance of any kinde of
mercy or deliverance.</p>
            <p>O Lord, bring me thy servant into
the sanctuary of thy saving grace, and
thy holy Ark the Church, in safety unto
the city of <hi>David,</hi> in despight of all
mocking <hi>Michals,</hi> that all the world
may praise thee for all thy mercies, as
<hi>David</hi> did magnifie thy mercy in the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:33120:192"/>
presence of all the congregation, with
a kind of spirituall joy, beyond the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of all humane conceit, or the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of a proud Naturalist, and place it
there O Lord, in the Tabernacle of
peace and quietnesse, that all the world
may see thy mercy, and know the way to
their salvation, leaving all blind by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths,
and distracted wayes that tend,
and bend to destruction.</p>
            <p>For thou O Lord hast shewed us a
way, and left us unexcusable if wee
follow it not, without unsound and
deceitfull reasoning; and our destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is of our selves.</p>
            <p>But let all praise and glory be given
to thee O Lord for thy goodnesse and
truth, Thou O Lord art the way, the
truth, and the life.</p>
            <p>Lord lead us all by that way which
thou hast shewn, unto that truth which
hath promised that life, then shall all
doubtfull errors be removed from our
soules, and we shall live in that Ark,
where is the light and glory of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
for ever.</p>
