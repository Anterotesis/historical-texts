            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat the power of the former Committees for removing Malignants and Delinquants, from Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Power and Truſt in the Common-wealth, being many years ſince determined;</p>
            <p>1. Many honeſt well-affected perſons have been remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and left out of authority.</p>
            <p>2. Divers Malignants and ill-affected perſons have crept into power, as Judges, Juſtices of the Peace, Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the monthly Aſſeſſement, &amp;c. by theſe means.</p>
            <p>1. Some by Marriages and Alliances.</p>
            <p>2. Others by the favour and countenance of Eminent Perſons, in authority for private ends.</p>
            <p>3. Many have intruded and inſinuated themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſociety and fellowſhip, of the honeſt, godly Congregations, and by their falſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful demeanors, have undiſervedly acquired the good opinion and certificates of thoſe godly, harmleſs people, who did not ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottom of their deſigns, nor diſcovered that ugly ſhape, covered with that outward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and meer formality of Religion, denying the power thereof, the better to conceal their evil purpoſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106190:3"/>And by theſe wyles having crept into authority, may prove the moſt dangerous Inſtruments in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: For the moſt notorious Cavaliers, and enemies of our peace, would accept of places of honour, power, and profit from their enemies hands, for theſe reaſons &amp; ends:</p>
            <p>1. They are thereby in a better capacity to diſcover to the common enemy the honeſt deſigns and purpoſes of the well-affected people of the Nation.</p>
            <p>2. To ſerve, countenance, and protect their own mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant party and intereſt; and to oppreſs and undermine the honeſt well-affected party.</p>
            <p>3. They being conſcious of their own guilt and incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, are the more ready to act arbitrarily at the will and pleaſure of any perſon, that ſhall be the means to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to power and authority.</p>
            <p>4. And thereby bring the Government into contempt, in the judgment and affections of the good people, and all conducing to the introducing and re-inveſting of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, and his party, into power and authority in the Nations.</p>
            <p>And the boldneſs of theſe ſubtle Cavaliers have been ſuch, That (having procured themſelves to be Elected by their malignant parties and intereſts in the Countries) they had the confidence to ſit in the great Council of the Nation, whereby they are in a capacity to carry on their malignant deſigns, and to challenge equal voices with thoſe Eminent Members that have ſpent their blood and treaſure to ſerve this Common-wealth, and redeem it <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And it pleaſed the Lord in a providential manner to point at, and diſcover two of theſe notorious Cavaliers, lately expelled the Houſe.</p>
            <p>But it is to be feared there may be many more of like guilt and principles that are left behind, who may prove the grand obſtructors of the bleſſed work of Reformation in all theſe three Nations, for which ſo much blood and

               <p>1. And by this means thoſe that know themſelves to be guilty, will immediately withdraw, without the trouble of charges, and examination of witneſſes.</p>
               <p>2. That a ſtanding Committee be appointed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from time to time to receive all complaints againſt all Malignants, Delinquents, and ill-affected perſons for bearing Offices, contrary to the ſeveral Acts, Orders, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Declarations of Parliaments, with power to impoſe Fines and Impriſonments on the offenders, in caſe they hold, or exerciſe their offices after publication made to the contrary.
