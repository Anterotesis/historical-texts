            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am perſwaded, that thoſe of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who now ſeem diſcontented at the Preſent State of Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> are miſtaken in the matter of Fact; and that they do imagine the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Laws, and Liberties of this Nation might have been ſecured to us, and our Poſterity, by other, and thoſe more legal Methods.</p>
            <p>Now if this Conceit of theirs were true, their Diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction would not be wholly unreaſonable; but to me, who have conſidered every Step of this Great Revolution with the utmoſt Attention of Mind, it ſeems altogether falſe and groundleſs.</p>
            <p>But whether they or I are miſtaken, it is abſolutely neceſſary that the matter of Fact ſhould be truly and fairly ſtated; which cannot be done, but by repreſenting in one View all the Papers which paſſed on both ſides, with the Actions which hapned, the preſent State of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at home and abroad, when the Revolution began, and the temper of Mens Minds in all the Occurrences as they hapned: And this I have endeavoured to do with all the Brevity, Perſpicuity, and Fidelity which was poſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56339:4"/>
As I am the firſt that have attempted it, ſo it is not impoſſible there may be ſome Miſtakes, Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or Errors; but there is not one wilful Error, and I will rectifie any involuntary Stumble I may have made, upon the firſt Advice of it.</p>
            <p>To have fully cleared this Queſtion, it was perhaps neceſſary that I ſhould have begun with the Year <hi>1600.</hi> and the Reſtitution of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, or at leaſt at his Death; but this would have taken too much time to have preſently gone about it; and if I find this is well received, and encouraged, I will in a convenient time do it; eſpecially if I may have the liberty of the Council-Book, and the Paper-Office, and ſuch other helps as are neceſſary.</p>
            <p>And in the mean time, I conceive this ſhort Abſtract of the Publick Printed Papers, is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any Man, that the <hi>Popiſh Party</hi> were reſolved we ſhould be Rebels, (as they now account us) or Slaves; and His late Majeſty was ſo far prevailed upon by them, that he choſe rather to deſert his <hi>Throne,</hi> than to loſe all the Poſſibilities of Eſtabliſhing an abſolute Soveraignty over the Nation, and <hi>Popery</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe it is not pretended in <hi>England,</hi> His late Majeſty forfeited his Right to Govern by his Miſgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but that the ſenſe of it prevail'd upon him rather to throw up the Government, than to concur with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Free-Parliament in all that was needful to
<pb facs="tcp:56339:4"/>
re-eſtabliſh our <hi>Laws, Liberties</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> and this is a proper legal <hi>Abdication,</hi> as it is diſtinguiſhed from a Voluntary <hi>Reſignation</hi> on the one hand, and a Violent <hi>Depoſition</hi> on the other.</p>
            <p>He was bound to govern us according to Law, and we were not bound to ſubmit to any other than a legal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but be would not do the one, and ſaw he could not force us to ſubmit to the other, and therefore deliberately relinquiſhed the <hi>Throne,</hi> and withdrew his Perſon and Seals, diſſolving (as much as he could) the whole Frame of our Government.</p>
            <p>The Reader may obſerve, tho' he give Reaſons why he withdrew the ſecond time, he never gave any why he went away at firſt; nor can any be aſſigned (as I verily believe) but that which I have expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Now if this be the true ſtate of this great Affair, then we were legally diſcharged of our Allegiance to <hi>James</hi> the Second, the Eleventh of <hi>December</hi> laſt paſt; and his Return afterwards, which was forced and involuntary, could have no Influence upon us; and if he were now to be reſtored again, he muſt be re-crowned and ſworn <hi>de novo,</hi> as <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was after he was reſtored by the Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There may poſſibly be ſome few Men ſo ſuperlative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Loyal, that rather than they would not ſtill be under the Government of <hi>James</hi> the Second, they would throw up all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and ſubmit to an abſolute and unlimited Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
<pb facs="tcp:56339:5"/>
either out of Scruple of Conſcience, Vanity, or Humour; now to theſe I have nothing to ſay, but that if they are willing to be <hi>Slaves,</hi> they may; but it is unreaſonable that they ſhould enſlave all the reſt of the Nation too; and as the Number is not great, ſo I am perſwaded (if Patience and gentle Methods are uſed) theſe Men will in a ſhort time be convinced by their own Intereſt, and acquieſce at leaſt, if they do not heartily joyn with the reſt in the Defence of the preſent Government.</p>
            <p>As to the ſmall Piece which I have anſwered, I cannot but admire at the <hi>Encomiums</hi> have been given it; I hope there is nothing in it worth regarding, which I have not fairly anſwered; at leaſt I am ſure it is very anſwerable, it being wholly founded on Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, either as to the matter of Fact, or the Laws of <hi>England:</hi> But be this as it will, I ſubmit to it the Reader to judge between us.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF THE DESERTION, AND AN ANSWER to a DISCOURSE, Intitled, <hi>The Deſertion diſcuſs'd:</hi> In a Letter to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Gentleman.</head>
            <p>THE late Tranſactions of that part of our Nation, which have eſpouſed the Intereſts and Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are ſo full of Wonder, that I perſwade my ſelf, Poſterity will look upon the Story of the laſt ten years, as a meer <hi>Romance;</hi> and will very hardly believe ſo ſmall a Party durſt attempt, or ſo great a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy would ever ſo long ſuffer what we have born with a <hi>Stoical</hi> Patience, I had almoſt ſaid <hi>Inſenſibility.</hi> But then this <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> was not owing either to their Courage, or their Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but a ſtrong Perſwaſion, that how ill ſoever they uſed us of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Non-reſiſtance</hi> would keep us in awe; and if the other part of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſhould offer to reſcue the Nation out of their <hi>Claws,</hi> our Zeal for the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and the <hi>Royal Family</hi> would have the ſame effect it had in the <hi>Monmouth</hi> Invaſion, and end in the Ruin of them.</p>
            <p>However, to prevent the worſt, they reſolved to keep up a numerous Army to ſuppreſs betimes any Party that might ſtir in the Nation; and to fix them the more to their Intereſt, they not only exempted the Souldiers from the Civil Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but ſuffer'd them to out-rage and injure whom they they pleaſed almoſt without reſtraint.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56339:6"/>
To divide us yet more, they procured a <hi>Toleration</hi> for the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and made ſuch fulſom Applications to them, and they again returned the Complement in ſuch <hi>Rhetorical Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes,</hi> that it was verily thought the Church of <hi>England</hi> Party would very eaſily have been given up for a Sacrifice to the <hi>kind, ſincere, well-meaning Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Diſſenters were not ſo eaſily wheedled into a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of what they had ſo lately ſuffered; and altho' they gave the <hi>Fathers</hi> many good words, and fair Promiſes, yet when they had opportunity, they gave ſuch bold hints of their Reſolution to defeat the Expectations of theſe Gentlemen, that I proteſt I wondred at nothing more than to ſee them ſo ſar infatuated, as to believe they ſhould ever reap any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from our <hi>Non-cons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were however ingaged, and therefore they muſt go on, be the Event what it would; and finding it would be a work of time; and that it was not poſſible <hi>James</hi> II. ſhould live to ſee it effected, and that after his death the Succeſſion of the then <hi>Princeſs of Orange</hi> would put an end to all this <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> of <hi>Confuſion</hi> they had with ſo much Labour and Hazard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. They reſolved in the next place to take care for a <hi>Catholick Succeſſor</hi> to finiſh this great Work. And in truth it was a Project worthy of ſuch bold Undertakers, if they could have as eaſily deluded the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> as they frequently do thoſe who have a mighty fondneſs for Miracles, and had rather be deceived than find out the <hi>Legerdemains</hi> of the Prieſthood: But then this was ſo highly improbable, that I wonder they ever entred into it; and that none of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have yet told us, that we ought not to think it poſſible for them to be ſuch Fools as to attempt to impoſe in a matter of that Conſequence upon ſo learned, ſo curious, ſo diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and fierce a Nation as this of <hi>England</hi> is: I aſſure them this Argument would have more force than all the <hi>Depoſitions</hi> they have printed in that caſe, and engage many to eſpouſe their Quarrel out of pure <hi>Piquantry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How far they might yet have gone, and what would in the end have been the conſequence of this <hi>formal Plot</hi> upon our Lives, Liberties, and Religion, is known to none but God: They looked upon the Proteſtant or Britiſh Intereſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as wholly at their Mercy: <hi>Scotland</hi> was in ſuch a condition,

that nothing could be begun there, which would not termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ruin of the Undertakers: And <hi>England</hi> was ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in Intereſt and Religion, that they expected a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Body of the Proteſtants would lend them their aſſiſtance to ruine the reſt, and therefore call'd them their <hi>Scaffolds. France,</hi> the moſt Potent of our Neighbours, was apparently engag'd in the ſame Deſign; <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> engaged againſt each other in the Quarrel of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein.</hi> The Proteſtant Princes in <hi>Germany</hi> were either awed by the <hi>French,</hi> or divided between the Northern Crowns: <hi>Spain</hi> was weak, and unable to defend it ſelf, and too Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick at laſt to eſpouſe heartily the Intereſts of a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Nation againſt a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Prince; ſo that they had nothing to fear but the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> And they looked upon the States as a knot of Merchants, more intent upon their <hi>Trade,</hi> than concern'd for the Fate of <hi>England;</hi> and yet if they ſhould attempt any thing, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> by Sea and Land would eaſily reduce them into the ſame ſtate they were in in the year 1672.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſing the <hi>French</hi> King who is ſo zealous a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholick, had not ſo vigorouſly (and as far as I can ſee) ſo impolitickly carried on the Controverſie with the Pope about the Franchiſes of his Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome;</hi> and that he had had the patience to ſuffer the Emperor to recover what his Anceſtors had loſt to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and left the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> (who is a Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick) and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to the determination of the Pope, what had <hi>France</hi> loſt in all this? And who then could have made one ſtep to the Recovery of <hi>England?</hi> I know very well it is ſaid, <hi>the Emperor would certainly begin a War with</hi> France <hi>ſo ſoon as ever he had ended this with the</hi> Turks <hi>to his mind:</hi> And in truth he had juſt reaſon ſo to do. But it is more probable he would have ſpent firſt ſome years in fortifying, peopling, and ſetling his new Conqueſts to ſecure himſelf on that ſide againſt his moſt formidable Neighbour, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that he would preſently transfer his Arms and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Armies from the Eaſt to the Weſt, and paſs ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from one long and ruinous War to another of no leſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and expence. And yet if he had done ſo, the Princes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56339:7"/>
of the Empire would never ſo heartily and generally have joyned with him againſt <hi>France,</hi> if he had been the <hi>Aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> how juſt ſoever his cauſe had been, as it might eaſily have been foreſeen they would, when they were firſt attack'd, and as it were forced to flie to the Emperor for his Protection. So that it was apparently the Intereſt of <hi>France</hi> to have ſate ſtill, and to have taken the firſt opportunity had offered it ſelf to have enſlaved the firſt of his Neighbours that had call'd him to their aſſiſtance; and our <hi>Engliſh Jeſuits</hi> did not doubt but that he would.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Interim</hi> it was well for <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> King acted as he did; for to him, in a great meaſure, our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is owing (tho' he never intended it) his Breach with the Pope and the Empire, having not only given the <hi>Dutch</hi> a pretence to arm by Sea and Land, and ſo blinded the Eyes of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, that they never ſaw, nor would believe themſelves concern'd in it, till it was too late to help it: But it alſo united not only all the Proteſtant, but all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Princes too (except <hi>France)</hi> in the Project of delivering us for their own ſecurity, that we might be in a condition to unite with them again for the preſervation of <hi>Europe,</hi> from following the triumphant Chariot of <hi>France</hi> in Chains.</p>
            <p>His late Majeſty ſeems to have been the only Prince in Chriſtendom, who made it his great, and almoſt only deſign to advance the Intereſts of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without, and againſt his own temporal Intereſt. The reſt of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and their Council look in the firſt place to their own Concerns at home and abroad, and make the Affairs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſubſervient to their other Deſigns. The Pope is not ſo fond of his old <hi>Mumpſimus,</hi> or of the Decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf, as to ſuffer <hi>France</hi> to conquer <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> no nor <hi>England,</hi> nor <hi>Holland</hi> neither, how much ſoever it might ſeem to facilitate their Reduction to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> becauſe he knows very well the firſt Prince that ſhall make himſelf the Univerſal Monarch of <hi>Europe,</hi> or gain ſuch a power over the reſt, as is not to be diſputed or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, will certainly put an end to the Soveraignty, Wealth, Grandeur, and Independency of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Pope will become as ſubject to him (notwithſtanding his Infallibility) as the <hi>Mufty</hi> is to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56339:7"/>
never makes any Scruple to depoſe, or bow-ſtring the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Gentleman whenever he croſſeth his Deſigns, and to ſet up another in his ſtead, whoſe Infallibility will be more complaiſant. The Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> is as religious and as zealous a Prince for the Roman Catholick Religion as ever ſprung out of that Family: But he has no mind, after all, to loſe his Life, his Empire, and his Liberty; he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there ſhould be ſome Hereticks in <hi>Germany,</hi> than to ſuffer the <hi>French</hi> King to ſend his Apoſtolick Dragoons to convert them, and drive him into Exile. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> values the poor diſpeopl'd ſhare he has yet left him in <hi>Europe,</hi> too well to put it into the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> in order to the reducing the Northern Hereticks to the <hi>See of Rome.</hi> No wonder then that theſe Princes ſhould all unite with his now Majeſty of <hi>England,</hi> againſt a Prince of their own Religion, when they ſaw he had embraced a deſign which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly end in his and all their Ruins, and which would raiſe <hi>France</hi> to ſuch an height of Power, as could never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved.</p>
            <p>This was very near the ſtate of Affairs at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, when Monſieur the <hi>Comte d' Avaux,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Ambaſſador<note place="margin">N.

            <p>The 26th of <hi>September</hi> there was an Order made to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize and empower the Lords Lieutenants (many of which were Roman Catholicks, or unqualified perſons) of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Counties, to grant Deputations to ſuch Gentlemen as had been lately removed from being Deputy-Lieutenants; and his Majeſty alſo gave directions to the Right Honourable the Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> to put into the Commiſſion of the Peace ſuch Gentlemen as had been lately laid aſide, and ſhall be recommended by the ſaid Lords-Lieutenants.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Interim</hi> certain Intelligence being brought, that the Preparations in <hi>Holland</hi> were deſigned againſt <hi>England:</hi> The 24th of <hi>September</hi> were ſummoned the Biſhop of <hi>London, Wincheſter, Ely, Chicheſter, Rocheſter</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and the 28th of <hi>Septemb.</hi> they appeared at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and there waited accordingly that day upon the King in a Body; <hi>Wincheſter, Ely, Chicheſter, Rocheſter, Bath and Wells,</hi> and <hi>Peterborough;</hi> but <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Briſtol</hi> came not then to Town; and the Archbiſhop was ſick, and came alone the next day.

            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> the 5th, two days after the Biſhops had made the Ten famous <hi>Propoſals</hi> above-recited, the King declared in Council, That in purſuance of his Reſolution and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to protect the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that all Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Jealouſies to the contrary may be removed, he had thought fit to diſſolve the <hi>Commiſſion for Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> &amp;c. and accordingly did give Directions to the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>England</hi> to cauſe the ſame to be forthwith done. Now this was only half what was asked; it not being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared illegal, nor any Promiſe made, ſo ſoon as ever the times would ſerve, it ſhould not be renewed: And we ſhall ſee the Jeſuits were champing on it bye and bye.</p>
            <p>The 6th. of <hi>October</hi> the King was alſo graciouſly pleaſed to reſtore to the City of <hi>London</hi> all their ancient Franchiſes and Privileges, as fully as they enjoyed them before the late Judgment upon the <hi>Quo Warranto;</hi> and the Lord Chancellor did them the honour to bring down the Inſtrument of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and Confirmation, under the Great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> And Sir <hi>John Chapman</hi> was thereby conſtituted Lord Mayor till the time of Election, and was accordingly ſworn in the Guild-hall with the uſual Solemnity.</p>
            <p>The ſame day the Aldermen (now in being) that were at the time of the ſaid Judgment took their former Places, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56339:13"/>
the Vacancies were to be ſupplied by the Election of the Citizens, according to the Ancient Cuſtom of the City.</p>
            <p>And an Addreſs of Thanks was forthwith voted and ſigned for the Favour granted to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> the 10th. his Majeſty having received ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of great Abuſes committed in the late Regulations of the Corporations, he thereupon in Council thought fit to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize and require the Lords Lieutenants of the ſeveral Counties to inform themſelves of all ſuch Abuſes and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, within their Lieutenancies, and to make forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Report thereof to his Majeſty, together with what they conceive fit to be done for the redreſſing of the ſame: Whereupon he would give ſuch further Orders as ſhould be requiſite. But preſſing News coming over from time to time of the great Preparations in <hi>Holland,</hi> theſe ſlow Methods ſoon appeared unſafe, and not fit to be relied upon; and therefore it became neceſſary to throw up at once this great and beloved Advantage, now it was utterly impoſſible to keep it any longer. By all which we may obſerve, that all was pure Force and Fear; and it will appear more fully in what is to follow.</p>
            <p>The 11th. of <hi>October</hi> there was publiſh'd a Form of Prayers to be us'd in all Cathedral, Collegiate, and Parochial Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Chappels, within this Kingdom, during the time of Publick Apprehenſions from the Danger of Invaſion, and to be added to the daily Office both Morning and Evening, immediately after the Prayers for the King and the Royal Family. The firſt of theſe was a Prayer for Repentance; the ſecond, for the King.</p>
            <q>O <hi>Almighty God, the bleſſed and onely Potentate, we affer up our humble Supplications and Prayers to thy Divine Goodneſs, beſeeching thee in this time of Danger to ſave and protect our moſt gracious King: Give thy holy Angels charge over him; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Royal Perſon in Health and Safety; inſpire him with Wiſdom and Juſtice in all his Counſels;</hi> Proſper all his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings for thy Honour and Service with good Suceeſs; <hi>Fill his Princely Heart with a Fatherly Care of all his People; and give all his Subjects Grace always to bear Faith and</hi> true <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his Majeſty; that both King and People joining together to</hi>

            <p>The third Prayer for Peace and Unity.</p>
            <q>O <hi>Lord God, our onely Hope in time of need; ſave and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, we humbly beſeech thee, from all thoſe</hi> Dangers that threaten us; <hi>Give Peace in our Days, O Lord, if it be thy Will, and prevent the Effuſion of Christian Blood in our Land: Reconcile all our Diſſentions, and heal all our Breaches:</hi> Preſerve that holy Religion we profeſs, together with our Laws and Ancient Government; <hi>and unite us all in unfeigned and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Charity one towards another, and in one and the ſame holy Worſhip and Communion; that with one Heart and one Mouth we may glorifie thy holy Name, and ſhew forth thy Praiſe from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to Generation: And this we beg for the ſake of Jeſus thy beloved, in whom thou art well pleaſed; to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory now and evermore.</hi> Amen.</q>
            <p>I am fully perſuaded, theſe Prayers contributed very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably to the late Revolution, and taught Men they were no more bound to promote any of the late King's Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings with their Swords, than with their Prayers, but what tended to the Honour and Service of God: And the very ſupplicating God to <hi>Preſerve our Holy Religion, together with our Laws and Ancient Government,</hi> neceſſarily put Men in mind that they had been endangered; and by whom, was as well known; and it ſeemed Nonſenſe and Hypocriſie to pray to God to preſerve theſe, and in the mean time to aid and aſſiſt the Enemies of both to deſtroy and ruine them.</p>

the putting them into the ſame State, Condition, and Plight they were in at the times of ſuch Deeds of Surrender, or Judgment made or given.

            <p>It was neceſſary to tranſcribe this long Piece, to ſhew what an hurry of Confuſion the Nation was then in, and how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable it was for the Biſhops in their Seventh Propoſal to deſire the Reſtitution of all theſe Corporations and Burroughs to their Ancient State, without which (as things had been carried of late eſpecially) it was altogether impoſſible a Free and Legal Parliament ſhould be holden.</p>
            <p>The 12th. of <hi>October</hi> his Majeſty having declared his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to preſerve the Church of <hi>England</hi> in all its Rights and Immunities, as an Evidence of it, ſignified his Pleaſure to the Right Reverend Father in God the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> as Viſitor of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> to ſettle that Society Regularly and Statutably, who
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56339:16"/>
accordingly cauſed the 16th. of that Month a Citation to be fixed up on the College Gates, to recal Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> and the former Fellows of that Society, by the ſecond of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> following: And he accordingly went down to reinſtate them, and was joyfully received by the Univerſity; but an Account coming that very Poſt, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet had ſuffered very much in a Storm the 16th. of the ſame Month <hi>N. S.</hi> and that they would hardly be able to ſail till the Spring, his Lordſhip was recalled to <hi>London,</hi> and the Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution put off. But ſoon after that falſe News being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted, the Affection to the Church of <hi>England</hi> revived, and the 24th. of <hi>October</hi> he returned, and went thorow with the Work.</p>
            <p>The 20th. of <hi>October</hi> we had the Favour of the following Proclamation beſtowed upon us.</p>
            <q>
               <p>FOraſmuch as the great Preparations made to invade and conquer this Our Kingdom, require Our utmoſt Care in providing for the neceſſary Safety and Defence thereof, wherein we reſolve (thro' God's Aſſiſtance) not to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and to the intent that Our Enemies, who will bring the heavy and ſad Calamities of War, may not ſtrengthen themſelves at their coming hither, by ſeiſing the Horſes, Oxen, and Cattel of any of Our Subjects, which may be uſeful and ſerviceable to them for Burthen and Draught: We have therefore thought fit, and We do here by this Our Royal Proclamation (publiſhed by and with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Our Privy Council) ſtrictly charge and command all and every the Lords Lieutenants and Deputy-Lieutenants of Our reſpective Counties adjoining to the Sea, and all She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, Juſtices of Peace, Mayors, Bailiffs, and all and every other Officers and Miniſters Civil and Military, within their reſpective Counties, Cities, Towns, and Diviſions, That they cauſe the Coaſts to be carefully watched, and upon the firſt approach of the Enemy, to cauſe all Horſes, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and Cattel which may be fit for Burthen or Draught, and not actually employed in the Defence and Service of Us and the Country, to be driven and removed by the ſpace of at leaſt Twenty miles from the Place where the Enemy ſhall attempt to Land, and to ſecure the ſame in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56339:17"/>
ſuch effectual manner, that they may not fall into the hands or power of any of Our Enemies: Wherein nevertheleſs it is Our Will and Pleaſure that the reſpective owners may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as little damage and loſs as may be conſiſtent with the great and publick ſafety of the Kingdom.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The ſame day the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who had but a ſhort time before been turned out of the Lieutenancy of <hi>Eſſex</hi> for refuſing to conſent to the Repeal of the Penal Laws and Teſts, was reſtored to the ſaid Office, as ſeveral others were about the ſame time.</p>
            <p>The 22d. of <hi>October</hi> his Majeſty ordered the Council to be aſſembled, and deſired the <hi>Queen Dowager,</hi> and ſuch of the Peers of this Kingdom, both Spiritual and Temporal, as were in Town, as alſo the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> and the Judges, and ſeveral of their Majeſties Council learned in the Law, and the Ladies, Lords, and others that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Queen's Labour, did appear there, and declare upon Oath what they knew of the Birth of his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> (as he was then call'd) of all which a full and particular Relation was then promiſed to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as was ſoon after done; but then thoſe Depoſitions are too well known to need, and too long to be here inſerted without cauſe: They have ſince been examined by another Pen, and therefore I may the better paſs them by, when I have put this ſhort queſtion, Why were they ſo long delay'd, and to what purpoſe were they now publiſhed? Why, they had received intelligence that the Troops were now on Shipboard, and that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> would embark himſelf ſo ſoon as the Ships from the <hi>Texel</hi> have joyn'd with thoſe in the <hi>Maes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Nation was by this time exaſperated and fermented to that height againſt the Court and the Popiſh party, that all places were fill'd with Reports and Whiſpers to their Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, many of which were falſe, and ſome ridiculous and impoſſible, which yet were then greedily ſwallowed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly ſpread and promoted; the Authors of them being utterly unknown, and doing it on various accounts, ſome out of meer Wantonneſs and Banter; others out of Spite, Deſign, and Averſion. And there can be nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56339:17"/>
than to expect his now Majeſty ſhould be obliged to prove all the ſilly Stories were then ſpread abroad by thoſe who pretended to favour his Intereſt, but did in reality rather miſchief than good to him. To put a ſtop to theſe Rumours, the 26. of <hi>October</hi> this following Proclamation was publiſhed.</p>
            <q>
               <p>ALtho' ſince Our Acceſſion to the Crown, We have graciouſly extended Our Royal Mercy and Clemency to Our Subjects by ſeveral General Pardons, one whereof was lately publiſhed; yet we are ſenſible that divers evil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed perſons being not reformed or wrought upon by ſuch Our Grace and Favour, do notwithſtanding make it their buſineſs by Writing, Printing or, Speaking, to defame Our Government with falſe and ſeditious News and Reports, thereby intending to amuſe Our loving Subjects, and as far as they are able, to create in them an univerſal Jealouſie and Diſcontent, eſpecially in this time of publick Danger threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the intended Invaſion upon this our Kingdom, and conſequently to alienate the Hearts of ſuch of Our loving Subjects from Us, who otherwiſe would readily yield unto Us that Aid and Aſſiſtance which by their Natural Allegiance they are bound to do: And whereas by the ancient Laws and Statutes of this Realm, great and heavy Penalties are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon all ſuch as ſhall be found to be Spreaders of falſe News, or Promoters of any malicious Slanders and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in their ordinary and common Diſcourſe, or otherwiſe; and moreſpecially upon ſuch who ſhall utter, or publiſh any words or things to incite or ſtir up the People to hatred or diſlike of Our Perſon, or the eſtabliſhed Government: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, there have been of late more bold and licencious Diſcourſes than formerly, and men have aſſumed to themſelves a liberty, not only in <hi>Coffee houſes,</hi> but in other Places and Meetings both publick and private, to cenſure and defame the Proceedings of State, by ſpeaking evil of things they underſtand not: We therefore conſidering that Offences of this nature proceed from the reſtleſs Malice of evil Perſons, or from the careleſs Demeanour of others, who preſume too much upon Our accuſtomed Clemency and Goodneſs, have therefore thought fit by this Our Royal Proclamation, by and with the Advice of Our Privy-Council,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56339:18"/>
ſtreightly to forewarn, and command all Our Subjects of what eſtate or condition they be, that they preſume not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, either by Writing, Printing, or Speaking, to utter or publiſh any falſe News or Reports whatſoever, or to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with the Affairs of State or Government, or with the Perſons of any of Our Counſellors or Miniſters, in their common and ordinary Diſcourſes, as they will anſwer the contrary at their utmoſt perils.</p>
               <p>And becauſe all bold and irreverent Speeches touching matters of high nature, and all malicious and falſe Reports tending to Sedition, or to the Amuſement of Our People, are puniſhable not only in the Speakers, but in the Hearers alſo, unleſs they do ſpeedily reveal the ſame unto ſome of Our Privy-Council, or ſome other of Our Judges or Juſtices of the Peace: Therefore that all perſons may be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, who ſhall not hereafter contain themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that modeſt and dutiful Regard which becomes them, We do further declare, that We will proceed with all Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Rigor againſt all ſuch perſons who ſhall be guilty of any ſuch malicious and unlawful Practices, by Writing, Printing, or other Publication of ſuch falſe News and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, or who ſhall receive or hear the ſame without reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or giving Information thereof, as aforeſaid, in due time: We being reſolved to ſuppreſs the ſaid Enormities by a moſt ſtrict and exemplary Puniſhment of all ſuch Offenders, as ſhall hereafter be diſcovered. And We do hereby ſtrictly charge and cammand all and ſingular Our Judges, Juſtices of the Peace, Sheriffs, Mayors, Bailiffs, and all other Our Officers and Miniſters whatſoever, to take effectual care for the ſpeedy Apprehenſion, Proſecution, and ſevere Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all ſuch perſons who ſhall at any time hereafter be found Offenders herein.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Proclamation rather increaſed the Averſion men then generally had for the Government; and there were very few who did not preſently reflect on <hi>Father Petre,</hi> who was then one of the Privy-Council, as fitter to be hang'd, than reverenc'd; but they were then under Hatches, and muſt comply, and for two or three days News was wondrous ſcarce; but then they fell to it again with ſo much the greater liberty, the publick ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56339:18"/>
prevailing over their Fear, as the day of their wiſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption grew nearer. But however, the Roman Catholicks from this time forward were ſtudiouſly avoided, no man fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any trouble from any body elſe, as in truth I never heard of any man that was proſecuted on this account.</p>
            <p>The 28th. of <hi>October</hi> the Earl of <hi>Sunderland</hi> was removed from the Office of Principal Secretary of State, and the Lord Viſcount <hi>Preſton</hi> put in his room: This Change pleaſed all men, but it came too late.</p>
            <p>As the Cauſe of the Diſmiſſion of the Earl of <hi>Sunderland</hi> was then wholly unknown, ſo it gave occaſion to the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Report that had been ſpread not long before, upon the Impriſonment of Sir <hi>Bevil Skelton</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador in <hi>France,</hi> that there had lately been a League concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> for the Extirpation of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> here, and the eſtabliſhing <hi>Popery and Arbitrary Government;</hi> to which end the <hi>French</hi> King was (as was ſaid) to ſend a conſiderable Army, and great Sums of Money into <hi>England;</hi> and as it was before pretended, that <hi>Skelton</hi> being a Proteſtant, had diſcovered this Tranſaction to the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> So it was now ſaid, <hi>Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had loſt the Original League out of his <hi>Scritore,</hi> and that it was carried over to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> But ſince that the Earl of <hi>Sunderland</hi> has publiſhed a Letter, wherein he has given a larger Account of the true Cauſe of his being laid aſide, than is any where elſe to be met with; and therefore I think it reaſonable to add it here.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>The Earl of</hi> Sunderland<hi>'s Letter to a Friend in</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>publiſhed</hi> March 23d. 1689.</head>
                  <p>TO comply with what you deſire, I will explain ſome things which we talked of before I left <hi>England.</hi> I have been in a Station of a great noiſe, without Power or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage whilſt I was in it, and to my Ruin now I am out of it. I know I cannot juſtifie my ſelf by ſaying, though it is true, that I thought to have prevented much Miſchief;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56339:19"/>
for when I found that I could not, I ought to have quitted the Service; neither is it an Excuſe that I have got none of thoſe things which uſually engage men in publick Affairs: My Quality is the ſame it ever was, and my Eſtate much worſe, even ruin'd, tho' I was born to a very conſiderable one, which I am aſhamed to have ſpoiled, tho' not ſo much as if I had encreaſed it by indirect means. But to go on to what you expect: The pretence to a Diſpenſing Power being not only the firſt thing which was much diſliked ſince the death of the late King, but the foundation of all the reſt, I ought to begin with that which I had ſo little to do with, that I never heard it ſpoken of till the time of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebellion, that the King told ſome of the Council of which I was one, that he was reſolved to give Employments to Roman Catholicks, it being fit that all perſons ſhould ſerve who could be uſeful, and on whom he might depend. I think every body adviſed him againſt it, but with little effect, as was ſoon ſeen: That Party was ſo well pleaſed with that the King had done, that they perſwaded him to mention it in his Speech at the next meeting of the Parliament, which he did, after many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates whether it was proper or not; in all which I oppoſed it, as is known to very conſiderable Perſons, ſome of which were of another opinion; for I thought it would engage the King too far, and it did give ſuch offence to the Parliament, that it was thought neceſſary to prorogue it; <hi>after which, the King fell immediately to the ſupporting the Diſpenſing Power, the moſt Chimerical thing that was ever thought of, and must be ſo till the Government here is as abſolute as in</hi> Turkey, <hi>all Power being included in that one.</hi> This is the ſenſe I ever had of it, and when I heard Lawers defend it, I never changed my Opinion or Language; however it went on, moſt of the Judges being for it, and was the chief buſineſs of the State, till it was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as ſetled. Then the Eccleſiaſtical Court was ſet up, in which there being ſo many conſiderable men of ſeveral kinds, I could have but a ſmall part; and that after Lawyers had told the King it was legal, and nothing like the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Court, I can moſt truly ſay, and it is well known that for a good while I defended <hi>Magdalen Colledge</hi> purely by care and induſtry, and have hundreds of times begg'd of the King never to grant <hi>Mandates,</hi> or to change any thing in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56339:19"/>
regular courſe of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, which he often thought reaſonable, and then by perpetual Importunities was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon againſt his ownſenſe; which was the very caſe of <hi>Magdalen Colledge,</hi> as of ſome others.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things which I endeavoured, though without Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, drew upon me the Anger and Ill-will of many about the King. The next thing to be try'd, was to take off the Penal Laws and the Teſts, ſo many having promiſed their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards it, that his Majeſty thought it feaſible; but he ſoon found it was not to be done by that Parliament, which made all the Catholicks deſire it might be diſſolv'd, which I was ſo much againſt, that they complained of me to the King, as a man who ruined all his Deſigns by oppoſing the only thing could carry them on; Liberty of Conſcience being the Foundation on which he was to build. That it was firſt offered at by the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> who by it had done the work, even in the late King's time, if it had not been for his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the weakneſs of his Miniſters: Yet I hindred the Diſſolution ſeveral Weeks, by telling the King that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in Being would do every thing he could deſire, but the taking off the Penal Laws and the Teſts, or the allowing his Diſpenſing Power, and that any other Parliament, tho' ſuch a one could be had as was propoſed, would probably never repeal thoſe Laws; and if they did, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly never do any thing for the ſupport of the Government, whatever exigency it might be in. At that time the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was ſick, upon which I ſaid often to the King, that if he ſhould die, it would be impoſſible for his Majeſty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the peace of Chriſtendom, that a War muſt be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſuch a one as would chiefly concern <hi>England;</hi> and that if the preſent Parliament continued, he might be ſure of all the help and ſervice he could wiſh; but in caſe he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd it, he muſt give over all thoughts of fereign Affairs, for no other would ever aſſiſt him, but on ſuch terms as would ruine the Monarchy; ſo that from abroad, or at home, he would be deſtroy'd, if the Parliament were broken, and any accident ſhould happen, of which there were many, to make the aid of his People neceſſary to him. This and much more I ſaid to him ſeveral times privately, and in the hearing of others. But being over-power'd, the Parliament was broke,

the Cloſetting went on, and a new one was to be choſen, who was to get by cloſetting, I need not ſay; but it was certainly not I, nor any of my Friends; many of them ſuffered, who I would fain have ſaved, and yet I muſt confeſs with grief, that when the King was reſolv'd, and there was no remedy, I did not quit, as I ought to have done, but ſerved on in order to the calling another Parliament. In the midſt of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for it, and whilſt the Corporations were regulating, the King thought ſit to order his Declarations to be read in all Churches, of which I moſt ſolemnly proteſt, I never heard one word, till the King directed it in Council, that drew on the Petition of my Lord the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the other Lords the Biſhops, and their Proſecution, which I was ſo openly againſt, that by arguing continually to ſhew the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and the Imprudence of it, I brought the Fury of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> upon me to ſuch a degree, and ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, that I was juſt ſinking, and I wiſh I had then ſunk; but whatever I did fooliſhly to preſerve my ſelf, I continued ſtill to be the Object of their hatred, and I reſolv'd to ſerve the publick as well as I could, which I am ſure moſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Proteſtants then at Court can teſtifie; and ſo can one very eminent man of the Country, whom I would have perſwaded to come into buſineſs, which he might have done, to have helped me to reſiſt the violence of thoſe in power; but he deſpaired of being able to do any good, and therefore would not engage. Sometime after came the firſt News of the Prince's deſigns, which were not then look'd on as they have proved, no body foreſeeing the Miracles he has done by his wonderful Prudence, Conduct, and Courage, for the greateſt thing which has been undertaken theſe thouſand years, or perhaps ever, could not be effected without Vertues hardly to be imagined till ſeen nearer hand. Upon the firſt thought of his coming I laid hold of the opportunity to preſs the King to do ſeveral things which I would have had done ſooner; the chief of which were to reſtore <hi>Magdalen Colledge,</hi> and all other Eccleſiaſtical Preferments, which had been diverted from what they were intended for, to take off my Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Suſpenſion, to put the Counties into the ſame hands they were in ſome time before, to annual the Eccleſiaſtical Court, and to reſtore entirely all the Corporations of <hi>England</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:56339:20"/>
Theſe things weredone effectually by the help of ſome about the King; and it was then thought I had deſtroyed my ſelf, by enraging again the whole Roman Catholick Party to ſuch <note place="margin">☜</note> a height as had not been ſeen; they diſperſed Libels of me every day, told the King that I betrayed him, that I ruined him by perſwading him to make ſuch ſhameful Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but moſt of all by hindring the ſecuring the chief of the diſaffected Nobility and Gentry, which was propoſed as <note place="margin">☜</note> a certain way to break all the Prince's Meaſures; and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing his Majeſty to call a Free-Parliament, and to depend upon that, rather than upon foreign Aſſiſtance. It is true I did give him thoſe Counſels which were called weak to the laſt moment he ſuffered me in his Service; then I was accuſed of holding Correſpondence with the Prince, and it was every where ſaid amongſt them, That no better could be expected from a man ſo related as I was to the <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and ſo allied to Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and the Marquiſs of <hi>Halifax.</hi> After this Accuſations of High Treaſon were brought againſt me, which, with ſome other reaſons relating to affairs abroad, drew the Kings diſpleaſure upon me, ſo as to turn me out of all without any conſideration, and yet I thought I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped well, expecting nothing leſs than the loſs of my head, as my Lord <hi>Middleton</hi> can tell, and I believe none about the Court thought otherwiſe; nor had it been otherwiſe, if my Diſgrace had been deferred a day longer; all things being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, I was put out the 27th. of <hi>October,</hi> the Roman Catholicks having been two Months working the King up to it, without intermiſſion, beſides the ſeveral Attacks they had made upon the before, and the unuſual aſſiſtance they obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do what they thought ſo neceſſary for the carrying on their Affairs, of which they never had greater hope than at chat time, As may be remembred by any who were then at <hi>London.</hi> But you deſired I would ſay ſomething to you of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which I will do in very few words, but exactly true.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Tyroonnell</hi> has been ſo abſolute there, that I never had the credit to make an Enſign, or keep one in, nor to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome of my Friende, <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#APEX" extent="2+ words">

Parliament there, which was deſigned to alter the Acts of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement. Chief Juſtice <hi>Nugent,</hi> and Baron <hi>Rice</hi> were ſent over <note place="margin">☞</note> with a draught of an Act for that purpoſe, furniſhed with all the preſſing Arguments could be thought on to perſwade the King; and I was offered forty thouſand pounds for my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, which I told to the King, and ſhewed him at the ſame time the Injuſtice of what was propoſed to him, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice it would be to that Country, with ſo good ſucceſs, that he reſolved not to think of it that year, and perhaps never. This I was helped in by ſome Friends, particularly any Lord <hi>Godolphin</hi> who knows it to be true, and ſo do the Judges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named, and ſeveral others.</p>
                  <p>I cannot omit ſaying ſomething of <hi>France,</hi> there having been ſo much talk of a <hi>League</hi> between the two Kings. I do proteſt I never knew of any; and if there were ſuch a thing, it was carried on by other ſort of men laſt Summer. Indeed <hi>French</hi> Ships were offered to join with our Fleet, and they were refuſed; ſince the noiſe of the Prince's deſign more Ships were offered, and it was agreed how they ſhould be commanded, if ever deſired. I oppoſed to death the accepting of them, as well as any aſſiſtance of men, and can ſay moſt truly, that I was the principal means of hindring both, by the help of ſome Lords, with whom I conſulted every day, and they with me, <note place="margin">☞</note> to prevent what we thought would be of great prejudice, if not ruinous to the Nation. If the Report is true, of Men, Ships, and Money intended lately for <hi>England</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> it was agreed upon ſince I was out of buſineſs, or without my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; if it had been otherwiſe, I believe no body drinks my Diſgrace would have hapned. My greateſt Misfortune has been to be thought the Promoter of thoſe things I oppoſed and deteſted, whilſt ſome I could name have been the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Contrivers of what they have had the Art to lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others; and I was often fooliſhly willing to beaſt what my Maſter would have done, tho I uſed all poſſible Endeavours againſt it. I lie under many other Misfortunes and Afflictions extreme heavy, but I hope they have brought me to reflect on the occaſion of them the looſe, negligent, unthinking life I have hitherto led, having been perpetually hurried away from all good Thoughts, by Pleaſure, Idleneſs, the Vanity of the Court, or by Buſineſs: I hope, I ſay, that I ſhall overcome
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56339:21"/>
all the diſorders my former life had brought upon me, and that I ſhall ſpend the remaining part of it in begging of Almighty God, that he will pleaſe either to put an end to my ſufferings, or to give me ſtrength to bear them; one of which he will certainly grant to ſuch as rely on him, which I hope I do, with the Submiſſion that becomes a good Chriſtian. I would enlarge on this Subject, but that I fear you might think ſomething elſe to be the reaſon of it, beſides a true ſenſe of my Faults, and that obliges me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain my ſelf at preſent. I believe you will repent in having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me to give you this account, but I cannot the doing of what you deſire of me.</p>

            <p>The 29th. an Account was given, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 52 Men of War, with a very numerous Attendance of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuallers, and other Ships and Veſſels for the Tranſportation of the Land Forces, ſailed the <hi>Friday</hi> before, which was the 19th. from <note place="margin">N. S.</note> the <hi>Flats</hi> near the <hi>Briel,</hi> with the Wind at S. W. and by S. and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> embarkt on a Frigat of 28, or 30 Guns, and with him the Count of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> General of the Horſe, the Count <hi>de Solmes,</hi> Colonel of his Foot-Guards; the Count <hi>de Stirum,</hi> the Sieur <hi>Benting,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>Cuerkerker,</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>de Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> went on board ſuch another Frigat. And the 20th. moſt of the Fleet was ſeen in the Morning from <hi>Schevelingue</hi> when the Wind coming more Weſterly, and the next Night proving very ſtormy, it obliged them to come in again, having ſuffered conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable damage, 400 Horſes being thrown over-board, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral dead men, and one of their Men of War was ſtranded, and another diſabled.</p>
            <p>There was very little of this Story true, but it was a Report ſet on foot to deceive the Court here, and it had the effect which was expected, and the Prieſts began to boaſt very much of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance they expected from the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and the reſt of the Saints who had been powerfully ſollicited to confound this Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Fleet. The firſt of <hi>November</hi> we were again told from the <hi>Hague,</hi> that the damage the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet had ſuſtain'd by the late Storms, was greater than was at firſt reported; That there were 1500 Horſes dead or unſerviceable, That the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had loſt moſt of his own Horſes, and the Marſhal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> the beſt of his; That his Son Count <hi>Charles Schomberg</hi> was in great danger, the Ship he was in having ſpent her main Maſt;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56339:22"/>
That a Captain of Horſe in the Sieur-<hi>Bentin'gs</hi> Regiment was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, with his whole Troop; and two Captains of Foot-Guards were likewiſe miſſing with their Companies; That to ſupply theſe loſſes a great many freſh Horſes were ordered to be ſent to the Fleet; and that it was ſaid the Regiment of the Baron <hi>de Frizes</hi> ſhould be imbarkt; That in the mean time the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> continued at <hi>Helvoetſluys,</hi> intending to ſail again ſo ſoon as the Fleet was in a condition, and the Weather would permit. Thus was our Court at that time impoſed upon for want of good intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
            <p>About this time a parcel of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declarations were intercepted in <hi>London,</hi> upon reading that expreſſion in it, <hi>That the Prince was moſt earnestly invited hither by divers of the Lords both Spiritual and Temporal, and by many Gentlemen and others.</hi> The King ſent for ſome of the Biſhops again, and required of them a Paper under their hands in abhorrence of the Prince of <hi>Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge</hi>'s intended Invaſion by ſuch a day; the following Declaration was then in the Preſs, and this Abhorrence was deſigned to be tacked to it; but the Biſhops of <hi>Canterbury, London, Peterborough</hi> and <hi>Rochester</hi> (on whom only this Storm fell) refuſed to do it, as contrary to their priviledge of Peerage, and their Profeſſion in promoting a War againſt a Prince ſo near ally'd to the Crown; and they earneſtly deſired this might be left to a Free-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His Majeſty hereupon was very much incenſed againſt them, and parted from them with Indignation. <hi>And thereupon the Jeſuited Party at Court were ſo violently enraged, that as we are</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">month </seg>Novemb.</label> The 2d. day of <hi>November</hi> there was publiſhed another Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for the ſuppreſſing of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declaration.</p>
            <q>
               <p>WHereas the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> and his Adherents, who deſign forthwith to invade Our Kingdoms, in order thereunto have contrived and framed ſeveral treaſonable Papers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, hoping thereby to ſeduce Our People, and (if it were poſſible) to corrupt our Army, a very great number whereof being printed, ſeveral perſons are ſent and imployed to diſperſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56339:22"/>
the ſame throughout Our Kingdoms: And altho' all perſons (as well in criminal as in other caſes) are bound to take notice of the Laws at their peril; yet to the intent that none may think to eſcape due puniſhment, or to excuſe themſelves when they ſhall be detected, by pretending Ignorance of the nature of their Crime, We are graciouſly pleaſed by this Our Royal Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on publiſhed, by the Advice of our Privy-Council, to forewarn and admoniſh all Our Subjects of what degree or quality ſoever, that they do not publiſh or diſperſe, repeat or hand about the ſaid treaſonable Papers or Declarations, or any of them, or any other Paper or Papers of ſuch like nature, without diſcovering and revealing the ſame as ſpeedily as may be to ſome of Our Privy-Council, or ſome of Our Judges, Juſtices of the Peace, or publick Magiſtrates, upon peril of being proſecuted according to the utmoſt ſeverity of the Law.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Proclamation had the ſame effect with all the reſt of their Counſels, for men ſuſpected thereupon, that there was much more in the Declarations and Papers than they afterwards found, and accordingly became more deſirous by far to ſee it; and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Ambaſſador here in <hi>London</hi> gave them (as I have been credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly informed) to whoſoever deſired them.</p>
            <p>For about almoſt three Weeks together the Wind ſtood perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Weſt; during all which time the common queſtion was every Morning, <hi>Where is the Wind to day?</hi> And a Seaman was obſerved to curſe the Dragon in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> for turning his Head where his Tail ſhould be. But in the latter end of <hi>October</hi> the Wind came Eaſt, to the great Sorrow of the Roman Catholicks, and the Joy of the reſt of the Nation. And when all men expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Invaſion would fall on the North, the third of <hi>November</hi> between ten and eleven of the Clock the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered about half Seas over, and about five this numerous Fleet was paſſed by that Town, ſteering a Channel courſe Weſtward, the Wind at Eaſt North-Eaſt, a freſh Gale.</p>
            <p>The ſame day Captain <hi>Aylmer,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Swallow,</hi> brought into the <hi>Downs</hi> a Fly-boat belonging to this Fleet, which had on board four Companies of the Foot of Colonel <hi>Babington</hi>'s Regiment commanded by Major <hi>Colambine.</hi> They ſaid the Prince ſail'd from <hi>Goree</hi> on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the firſt of <hi>November.</hi> This Ship had had the misfortune to ſtrike upon a Sand which had torn off her
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56339:23"/>
Rudder, without doing her any other damage, ſo that ſhe was forced to float as the Winds and Seas drove her, and could hold no Courſe, which was the cauſe of her being taken: And this ſmall piece of good Fortune turn'd to their diſadvantage, men, from the number taken in this Ship, concluding that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Army was three times as great, as it really was.</p>
            <p>By this time they found that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could not be totally ſuppreſs'd; and thereupon one of the Scribling Jeſuits put out a Pamphlet againſt it, intituled, <hi>The Dutch Deſign Anatomized, or the Diſcovery of the Wickedneſs and Unjuſtice of the intended Invaſion, and a clear Proof, That it is the Intereſt of all the King's Subjects to defend his Majeſty and their Country against it.</hi> This Author has the Confidence to tell us, <hi>That the forged Heads of the Prince's Declaration, and the</hi> Biſhops Ten Propoſals, <hi>are known to be the Contrivance of the King's Enemies, framed on purpoſe to amuſe the People, and make them believe the ſetting us at rights is the only deſign of the</hi> Dutch; <hi>and till thoſe Propoſals be granted, we are not ſafe</hi> (pag. 29.) So that if the deſign had miſcarried, not only the Redreſs of thoſe Grievances was utterly to be diſpaired of, but thoſe that had made them to preſerve the King from ruin, were already arraigned for his Enemies, and accordingly to be treated. Page the 39. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>out of peeviſh ſtubbornneſs ſome will ſit ſtill, and not aſſiſt the King in this Juncture, or trayterouſly joyn with the Invaders, what can they expect from his victorions Arms, but the Puniſhment due to their Perfidiouſneſs and Cowardice.</hi> So that here was no Mercy for any but thoſe who were very active in the ruine of the Invaders; and by what followed upon the Defeat of the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> all men were able to make an Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate what would be our Deſtiny now.</p>
            <p>Another of the ſame Party comes forth ſoon after in Print, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of <hi>Reflections upon his Highneſs the Prince of</hi> Orange<hi>'s Declaration;</hi> but then neither of the theſe were ſuffered to print the Declaration it ſelf, and therefore what they ſaid of it, was neither regarded, nor believed by any of the Proteſtants, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only to exaſperate the Nation the more againſt them.</p>
            <p>The 5th. of <hi>November</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet paſſed by <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and it being a hazy foggy Morning, and full of Rain, they over-ſhot <hi>Torbay</hi> where the Prince intended to land, but about nine of the Clock the Weather cleared up, and the Wind changed W. S. W. and the Fleet ſtood Eaſtward, with a moderate Gale, entring
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56339:23"/>
               <hi>Torbay,</hi> and being then about 4 or 500 Sail in Number. This Change of the Wind was obſerved by Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to have been of no long duration, but immediately it chopped into another Corner, when it had executed its Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Prince was buſie Landing his Army in the Weſt, the King puts out here the 6th. of <hi>November</hi> this following <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>AS We cannot conſider this Invaſion of Our Kingdoms by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> without Horror, for ſo unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and unnatural an Undertaking, in a Perſon ſo nearly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Us; ſo it is Matter of the greateſt Trouble and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to Us, to reflect upon the many Miſchiefs and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which an Army of Foreigners and Rebels muſt unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bring upon Our People. It is but too evident, by a late Declaration publiſhed by him, That notwithſtanding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpecious and plauſible Pretences it carries, <hi>his Deſigns at the bottom do tend to nothing leſs than an Abſolute Uſurping of Our Crown and Royal Authority:</hi> As may fully appear by his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to himſelf in the ſaid Declaration the Regal Style, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the Peers of this Realm both Spiritual and Temporal, and all other Perſons of all Degrees, to obey and aſſiſt him in the Execution of his Deſigns; a Prerogative inſeparable from the Imperial Crown of this Realm. And for a more undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Proof of his immoderate Ambition, and which nothing can ſatisfie but the immediate Poſſeſſion of the Crown it ſelf, he calls in queſtion the Legitimacy of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Our Son, and Heir apparent; <hi>tho by the Providence of God,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>there were preſent at his Birth ſo many Witneſſes of unqueſtionable Credit, as if it ſeem'd to have been the particular Care of Heaven on purpoſe to diſappoint ſo wicked and unparallell'd an Attempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in order to the effecting of his Ambitious Deſigns, he ſeems deſirous in the Cloſe of his Declaration to ſubmit all to the Determination of a Free Parliament, hoping thereby to ingratiate himſelf with Our People; though nothing is more evident, than that a Parliament cannot be <hi>Free,</hi> ſo long as there is an Army of Foreigners in the Heart of Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; ſo that in truth he himſelf is the fole Obſtructer of ſuch a Free Parliament: We being fully reſolved, as We have already declared, ſo ſoon as by the Bleſſing of God Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56339:24"/>
ſhall be delivered from this Invaſion, to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which can no longer be liable to the leaſt Objection of not being freely choſen, ſince We have actually reſtored all the Burroughs and Corporations of this Our Kingdom to their Ancient Rights and Privileges, in which we ſhall be ready not only to receive and redreſs all the Juſt Complaints and Grievances of Our Good Subjects, but alſo to repeat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Aſſurances We have already given to them in Our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Declarations,</hi> of Our Reſolution by God's Bleſſing to maintain them in their Religion, their Liberties and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all other their Juſt Rights and Privileges whatſoever. Upon theſe Conſiderations, and the Obligations of their Duty and Natural Allegiance, we can no ways doubt, but that all Our Faithful and Loving Subjects will readily and heartily concur and joyn with Us in the entire Suppreſſing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling of thoſe Our Enemies, and Rebellious Subjects, who have ſo injuriouſly and diſloyally invaded and diſturbed the Peace and Tranquility of theſe Our Kingdoms.</p>
            </q>
            <p>All this while the Prince's Declaration was kept in, and few had ſeen it; but Men had now a general Idea of it. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in the mean time was pleaſing to very few. It was penn'd with too much Spleen and Paſſion, to create ſuitable Thoughts in the Hearts of thoſe who had leſs Intereſt in the Defeat of the Prince's Army than the R. C's had. The Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> being thus worded, made Men ſmile; and they could preſently recollect the Force and Value of the Depoſers Evidence, which had now been ſome time publiſhed; but then nothing diſguſted the Generality of Men more, than to ſee the King continue ſo averſe to the holding a Parliament, till the Prince was expell'd out of the Nation, the Conſequence of which was notorious. To what end, ſaid they, ſhould we fight, when the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> offereth at firſt to ſubmit to a Free Parliament? What, ſhall we drive him out, that we may never have one that ſhall ſit to do us good? Are the Jeſuits ſuch Reverers of Promiſes, as to regard them when they can chuſe? No, let us have a Parliament while the Prince is here to ſee us have Right, or fight who will for me.</p>
            <p>The ſame 5th. day of <hi>November</hi> an Account was ſent from <hi>Brixham,</hi> That about 300 of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet were come into
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56339:24"/>
               <hi>Torbay;</hi> ſeveral of which came directly to <hi>Brixham</hi> Key, and Landed ſome Soldiers; and the reſt were ſending them on Shore in Boats, about 5 or 600 being then Landed; and it was then ſaid the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was come on Shore.</p>
            <p>This Fleet conſiſted of 51 Men of War, 18 Fire ſhips, and 330 Tenders, for the carriage of Men, Horſes, Arms, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition: At his firſt Attempt he loſt 400 Horſe in a Storm, and a Veſſel was ſeparated with 400 Foot, which after came back to the <hi>Texel.</hi> Hereupon order was given to the <hi>Harlem</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Gazetteers to make a dreadful Repreſentation of this Loſs, which had its effect upon our credulous Court. The Fleet was ſoon got in order again, and ſailed the firſt of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember:</hi> There lay then an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet in the <hi>Buoy</hi> and <hi>Nore,</hi> conſiſting of 34 Sail of Men of War; and there were three in the <hi>Downs;</hi> but the Wind was at E. N. E. and ſo they could not get out, and they had no mind beſides to do it. At his Landing the People in great numbers from the Shore welcom'd his Highneſs with loud Acclamations of Joy.

               <hi>November</hi> the 8th. the Prince went from <hi>Chudleigh</hi> towards <hi>Exeter,</hi> where he arrived about One of the Clock, and made a very ſplendid Entry with his Army, the People much rejoycing at it, and looking upon him as their Deliverer from Popery and Slavery. That Night the Prince lodged at the Deanry, the Dean as well as the Biſhop having left the Town.</p>
            <p>The 9th. Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> was ſent to order the Prieſt and Vicars of the Cathedral not to pray for the Pretended <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> which they would not comply with till they were ſeverely threatned.

Times of Peace; and now the War was opening, became more Inſolent: So that the ill obſerving this Order, was one of thoſe things which tended as much as any thing to the Ruine of that Army, they being reduced to a great Want of all Neceſſaries by the People, who feared their Payment, and hated both them and the Cauſe they were embarked in.</p>

            <p>The Prince continued three days at <hi>Exeter,</hi> before any of the Gentry or Nobility appeared for him, which cauſed a great Wonder in his Army, and was publiſhed here the 18th. we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told, that ſome of the Rabble liſted themſelves for him, and had Arms given them; but the Mayor and Clergy of the City ſtood their Ground.</p>
            <p>The 11th. of <hi>November</hi> the King publiſhed an Account, That the Enemy ſeiſed all the King's Money was found in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and that they had taken 300 <hi>l.</hi> from the Collector of the <hi>Exciſe</hi> at <hi>Exeter,</hi> and committed the Officer to Cuſtody; and that not one Perſon of Quality was yet come in to them. This laſt was again confirm'd by another Expreſs the next day.</p>
            <p>The 13th. an Account came from <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> That the Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi> going to the Prince with between 60 and 70 Horſe, was there ſeiſed by the Militia, by Order of the Duke of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> with about 13 of the Party, one Major <hi>Lorege</hi> being ſlain in the Action, together with his Son, Captain <hi>Lee,</hi> and Leiute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Williams</hi> and ſix Common Soldiers wounded; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Reſiſtance, the Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi> was at laſt forced to yield, and ſecured by the Duke of <hi>Beaufort;</hi> and this was very acceptable News at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> but the Joy was ſhort, and not well founded.</p>
            <p>The 14th. there came an Account from <hi>Salisbury,</hi> That upon the 12th. the Lord <hi>Cornbury</hi> pretending to have received Orders from his Majeſty, cauſed the Royal Regiment of Horſe, the Royal Regiment of Dragoons whereof he was Colonel, and the Duke of <hi>St. Albans</hi> Regiment of Horſe commanded by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Langſton,</hi> to march from <hi>Salisbury</hi> to <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> where they refreſhed themſelves, and then they went to <hi>Bridport</hi> and <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter.</hi> Several of the Officers thereupon apprehending ſome Deſign, asked the Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> as was ſaid, whither they were
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56339:26"/>
going? Who anſwered, To beat up the Enemies Quarters at <hi>Honiton:</hi> But he finding the Royal Regiment of Horſe, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Officers of the Dragoons, did more and more ſuſpect him, he marched with thoſe that would follow him towards <hi>Honiton, Langſton</hi> going before with the Regiment of <hi>St. Albans;</hi> but the Royal Regiment of Horſe, and ſeveral of the Dragoons, return'd to <hi>Bridport.</hi> And the ſame day the Earl of <hi>Feverſham</hi> came to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> to Command the Forces in Chief. The next day theſe Regiments return'd from <hi>Bridport</hi> to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and we were told, there was not ten Troopers of the Royal Regiment wanting; <hi>which ſufficiently ſhews how firm they were in their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to his Majeſty:</hi> But notwithſtanding this Flouriſh, this News cauſed a great Conſternation at <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 16th. there was publiſhed a Proclamation to prohibit the keeping of <hi>Exeter</hi> Fair, and other Fairs thereabouts, becauſe many on that Pretence went over to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame day the Reverend Dr. <hi>Lamplu,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> was Tranſlated to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>York,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawny</hi> from the See of <hi>Briſtol</hi> to that of <hi>Exeter:</hi> And his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty alſo ordered a Publick Collection to be made thorow the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>London,</hi> the Liberties and Suburbs thereof, for the Relief of the poor and diſtreſſed Inhabitants of the City, who were by the Diſtractions of the Times, and the Interruption of Trade, reduced to great Want and Miſery.</p>
            <p>The 17th. of <hi>November</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> Elect, the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> preſented this Petition to the King.</p>

            <p>It was ſaid there was a ſharp Anſwer given to this excellent Petition, which was the Senſe of all the King's Friends in the Nation, except a few deſparate Men, whoſe Crimes had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them uncapable of the Mercy of a Parliament, and ſome others who deſigned the Ruine of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, with the utmoſt hazard of the King and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The ſame day in the Afternoon the King left the City, and with his Royal Highneſs Prince <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> went to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and the next Morning he went to <hi>Salisbury;</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his abſence the Privy-Council to meet for the Diſpatch of all Affairs as occaſion ſhould require.</p>
            <p>The 19th. of <hi>November</hi> the Lords for their own Vindication publiſhed the Petition afore-repreſented; and the next day the King's Anſwer to it was printed alſo, which was this.</p>

                     <hi>WHat you ask of Me, I moſt paſſionately deſire; and I promiſe you UPON THE FAITH OF A KING, That I will have a Parliament, and ſuch an one as you ask for, as ſoon</hi> as ever the Prince of Orange has quitted this Realm: <hi>For how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a Parliament ſhould be Free in all its Circumſtances, as you Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for, whilſt an Enemy is in the Kingdom, and can make a Return of near an hundred Voices?</hi>

            <p>This was ſufficiently diſobliging, conſidering the State of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and the Temper of the Nation at that time; but the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:56339:27"/>
were ſo enraged at the printing the <hi>Petition,</hi> that they publiſhed a Paper with this Title, <hi>Some Reflections upon the Humble Petition to the King's Moſt Excellent Majeſty, of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, who ſubſcribed the ſame, preſented</hi> November 17th. 1688. which follows in theſe words.</p>
            <p>THat the <hi>Peace-makers</hi> are <hi>bleſſed,</hi> is a Truth our Saviour hath left recorded in the holy Scriptures, and thoſe are truly to be honoured, who can contribute any thing to ſo happy a work: But that either this way of Petitioning, or the matter in it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, is likely to produce ſo great a Bleſſing, is a Queſtion wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thy ſerious Conſideration.</p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt therefore take notice of ſome of the dubious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the Petition, and then lay down ſome few Reaſons why I judge the Petition in it ſelf unſeaſonable; and laſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhew how unpracticable the ſummoning of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is at this preſent.</p>
            <p>The Expreſſion, <hi>That a War is now breaking forth in the Bowels of the Kingdom,</hi> ſhews that their <q>Lordſhips either know or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that a Civil War is fomenting; and I pray God this Petition do not,more than any thing elſe, occaſion it;</q>  or that the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> intends to carry on the War through the Bowels of the Kingdom, whereas thoſe that wiſh well to the King, hope it will be kept in and about the parts where he landed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to <hi>the distraction of the People under their preſent Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances;</hi> it ſeems to many true Members of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that it had been every whit as agreeable to your Lordſhips Character to have rather thank'd his Majeſty for his late extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and gracious Favours, than to have amus'd the Subjects at this time with the Apprehenſions of <hi>Grievances,</hi> without any intimation what they were; for it is moſt manifeſt, that by ſuch remonſtrating of Grievances, the People were inſtigated to that bloody Rebellion in 1641.</p>
            <p>As to the Expreſſion, That your Lordſhips <hi>think your ſelves bound in Conſcience</hi> of the Duty you owe to God and our holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to his Majeſty and our Country, <hi>moſt humbly to offer to his Majeſty, That in your opinion the</hi> ONLY <hi>viſible way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his Majeſty and his Kingdom, would be the calling of a Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and free in all its Circumſtances.</hi> I hope to make out, that the ſummoning of a Parliament now, is ſo far from being the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56339:28"/>
               <hi>Only</hi> way to effect theſe things, that it will be one of the principal cauſes of much Miſery to the Kingdom; <q>and I am ſure both <hi>our Duty to God</hi> and <hi>our holy Religion,</hi> as well as to <hi>his Majeſty</hi> and <hi>our Country,</hi> doth plainly enjoyn us to uſe <hi>One</hi> other effectual means to obviate the Miſeries of a Civil or Invaſive War; which is, the keeping inviolably our Allegiance to our Soveraign, and effectually joyning with him to reſiſt all his Enemies, whether ther Foreign Aggreſſors, or Native Rebels:</q> And it is much to be wondred at, that this Duty, ſo well known to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, ſhould never be mention'd.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Regular and Free Parliament in all its Circumſtances,</hi> I ſhall now proceed to prove, that at this Seaſon all our Wiſhes for ſuch a one are impotent, and muſt be ineffectual.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is a known Truth, and ſadly experienced, That when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the People are in a great Ferment, and contrary Parties are bandying one againſt another, the giving liberty to the People to meet in great Bodies, is dangerous to the Government; and you your ſelves not long ſince were of that opinion, when you oppos'd the vehement Addreſſes to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. for ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Parliament, when he judged it would ſtrengthen the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt him; and you very well know, when great heats were among the Members, and unreaſonable Votes were paſs'd againſt the Lineal Succeſſion, and other matters endangering the Government, the King was obliged to prorogue ſome Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from time to time, that ſuch ſeparation might produce more ſober Counſels: And then the great cry was, That for the Preſervation of the King's Perſon and our Religion, they were ſo earneſt to have a Parliament meet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> 
               <q>it is impoſſible there can be a Regular and Free Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, while the Electors are ſo violently divided; one part of them being ſo vehement Wiſhers of the Succeſs of the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> that they ſlight all the Miſeries that unavoidably will fall on the Country thereby, upon the bare hope that he will preſerve <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> Now in ſuch a time as this, when, if we will give credit to the <hi>Prince's Declaration,</hi> there are ſo many that have invited him, can it be ſafe for the King to grant a Commiſſion, even to the People, to aſſemble in ſuch great Confluxes, as may afford them opportunity of liſting themſelves againſt him?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:56339:28"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If we yield that Elections can be without outragious Routs; yet when the Parliament is met, it is requiſite by the very Conſtitution, that every part of that Auguſt Aſſembly ſhould be free in their Aſſent or Diſſent to what is to be debated; and that Freedom is as fundamentally neceſſary in the Perſon of the King, as in the Members of either Houſe; and that one of the proper and neceſſary Circumſtances of that Convention ought to be, that all the Members ſhall be preſent. I ſhall therefore ſhew, that at this time none of theſe can be practicable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the King: While ſuch powerful Enemies are in the Country, and ſo many ready to catch any opportunity to joyn with them, how can the King be abſent from his Army? The providing for, cheriſhing, animating and ordering of which, will ſufficiently employ the moſt indefatigable of Princes. <q>And none can think that any Prince can watch the motions of ſuch an Enemy, and time his opportunities of aſſaulting them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending himſelf, and at the ſame time be embaraſs'd with a Party in the Houſes, that may as dangerouſly be levelling their Votes againſt him, as the Invaders are their Artillery.</q>
            </p>
            <p>However there can be no freedom to the King, how undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoever, becauſe the impending Storm may ſo affright his Council, that they may adviſe to the yielding of ſome things that may be of ill conſequence to the Government; for whatever leſſens the King's juſt Prerogative, as this may do, in depriving him of exerciſing his Negative Voice, is at one time or other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to his Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Lords: There can be no free Convention of them, ſince ſeveral of them have ſo far forgot their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>once, that they are actually in the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi>'s Army, and many other Lords are attending the King, and their Charges; ſo that while theſe Armies are in Being, <q>they cannot meet in their Houſe but by their Proxies; which I ſuppoſe none can expect will be allowed to the Peers that are in Rebellion, if we may be allowed to call that ſuch, which all our Laws ſo adjudgeth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The like may be ſaid for the Houſe of Commons: All the Gentlemen of Intereſt in their Country, by their Allegiance are bound to ſerve the King in his Wars at his Command, and will be few enough to keep their reſpective Counties in peace. And I am confident none will think ſuch a Parliament, as this ought to be that is deſir'd, ſhould conſiſt of ſuch who have been little
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56339:29"/>
converſant in publick Affairs, or have ſmall Intereſts in their Counties.</p>
            <p>So, that upon the whole, I cannot ſee how any Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can meet, unleſs it be ſuch a Convention as the <hi>Saxons</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the <hi>Britains</hi> on <hi>Salisbury-Plains,</hi> where the eminenteſt of both People were to meet unarmed, and there amicably adjuſt matters in difference; but it is well known, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> under their long Coats had their Weapons, wherewith they ſlew the Flower of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nobility, and thereby rendred their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt more eaſie.</p>
            <p>It is true, ſuch a Stratagem is now like to take ffect, <hi>but the King and thoſe that wiſh well to the Succeſſion of the Monarchy, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Country, must needs fear, that there will be as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conteſts within the Houſes, as may be in the open Fields;</hi> and thereby little can be expected from ſuch a Parliament, which can redound to the publick good of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Thoſe Spiritual and Temporal Lords that have ſigned this Petition, either have not, or they have conſulted the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> before they propoſed this Advice.</p>
            <p>If they have not conſulted him, they ought to ſatisfie the King how they can warrant a Ceſſation of Arms on the Prince's ſide, or how they can hinder him from advancing further to awe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in the Houſes, or what aſſurance they can give, that he will acquieſce in the free Deciſion of the matters propoſed, or that he will peaceably depart out of the Land, when things are ſetled, and will not pretend a ſtay here, till the vaſt Sums be paid him that he hath expended on this occaſion; or laſtly, will not find new occaſions of queſtioning the ſecurity of Performance of any Agreement to be made.</p>
            <p>If they have conſulted the Prince, they ought to ſhew his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, authorizing them to make Propoſal or ſhew the Heads of thoſe Grievances he demands to be redreſſed; for ſome they urge in their Petition there are, which diſtract the People; <q>but I ſuppoſe they are more careful of their Heads, than to own any ſuch correſpondence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe Noble Perſons would have effectually ſaved Effuſion of Blood, they would rather have uſed all their Intereſt to have kept the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in his Country, tho' with his Army and Fleet in readineſs, and have obtained his ſending his demands, and have waited like dutiful Subjects till the King had convened his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56339:29"/>
and have tried how Gracious the King would have been in redreſſing Grievances, and ſecuring Religion and Property, and after the King's refuſal there might have been ſome colour for his Invaſion, but none upon any pretence whatſoever to have invited him to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Thoſe who will not openly, and with a bare face juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Pretenſions, cannot think it conſiſtent with the Honour of the King to ſtoop ſo low as to ſummon a Parliament at the direction of an Invader, who can never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to deſire it with that eagerneſs, if he did not judge it very much conduceable to his Intereſt, for which very reaſon the King ought to be jealous of ſuch Councils.</p>
            <p>And I humbly conceive thoſe Peers have not ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered how prejudicial this ſort of Addreſs may be to the King's Affairs, and how much it will conduce to the further alienating of the Affections of the Subjects from the King, when they ſhall hear of his denial to comply at preſent with this Expedient, and never hear the reaſons thereof, ſince they have not divulged his Majeſties Gracious Anſwer, together with their Petition; <q>and I am ſure, at this time the putting the King upon ſuch a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> is the greateſt diſ-ſervice can be done him, and very little infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to joining with his Enemies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I might add many more Arguments to prove, that the King cannot in Honour yield to this Advice, without quitting that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Prerogative the Laws give him, of making War, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding peace, if thoſe matters ſhould be ſubmitted to the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of the two Houſes; or owning that the Allegiance of his Subjects did not bind them to aſſiſt him in the defence of his Crown and Dominions, without the Votes of a Parliament. But I ſhall conclude with ſome few Conſiderations I humbly offer to thoſe Right Reverend, and Noble Lords, and all thoſe who are of the ſame Judgment with them, to reflect upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, I deſire them to conſider, whether it will not be more glorious, and agreeable to the Principles of our Religion, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to aſſiſt our undoubted lawful Soveraign, than to ſuffer him to be dethroned ſolely becauſe he is a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> ſince the Papiſts themſelves, tho' they never take the Oath of Allegiance or Supremacy, yet do, and ever have declared, that if any <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Prince, yea the Pope himſelf in perſon, ſhould invade any King of <hi>England,</hi> tho' a Proteſtant, yet that they are bound
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56339:30"/>
to defend ſuch a King againſt them, as much as if they were <hi>Turks.</hi>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether ſince the true and original Cauſe of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, and conſequently of all the Blood-ſhed theſe Lords ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire to prevent, hath not been the denying to concur with the King in eſtabliſhing of Liberty of Conſcience, even with ſuch ſecurity to the Proteſtant Religion, and Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as could be deſired: and whether in all human probability, that would not be more conduceable to eſtabliſh the publick Tranquility of the Kingdom, and its increaſe in Wealth and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and conſequently the moſt efficacious means to reduce the <hi>Dutch</hi> to be juſt and tractable Allies and Neighbours, rather than any thing can be effected by this Invaſion, or the truckling to ſuch avowed Enemies to our Country, our Religion, and our King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether the King's entire Truſt in the Fidelity of his own Subjects for his defence, and not admitting of foreign Aids that were unſought for, proffered, do not oblige all that have any ſenſe of Gratitude or Duty, to aid him to the very utmoſt againſt ſuch Foreigners as ſo unnaturally, and ſo unjuſtly invade him; and when it hath pleaſed God to give ſucceſs to the King's juſt Arms, we are not to doubt, but the King, according to his ſolemn promiſe in his late Royal Declaration, will ſpeedily call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in it redreſs all ſuch Grievances as his people can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complain of, with a full and ample ſecurity to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all his Proteſtant Subjects, which it will much more be our Intereſt to have in a truly harmonious, and Free-parliamentary way at that time eſtabliſhed, than at this preſent in a tumultuary and precipitate haſte ſo patched up, as will not be durable; and the more earneſtly we deſire to ſee this good work to be ſet upon, the more haſte the Nobility and Gentry ſhould make to expel thoſe who hindred the Convention of that Parliament, which was much more likely to have ſetled matters to the content of the King and his People, than this Invaſion can ever hope to effect.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declaration could be no longer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, and therefore it was ſuffered about this time to be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſhort <hi>Preface, and ſome modeſt Remarks</hi> (as the Author pretends) <hi>on it:</hi> In 4to.</p>

                        <head>The Declaration of his Highneſs, WILLIAM HENRY, by the Grace of God, PRINCE of ORANGE, &amp;c. of the Reaſons inducing him to appear in Arms in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> for preſerving of the Proteſtant Religion, and for reſtoring the Laws and Liberties of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p n="1">1. IT is both certain and evident to all men, that the publick Peace and Happineſs of any State or Kingdom cannot be preſerved, where the Laws, Liberties, and Cuſtoms eſtabliſhed by the lawful Authority in it, are openly tranſgreſſed and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled: More eſpecially where the Alteration of <hi>Religion</hi> is endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and that a <hi>Religion</hi> which is contrary to Law, is endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be introduced: Upon which thoſe who are moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concerned in it, are indiſpenſably bound to endeavour to preſerve and maintain the eſtabliſhed Laws, Liberties and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and above all, the <hi>Religion</hi> and Worſhip of God that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed among them; and to take ſuch an effectual care, that the Inhabitants of the ſaid State or Kingdom, may neither be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their <hi>Religion,</hi> nor of their Civil Rights: Which is ſo much the more neceſſary, becauſe the Greatneſs and Security both of Kings, Royal Families, and of all ſuch as are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as well as the Happineſs of their Subjects and People, depend, in a moſt eſpecial manner, upon the exact obſervation and maintenance of theſe their Laws, Liberties and Cuſtoms.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Upon theſe grounds it is, that we cannot any longer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to declare that to our great Regret, we ſee that thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, who have now the chief Credit with the King, have overturned the <hi>Religion,</hi> Laws and Liberties of thoſe Realms, and ſubjected them in all things relating to their Conſciences, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Properties, to Arbitrary Government, and that not only by ſecret and indirect ways, but in an open and undiſguiſed manner.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Thoſe evil Councellors for the advancing and colouring this with ſome plauſible Pretexts, did invent and ſet on foot the Kings
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56339:31"/>
                           <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> by Virtue of which they pretend, that according to <hi>Law,</hi> he can <hi>ſuſpend,</hi> and <hi>diſpence</hi> with the Execution of the <hi>Laws</hi> that have been enacted by the Authority of the King and Parliament, for the ſecurity and happineſs of the Subject, and ſo have rendred thoſe Laws of no effect; tho' there is nothing more certain, than that as no Laws can be made, but by the joint concurrence of King and Parliament, ſo likewiſe Laws ſo enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which ſecure the publick Peace, and ſafety of the Nation, and the Lives and Liberties of every Subject in it, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed or ſuſpended but by the ſame Authority.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. For tho the King may pardon the Puniſhment that a Tranſgreſſor has incurred, and to which he is condemned, as in the Caſes of <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Felony;</hi> yet it cannot be with any colour of Reaſon inferred from thence, that the King can entirely ſuſpend the Execution of thoſe Laws relating to <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Felony;</hi> unleſs it is pretended, that he is clothed with a Deſpotick and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power; and that the Lives, Liberties, Honours, and Eſtates of the Subjects depend wholly on his good Will and Pleaſure, and are entirely ſubject to him; which muſt infallibly follow, on the King's having a Power to <hi>ſuſpend</hi> the Execution of the <hi>Laws,</hi> and to diſpenſe with them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Thoſe Evil Counſellors, in order to the giving ſome Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to this ſtrange and execrable Maxim, have ſo conducted the Matter, that they have obtained a Sentence from the Judges, declaring, that this <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> is a Right belonging to the <hi>Crown;</hi> as if it were in the power of the Twelve Judges to offer up the Laws, Rights, and Liberties of the whole Nation to the King, to be diſpoſed of by him Arbitrarily and at his Pleaſure, and expreſly contrary to Laws enacted for the Security of the Subjects. In order to the obtaining this Judgment, thoſe Evil Counſellors did before hand examine ſecretly the Opinion of the Judges, and procured ſuch of them as could not in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience concur in ſo pernicious a Sentence, to be turned out, and others to be ſubſtituted in their rooms, till by the Changes which were made in the Courts of Judicature, they at laſt obtained that Judgment. And they have raiſed ſome to thoſe Truſts, who make open Profeſſion of the Popiſh Religion, tho thoſe are by Law rendred incapable of all ſuch Employments.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. It is alſo manifeſt and notorious, That as his Majeſty was, upon his coming to the Crown, received and acknowledged by all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56339:32"/>
the Subjects of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as their <hi>King,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Oppoſition, tho he made then open Profeſſion of the <hi>Popiſh Religion;</hi> ſo he did then promiſe, and ſolemnly ſwear at his Coronation, That he would maintain his Subjects in the free Enjoyment of their Laws and Liberties; and in particular, that he would maintain the <hi>Church of England as it was eſtabliſhed by Law:</hi> It is likewiſe certain, that there have been at divers and ſundry times ſeveral Laws enacted for the Preſervation of thoſe Rights and Liberties, and of the Proteſtant Religion; and among other Securities, it has been enacted, That all Perſons whatſoever, that are advanced to any Eccleſiaſtical Dignity, or to bear Office in either Univerſity, as likewiſe all other that ſhould be put in any Imployment, Civil or Military, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they were not Papiſts, but were of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that by their taking of the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> and the <hi>Teſt;</hi> yet theſe Evil Councellors have in effect annulled and aboliſhed all thoſe Laws, both with relation to Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Employments.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. In order to Eccleſiaſtical Dignities and Offices, they have not only without any colour of Law, but againſt moſt expreſs Laws to the contrary, ſet up a Commiſſion, of a certain number of Perſons, to whom they have committed the Cogniſance and Direction of all Eccleſiaſtical matters; in the which Commiſſion there has been, and ſtill is one of his Majeſties Miniſters of State, who makes now publick profeſſion of the Popiſh Religion, and who at the time of his firſt profeſſing it, declared that for a great while before he had believed that to be the only true Religion. By all this, the deplorable State to which the Proteſtant Religion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, is apparent, ſince the Affairs of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are now put into the hands of perſons who have accepted of a Commiſſion that is manifeſtly illegal, and who have executed it contrary to all Law; and that now one of their chief Members has abjured the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and declared himſelf a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> by which he is become uncapable of holding any publick Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſaid Commiſſioners have hitherto given ſuch proof of their Submiſſion to the Directions given them, that there is no reaſon to doubt, but they will ſtill continue to promote all ſuch deſigns as will be moſt agreeable to them. And thoſe Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors take care to raiſe none to any Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, but perſons that have no Zeal for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and that now
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56339:32"/>
hide their unconcernedneſs for it, under the ſpecious pretence of <hi>Moderation.</hi> The ſaid Commiſſioners have ſuſpended the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> only becauſe he refuſed to obey an Order that was ſent him to ſuſpend a worthy Divine, without ſo much as citing him before him to make his own Defence, or obſerving the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon forms of Proceſs. They have turned out a Preſident cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the Fellows of <hi>Magdalene Colledge,</hi> and afterwards all the Fellows of that Colledge, without ſo much as citing them before any Court that could take legal Cogniſance of that Affair, or obtaining any Sentence againſt them by a competent Judge. And the only reaſon that was given for turning them out, was their refuſing to chuſe for their Preſident, a perſon that was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them, by the Inſtigation of thoſe Evil Councellors, tho' the Right of a Free-Election belonged undoubtedly to them. But they were turned out of their Free-holds contrary to Law, and to that expreſs Proviſion in the <hi>Magna Charta; That no man ſhall loſe Life or Goods, but by the Law of the Land.</hi> And now theſe Evil Councellors have put the ſaid Colledge wholly into the hands of Papiſts, tho' as is aboveſaid, they are incapable of all ſuch Employments, both by the Law of the Land, and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Colledge. Theſe Commiſſioners have alſo cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all the Chancellors and Archdeacons of <hi>England,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them to certifie to them the Names of all ſuch Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as have read the King's Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and of ſuch as have not read it, without conſidering that the reading of it was not enjoined the Clergy by the Biſhops who are their Ordinaries. The Illegality and Incompetency of the ſaid Court of the Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſioners was ſo notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, and it did ſo evidently appear, that it tended to the Subverſion of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> that the Moſt Reverend Father in God, <hi>William</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate and Metropolitan of all <hi>England,</hi> ſeeing that it was raiſed for no other end but to oppreſs ſuch perſons as were of eminent Virtue, Learning and Piety, refuſed to ſit, or to concur in it.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. And tho' there are many expreſs Laws againſt all Churches or Chappels for the exerciſe of the Popiſh Religion, and alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Monaſteries and Convents, and more particulary againſt the Order of the <hi>Jefuits,</hi> yet thoſe Evil Counſellors have procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red orders for the building of ſeveral Churches and Chappels for the exerciſe of that Religion. They have alſo procured divers
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56339:33"/>
Monaſteries to be erected, and in contempt of the Law, they have not only ſet up ſeveral Colledges of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the corrupting of the Youth, but have raiſed up one of the <hi>Order</hi> to be a Privy Counſellor, and a Miniſter of State. By all which they do evidently ſhew, that they are reſtrained by no rules of Law whatſoever, but that they have ſubjected the Honours and Eſtates of the Subjects and the eſtabliſh'd Religion, to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotick Power, and to Arbitrary Government. In all which they are ſerved and ſeconded by thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſioners.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. They have alſo followed the ſame Methods with relation to Civil affairs; for they have procured orders to examine all Lords Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants, Sheriffs, Juſtices of Peace, and all others that were in any publick Imployment, if they would concur with the King in the repeal of the <hi>Teſt</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and all ſuch whoſe Conſciences did not ſuffer them to comply with their deſigns, were turned out, and others were put in their places, who they believed would be more compliant to them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of defeating the Intent and Execution of thoſe Laws which had been made with ſo much care and caution for the ſecurity of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> And in many of theſe places they have put profeſſed Papiſts, tho' the Law has diſabled them, and warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Subjects not to have any regard to their Orders.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. They have alſo invaded the Priviledges, and ſeized on the Charters of moſt of thoſe Towns that have a right to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by their Burgeſſes in Parliament, and have procured Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renders to be made of them, by which the Magiſtrates in them have delivered up all their Rights and Priviledges, to be diſpoſed of at the pleaſure of thoſe Evil Councellors, who have thereupon placed new Magiſtrates in thoſe Towns, ſuch as they can moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely confide in; and in many of them they have put Popiſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, notwithſtanding the Incapacities under which the Law has put them.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. And whereas no Nation whatſoever can ſubſiſt without the adminiſtration of good and impartial Juſtice, upon which mens Lives, Liberties, Honours and Eſtates do depend, thoſe Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors have ſubjected theſe to an Arbitrary and Deſpotick Power: In the moſt important Affairs they have ſtudied to diſcover before-hand the Opinions of the Judges, and have turned out ſuch as they found would not conform themſelves to their intentions, and have put others in their places, of whom they were more
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56339:33"/>
aſſured, without having any regard to their Abilities. And they have not ſtuck to raiſe even profeſſed Papiſts to the Courts of Judicature, notwithſtanding their Incapacity by Law, and that no regard is due to any Sentences flowing from them. They have carried this ſo far, as to deprive ſuch Judges, who in the common adminiſtration of Juſtice, ſhewed that they were governed by their Conſciences, and not by the Directions which the others gave them. By which it is apparent, that they deſign to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the abſolute Maſters of the Lives, Honours and Eſtates of the Subjects, of what rank or dignity ſoever they may be; and that without having any regard either to the Equity of the Cauſe, or to the Conſciences of the Judges, whom they will have to ſubmit in all things to their own Will and Pleaſure; hoping by ſuch ways to intimidate thoſe who are yet in Employment, as alſo ſuch others, as they ſhall think fit, to put in the rooms of thoſe whom they have turned out; and to make them ſee what they muſt look for, if they ſhould at any time act in the leaſt contrary to their good liking; and that no failings of that kind are pardoned in any Perſons whatſoever. A great deal of Blood has been ſhed in many places of the Kingdom, by Judges governed by thoſe Evil Counſellors, againſt all the Rules and Forms of Law, without ſo much as ſuffering the Perſons that were accuſed to Plead in their own Defence.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. They have alſo, by putting the Adminiſtration of Juſtice in the hands of Papiſts, brought all the matters of Civil Juſtice into great uncertainties; with how much Exactneſs and Juſtice ſoever that theſe Sentences may have been given. For ſince the Laws of the Land do not only exclude Papiſts from all Places of Judicature, but have put them under an Incapacity, none are bound to acknowledge or to obey their Judgments, and all Sentences given by them are null and void of themſelves: So that all Perſons who have been caſt in Tryals before ſuch Popiſh Judges, may juſtly look on their pretended Sentences, as having no more force than the Sentences of any private and unauthoriſed Perſon whatſoever. So deplorable is the caſe of the Subjects, who are obliged to anſwer to ſuch Judges, that muſt in all things ſtick to the Rules which are ſet them by
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56339:34"/>
thoſe Evil Counſellors, who as they raiſed them up to thoſe Employments, ſo can turn them out of them at pleaſure; and who can never be eſteemed Lawful Judges; ſo that all their Sentences are in the Conſtruction of the Law, of no Force and Efficacy. They have likewiſe diſpoſed of all Military Employments, in the ſame manner: For though the Laws have not only Excluded Papiſts from all ſuch Employments, but have in particular, Provided that they ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed; yet they, in contempt of theſe Laws, have not only armed the Papiſts, but have likewiſe raiſed them up to the greateſt Military Truſts, both by Sea and Land, and that Strangers as well as Natives, and Iriſh as well as Engliſh, that ſo by thoſe means, having rendred themſelves Maſters both of the Affairs of the Church, of the Government of the Nation, and of the Courts of Juſtice, and ſubjected them all to a Deſpotick and Arbitrary Power, they might be in a capacity to maintain and execute their wicked Deſigns, by the aſſiſtance of the Army, and thereby to enſlave the Nation.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. The diſmal effects of this Subverſion of the Eſtabliſhed Religion, Laws and Liberties in <hi>England,</hi> appear more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to us, by what we ſee done in <hi>Ireland;</hi> where the whole Government is put in the Hands of Papiſts, and where all the Proteſtant Inhabitants are under the daily fears of what may be juſtly apprehended from the Arbitrary Power which is ſet up there: which has made great numbers of them leave that Kingdom, and abandon their Eſtates in it, remembring well that Cruel and Bloody Maſſacre which fell out in that Iſland in the Year 1641.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Thoſe evil Counſellors have alſo prevailed with the King to declare in <hi>Scotland,</hi> That he is cloathed with <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> and that all the Subjects are bound <hi>to Obey him without Reſerve:</hi> upon which he has aſſumed an Arbitrary Power both over the Religion and Laws of that Kingdom; from all which it is apparent, what is to be looked for in <hi>England,</hi> as ſoon as matters are duly prepared for it.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. Thoſe great and inſufferable Oppreſſions, and the open Contempt of all Law, together with the Apprehenſions of the ſad Conſequences that muſt certainly follow upon it, have put the Subjects under great and juſt Fears; and have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56339:34"/>
made them look after ſuch lawful Remedies as are allowed of in all Nations: yet all has been without effect. And thoſe Evil Counſellors have endeavoured to make all Men appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the loſs of their Lives, Liberties, Honours, and Eſtates, if they ſhould go about to preſerve themſelves from this Oppreſſion, by Petitions, Repreſentations, or other means authoriſed by Law. Thus did they proceed with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the other Biſhops, who having offered a moſt humble Petition to the King, in terms full of Reſpect, and not exceeding the number limited by Law, in which they ſet forth in ſhort, the Reaſons for which they could not obey that order which, by the Inſtigation of thoſe Evil Counſellors, was ſent them, requiring them to appoint their Clergy to read in their Churches the Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> were ſent to Priſon, and afterwards brought to a Tryal, as if they had been guilty of ſome enormous Crime. They were not only obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves in that purſuit, but to appear before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Papiſts, who had not taken the Teſt, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence were Men whoſe Intereſt led them to condemn them; and the Judges that gave their Opinion in their favours, were thereupon turned out.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. And yet it cannot be pretended, that any Kings, how great ſoever their Power has been, and how Arbitrary and Deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ſoever they have been in the exerciſe of it, have ever reckoned it a Crime for their Subjects to come in all Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Reſpect, and in a due number, not exceeding the limits of the Law, and repreſent to them the Reaſons that made it impoſſible for them to obey their Orders. Thoſe Evil Counſellors have alſo treated a Peer of the Realm as a Criminal, only becauſe he ſaid, That the Subjects were not bound to obey the Orders of a Popiſh Juſtice of Peace; though it is evident, that they being by Law rendred inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of all ſuch Truſts, no regard is due to their Orders. This being the ſecurity which the People have by the Law for their Lives, Liberties, Honours and Eſtates, that they are not to be ſubjected to the Arbitrary Proceedings of Papiſts, that are contrary to Law, put into any Employments Civil or Military.</p>

Both We our ſelves, and our Deareſt and moſt Entirely Beloved Conſort the Princeſs, have endeavoured to ſignifie, in terms full of reſpect to the King, the juſt and deep Regret which all theſe Proceedings have given us; and in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his Majeſty's deſires ſignified to us, We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared both by Word of Mouth, to his Envoy, and in Writing, what our Thoughts were touching the Repealing of the <hi>Teſt and Penal Laws;</hi> which we did in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that we hoped we had propoſed an Expedient, by which the Peace of thoſe Kingdoms, and a happy agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the Subjects of all Perſuaſions, might have been ſetled: but thoſe Evil Counſellors have put ſuch ill Conſtructions on theſe our good Intentions, that they have endeavoured to alienate the King more and more from us; as if We had deſigned to diſturb the Quiet and Happineſs of the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. The laſt and great Remedy for all thoſe Evils, is <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For thoſe Men apprehending, that a Lawful Parliament being once aſſembled, they would be brought to an account for all their open Violations of Law, and for their Plots and Conſpiracies againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and the Lives and Liberties of their Subjects, they have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under the ſpecious Pretence of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> firſt to ſow Diviſions among Proteſtants, between thoſe of the <hi>Church of England</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenters:</hi> The Deſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid to engage Proteſtants, that are all equally concerned, to preſerve themſelves from Popiſh Oppreſſion, into mutual Quarrellings, that ſo by theſe ſome Advantages might be given to them to bring about their Deſigns; and that both in the Election of the Members of Parliament, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Parliament it ſelf. For they ſee well, that if all Proteſtants could enter into a mutual good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with another, and concur together in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of their Religion, it would not be poſſible for them to compaſs their wicked Ends. They have alſo required all Perſons in the ſeveral Counties of <hi>England,</hi> that either were in any Employment, or were in any conſiderable
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56339:35"/>
Eſteem, to declare before-hand, that they would concur in the Repeal of the <hi>Teſt and Penal Laws;</hi> and that they would give their Voices in the Elections to Parliament, only for ſuch as would concur in it: Such as would not thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage themſelves, were turned out of all Employments; And others who entred into thoſe Engagements, were put in their places, many of them being Papiſts: And contrary to the Charters and Privileges of thoſe Burroughs that have a Right to ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament, they have ordered ſuch Regulations to be made, as they thought fit and neceſſary, for aſſuring themſelves of all the Members that are to be choſen by thoſe Corporations: and by this means they hope to avoid that Puniſhment which they have deſerved; though it is apparent, that all Acts made by Popiſh Magiſtrates are null and void of themſelves: So that no Parliament can be Lawful, for which the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Returns are made by Popiſh Sheriffs and Mayors of Towns; and therefore as long as the Authority and Magiſtracy is in ſuch hands, it is not poſſible to have any Lawful Parliament. And though according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, and Immemorial Cuſtom, all Elections of Parliament-men ought to be made with an entire Liberty, without any ſort of Force, or the requiring the Electors to chuſe ſuch Perſons as ſhall be named to them; and the Perſons thus freely Elected, ought to give their Opinions freely, upon all Matters that are brought before them, having the good of the Nation ever before their Eyes, and following in all things the dictates of their Conſcience; yet now the People of <hi>England</hi> cannot expect a Remedy from a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> legally Called and Choſen. But they may perhaps ſee one Called, in which all Elections will be carried by Fraud or Force, and which will be compoſed of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of whom thoſe Evil Counſellors hold themſelves well aſſured, in which all things will be carried on according to their Direction and Intereſt, without any regard to the Good or Happineſs of the Nation. Which may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear evidently from this, that the ſame Perſons tried the Members of the laſt Parliament, to gain them to Conſent to the Repeal of the <hi>Teſt and Penal Laws,</hi> and procured
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56339:36"/>
that Parliament to be diſſolved, when they found that they could not, neither by Promiſes nor Threatnings, prevail with the Members to comply with their wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. But to Crown all, there are great and violent Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, inducing us to believe, that thoſe Evils Counſellors, in order to the carrying on of their ill Deſigns, and to the gaining to themſelves the more time for the effecting of them, for the encouraging of their Complices, and for the diſcouraging of all good Subjects, have publiſhed, That the <hi>Queen</hi> hath brought forth a <hi>Son;</hi> though there have appeared both during the <hi>Queen</hi>'s pretended bigneſs, and in the manner in which the Birth was managed, ſo many juſt and viſible grounds of Suſpicion, that not only we our ſelves, but all the good Subjects of thoſe Kingdoms, do vehemently ſuſpect, that the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was not born by the <hi>Queen.</hi> And it is notoriouſly known to all the World, that many both doubted of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Bigneſs, and of the Birth of the Child, and yet there was not any one thing done to ſatisfie them, or to put an end to their Doubts.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. And ſince our Deareſt and moſt Entirely Beloved Conſort the Princeſs, and likewiſe We Our Selves, have ſo great an Intereſt in this Matter, and ſuch a Right, as all the World knows, to the Succeſſion to the Crown: Since alſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did in the Year 1672, when the States General of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> were invaded in a moſt unjuſt War, uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to put an end to that War, and that in oppoſition to thoſe who were then in the Government; and by their ſo doing, they run the hazard of loſing both the Favour of the Court, and their Employments: And ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation has ever reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a moſt particular Affection and Eſteem, both to our Deareſt Conſort the Princeſs, and to Our Selves, We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not excuſe our ſelves from eſpouſing their Intereſts, in a Matter of ſuch high Conſequence; and from Contributing all that lies in us, for the Maintaining both of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and of the Laws and Liberties of thoſe Kingdoms, and for the ſecuring to them the continual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all their juſt Rights. To the doing of which,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56339:36"/>
We are moſt earneſtly ſolicited by a great many Lords, both Spiritual and Temporal, and by many Gentlemen and other Subjects of all Ranks.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. THEREFORE it is, that We have thought fit to go over to <hi>England,</hi> and to carry over with us a Force, ſufficient by the Bleſſing of God, to defend us from the Violence of thoſe Evil Counſellors. AND WE being deſirous that our Intentions in this may be rightly underſtood, have for this end prepared this <hi>Declaration,</hi> in which as we have hitherto given a True Account of the Reaſons inducing us to it; So we now think fit to DECLARE, That this our Expedition is intended for no other Deſign, but to have a Free and Lawful Parliament aſſembled, as ſoon as is poſſible: and that in order to this, all the late Charters by which the Elections of Burgeſſes are limited contrary to the ancient Cuſtom, ſhall be conſidered as null and of no force: And likewiſe all Magiſtrates who have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly turned out, ſhall forthwith reſume their former Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, as well as all the Burroughs of <hi>England</hi> ſhall return again to their Ancient Preſcriptions and Charters: And more particularly, that the Ancient Charter of the Great and Famous City of <hi>London,</hi> ſhall again be in force: And that the Writs for the Members of Parliament ſhall be addreſſed to the proper Officers, according to Law and Cuſtom. That alſo none be ſuffered to chooſe or to be choſen Members of Parliament, but ſuch as are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Law: And that the Members of Parliament being thus lawfully Choſen, they ſhall meet and ſit in full Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; That ſo the Two Houſes may concur in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of ſuch Laws, as they upon full and free Debate ſhall judge neceſſary and convenient, both for the confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and executing the Law concerning the <hi>Teſt,</hi> and ſuch other Laws as are neceſſary for the Security and Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Proteſtant Religion; as likewiſe for making ſuch Laws as may eſtabliſh a good agreement between the <hi>Church of England</hi> and all <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters;</hi> as alſo for the covering and ſecuring of all ſuch who will live peaceably under the Government, as becomes good Subjects, from all Perſecution upon the account of their Religion, even <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves not excepted; and for the doing of all
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56339:37"/>
other things, which the Two Houſes of Parliament ſhall find neceſſary for the Peace, Honour and Safety of the Nation, ſo that there may be no more danger of the Nations falling at any time hereafter under <hi>Arbitrary Government.</hi> To this Parliament we will alſo refer the Enquiry into the Birth of the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and of all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it, and to the Right of Succeſſion.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. And We, for our part, will concur in every thing that may procure the Peace and Happineſs of the Nation, which a Free and Lawful Parliament ſhall determin; Since we have nothing before our Eyes in this our Undertaking, but the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, the Covering of all Men from Perſecution for their Conſciences, and the ſecuring to the whole Nation the free enjoyment of all their Laws, Rights and Liberties, under a Juſt and Legal Government.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. This is the Deſign that we have propoſed to our ſelves, in appearing upon this occaſion in Arms: In the Conduct of which, We will keep the Forces under our Command, under all the ſtrictneſs of Martial Diſcipline; and take a ſpecial care, that the People of the Countries through which we muſt march, ſhall not ſuffer by their means; and as ſoon as the ſtate of the Nation will admit of it, We promiſe that we will ſend back all thoſe Foreign Forces that we have brought along with us.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. We do therefore hope that all People will judge rightly of us, and approve of theſe our Proceedings: But we chiefly rely on the Bleſſing of God for the Succeſs of this our Undertaking, in which we place our whole and only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. We do in the laſt place invite and require all Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, all the Peers of the Realm both Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, all Lords Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants, and all Gentlemen, Citizens, and other Commons of all ranks, to come and aſſiſt us, in order to the Executing of this our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, againſt all ſuch as ſhall endeavour to Oppoſe us; that ſo we may prevent all thoſe Miſeries which muſt needs follow upon the Nations being kept under Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Slavery: And that all the Violences and Diſorders which have overturned the whole Conſtitution of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56339:37"/>
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, may be fully redreſſed in a FREE AND LEGAL PARLIAMENT.</p>
                        <p n="26">26. And we do likewiſe reſolve, that as ſoon as the Nations are brought to a ſtate of Quiet, We will take care that a Parliament ſhall be called in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the reſtoring the Ancient Conſtitution of that Kingdom, and for bringing the Matters of Religion to ſuch a Settlement, that the People may live eaſie and happy, and for putting an end to all the injuſt Violences, that have been in a courſe of ſo many years committed there.</p>
                        <p n="27">27. We will alſo ſtudy to bring the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> to ſuch a ſtate, that the Settlement there may be religiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and that the Proteſtant and Britiſh Intereſt there, may be ſecured. And we will endeavour by all poſſible means, to procure ſuch an Eſtabliſhment in all the Three Kingdoms, that they may all live in a happy Union and Correſpondence together; and that the Proteſtant Religion, and the Peace, Honour and Happineſs of thoſe Nations, may be eſtabliſhed upon laſting Foundations.</p>

               <hi>The Great Men of this Kingdom ever thought a Parliament Irregularly Choſen more eligible than either a War, or a raſh En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the manner of the Choice. Did Queen</hi> Elizabeth<hi>'s Parliament admit of a Words being ſpoken to bring Queen</hi> Mary<hi>'s Parliament into doubt? Did they not look on it as moſt dangerous to do ſo?

                        <p>AFter we had prepared and printed this our Declaration, we have underſtood, that the Subverters of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Laws of thoſe Kingdoms, hearing of our Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to aſſiſt the People againſt them, have begun to retract ſome of the Arbitrary and Deſpotick Powers that they had aſſumed, and to vacate ſome of their Injuſt Judgments and Decrees. The ſenſe of their Guilt, and the diſtruſt of their Force, have induced them to offer to the City of <hi>London</hi> ſome ſeeming Relief from their great Oppreſſions; hoping thereby to quiet the People, and to divert them from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a Re-eſtabliſhment of their Religion and Laws under the ſhelter of our Arms: They do alſo give out, That we do intend to Conquer and Enſlave the Nation; and therefore it is that we have thought fit to add a few words to our Declaration.</p>
                        <p>We are confident, that no Perſons can have ſuch hard thoughts of us, as to imagine that we have any other Deſign in this Undertaking, than to procure a Settlement of the Religion, and of the Liberties and Properties of the Subjects upon ſo ſure a Foundation, that there may be no danger of the Nations relapſing into the like Miſeries at any time hereafter. And as the Forces that we have brought along with us, are utterly diſproportioned to that wicked Deſign of Conquering the Nation, if we were capable of Intending it; ſo the great numbers of the Principal Nobility and Gentry, that are Men of Eminent Quality and Eſtates, and Perſons of known Integrity and Zeal both for the Religion and Government of <hi>England,</hi> many of them being alſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by their conſtant Fidelity to the Crown, who do both accompany us in this Expedition, and have earneſtly ſolicited us to it, will cover us from all ſuch malicious Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations: For it is not to be imagined, that either thoſe who have Invited us, or thoſe that are already come to Aſſiſt us, can joyn in a wicked attempt of Conqueſt, to make void
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56339:39"/>
their own lawful Titles to their Honours, Eſtates and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. We are alſo confident, that all Men ſee how little weight there is to be laid on all Promiſes and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that can be now made; ſince there has been ſo little regard had in time paſt, to the moſt ſolemn Promiſes. And as that imperfect Redreſs that is now offered, is a plain Confeſſion of thoſe Violations of the Government that we have ſet forth; ſo the Defectiveneſs of it is no leſs apparent: For they lay down nothing which they may not take up at pleaſure; and they reſerve entire, and not ſo much as mentioned, their Claims and Pretences to an Arbitrary and Deſpotick Power; which has been the Root of all their Oppreſſion, and of the total Subverſion of the Government. And it is plain, that there can be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs nor Remedy offered but in Parliament; by a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Rights of the Subjects that have been inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and not by any Pretended Acts of Grace, to which the extremity of their Affairs has driven them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that we have thought fit to declare, That we will refer all to a Free Aſſemby of the Nation, in a Lawful Parliament.</p>

               <hi>THis Addition doth very fully unfold the Deſign, the Prince will abide among us with a Foreign Power, and make the Choice of a Parliament impracticable, and therefore the Call of one a weak and fooliſh thing; and yet oblige us to diſtruſt every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the King makes us, leſſening what is done, and inſinuating that all things ſhall be ſoon undone. And why all theſe Inſinuations, but to help us to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravel the whole Intriegue; which, if it be not for the Crown, muſt be thus: The</hi> Dutch <hi>knowing how the Prince hath raviſhed from them their Liberties and Privileges, and what danger they are in of being utterly undone, if</hi> Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <hi>be ſetled among us in</hi> England, <hi>precipitate the Prince on this hazardous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, not doubting but they ſhall be either delivered from the Prince's Exerciſe of a Deſpotick Power over them, or ſpoil our Liberty, to the Continuance and Advance of their own Trade; which may be the reaſon why in the entrance into the Declaration, what relates to Religion is</hi> ſo <hi>worded as to gain the Biſhops over to them, the more eaſily to effect their Deſign; for ſays the Declaration, The Alteration of Religion is endeavoured, and that a</hi> Religion <hi>which is contrary to Law, is endeavoured to be introduced: It is not ſaid, that the</hi> Popiſh Religion, <hi>but a Religion contrary to the Law; and, it's well known, that the Laws are againſt the Religion of the Diſſenters, and the Prince's endeavour ſhall be to preſerve and maintain, above all, the</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>and</hi> Worſhip of God that is Eſtabliſhed among us; <hi>which cannot be underſtood of the Worſhip the Diſſenters uſe, but of the Hierarchical way, that is as contrary to the Prince's own Religion, as 'tis to that of the Diſſenters in</hi> England. <hi>And to perſuade the Church-men to cloſe with him, he Declares, That he was moſt earneſtly ſolicited to come over by the</hi> Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, <hi>not doubting, but that if the Belief thereof prevail among the Mobile, they'll be all of an Opinion, that the Prince's Grounds are moſt Juſt and Reaſonable; ſo that though it cannot be made out by any thing particularly known, yet this general carrying a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand unheard of Arguments in its Bowels cannot fail of ſucceſs.</hi>

And Laſtly, Becauſe the King was not accountable to his own Subjects, concludes, that neither was he ſo to the Prince, though a Sovereign Prince. So he was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered like a God, and No-body (not a Neighbour-intereſted Prince) was to preſume to ſay to him, What doeſt thou? To that height of ſtupidity was their Flattery then arrived, but ſoon after it expired!</p>
            <p>This is the beſt Abſtract I can give of that Defence, which is too long to be intirely inſerted in this Work, though it were to be wiſhed a larger might in due time be publiſhed, with all the material Papers at large.

            <p>Though there was not all that Men had fondly expected in this Declaration, yet here was enough to ſatisfie any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Man, that the Expelling this Prince and his Army before our Religion, Liberties, Properties and Government were effectually ſetled in Parliament; and thoſe who had ſo outragiouſly attempted the ruine of them were call'd to an Account, would certainly end in the ruine of them; and was a kind of cutting up our Laws and Religion with our Swords. This and nothing elſe was the cauſe that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Prince's <hi>Declaration</hi> was read, it conquered all that ſaw or heard it; and it was to no purpoſe to excite Men to fight againſt their own Intereſt, and to deſtroy what was more dear to them than their Lives.</p>

            <p>This Letter was ſpread under-hand over the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and read by all ſorts of Men; and the reaſon of it being undeniable, it had a great force on the Spirits of the Soldiery; ſo that thoſe who did not preſently comply with it, yet reſolved they would never ſtrike one ſtroke in this Quarrel, till they had a Parliament to ſecure the <hi>Religion, Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> which the Court, on the other ſide, had reſolved ſhould not be granted till the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with his Army, was expelled out of the Nation, and all thoſe that had ſubmitted to him (which were not many then) were reduced into their Power, to be treated as they thought fit.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Fleet came about from the <hi>Buoy and Ore</hi> to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> under the Command of the Lord <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> where it arrived the Seventeenth of <hi>November;</hi> and on <hi>Monday</hi> the Ninteenth day of <hi>November</hi> the King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Salisbury,</hi> which was then the Head Quarters of the Army.</p>

               <p>We are by innumerable Grievances made ſenſible, that the very Fundamentals of our Religion, Liberties, and Properties, are about to be rooted out by our late <hi>Jeſuitical Privy Council,</hi> as has been of late too apparent: Firſt, by the King's diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with all the Eſtabliſh'd Laws at his pleaſure. 2. By diſplacing all Officers out of all Offices of Truſt and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and placing others in their room, that are known Papiſts, deſervedly made incapable, by the Eſtabliſh'd Laws of this Land. 3. By deſtroying the Charters of moſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations in the Land. 4. By diſcouraging all Perſons that are not Papiſts, and preferring ſuch as turn to Popery. 5. By diſplacing all honeſt and conſciencious Judges, unleſs they would, contrary to their Conſciences, declare that to be Law, which was meerly Arbitrary. 6. By branding all Men with the name of Rebels, that but offered to juſtifie the Laws in a legal courſe againſt the Arbitrary Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the King, or any of his corrupt Miniſters. 7.

And above all (3ly.) the Pope's diſpenſing with the Breach of Oaths, Treaties, or Promiſes at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when it makes for the Service of Holy Church, as they term it. Theſe, we ſay, are ſuch convincing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to hinder us from giving credit to the aforeſaid <hi>Mock ſhews</hi> of Redreſs, that we think our ſelves bound in Conſcience to reſt on no Security that ſhall not be ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proved <note place="margin">☜</note> by a freely-elected Parliament; To whom, under GOD, we referr our Cauſe.</p>

                  <p>WIth an Heart full of Grief am I forced to write what Prudence will not permit me to ſay to your Face: And may I e'er find Credit with Your Majeſty, and Protection from Heaven, as what I now do is free from Paſſion, Vanity, or Deſign, with which Actions of this Nature are too often accompanied. I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the frequent Miſchiefs wrought in the World by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56339:45"/>
factious pretences of Religion; but were not Religion the moſt juſtifiable Cauſe, it would not be made the moſt ſpecious pretence. And your Majeſty has alwaies ſhewn too unintereſted a Senſe of Religion, to doubt the juſt effects of it in one, whoſe practices have, I hope, never given the World cauſe to cenſure his real Conviction of it; or his backwardneſs to perform what his Honour and Conſcience prompt him to. How then can I longer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe my juſt Concern for that Religion, in which I have been ſo happily educated, which my Judgment throughly convinceth me to be the Beſt, and for the Support of which, I am ſo highly intereſted in my native Country? and, Is not <hi>England</hi> now by the moſt endearing Tye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo?</p>

of Fear and Suſpicion, that a falſe Alarm being made by deſign or accident, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 25th. of <hi>November,</hi> the King and the whole Army left <hi>Salisbury;</hi> the Army retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Reading,</hi> and the King to <hi>Andover,</hi> and on <hi>Monday</hi> the 26th. of <hi>November</hi> returned in the Evening to <hi>London.</hi> The Princeſs <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> his ſecond Daughter, was gone privately the night before from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> with the Lady <hi>Churchil;</hi> and if ſhe had not left a Letter too behind her, which ſhew'd the reaſon of her retiring, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, all the Popiſh Party about <hi>Whitehall</hi> had been cut in pieces by the King's own Guards, upon a ſurmiſe they had made away this beloved Princeſs: So that they were forced to print her Letter to the Queen, to ſecure them ſelves from Violence.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing the King did after his return to <hi>London,</hi> was, to remove Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> from being Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and to put Sir <hi>Bevil Skelton,</hi> a Proteſtant, in his place. Sir <hi>Edward</hi> had angered the whole City to the utmoſt, by planting ſeveral Mortar pieces on the Walls towards the City, which tho' deſigned only to awe it, had enraged more than frighted them.

            </p>
            <p>The 28th. day His Majeſty ordered in a Privy-Council the Lord Chancellor to iſſue out Writs for the Sitting of a Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the 15th. day of <hi>January</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: But it was now too late, and the Nation was in that Ferment, that it was not much regarded what the Court did or ſaid.</p>

And we do alſo ſtrictly require and command all Sheriffs, Mayors, Bailiffs, and other Officers, to whom the Execution or Return of any Writ, Summons, Warrant, or Precept, for Members to the enſuing Parliament ſhall belong; that they cauſe ſuch Writ, Summons, Warrant, or Precept, to be duly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and executed, and Returns thereupon fairly made, according to the true merits of ſuch Elections.</p>
               <p>And for the Security of all Perſons both in their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Service in Parliament, we do hereby publiſh and declare, That all our Subjects ſhall have free Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to elect, and all our Peers, and ſuch as ſhall be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <note place="margin">☜</note> Members of our Houſe of Commons, ſhall have free Liberty and Freedom to ſerve and ſit in Parliament, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they have taken Arms, or committed any act of Hoſtility, or been any way aiding or aſſiſting therein.

            <p>In the week following, the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was ſent down to <hi>Portſmonth,</hi> with Orders to the Lord <hi>Dartmouth</hi> to ſend him under a good Convoy with his Nurſe into <hi>France.</hi> This he was ſaid to have utterly refuſed; whereupon he was brought back to <hi>London</hi> again on <hi>Saturday Doc.</hi> 8. and the Queen reſolved to go over with him her ſelf;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56339:47"/>
and not contented with this, extorted from the King a Promiſe to follow her himſelf: Which was the very worſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel the worſt Enemy he had in the World could poſſibly have given him.</p>
            <p>But to return back, <hi>Scotland</hi> was by this time almoſt in as bad a condition as <hi>England,</hi> and ſome of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> were ſent up with a Petition for a Free Parliament; and the Popiſh Chapels at <hi>York, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol, Gloceſter, Worceſter, Shrewsbury, Stafford, Woolverhampton, Bromidgham, Cambridge,</hi> and St. <hi>Edmond's Bury,</hi> were about this time demoliſhed, and whereever the Lords in Arms came, the Papiſts were diſarmed: And in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> their Lord-Lieutenant, had a great appearance of the Gentry with him, where he and they declared for a Free Parliament, and the Protection of the Proteſtant Religion. This meeting was at <hi>Norwich</hi> the Firſt of <hi>December,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, the ſame Declaration was renewed at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and the <hi>Suffolk</hi> men approved of it, but wanted a Lord Lieutenant to aſſemble and head them, in order to the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their concurrence with ſafety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briſtol</hi> was ſeized by the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and Sir <hi>John Guiſe;</hi> the Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi> was delivered by the Gentry of <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> out of the Caſtle of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> where till then he had been impriſoned.

Party were much fewer in number, becauſe they believed the whole Army was at hand.</p>
            <p>The Popiſh Party was become ſo contemptible in <hi>London,</hi> that on <hi>Thurday</hi> the Sixth of <hi>December</hi> there was an <hi>Hue and Cry after Father Peters,</hi> publickly cried and ſold in the Streets of <hi>London.</hi> But this was not the worſt neither; for about the ſame time came forth this following Declaration, in the Name of the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>

                        <p>WE have in the courſe of our whole life, more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by the apparent hazards both by Sea and Land, to which we have ſo lately expoſed our Perſon, given to the whole World ſo high and undoubted Proofs of our fervent Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, that we are fully confident no true Engliſhman and good Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant can entertain the leaſt Suſpicion of our firm Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, rather to ſpend our deareſt Blood and periſh in the Attempt, than not to carry on the bleſſed and glorious Deſign, which by the favour of Heaven we have ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully begun, to reſcue <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> from SLAVERY and POPERY, and in a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> to Eſtabliſh the Religion, the Laws, and the Liberties of theſe Kingdoms on ſuch a ſure and laſting Foundation, that it ſhall not be in the Power of any Prince for the future to introduce <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny.</hi>

                        <p>Towards the more eaſie compaſſing this great Deſign, we have not been hitherto deceived in the juſt Expectation we had of the concurrence of the Nobility, Gentry, and People of <hi>England</hi> with us, for the Security of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Reſtitution of the Laws, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of their Liberties and Properties: Great numbers of all Ranks and Qualities having joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to us; and others, at great diſtances from us, have taken up Arms and Declared for Us.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56339:48"/>
(by the ſpecial Providence of God) both Officers and common Soldiers have been touched with ſuch a feeling ſenſe of Religion, and Honour, and of true Affection to their Native Country, that they have already deſerted the ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Service they were engaged in, and have come over to Us, and have given us full aſſurance from the reſt of the Army, That they will certainly follow this Example, as ſoon as with our Army we ſhall approach near enough to receive them without hazard of being prevented and betray'd. To which end, and that we may the ſooner execute this juſt and neceſſary Deſign we are engaged in for the publick Safety and Deliverance of theſe Nations, We are reſolved, with all poſſible diligence, to advance forward, that a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> may be forthwith called, and ſuch Preliminaries adjuſted with the King, and all things firſt ſetled upon ſuch a foot according to Law, as may give us and the whole Nation juſt reaſon to believe the King is diſpoſed to make ſuch neceſſary Condeſcenſion on his part, as will give entire Satisfaction and Security to all, and make both King and People once more happy.</p>
                        <p>And that we may effect all this in the way moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our deſires, if it be poſſible, without the effuſion of any Blood, except of thoſe execrable Criminals who have juſtly forfeited their Lives, for betraying the Religion, and ſubverting the Laws of their Native Country, we do think fit to declare, that as we will offer no violence to any but in our own neceſſary defence; ſo we will not ſuffer any injury to be done to the Perſon even of any Papiſt, provided he be found in ſuch place and condition and circumſtances as the Laws require. So we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and do declare, That all Papiſts who ſhall be found in open Arms, or with Arms in their Houſes, or about their Perſons, or in any Office or Employment Civil or Military, upon any pretence whatſoever, contrary to the known Laws of the Land, ſhall be treated by Us and our Forces not as Soldiers and Gentlemen, but as Robbers, Free-booters, and <hi>Banditti:</hi> They ſhall be incapable of Quarter, and intirely delivered up to the Diſcretion of our Soldiers.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56339:49"/>
them, or ſhall march under their Command, or ſhall joyn with, or ſubmit to them in the diſcharge or execution of their illegal Commiſſions or Authority, ſhall be looked upon as Partakers of their Crimes, Enemies to the Laws, and to their Country.</p>
                        <p>And whereas we are certainly informed, that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Armed Papiſts have of late reſorted to <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and Parts adjacent, where they remain, as we have reaſon to ſuſpect, not ſo much for their own Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, as out of a wicked and barbarous Deſign to make ſome deſperate Attempts upon the ſaid Cities, and the Inhabitants, by Fire, or a ſudden Maſſacre, or both, or elſe to be the more ready to joyn themſelves to a Body of <hi>French</hi> Troops, deſigned, if it be poſſible, to land in <hi>England,</hi> procured of the <hi>French</hi> King by the Intereſt and Power of the Jeſuits in purſuance of the Engagements, which, at the Inſtigation of that peſtilent Society, his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, with one of his Neighbouring Princes of the ſame Communion, has entred into, for the utter Extirpation of the Proteſtant Religion out of <hi>Europe.</hi> Though we hope we have taken ſuch effectual care to prevent the one, and ſecure the other, that by God's aſſiſtance, we cannot doubt but we ſhall defeat all their wicked Enterpriſes and Deſigns.</p>

               <p n="1">I. That all Papiſts, and ſuch Perſons as are not qualified by Law, be Diſarmed, Disbanded, and removed from all Employments Civil and Military.</p>

               <p n="5">V. And that for the Security of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and their Trade, <hi>Tilbury</hi> Fort be put into the Hands of the City.</p>

And at the ſame time he ſent Order to the Earl of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> to Disband the Army, and Diſmiſs the Soldiers.</p>
            <p>The Letter to the Earl of <hi>Feverſham</hi> was in this Form.</p>

                  <p>THings being come to that Extremity, that I have been forced to ſend away the Queen, and my Son the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> that they might not fall into the Enemies Hands, which they muſt have done if they had ſtay'd: I am obliged to do the ſame thing, in hopes it will pleaſe God, out of his infinite Mercy to this unhappy Nation, to touch their Hearts again with true Loyalty and Honour. If I could have rely'd on all my Troops, I might not have been put to the Extremity I now am in, and would at leaſt have had one blow for it. But though I know there are many and brave Men among you, both Officers and Soldiers; yet you know, that both you, and ſeveral of the General Officers and Soldiers, and Men of the Army, told me, It was no ways adviſable for me, to venture my ſelf at their Head, or to think to fight the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with them.</p>
                  <p>And now there remains only for me to thank you, and all thoſe, both Officers and Soldiers, who have ſtuck to me, and been truly Loyal. I hope you will ſtill retain the ſame Fidelity to me; and though I do not expect you ſhould expoſe your ſelves, by reſiſting a Foreign Army, and a Poyſon'd Nation; yet I hope your former Principles

                  <p>HAving received this Morning a Letter from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, with the unfortunate News of his Reſolution to go out of <hi>England;</hi> I thought my ſelf obliged, being at the Head of his Army, and having received his Orders, to make no Oppoſition againſt any body; to let your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs know it, with the Advice of the Officers here, ſo ſoon as was poſſible, to hinder the effuſion of Blood.

            <p>This was to all intents and purpoſes a clear and full <hi>Abdication</hi> or <hi>Deſertion</hi> of the Army, and put them under an inevitable neceſſity of ſubmitting to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> they having no body to Lead or Head them againſt him. And it is not conceivable how they could keep themſelves from entring into an <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> or <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> to the Prince, now he was gone, without <hi>expoſing themſelves, by reſiſting a Foreign Army, and a Poyſon'd Nation.</hi> For neither could the Nation long continue without a Prince, nor would any Perſon that ſucceeded in that Capacity, have ever ſuffered them to live within his Government, without giving him Security by Oath, for their Submiſſion and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to him: So that the whole deſign of this Letter ſeems to be the Sowing a Diviſion in the Nation; that at the ſame time he left us, we might not unite or ſettle our ſelves under

the other, but by our <hi>Principles</hi> be divided, that ſo he might the more eaſily reduce us again into the State we were in, when the Prince firſt deſigned his Expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being done, about Three of the Clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>December</hi> the 11th. the King went down the River in a ſmall Boat, towards <hi>Graveſend:</hi> The principal Officers of the Army about the Town thereupon met about Ten of the Clock at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and ſent an Expreſs to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to acquaint him with the Departure of the King, and to aſſure him, that they would aſſiſt the Lord Mayor, to keep the City quiet till his Highneſs came, and made the Souldiery to enter into his Service.</p>
            <p>Much about the ſame time, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal about the Town came to <hi>Guildhall,</hi> and ſending for the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, made the following Declaration.</p>

                        <p>WE doubt not but the World believes, that in this great and dangerous Conjuncture we are heartily and zealouſly concerned for the Proteſtant Religion, the Laws of the Land, and the Liberties and Properties of the Subject.

We do therefore unanimouſly reſolve to apply out ſelves to his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who with ſo great

Kindneſs to theſe Kingdoms, ſo vaſt Expence, and ſo much Hazard, hath undertaken, by endeavouring to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Free Parliament, to reſcue us (with as little effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſtian Blood as poſſible) from the imminent Dangers of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>In the mean time we will endeavour to preſerve, as much as in us lies, the Peace and Security of theſe great and populous Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the parts adjacent, by taking care to diſarm all Papiſts, and ſecure all Jeſuits and Romiſh Prieſts, who are in or about the ſame.</p>
                        <p>And if there be any thing more to be performed by Us, for promoting his Highneſs's Generous Intentions for the Publick Good, we ſhall be ready to do it as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requires.</p>

            <p>After his Highneſs had certain Intelligence, that the King was gone back to <hi>London,</hi> he came forward by eaſie Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and entered <hi>Salisbury</hi> on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 4th. of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> The 5th. the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> came thither to him. The ſame day, the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> of <hi>Cherbury,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edw. Harley,</hi> and moſt of the Gentry of <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſhire,</hi> met at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and Declared for the Prince of <hi>Orange. Ludlow</hi> Caſtle was alſo taken in for him by the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Blunt,</hi> and the Popiſh Sheriff of <hi>Worceſter</hi> ſecured in it by that Peer. The 7th. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> his Highneſs came on to <hi>Hungerford;</hi> the 8th. the Lords ſent by the King came thither to him, and had the Diſpatch I have mentioned; and after Dinner, he went to <hi>Lidcot.</hi> The 14th. his Highneſs entered <hi>Windſor</hi> about Two of the Clock in the Afternoon.</p>
            <p>The King in his departure put himſelf aboard a ſmall <hi>Yatch</hi> or <hi>Smack,</hi> commanded by one Captain <hi>Sanders,</hi> but was forced for ſhelter to take into <hi>Eaſt Swale,</hi> (the Eaſtern part of the Iſle of <hi>Sheppy)</hi> in order to the taking in Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt; where the Inhabitants of <hi>Feverſham</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> being out to take up Jeſuits and other ſuſpected Perſons, found this ſmall Veſſel and ſeized it, on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 12th. of <hi>December;</hi> there were then preſent with him Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> and Mr. <hi>Labady,</hi> and none of them being known at firſt, they were very ill treated by the Seamen, and brought up to <hi>Feverſham</hi> as ſuſpicious Perſons: The King being come there, and by that time known, he lodged that night at the Mayor's Houſe, and ſent for the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea,</hi> the Lord Lieutenant of that County to come to him.</p>

The Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi> having received a Letter from the King, the 11th. of <hi>December,</hi> disbanded Four Thouſand Men (which was all the Army was left) at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge,</hi> where their head Quarters then were, as I have ſaid. The ſame day the Dutch Officers taken in the Fly-boat, and till then Impriſoned in <hi>Newgate,</hi> were Diſcharged.</p>

That Night they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed the Popiſh Convent and Chappel at St. <hi>John</hi>'s, (which they had attempted before the King went away, and had hardly been prevented, from deſtroying it, by the Death of three or four Perſons) the Convent and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Fryars in <hi>Lincolns Inn-Fields,</hi> and the Popiſh Chapels in <hi>Lime-ſtreet</hi> and <hi>Bucklers-Berry,</hi> and the Chapel at <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> which was the Reſidence of the Spaniſh Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. Out of the Materials of theſe Buildings they made great Piles, and at Night fired them inſtead of Bon-fires, and the number that ran together was incredible, and very terrible, not only to the Roman Catholicks, but to all conſidering men, who did reflect ſeriouſly on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Times and the rage of the People. The ſame day therefore the Lords put out an Order for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Goods taken from the Spaniſh Ambaſſador, promiſing a good Reward, and commanding all Books and Papers taken out of his Library, to be brought to the Council-Chamber in <hi>Whitehall.</hi>

            <p>It was but time to put out this Order; for, on <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning the 13th. of <hi>December,</hi> about Three of the Clock, there was a dreadful Alarm, that the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in a deſperate Rage, were approaching the City putting Men, Women, and Children to the Sword as they came along; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Citizens all roſe, placing Lights in their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows from top to bottom, and guarded every man his own Doors, with his Muſquet charged with Bullet; and all the Trainbands in the City were aſſembled; and there was nothing but ſhooting and beating of Drums all night. This Alarm ſpread it ſelf the whole length and breadth of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and all that were able to bear Arms appeared at their ſeveral places, vowing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Lives, Religion, Laws and Liberties, and reſolving to deſtroy all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56339:55"/>
caſe any injury were offered them; but then there were very few Papiſts ſlain in theſe Tumults and Frights, but their Houſes were generally rifled on pretence of ſearching for Arms and Ammunition.</p>
            <p>The Lords, after this, ſent the Lords, <hi>Feverſham, Aileſ bury, Yarmouth,</hi> and <hi>Middleton,</hi> moſt humbly to entreat the King to return to <hi>Whitchall;</hi> and ordered his Guards to go down to him, to ſee him ſafe on board any Ship he ſhould chuſe, if he perſiſted in his Reſolution to go out of the Nation. With them went the Servants of his Houſhold, to carry him Money and Cloaths, all he had of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being taken from him by the Seamen, and his Cloaths rent and torn in the ſearching of him before he was known, as he had in part ſignified in a Letter to the Lord <hi>Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham.</hi> Now conſidering the whole Nation, in a manner, had ſubmitted to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> before the King was heard of, after he had withdrawn himſelf, it had perhaps been but reaſonable to have ſuſpended the inviting him back to <hi>Whitchall,</hi> till they had received his Conſent, or at leaſt asked it, or had called a greater Aſſembly of the Peers than that day met.</p>
            <p>The 12th. day the four Lords ſent by the Peers, with four Aldermen and eight of the Common Council of <hi>London,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to wait upon the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſigned by the Body of the Peers the day before at <hi>Guildhall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 15th. the King removed to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> in order to his Return to <hi>London,</hi> and ſome of his Troops of Guard went down thither to him: And the next day, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> he returned about Five in the Evening to <hi>Whitchall,</hi> attended by one Troop of Grenadiers, and three Troops of Life. Guard, a Set of Boys following him through the City, and making ſome <hi>Huzza</hi>'s, whilſt the reſt of the People ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently looked on. His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who was then at <hi>Windſor,</hi> had ſent Monſieur <hi>Zuleſtein</hi> to the King, to deſire him to continue at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> but he miſſing him, the King came to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and from thence ſent the Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi> with a Letter to the Prince to <hi>Windſor,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him to St. <hi>James</hi>'s with what number of Troops he ſhould think fit to bring with him, he could now do no otherwiſe, his

own Army having been disbanded by his own order, all the Forts in <hi>England,</hi> except <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> being in the Prince's hands, and <hi>London,</hi> and almoſt all the Peers in his abſence having ſent their Submiſſion, and inviting him to come forthwith to Town, to take upon him the Care of the City.</p>
            <p>This Letter being by the Prince referred to the Peers that were then at <hi>Windſor,</hi> they concluded that the ſhortneſs of the time could admit no better Expedient, than that the King might be deſired to remove to ſome place within a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable diſtance from <hi>London;</hi> and <hi>Ham,</hi> a Houſe belonging to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Landerdale,</hi> was pitched upon, and a Note or Paper to that purpoſe drawn up, which was ordered to be delivered after the Prince's Guards were in Poſſeſſion of the Poſts about <hi>Whitchall.</hi>

            <p>There having been ſufficient care taken for this by the Council before, it was not conſiſtent with his Intereſt thus to ſhew his Zeal for the Popiſh Party in the very firſt Act he did upon his return, as if he had come back only to ſerve them.</p>
            <p>During the time the King ſtay'd at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> it was crowded with Iriſhmen, Prieſts, Jeſuits, and Roman Catholicks, afrer the old wont; and it is ſaid one of the Prieſts ſent an imperious Meſſage to the Earl of <hi>Mulgrave</hi> the Lord Chamberlain, to furniſh his Lodgings with new Furniture,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56339:56"/>
for he meant to continue in them. And the King alſo (as was ſaid) diſcharged <hi>Leiburn</hi> a Popiſh Biſhop, out of <hi>Newgate,</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> the Seventeenth of <hi>December:</hi> So that all things were returning apparently into the old Chanel, and we were to expect nothing but what we had already ſeen and felt; and ſome that wiſhed well to the King ſaid, he was cunningly invited back to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> with a deſign to ruine him the more effectually, and without any pity from his Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
            <p>The Peers at <hi>Windſor</hi> did not think it reaſonable, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſhould accept the King's Invitation, and venture his Perſon in the ſame place: for this they had another good reaſon, the Duke of <hi>Grafton</hi> marching through the <hi>Strand,</hi> on the Fourteenth day, at the Head of a Foot Regiment of Guards, to take the Fort of <hi>Tilbury</hi> out of the hands of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> by the Order of the Council, an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Trooper came riding up to him, and being beaten off by the Soldiers, drew a Piſtol a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; for which he was ſhot dead upon the place. And it was not improbable there were more of the ſame temper.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Peers at <hi>Windſor</hi> reſolved to ſend the Prince's Guards to take Poſſeſſion of the Poſts about <hi>Whitehall,</hi> to prevent all poſſibility of a Diſturbance from Guards belonging to two ſeveral Maſters; which, beſides other ill Conſequences, might have perhaps involved the King's own Perſon in the danger that might have ariſen from any Diſpute. Theſe Guards got not to <hi>London</hi> before Ten at Night, being commanded by Count <hi>Solmes;</hi> and the Guards then on Duty not being willing to diſlodge, it was Twelve at Night before the Lords could deliver the Paper they had brought from <hi>Windſor,</hi> of which they firſt ſent this Account to Secretary <hi>Middleton.</hi>

When they were gone as far as the Privy-Chamber, the King ſent for them again and told them, He had forgot to acquaint them with his Reſolutions before the Meſſage came, To ſend my Lord <hi>Godolphin</hi> next Morning to the Prince, to propoſe his going back to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> he finding by the Meſſage Monſieur <hi>Zuleſtein</hi> was charged with, the Prince had no mind he ſhould be at <hi>London;</hi> and therefore he now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired he might rather return to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> than go to any other place. The Lords replied, That they would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſend an Account to the Prince of what His Majeſty deſired, and they did not doubt of ſuch an Anſwer as would be to his Satisfaction: Accordingly they ſent to him, who was then at <hi>Sion,</hi> and before Eight next Morning there came a Letter from Monſieur <hi>Benting,</hi> by the Prince's Order, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the King's Propoſal of going to <hi>Rocheſter:</hi> whereupon he went (the Guards being made ready and Boats prepared) that Night to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> in his own Barge, attended by the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> and ſome few others.</p>

The ſame day, <hi>Dec.</hi> the 18th. about Three in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> came to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, attended by Monſieur <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and a great number of the Nobility and Gentry, and was entertain'd with a Joy and Concourſe of the People which appeared free and unconſtrained, and all the Bells in the City were rung, and Bon-fires in every Street.</p>
            <p>The King continued at <hi>Rocheſter</hi> till the 23. of <hi>December,</hi> and then about one or two in the morning privately withdrew himſelf, taking only with him Mr. <hi>Ra. Sheldon</hi> and Mr. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labady,</hi> he went towards <hi>Dover,</hi> and embarqued in a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel laid ready for his Tranſportation for <hi>France.</hi> The Queen, who went hence the 10th. arrived the 11th. at <hi>Calais,</hi> and was in great pain (not knowing what had happened in <hi>England)</hi> for the King, whom ſhe expected every tide.</p>
            <p>The King, before he withdrew this ſecond time, wrote and left behind him this following Letter, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards printed by his Order in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>
                     <hi>His Majeſty's Reaſons for withdrawing Himſelf from</hi> Rocheſter; <hi>Writ with his own Hand, and ordered by him to be Publiſhed.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE World cannot wonder at my withdrawing my ſelf now this ſecond time. I might have expected ſomewhat better uſage after what I writ to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by my Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> and the Inſtructions I gave him; but inſtead of an Anſwer, ſuch as I might have hoped for, what was I to expect after the uſage I received, by the making the ſaid Earl a Priſoner, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Practice and Law of Nations; <hi>the ſending his own Guards at Eleven at Night, to take Poſſeſſion of the Poſts at</hi> Whitehall, without advertiſing me in the leaſt manner of it; the ſending to me at One of the Clock at midnight,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56339:58"/>
when I was in Bed, a kind of Order by three Lords to be gone out of my Palace before Twelve that ſame mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? After all this, How could I hope to be ſafe, ſo long as I was in the power of one, who had not only done this to me, and invaded my Kingdoms, without any juſt occaſion given him for it, but that did by his firſt Declaration lay the greateſt Aſperſion on me that malice could invent, in <hi>that clauſe of it which concerns my Son?</hi> I appeal to all that know me, nay, even to himſelf, that in their Conſciences neither he nor they, can believe me in the leaſt capable of <hi>ſo unnatural a Villany,</hi> nor of ſo little common Sence, to be impoſed on in a thing of ſuch nature as that. What had I then to expect from one, who by all Arts hath taken ſuch pains to make me appear as <hi>Black as Well,</hi> to my own people, as well as to all the World beſides? What effect that hath had at home, all Mankind hath ſeen, by ſo general a defection in my Army, as well as in the Nation amongſt all ſorts of people.</p>
                  <p>I was born free, and deſire to continue ſo; and tho I have ventured my Life very frankly on ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for the Good and Honour of my Country, and am as free to do it again <hi>(and which I hope I ſhall yet do, as old as I am, to Redeem it from the Slavery it is like to fall under;)</hi> yet I think it not convenient to expoſe my ſelf to be ſecured, as not to be at Liberty to effect it; and for that Reaſon to withdraw, but ſo as to be within Call whenſoever the Nation's Eyes ſhall be opened, ſo as to ſee how they have been impoſed upon by the <hi>Specious Pretences of Religion and Property.</hi> I hope it will pleaſe GOD to touch their Hearts, out of His Infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to make them ſenſible of the ill condition they are in, and bring them to ſuch a <hi>Temper that a Legal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may be call'd;</hi> and that amongſt other things which may be neceſſary to be done, they will agree to <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> for all Proteſtant Diſſenters, and that thoſe of my own Perſwaſion may be ſo far conſidered, and have ſuch a ſhare of it, as they may live peaceably and quietly, as Engliſh men and Chriſtians ought to do, and not to be obliged to Tranſplant themſelves, which would
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56339:58"/>
be very grievous, eſpecially to ſuch as love their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: And I appeal to all men, who are conſidering men, and have had experience, whether any thing can make this Nation ſo great and flouriſhing, as Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Some of our Neighbours dread it.</p>
                  <p>I could add much more to confirm what I have ſaid, but now is not the proper time.</p>

            <p>Having now attained that period of time I deſigned, what followed being the Methods of Redreſſing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders we fell into by the Deſertion, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettling the Government again, I muſt deſire my Reader to make a Stand with me, and to conſider what it was could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly work upon the Apprehenſions of this Prince, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him at firſt to entertain the Thoughts of leaving his People, and withdrawing into a Foreign Country.</p>
            <p>When the Prince's Expedition was firſt certainly made known to him, he was reſolved to have had a Parliament, upon a Belief, that he ſhould have been intirely Maſter of the Lower Houſe, by reaſon of the <hi>Regulations,</hi> and other means then lately uſed; but yet it is probable he would have examined them man by man, before they ſhould have met.</p>
            <p>But when all this was out of doors, and the Charters reſtored, he dreaded nothing more than a Parliament, and the rather, becauſe the Prince had in his Declaration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, That <hi>all the Violences and Diſorders which have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the whole conſtitution of the Engliſh Government, may be fully redreſſed in a Free and Legal Parliament:</hi> This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under it theſe things, which he would certainly have periſhed, rather than to have ſubmitted to them, by concurring with a Parliament.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt thing is, The Examination of the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> (as he is call'd) the but Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56339:59"/>
of which, was a Stab at the Heart of this Prince, as appears by his laſt Letter. And the Reflections on the Biſhop's Petition mention that as a thing not fit to be referr'd then to a Parliament. I will not blame them for this, conſidering the proof they were able to make of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The next thing was, that Juſtice would certainly have been demanded againſt all the Inſtruments of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Calamities, whom he had pardoned, and was in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour bound to protect, at leaſt, not to puniſh thoſe whom he had hired or perſwaded, or perhaps forced almoſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Criminals.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The third was, the conſenting to the intire Ruine of the Means or Hopes of ever ſettling Popery in <hi>England,</hi> and to the hanging ſome, and attainting others of the Prieſts and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> for doing their kind, and what their Rules, Oaths, and Vows oblige them to.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. He foreſaw ſuch a Parliament would not only for ever damn the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Court,</hi> and <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> but would in all probability retrench much of his <hi>Revenue,</hi> and more of his Legal and Ancient <hi>Prerogatives,</hi> eſpecially after the Prince had got all the Forts into his Hands, and reduced the Engliſh Army to nothing. And this alone was a thing he would hardly have conſented to, though nothing elſe had been asked.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The Prince, he foreſaw, would have inſiſted on the having ſome Forts in his hands, and the Parliament for their own ſecurity, and for the fixing a Faith which had not been over nice, would have joined with him: So, ſaid he, if I ſtay, I ſhall be a Nominal, rather than a real King of <hi>England,</hi> and only ſerve as an Inſtrument to ruine my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, my Friends, the Monarchy, and the Child, and after all, do and hear what is worſe (to me) than a Thouſand Deaths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:56339:59"/>
At firſt he alledged, That the Diſorders the Preparations to repel the Invaſion cauſed, would not ſuffer a Parliament to meet. Secondly, After the Prince was landed, that all the Countries he had under him would not be free. Thirdly, That all that had joyned with him, ought not to ſit, but when he ſaw the whole Army and Nation (the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> excepted) of the ſame mind, mere force drove him to conſent to Call a <hi>Parliament;</hi> and when he had again conſidered the Conſequences of it, he at laſt reſolved to throw up the Crown all at once, rather than to ſubmit to all theſe Hardſhips.</p>
            <p>He ſeems to have had at the ſame time a fluttering hope, that (1.) We would never be able long to agree, after he had made it impoſſible for us to have a Legal Parliament, by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Writs (2.) That the <hi>Church of England</hi> Principles would, when the fear and diſorder was over, form for him a potent Army in the Nation. And (3.) That the <hi>French</hi> King would lend him potent Forces, and good ſtore of Money; and if he recovered the Throne by force, he ſhould be freed of all theſe Miſeries, and have what he only wanted before, a Popiſh Army, to inſure the Slavery of <hi>England</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>Now I would deſire thoſe <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who pretend, now too late, to be ſo zealous for him, to conſider, whether what I have ſaid would not have been expected from him by them, for their Security; and what they would have done, had he called a Parliament, and refuſed them all theſe things, and have inſiſted, That they ſhould have taken his Word as to the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> have ſuffered him to have been educated in <hi>France,</hi> and have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Army, the Prerogative, the Miniſters, and the Revenues to have continued entirely as they were, upon a Promiſe, He would have uſed them better for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
            <p>If they ſay No; They would have had the beſt Security that Law or Reaſon could have required: Then all the hard things I have mentioned muſt have been granted them, and I much queſtion, whether he would how return to the Throne on thoſe terms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:56339:60"/>
If they ſay, we ought however to have treated with him' have offered him terms; I ſay, it would have come to a ſeparate Treaty; and the Church, the Liberties of the Nation, and the Government, would have been ruined that way; and when all had been done, no Bond (that he could have broken) would have held him longer than the Neceſſity had continued.</p>
            <p>The only Advantage we could pretend to have by the coming over of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with an Army, was to force the King to what he would never have yielded without that Force. Now when he had accordingly paſſed his Word to the Nation, in the Proclamation of the Thirtieth of <hi>November,</hi> That there ſhould be a <hi>Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in his Meſſage by the three Lords, <hi>That he would conſent to every thing that could reaſonably be required for the Security of thoſe that come to it;</hi> and yet without any Provocation would burn the Writs, and reſolve to withdraw his Perſon before theſe Lords could poſſibly return him any Anſwer (for he promiſed the Queen to follow her, who went away the day before him.) I ſay, this breach of his Word ſo ſolemnly made and given both to the Nation and the Prince, ſhew that he was not Maſter of himſelf, but turned about by others whither they pleaſed.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe the Prince had ſuffered him to continue at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and to call a Third Parliament, what aſſurance could he have given, that in the end of another forty days we ſhould not have the ſame trick play'd us, and then in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April</hi> have been left in the ſame ſtate of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we were in in <hi>December,</hi> to the certain ruine of theſe three Kingdoms, and <hi>Holland</hi> into the bargain. And when all had been done, the Scruples would have been the ſame they are now, the Obligations of the Oath of Allegiance the ſame, and the ſin of Depoſing a Lawful Prince, who reſolved to do the Nation no Right, would have been much greater and more ſcandalous, than barely to take him at his Word; and ſince he had left the Throne empty, when he needed not, to reſolve he ſhould aſcend it no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:56339:60"/>
Laſtly, Suppoſe the Prince had been Expelled by the King, Would the King have then granted us what he would not grant us now? Would he not have Disbanded his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Army, and have kept the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces in Pay, and have every day encreaſed them? What Reſpect would he ever after this have ſhewn to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, Religion or Liberties, when he had had no longer any thing to fear? The memory of what happened after the <hi>Monmouth</hi> defeat, (though effected only by <hi>Church of England</hi> Men) will certainly never be forgotten by others, whatever theſe Bigots of Loyalty may pretend or ſay.</p>
            <p>That Expreſſion of the Lord <hi>Churchill</hi>'s, in his Letter, <hi>[That he could no longer joyn with Self-intereſted Men, who had framed Deſigns againſt His Majeſty's true Intereſt, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, to give a pretence by Conqueſt to bring them to effect]</hi> ought to be ſeriouſly conſidered by all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of the Nation: This one Argument prevailed upon him, when he ran the hazard of his Life, Reputation and Fortunes; and now they are all on the other ſide, I ſhould conſider very ſeriouſly, if I were one of them, what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer I could make to this turned into a Queſtion in the Day of Death and Judgment, before ever I ſhould act the direct contrary to what he has done.</p>
            <p>For my part I am amazed to ſee Men ſcruple the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the preſent King; for if ever Man had a juſt cauſe of War, he had; and that creates a Right to the thing gained by it: the King by withdrawing and disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his-Army, yielded him the Throne; and if he had, without any more Ceremony, aſcended it, he had done no more than all other Princes do on the like occaſions; and when the King after this was taken and brought back by force, he was no longer then bound to conſider him, as one that <hi>was,</hi> but as one that <hi>had been</hi> King of <hi>England;</hi> and in that capacity he treated him with great Reſpect and Civility, how much ſoever the King complained of it, who did not enough conſider what he had done to draw upon himſelf that uſage.</p>
            <p>But when all is ſaid that can be ſaid, there may poſſibly be ſome Men to whom may be applied the Saying of <hi>Job, Thou loveſt thine enemies, and hateſt thy friends; for thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:56339:61"/>
               <hi>this day, that thou regardeſt neither princes, nor ſervants; for this day I perceive, that if Abſolons had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleaſed thee well.</hi> Had the Proteſtant Religion, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties, the Nobility and Gentry of this Nation, been all made an <hi>Holocauſt</hi> to their Reputations and Humours, their Scruples and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niceties, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> periſhed, or returned Ruin'd or Inglorious into <hi>Holland;</hi> we ſhould then have had the Honour of cutting up our Religion, our Laws, and our Civil Rights, with our own Swords; and we ſhould have been the only Church under Heaven that had refuſed a Deliverance, and Religiouſly and Loyally had Deſtroyed it ſelf. In truth, the Men that would have purchaſed <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> ſo dear, ought to have enjoyed both to the End of the World.</p>

againſt quartering Soldiers on private Houſes. <hi>And that all Houſes ſhould be deemed Private Houſes, except Victualling Houſes, and Houſes of Publick Entertainment, or ſuch as ſell Wine or any other Liquor by Retail.

            <p>The <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>January</hi> the Lords paſſed this Order,</p>

            <p>The Throne being thus declared vacant, ſome were for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to be Elected King alone, others for the Princeſs to be forthwith proclaimed and acknowledged as next Immediate Heir of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and others were for a <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> But the two ſtrongeſt parties were thoſe who were for the Prince, and thoſe that were for the Princeſs, ſo that at laſt there was a way found to twiſt theſe two into one by giving the Title indifferently to both, and the Adminiſtration ſolely to the Prince, to avoid the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of two co-ordinate Soveraigns.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe things were warmly debated in the Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Town, and all men were yet in ſuſpence which way they would be determin'd ſome that were over zealous ſet a foot the following Petition the firſt of <hi>February,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to have it ſubſcribed by the Multitude indifferently, going up and down to publick places to ſolicite Subſcriptions.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Concluſion.</note>Thus ended that Stupendious Revolution in <hi>England,</hi>  which we have ſo lately ſeen; to the great Joy of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Proteſtants of <hi>Europe,</hi> and of many of the Catholick Princes and States, who were at laſt convinced, that the attempting to force <hi>England</hi> to return under the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56339:71"/>
Obedience of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> in the preſent conjuncture of Affairs would certainly end in the ruine of this potent King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and whileſt it was doing, the preſent <hi>French</hi> King would poſſeſs himſelf of the remainder of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and perhaps of the Electorates of <hi>Cologne, Ments,</hi> and <hi>Triers,</hi> a great part of which he hath actually ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed whileſt the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was thus Gloriouſly aſſerting the Engliſh Liberty.</p>
            <p>The true reaſons of the Swiftneſs of this Change may eaſily be aſſigned by ſhewing the temper and deſigns of <hi>James</hi> the II. The Temper of <hi>William</hi> the III. our Preſent Soveraign, and The Nature of the Engliſh Nation, and of the times all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with Wonderful Harmony to produce this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effect. For had <hi>James</hi> the II. undertook any thing but the ſubjecting <hi>England</hi> to Popery, and the Exerciſe of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power to that end; his vaſt Revenue, and perſonal Valour, and the Reputation he had gained at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by the defeat of the <hi>Monmouth</hi> Invaſion, would have gone near to have effected it: and after all this if he had in the beginning of <hi>October</hi> frankly granted all the Ten Propoſals made by the Biſhops, and ſuffered a Parliament to have met and given up a confiderable number of his Miniſters to Juſtice, and ſuffered the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> his Birth to be freely debated and determin'd in Parliament. It would in all probability have prevented or defeated the then intended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion. But whileſt he thought to ſave the Pretended Succeſſion, the Diſpenſing and Suſpending power, and the Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion to carry on his former deſign with, when he had baffl'd the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> the Nation ſaw through the project, and he loſt all.</p>
            <p>Had a Prince of leſs ſecrecy, prudence, courage and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt than the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> undertaken this buſineſs it might probably have miſcarried, but as his cauſe was better, ſo his reputation, conduct, and patience infinitely exceeded theirs; he would not ſtir till he ſaw the <hi>French</hi> Forces ſet down before <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> and then he was ſure <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> were irrevocably ingaged in a War, and conſequently he ſhould have no other oppoſition than what the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh Roman</hi> Catholicks could make againſt him. For no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant would fight his Country into Vaſſalage and Slavery to Popiſh
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56339:72"/>
Prieſts, and <hi>Italian</hi> Women, when a Parliament ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt at laſt have determin'd all the things in Controverſie, except we reſolved once for all to give up our Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Eſtates to the will of our King, and ſubmit for ever to a <hi>French</hi> Government.</p>
            <p>A Nation of leſs ſenſe than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon, of leſs bravery and valour might have been frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of a more ſervile temper might have neglected its Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, till it had been too late to have ever recovered them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: But none but a parcel of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> bred in a Cloiſter, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with our temper as well as Conſtitution would ever have hoped to have carried two ſuch things as Popery and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power, both at once upon ſo jealous a Nation as the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> is, which hates them above any other people in the World.</p>
            <p>The cruel ſlaughter they had made of the poor wretches they took after the defeat at <hi>Bridgwater</hi> ought to have made them for ever deſpair of gaining any credit with the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who rarely forgive, but never forget any ill treatment. Yet theſe little <hi>Politico's</hi> had ſo little ſenſe as to build all their hopes on the Gratitude and Inſenſibility of theſe men; as if they ſhould for <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> arbitrarily and illegally granted, and conſequently revocable at the will of the Granter, have ſold themſelves to everlaſting ſlavery.</p>
            <p>They were equally miſtaken in their carriage towards the Church of <hi>England party,</hi> for when ſome of them had purſued both Clergy and Laity with the utmoſt obloquy, hatred, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and contempt to the very moment they found the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſtorm would fall upon them. Then all at once they paſſed to the other extream, the Biſhops are preſently ſent for the Government intirely to be put into their hands, and all places, Preſſes and Papers fill'd with the <hi>Encomiums</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Loyalty and Fidelity, who but three days before were Male-contents, if not Rebels and Traytors, for oppoſing the Kings Diſpenſing power, and the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Commiſſion. And which was the height of folly, the ſame Pen which had been hired to defame and blacken the Church of <hi>England</hi> (the Author of the <hi>Publick Occurrences truly ſtated)</hi> was ordered to magnifie its Loyalty. By which they gained nothing but the intire and abſolute diſobliging the whole Proteſtant party in the Nation, ſo that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no body would ſerve or truſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:56339:72"/>
To compleat their folly and madneſs they perſwaded the King to throw up the Government, and retire into <hi>France,</hi> pretending we would never be able to agree amongſt our ſelves, but would in a ſhort time be forced to recal him and yield to all thoſe things we had ſo violently oppoſed, or if not he might yet at leaſt force us to ſubmit by the ſuccours he might gain in <hi>France,</hi> without ever conſidering how poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it was we might agree, and how difficult it would be to force us by a <hi>French</hi> Army, which was equally contrary to the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> and all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides, and to all intents and purpoſes deſtructive of the Intereſt of that Prince they pretended thus to exalt and re-eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>Had <hi>France</hi> been now in Peace there might yet have been ſome colour for this, but when all <hi>Europe</hi> was under a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to unite againſt him for its own preſervation then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to deſert his Throne, and fly thither for ſuccour, upon hopes of recovering his Kingdoms again by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>French</hi> (the mortal and heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary enemies of the <hi>Engliſh)</hi> this was ſo ſilly a project that there ſeems to have been ſomething of a Divine Infatuation in it.</p>
            <p>However certainly no rational man will think that all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> would ſit ſtill and ſuffer the <hi>French</hi> King to conquer <hi>Britain</hi> under pretence of reſtoring <hi>James</hi> the Second to that Throne which he had abandon'd, becauſe he could not bring the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (their Allie) and all his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subjects to his own Terms.</p>
            <p>And yet if none of them ſhould enterpoſe but the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> alone, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets being united would render the landing a <hi>French</hi> Army ſo difficult and uncertain, that it would be next door to madneſs to truſt one to their Navy, which is ſo much inferior to either of the others ſingly taken.</p>
            <p>So that all things conſidered, either <hi>James</hi> the Second ought to have ſtayed at home and have made as good terms as he could with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and his own Subjects: Or if he would have abandon'd his Kingdoms, he ought to have deſpaired of any reſtitution, and have betaken himſelf to a private life as <hi>Christina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:56339:73"/>
Since I finiſhed that which goes before, we have now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Intelligence that <hi>James</hi> the Second Landed the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> at <hi>Kingſale</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo that now it cannot be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that he hopes to recover <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> by the help of the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> which is all one as if he had done it by the <hi>French.</hi> His ſucceeding in this deſign laying us at the mercy of an <hi>Iriſh Roman</hi> Catholick Army; whoſe civility and kindneſs to our Nation we may learn from our Country-men, who after having loſt all but their lives, have been forced to flee over to us for ſhelter and protection. I ſhall not add any other conſideration to perſwade my Country-men to defend their King, Queen, and the whole Proteſtant Succeſſion, their Lives, Liberties, Priviledges and Religion, becauſe this alone is ſufficient.</p>

                  <p n="1">§. 1. I Don't wonder to find a Perſon of your Senſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity ſo much ſurprized at the Report of the Throne's being declared Vacant, by the Lower Houſe of the Convention: <hi>For how</hi> (ſay you) <hi>can the Seat of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be Empty, while the King, who all grant had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Title, is ſtill Living,</hi> and his Abſence forced and involuntary? <hi>I thought our Laws, as well as our Religion, had been againſt the Depoſing Doctrine; therefore I deſire you would Expound this State Riddle to me, and give me the Ground of this late extraordinary Revolution.</hi> In anſwer to your Queſtion, you may pleaſe to take notice, That thoſe Gentlemen of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and the reſt of their Sentiments, who declare a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy in the Government, lay the main ſtreſs of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon his Majeſties withdrawing himſelf: For now, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the <hi>Story of the</hi> French League, <hi>and the Buſineſs of the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>are paſſed over in Silence, moſt Men believe that the pretended Breach of that which they call,</hi> The Original Contract <hi>was deſigned for no more than a popular Flouriſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. And that you may be not beſhocked by ſeeing the Votes of ſo conſiderable and publick a Meeting debated by a private hand, give me leave to remind you, That a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a Convention, are two very different Things: The latter, for want of the King's Writs and Concurrence, having no ſhare in the Legiſlative Power. If it's urged, That the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56339:74"/>
Poſture and Exigence of Affairs, is a ſufficient Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the uſual Preliminaries and Forms of Parliament. To this I am obliged to anſwer, That this pretended <hi>Neceſſity is either of their own Making, or of their own Submitting to, which is the ſame thing; and therefore ought not to be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Justification of their Proceedings.</hi> For if his Majeſty had either not been driven out of his Dominions, or invited back <hi>upon honourable Terms, they needed not to have had recourſe to theſe ſingular Methods.</hi> And ſince they have neither the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Law, or Neceſſity, to ſupport their Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I hope they will not think themſelves diſobliged, if they are inquired into; and ſome part of that Liberty which they have taken with his Majeſty be returned upon themſelves. For all private and unauthorized Opinions are to be regarded no farther than they prove their point. Like Plate without the Royal Impreſſion, they ought not to be obtruded for currant Coin; nor rated any higher than the Intrinſick Value of the Mettal. Let us examine therefore, if his Majeſty has done any thing which imports, either in it ſelf, or by neceſſary conſequence, That he has voluntarily Reſigned his Crown, and Diſcharged his Subjects of their Allegiance. Now the Author of <hi>The Enquiry into the preſent State of Affairs, &amp;c.</hi> for whoſe Judgment the Commons ſeem to have a very great Regard, as appears from their concurrence with him: For their moſt conſiderable Votes are, in a manner, tranſcribed from his <hi>11th.</hi> Paragraph. This Author tells us, Pag. 5. <hi>That when a King withdraws himſelf, and his Seals, without naming any Perſons to repreſent him, the Government is certainly laid down and forſaken by him.</hi> Though afterwards he is ſo good natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as to add, <hi>That if any imminent preſent Danger, or juſt Fear, (though indeed a King can never be decently ſuſpected of that;</hi> I ſuppoſe his Reaſon is, becauſe Kings are invulnerable) <hi>had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Majeſty away, it might ſeem a little too hard to urge this too much.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. In order to the confuting this Notion, I ſhall prove in the</p>
                  <p>Firſt place, That his Majeſty, before his withdrawing, had ſufficient Grounds to make him apprehenſive of Danger, and therefore it cannot be called <hi>an Abdication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the leaving any Repreſentatives behind him was impracticable at this Juncture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:56339:74"/>
Thirdly, That we have no Grounds, either from the Laws of the Realm, or thoſe of Nature, to pronounce the Throne void, upon ſuch a Retreat of a King.</p>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. But before I do this, it's not improper to obſerve, That this pretence of a Demiſe, if it ſignified any thing, cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland:</hi> Not the firſt, For there his Majeſty's Commiſſioners acted in the uſual manner, till they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed: <hi>Nor the ſecond, For that Kingdom continues ſtill under the Regular Adminiſtration of the Lord Lieutenant.</hi> Neither is it ſufficient to ſay, <hi>That Ireland is an Appendage to the Crown of England, and therefore it muſt follow its Revolution.</hi> For allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Demiſe was really conſequent upon a Failure of Seals and Repreſentatives; yet there would be no colour to apply it to a Caſe where there was no ſuch Omiſſion. For no Forfeiture ought to be ſtretched beyond the Reaſon upon which it is grounded. But this only by the way. I ſhall proceed to prove the firſt thing propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Majeſty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his withdrawing, had ſufficient Grounds to make him apprehenſive of imminent Danger.</p>
                  <p n="5">§. 5. We are now fallen upon Times in which the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant and almoſt impoſſible Things are ſwallowed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chewing, and the plaineſt Truths outfaced and denied; <hi>as if Evidence was an Argument againſt Proof,</hi> and Abſurdities the only Motives of Credibility: So that now, if ever, we ſeem fit for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Had not ſome Men believed this true, in a great Meaſure, they would never have diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt matter of Fact, which was done almoſt in the Face of the whole Kingdom. To ſpeak to the preſent Caſe; Had not his Majeſty great Reaſon to retire, to ſecure his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and his Honour, at his firſt withdrawing from <hi>Whitehal?</hi> which is the time from which our Author dates his pretended Deſertion (for he will not allow him to be King at his return) I ſay, had not his Majeſty great Reaſon to retire when he had met with ſo many unfortunate Diſappointments, with ſo many ſurprizings and unparallel'd Accidents? When part of the Army was revolted, and the Remainder too apparently unſerviceable? When the People had ſuch fatal and unremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable prejudices againſt his Majeſty's Service? <hi>When there were ſuch terrible Diſorders in the Kingdom, and all Places were either Flaming, or ready to take Fire?</hi> What ſhould a Prince do,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56339:75"/>
when he had ſcarce any thing left him to loſe but himſelf, but conſult his Safety, and give way to the irreſiſtible Evil? But our Author pretends the King's Affairs had a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Aſpect; Let us obſerve how he proves it. Why he tells us, <hi>That when the Prince of</hi> Orange<hi>'s Propoſals came to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, the Army and the Fleet were left in his Hands.</hi> They were ſo, that he might pay them for the Prince's Service; for they owned his Majeſty's Authority ſcarce any other way than by receiving his Money, and eating up his Meat. <hi>(It's to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped they have ſince repented of their Actions.)</hi> But the Enquirer goes on with his Inventory of <hi>Forts and Revenues,</hi> which the King was to have ſtill. He may know, if he pleaſes, that we have but Four conſiderable Forts in the Kingdom. Now <hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>Plimouth</hi> had already diſpoſed of themſelves, and the Tower of <hi>London</hi> was demanded for the City; ſo that there was none but <hi>Portſmouth</hi> remaining. And as for the <hi>Revenues,</hi> it's to be feared, the Northern Collections would have been almoſt as Slender as thoſe in the Weſt. And now one would think our Father began to relent: For he owns, <hi>That ſome Things, which the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>propoſed, may be called hard; viz.</hi> his demanding <hi>that the Laws againſt Papiſts which were in Imployment might be executed.</hi> But the Enquirer is much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if he thinks the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> inſiſted upon no more than the bare Execution of the Law in this point. <hi>For the Disbanding of all Papiſts</hi> (which was part of his Propoſals) <hi>is much more than what the Law requires; by which the Papists are only excluded from Offices of Command, and Trust.</hi> But neither the Teſt-Acts, nor any others bar the King from Liſting them as common Souldiers. And laſtly, to deliver up his beſt Magazine, and the Strength of his Capital City: To be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to pay a Foreign Army, which came over to enable his Subjects to drive him out of his Dominions, were very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary demands, and looked as if there was a Deſign to reduce him as low in his Honour, as in his Fortune. To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give a Man who endeavoured to Ruin me, is great Chriſtian Charity; <hi>but to Article away my Eſtate to him, becauſe he has Injured me, is ſuch a Mortification as no Religion obliges us to.</hi> This is in effect to Betray our Innocence, and Sign away the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of our Cauſe; and own that we have deſerved all that hard Uſage which has been put upon us; ſo that it's eaſie to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56339:75"/>
imagine what an unconquerable Averſion the Spirit of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt needs have to ſuch an Unnatural Penance. In ſhort, when the Forts and Revenue were thus diſpoſed of; <hi>when the Papiſts were to be Disbanded, and the Protestants could not be truſted;</hi> when the Nation was under ſuch general, and violent Diſſatisfactions; when the King, in caſe of a Rupture, (which was not unlikely) had nothing upon the Matter but his ſingle Perſon to oppoſe againſt the Prince's Arms, and thoſe of his own Subjects; <hi>when his Mortal Enemies, and thoſe were under the higheſt Forfeitures to his Majeſty, were to ſit Judges of his Crown and Dignity, if no farther;</hi> when Affairs were in this Tempeſtuous Condition, To ſay that a Free and Indifferent Parliament might be Choſen, with relation to the King's Right, as well as the Peoples; and that His Majeſty <hi>had no juſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cauſe to apprehend himſelf in Danger, is to out face the Sun, and to trample upon the Underſtandings, and almoſt upon the Senſes of the whole Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">§. 6. 2. It's not improper to examine what doubty Reaſons the Enquirer advances to prove, <hi>the Kings coming from</hi> Feverſham <hi>to</hi> Whitehal <hi>to be no return to his People.</hi> The reaſon of his affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming this is apparent; He is ſenſible what ſingular uſage his Majeſty met with, and therefore he would fain unking Him, that it might the better ſuit with his Character. But, pray, what had the King done to incur a Forfeiture by his Firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement? Had he quitted the Realm? If that was material, it cannot be alledged, for his Majeſty was no farther off than the Coaſt of <hi>Kent.</hi> Did he refuſe to take Care of his people any longer, when the Lords went down to Viſit him to <hi>Whitehal?</hi> No: If he had, he would not have come back when he was at his Liberty. <hi>His return, after ſome Aſſurances of fair Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a plain diſcovery of the Motives of his withdrawing; and that be came up with an intention to Govern.</hi> For, I believe, few People imagine that his Majeſty would take ſuch a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, only to have <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards clap'd upon him; to be hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his Palace, and carried Priſoner down the <hi>Thames</hi> at Noon-day. But <hi>the Seals never appeared.</hi> What time was there for them in 24 Hours? Beſides there was an Order of Council with his Majeſty at the Head of it, for ſuppreſſing the Mobile, Dated <hi>Decemb.</hi> 18. which was the next Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Majeſty's return. And when he was ſent back to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:56339:76"/>
he might plainly perceive his Government was at an End for the preſent. For the Tower was Garriſon'd by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Forces: The Lords publiſhed an Order by their own Authority, to oblige the Papiſts to depart the Town: <hi>The City made an Addreſs to the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>which was a Virtual acknowledgment of his Power;</hi> and Aſſociations came up to to that purpoſe out of the Country; <hi>(Cambridgeſhire</hi> Addreſs) not to admit <hi>that his Majeſty was denied</hi> a ſmall Sum of his own Gold to Heal with; As if they had rather poor People ſhould periſh with Boyles and Ulcers, than ſhew common Juſtice and Humanity to their King. From all theſe remarkable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, his Majeſty might eaſily gueſs how they intended to diſpoſe of him: For no Man in his Senfes, who has treated a Prince ſo Contemptuouſly in his own Kingdom, will ever permit him either Power, or Liberty, for fear he ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his former Uſage. From what has been ſaid, it's moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that his Majeſty had all imaginable reaſon to provide for his own Security in ſome other Country.</p>
                  <p n="7">§. 7. And ſince his Majeſty had ſufficient reaſons to withdraw, theſe can be no pretence for an Abdication: For we are to obſerve, that to Abdicate an Office, always ſuppoſes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of him who Quits it. That this is the ſignification of the Word <hi>Abdico,</hi> appears from <hi>Tully, Saluſt,</hi> and <hi>Livie;</hi> to which I ſhall only add the Learned <hi>Grotius, De Jure Belli,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Libr.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. Where he makes Abdicating the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and plainly Giving it up, to be <hi>Terms</hi> of the ſame importance.</p>
                  <p n="8">§. 8. And to prevent unreaſonable Cavils, he adds, that a Neglect, or Omiſſion in the Adminiſtration of Government, is by no means to be Interpretated a Renunciation of it. We have but two Inſtances with us which looks like an Abdicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſince the Conqueſt; which are in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> II. and <hi>Richard</hi> II. both which were unjuſtly Depoſed by their Subjects. However they did not renounce their Allegiance, and declare the Throne void, till they had a formal Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the Hands of both thoſe unfortunate Princes. And hence it appears how unlucky our Enquirer is at citing the Laws. For <hi>pag.</hi> 12. He tells us, <hi>That ſince theſe Two Princes have been judged in Parliament for their Male Adminiſtration, and ſince theſe Judgments have never been vacated by any ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:56339:76"/>
                     <hi>Parliaments; theſe Proceedings are part of our Law.</hi> From hence I obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="9">§. 9. 1. That our Author contradicts himſelf. For here he owns that Male Adminiſtration is ſufficient to warrant Depoſition, and Reſiſtance. But in his Enquiry into the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Submiſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (For both theſe Papers are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed to come from the ſame Hand) <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. <hi>Par.</hi> 14. He is much kinder to the Crown; for there he aſſerts, <hi>That it is not Lawful to reſiſt the King upon any pretence of Ill Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and that nothing leſs than ſubverting the Fundamentals of Government will juſtifie an Oppoſition.</hi> Now I am much miſtaken, if Depoſing of Kings is not Reſiſting them with a Witneſs. But beſides his ſelf Contradiction; the caſe is not to his purpoſe: For,</p>
                  <p n="10">§. 10. 1. Theſe Parliaments were called in Tumultuous times, when the Subjects were ſo hardy as to put their Kings under Confinement. Now if it is againſt the Conſtitution of Parliaments to Menace the Two Houſes out of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Voting freely, then certainly Kings ought not to be overawed by Armies, and Priſons. Theſe Parliaments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are very improper to make Precedents of.</p>
                  <p n="11">§. 11. 2. Thoſe Princes were wrought upon ſo far, as to reſign their Crowns, which each of them did, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly; Let this Enquirer produce ſuch a Reſignation from His Majeſty, and he ſays ſomething.</p>
                  <p n="12">§. 12. 3. He is much miſtaken in ſaying <hi>theſe Judgments,</hi> as he calls them, <hi>have not been vacated by ſubſequent Praliaments.</hi> For all thoſe ſubſequent Parliaments, which declare it Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to take up Arms againſt the King, do by neceſſary implication condemn theſe Depoſing Precedents; for it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Subjects to Depoſe their Princes without Reſiſting them.</p>

                  <p n="17">§. 17. To this it was Anſwered, That the pretence of Right as next Heir to <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. was falſe, and only made uſe of as a Cloak to ſhadow the violent Uſurpations of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p n="18">§. 18. 2. It was Objected againſt the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> That the Crown was by Act of Parliament Entailed upon <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. and the Heirs of his Body, from whom King <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. did Lineally Deſcend. <hi>The which Act</hi> (ſay they, as it is in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord) <hi>is of Authority to defeat any manner of Title.</hi> To which the Duke of <hi>York</hi> replied; <hi>That if</hi> Hen. 4. <hi>might have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and enjoyed the Crowns of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> France <hi>by Title of Inheritance, Deſcent, or Succeſſion, he neither needed, nor would have deſired, or made them to be granted to him in ſuch wiſe, as they be by the ſaid Act, the which takes no Place, nor is of any Force or Effect, againſt him that is right Inheritor of the ſaid Crowns; as it accordeth with Gods Laws; and all Natural Laws.</hi> Which Claim and Anſwer of the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> is expreſsly acknowledged and recognized, by this Parliament, to be <hi>Good, True, Juſt, Lawful and Sufficient.

                  <p n="19">§. 19. From theſe Recognitions it plainly follows,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Succeſſion cannot be interrupted by an Act of Parliament, eſpecially when the Royal Aſſent is given by a King <hi>De Facto,</hi> and not <hi>De Jure.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:56339:77"/>
If it's demanded, Why his Majeſty did not leave <hi>Seals and Commiſſioners</hi> to ſupply his Abſence? This Queſtion brings me to the Second Point, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew,</p>
                  <p>That the leaving ſufficient Repreſentatives was impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable at this Juncture. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When the Nation was ſo much embroiled, and the King's Intereſt reduced to ſuch an unfortunate Ebb; <hi>It would have been very difficult, if not impoſſible, to have found Perſons who would have undertaken ſuch a dangerous Charge.</hi> That Man muſt have had a Reſolution of an extraordinary Size who would venture upon Repreſenting a Prince who had been ſo much diſrepected in his own Perſon; whoſe Authority had been ſet aſide, <hi>and his Ambaſſador</hi> clapt up at <hi>Windſor,</hi> when he carried not only an inoffenſive, but an obliging Letter. But granting ſuch a Repreſentation had been ingaged in; the Commiſſions muſt either have extended to the Calling of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, or not; if not, they would neither have been Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, nor abſolutely neceſſary. Not Satisfactory, <hi>For the want of a Parliament was that which was accounted the great Grievance of the Nation, as appears from the Prince of</hi> Orange's <hi>Declaration.</hi> Where he ſays expreſly, <hi>That his Expedition is intended for no other Deſign but to have a Free and Lawful Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, as ſoon as is poſſible.</hi> Declar. P. 12.</p>
                  <p n="21">§. 21. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Expedient was not abſolutely Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; for the Adminiſtration of Juſtice might have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Regularly, without any ſuch Deputation, by Virtue of thoſe Commiſſions which the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Judges and Juſtices of the Peace had already from the King. This I ſhall prove,</p>
                  <p n="22">§. 22. 1. From a parallel Inſtance; King <hi>Charles</hi> the I. took a Journy into <hi>Scotland</hi> in 41. during the Seſſion of Parliament at <hi>Westminſter;</hi> where, though he appointed Five Lords to ſign Bills in his Name, (The Continuation of <hi>Bak. Chron.)</hi> yet the Judges and Juſtices Acted by vertue of their former Commiſſions, without any new Authority from any Repreſentatives of His Majeſty. Now <hi>Scotland</hi> is as much a diſtinct Kingdom from <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>France;</hi> and <hi>France</hi> as much His Majeſties Dominions as <hi>Scotland:</hi> And therefore if Commiſſions will hold in the King's Abſence in one Place, why not in the other?</p>
                  <p n="23">§. 23. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The preſent Judges met in <hi>January</hi> laſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56339:78"/>
at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> to diſpatch, ſome Buſineſs in order to keep the Term but were forbidden to proceed by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Secretary: So that it is plain, it was the <hi>Opinion of theſe Reverend Judges, that their Commiſſions from His Majeſty were ſtill in Force.</hi> But in the next place,</p>
                  <p n="24">§. 24. If His Majeſty had deputed any Perſons to Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him in Parliament, this Method would have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with new and inſuperable Difficulties. For,</p>
                  <p n="25">§. 25. 1. If they had been Limited they would not have given Satisfaction: For it being impoſſible to foreſee the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and Votes of a Parliament at a diſtance; If they had been reſtrained to certain Points, in all probability they would have wanted Power to have paſſed all the Bills, and and ſo their Deputation would not have Anſwered the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Houſes, and the greateſt part of their Grievances might have <hi>been counted unredreſſed.</hi> If it's ſaid that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament might have requeſted an Enlargement of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from His Majeſty. To this I Anſwer. <hi>That the Convention may ſend to His Majeſty for an Expedient now if they pleaſe.</hi> And, I hope, they will; for I hear his Majeſty has been ſo gracious as to ſend to them. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If theſe Commiſſioners were unlimited, it would be in their Power to do a great many things prejudicial to the Crown; In ſuch a Caſe they might alter the Monarchy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Commonwealth, or Sign the Depoſing of his Majeſty, if ſuch Bills ſhould happen to be offered. And though there may be many Perſons of Honour, and Conſcience enough, to lodge ſuch a Truſt with: Yet in regard his Majeſty has been lately miſtaken <hi>in ſome, of whoſe Fidelity he had ſo great and Aſſurance, he has ſmall encouragement to be over confideing for the Future.</hi> Indeed no Wiſe Prince will Truſt ſo vaſt a Concern, as a Kingdom, with the Honeſty of another, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when many of his Subjects are diſaffected, and in a Ferment. So that nothing can be more unreaſonable than to expect ſuch Plenipotentiary and Abſolute Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                  <p n="26">§. 26. 3. I ſhall prove in the laſt place, That we have no Grounds, either from the Laws of the Realm, or from thoſe of Nature, to pronounce the Throne void, upon ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of a Prince as we have before us.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:56339:78"/>
1. To begin with the Laws of the Realm, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Acts of Parliament, or thoſe we call Common Laws. Now there is no Statute, ſo much as pretended, to ſupport this Deſerting Doctrine; and if there was, it's certain no ſuch can be produced. Indeed a Prince muſt be very weary of Governing, and void of the common Inclinations of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; who would ſign a Bill of this Nature, and give his Subjects ſuch a dangerous Advantage againſt himſelf, and his Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Neither has this Opinion any better Countenance from Common Law: For Common Law is nothing but Antient Uſage, and Immemorial Cuſtom. Now Cuſtom ſuppoſes Precedents and Parallel Caſes: But it's granted of all Hands, That the Crown of <hi>England</hi> was never judged to be Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, by the withdrawing of the Prince before now. And, therefore it follows, by undeniable Conſequence, that this Opinion can have no Foundation in the Common Law, becauſe there is not ſo much as one Ruled Caſe to prove it by. Nay, our Laws are not only ſilent in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of this Paradox, but againſt it, as I ſhall make good by Two Precedents.</p>
                  <p n="27">§. 27. 1. From the Caſe of <hi>Edward</hi> the IV. who having not ſufficient Force to Encounter the Earl of <hi>Warick,</hi> who had raiſed an Army for King <hi>Henry,</hi> was obliged to fly the Kingdom; but that he deputed any Perſons to Repreſent him, our Hiſtories don't give us the leaſt Intimation: Neither was it Objected at his return, that he had Abdicated the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by omitting to Conſtitute a Regent. <hi>Neither is it material to Object, that all Diſputes of this Nature were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by his Victorous Army;</hi> For if it had been the known Law of this Realm, that a Prince had <hi>ipſo facto</hi> forfeited his Crown by going beyond Sea, without leaving a Deputation, though his Departure ſhould happen to be Involuntary: If this, I ſay, had been the Law of the Kingdom, it would not only have been a great advantage to <hi>Henry</hi> the VI. and made the Nation ring of it, (of which there is <hi>altum Silenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;)</hi> but we may be well aſſured, King <hi>Edward</hi> would not have conferr'd Honour, worn the Crown, and taken the State and Authority of the King upon him, till he had been Re-Eſtabliſhed by Parliaments. But that he did Exerciſe all
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56339:79"/>
Acts of Soveraignty before the calling of a Parliament, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>Daniel, Stow,</hi> and <hi>Baker.</hi> And when the Parliament was Convened, thoſe who had taken up Arms againſt him were found Guilty of Treaſon, and his Adherents were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to Blood and Eſtate <hi>(Daniel.)</hi> But there was no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, or Reſiſting or his Title, which is a Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there was no need of it; and that this Abdicating Doctrine was perfectly unknown to that Age.</p>
                  <p n="28">§. 28. 2. To come nearer our own Times, what Seals, or Commiſſioners did <hi>Charles</hi> the II. leave behind him after <hi>Worceſter</hi> Fight? And yet, I beleive, no Mortal ever urged this as an Argument againſt his Reſtauration. If it be Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, that there was much more danger in this caſe, than in that before us. To this I reply, that if we Examine the matter more narrowly, we ſhall find the diſparity very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable. For was there not a numerous Army of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners and Subjects in the Field, againſt his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty at his retiring? What Power or Authority, or ſo much as Liberty was there left him? And I am afraid that at that time he had fewer Friends to ſtand by him, than his Brother after that unfortunate Battle in 51.</p>
                  <p n="29">§. 29. And ſince this pretended Dereliction has no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Protection from the Conſtitution, it has no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge but the Laws of Nature to fly to; but a very little Storming will ſerve to drive it from this laſt Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="30">§. 30. For the Law of Nature is nothing but the Reaſon of the Thing. Now impartial Reaſon has always a regard to the Circumſtances of Action, and makes Allowances for Surpriſe, for Straitneſs of Time, for Reſentment upon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary provocation; and never takes advantage of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which may be fairly Interpreted, from any or all of theſe Cauſes. I mention this not that the preſent Caſe needs any ſuch Allowance, but to ſhew that the Law of Nature would admit it, if Occaſion required. 'Tis true, written Laws, either through the ambiguity of the Words, or the defectiveneſs of the Senſe, are often abuſed by ill Men, and wreſted contrary to the Deſign of the Legiſlators:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56339:79"/>
But the Law of Nature is not tyed up to the Alphabet, nor bound to determine by the Imperfections of former Ages. Therefore this Principle will give the Enquirer no <hi>juſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages</hi> againſt his Majeſty; for Equity has no Quirk, in it, nor ever lies at Catch. <hi>Reaſon is always Juſt and Generous, it never makes Misfortune an Accuſation, nor judges in favour of Violence. Indeed, what can be more Unrighteous</hi> (though the Caſe was private and inferior) than that any one ſhould Suffer for being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, and be barred his Right for the Faults of others? If a Man ſhould forfeit his Houſe to thoſe who ſet it on Fire, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe he quitted it without giving ſome formal Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Servants; and be obliged to loſe his Eſtate, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to preſerve his Life. I believe it would be thought an incomprehenſible ſort of Juſtice. If to proceed in this manner be not to eſtabliſh Wickedneſs by a Law, I have done. If Princes may be thus roughly treated, their Birth is a Misfortune to them; and, we may ſay, they are Crown'd rather for Sacrifice than Empire. At this rate, the People muſt e'en Govern themſelves, for the Throne will be a Place of too much Danger to ſit on any longer. <hi>We have an Excellent Church, and we do well to take due Care to continue its Eſtabliſhment; but to diſpoſſeſs our Prince, upon this Score, has as little Divinity as Law in it.</hi> To endeavour to preſerve our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by ſuch Methods will make it more Fatal to us in the event than Atheiſm it ſelf. <hi>'Tis a miſtake to think the World was made for none but Proteſtants; and if Dominion was founded in Grace, I am afraid our ſhare would not be great in the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>

               <p>HAving thus as truly and as ſhortly as I can from the Papers I have Collected, ſtated the matter of Fact, without which it is impoſſible to paſs any judgment upon the merits of the caſe; I come now in the next place to conſider the ſmall Piece which has neceſſitated me to take all this pains.</p>
               <p>The Author of it is my acquaintance, and a perſon for whom I have a great eſteem, both on the account of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and of his perſonal worth, learning and ſobriety, ſo that I cannot believe he had any ill deſign either in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or publiſhing of it; his zeal for the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Loyalty, and the difficulty and unuſualneſs of the preſent caſe having been the occaſions if not the cauſes of his miſtake, and therefore I will endeavour to ſhew him and the world his error, with as much candor and ſweetneſs as he himſelf can wiſh, becauſe I have the ſame deſign for the main that he had, <hi>viz.</hi> the Honour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the ſafety of Government, and eſpecially our Monarchy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:56339:80"/>
It begins thus, <hi>Sir, I don't wonder to find a Perſon of your ſenſe and integrity ſo much ſurprized at the report of the Thrones being declared</hi> vacant, <hi>by the Lower Houſe of the Convention:</hi> for how (ſay you) can the Seat of the Government be empty, whileſt the King, who all grant had an unqueſtionable Title, is ſtill living, and <hi>his abſence forced and involuntary?</hi> I thought our Laws as well as our Religion had been againſt the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Doctrine; therefore I deſire you would expound this State Riddle to me, and give me the Grounds of this late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Revolution. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. In Anſwer to which he tells his Country Gentleman, That the Gentlemen of the Lower Houſe of Convention lay the main ſtreſs of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon his Majeſties withdrawing himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that the King was <hi>de facto</hi> gone is not to be diſputed, but the Queſtion is, Whether his abſence was truly forced and involuntary or no, and by whom he was forced. Our Author is for the affirmative, and afterwards propoſeth his Reaſons, which I ſhall examine And this Queſtion being well ſtated, the buſineſs of the Depoſing Doctrine will appear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now before our Author could regularly enter upon this Queſtion, he ought firſt to have conſidered what the cauſes of this force was, and what had been done by the King on his part, and then have come to the other, Whether the abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf was a fault or a misfortune.</p>
               <p>So that to begin at the right end of the Queſtion we muſt enquire what were the cauſes of this Revolution, who were the Parties concern'd, how things were managed on both ſides, and then come in the laſt place to the Queſtion he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> are the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declaration, and the Biſhops Ten Propoſals as to the things complained of true or falſe? Are they juſtifiable or not by the Laws of <hi>England?</hi> For if the King had done nothing which he could not fairly juſtifie his <hi>Title was unqueſtionable,</hi> and therefore he ought not to have been diſturbed either by his own Subjects, or his Neighbours, during his life. But then, <hi>Sir,</hi> I think he had no right to govern us as he did, and he had as little reaſon to expect (whatever we did) that his Neighbours would ſit ſtill and ſuffer him to do what he pleaſed to them and us to the Ruin of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:56339:81"/>
The King of <hi>England,</hi> ſaith the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, <hi>have given the greateſt credit to thoſe Counſellors who have overturned the Religion, Laws and Liberties of his Realms: And ſubjected them in all things relating to their Conſciences, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herties and Properties, to Arbitrary Government; and that not only by ſecret and indirect ways, but in open and undiſguiſed manner,</hi> §.2. Pag. 10. §. 17. he informs us, <hi>That both he and his deareſt and moſt entirely beloved Conſort the Princeſs, have endeavoured to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie in terms full of reſpect to the King, the juſt and deep regret which all theſe proceedings have given us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But thoſe evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors have put ſuch ill Conſtructions on theſe our good intentions, that they have endeavoured to alienate the King more and more from us: as if we had deſigned to diſturb the peace and happineſs of the Kingdom.</hi> Sect. 19. <hi>To crown all, there are great and violent preſumptions inducing us to believe, that theſe evil Counſellors in order to the carrying on their ill deſigns, and to the gaining to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the more time for the effecting of them, for the encouraging of their Complices, and for the diſcouraging of all good Subjects</hi> (they) <hi>have publiſhed that the Queen have brought forth a Son, tho there have appeared, both during the Queens pretended bigneſs, and in the manner in which the Birth was managed, ſo many juſt and viſible Grounds of ſuſpicion, that not only we our ſelves, but all the good Subjects of thoſe Kingdoms, do vehemently ſuſpect that the Pretended Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>was not born by the Queen. And it is notoriouſly known to all the world, that many both doubted of the Queens big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of the Birth of the Child, and yet there was not any one thing done to ſatisfie them, or to put an end to their Doubts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Things being in this ſtate, <hi>He reſolved to go over to</hi> England (Sect. 21.) <hi>and to carry with him ſufficient force to defend him from the violence of thoſe evil Counſellors, and then he declares that this Expedition was intended for no other deſign but to have a free and lawful Parliament aſſembled as ſoon as is poſſible.</hi> (Sect. 25.) <hi>To the end that all the violences and diſorders which have overturned the whole Conſtitution of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Government may be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed in a Free and Legal Parliament, to which he would alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Enquiry into the Birth of the Pretended Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>and all things relating to it, and to the Right of Succeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if all this is true (which no <hi>Engliſh</hi> man can deny) then had the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> the juſteſt cauſe that ever man had to do what he did; and the King of <hi>England</hi> was bound in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56339:81"/>
to have Summoned a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and to have referr'd the things in queſtion to them, there being no other compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judg on Earth of the things in diſpute; but if he would not ſuffer a Parliament to meet, then the Sword muſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Queſtion between them, for they were both Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Princes, and had no Superior over them to decide it. The King accordingly referr'd it to the Sword, for he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the laſt to ſuffer a Parliament to meet till the Invaſion was over, and the Prince had no reaſon to take his word for it.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtants of <hi>England</hi> had no reaſon to fight againſt this Prince, who came to right their Cauſe, and offered to refer all to a Parliament of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility and Gentry, and the Papiſts alone were not able to reſiſt the Prince's Army, eſpecially after many of the King's Army were gone over to the Prince, ſo that the King was at laſt forced to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the manner I have ſet forth, and he promiſed both the Nation and the Prince, the Parliament ſhould meet and act freely, but before this was poſſible to be brought about, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cauſe given or alledged, he disbanded his Army, ſent away the Queen, the Child, and the Seals, and then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them himſelf, leaving the Nation in Anarchy and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Now I will refer this to the World whether this abſence was not voluntary, unforced, and criminal, after he had thus paſſed his word?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For ſuppoſing he had ſtayed on the Princes terms, and the Parliament had met, no Act could have paſſed without his own conſent, and if any thing had been required that had not been juſt and legal, if then he had withdrawn, his caſe would have been more juſtifiable, and perhaps he ſhould have found enough to have defended it, and ſo needed not to have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn.</p>
               <p>The Story of the <hi>French League,</hi> and the <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> are not paſſed ſo over (tho they are poſtponed) but we may hear more of them in due time; tho when all is done, there will be no reaſon to expect that all the Prate of this populous Town ſhould be proved to be true, it will be ſufficient if his now Majeſty juſtifie his own Publick Declarations, which I believe no man doubts but he can, and has done, the Three Eſtates having in their <hi>Declaration</hi> ſubſcribed to the truth of all the main parts of his.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:56339:82"/>
The King being thus gone, ſome way or other muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to bring us again to a ſettlement, and that of a <hi>Convention</hi> of the Three Eſtates was taken as leaſt liable to Exception and Miſtake; but then he tells us, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. That <hi>the Neceſſity</hi> alledged for their juſtification, <hi>is either of their own making, or of their own ſubmitting to, which is the ſame thing; and therefore ought not to be pleaded in juſtification of their Proceedings.</hi> Now this is not True: The King would never have left his people if he had not firſt loſt their hearts by the things charged upon his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors; nor then neither if he had not firſt reſolved never to do them right againſt thoſe Counſellors, becauſe he had reaſon to believe this would have ſatisfied them; ſo that his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was <hi>not driven out of his Dominions</hi> by his Enemies (as he ſtiled them) but by his pretended Friends, who put him upon doing ill things, and then would not ſuffer him to Redreſs them.</p>
               <p>Well but <hi>If he had been invited back upon Honourable Terms, they needed not have had recourſe to theſe ſingular Methods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why how does he know that? The King had Honourable Terms offered him before he went, and they would not ſtop him from going; and if they had ſent more Honourable Terms after him who can tell whether he would have accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or have ſtood to them? He had paſſed his Word before, that a Parliament ſhould meet, yet he Burnt the Writs and withdrew.</p>
               <p>Well, but however our Author is reſolved the late Kings withdrawing <hi>himſelf is no reſigning of his Crown, or diſcharging of his Subjects of their Allegiance.</hi> In order to which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to ſhew that <hi>his late Majeſty before his withdrawing had ſufficient Grounds to make him apprehenſive of danger, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be call'd an Abdication.</hi> 2. <hi>That the leaving any repreſentative behind him was impracticable at this juncture.</hi> But there are two other things which he has not mentioned, the firſt of which is, who gave the occaſion of theſe Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which he apprehended, and the Second, whether he had no other way to avoid thoſe Dangers but by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now it is plain that the ill courſes taken under his Government had brought upon him thoſe Dangers, and that if he would have ſuffered a Parliament to meet he needed not to have withdrawn, and conſequently his going away rather than ſubmitting the things in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56339:82"/>
to a Parliament was a <hi>voluntary Abdication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. Our Author has a ſcruple whether the Kings go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away ſignifies any thing to <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> now all this is no better than <hi>banter,</hi> for when he left <hi>England</hi> he left them too, tho' the one was for ſometime, and the other ſtill is under the <hi>Regular Adminiſtration of the Lord Lieutenant</hi> as he tells us, but thoſe that have ſince come from thence aſſure us there is nothing Regular in his Adminiſtration, but the Britiſh Proteſtants are treated as Enemies by this Miniſter of his; ſo that <hi>Ireland</hi> being an Appendage of <hi>England,</hi> and thus treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Brethren, ought by us to be taken for a Rebel and an Enemy, let the pretence be what it will; Their Loyalty to the Late King not excuſing but Aggravating their Injuries to his Country men, who have done nothing to deſerve this uſage, but it is to be hoped will find hands enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge it in due time.</p>
               <p>Our Author in the 5 <hi>Sect.</hi> is to prove the late King had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Grounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> omitting his Rhetorick, <hi>Had not his Majeſty</hi> (faith he) <hi>great Reaſon to Retire, to ſecure his Perſon and Honour, at his firſt withdrawing from</hi> Whitchal? <hi>When he had met with ſo many unfortunate diſappointments, with ſo many ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing and unparallell'd Accidents?</hi> &amp;c.—I ſay no, he ought to have conſidered what was the Cauſe of all theſe Misfortunes, and to have applied himſelf with ſo much the more Induſtry to the quieting of his people, which the ſitting of the Parliament would in all probability have effected. But what could he promiſe himſelf by withdrawing, but the bare ſaving of his Life and Liberty with the loſs of his Crown, now his Life and Liberty were in no Danger as is plain, for after he was brought back a Priſoner, and ſuffered to go away again without any hinderance. There are many indiſcreet things ſaid in this Paragraph which I could eaſily expoſe, but I would not make this Anſwer too long, nor exaſperate any body againſt the Author, and therefore I will paſs them over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To be obliged</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to Pay a Foreign Army which came over to enable his Subjects to drive him out of his Dominions, Looked as if there was a deſign to reduce him as low in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as in his Fortune.</hi> The Prince ſaith in his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Sect.</hi> 21. <hi>That he intended nothing but to have a Free and Lawful Parliament Aſſembled as ſoon as was poſſible.</hi> And this might
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56339:83"/>
have been done without driving the King out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and it is very difficult to imagine how he could at firſt propoſe more to himſelf, nor would it have been any dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the Kings Honour to have paid the Dutch Army a few Weeks or Months till things could have been ſetled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the Forts and Revenues were thus diſpoſed off, when the Papiſts were to be disbanded, And the Proteſtants could not be trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the Nation was under ſuch violent and general diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions; when the King in caſe of a Rupture (which was not unlikely) had nothing but his ſingle Perſon to oppoſe againſt the Princes Arms, and thoſe of his own Subjects.—</hi>Well what then? Why it was time to be gone. No Sir it was time to be better Adviſed than he had been by thoſe that had brought him into this deplorable State. It was time to deſpair of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being able to Set up Popery and an Arbitrary Power in <hi>England,</hi> to have reflected on the breach of his former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Oaths which had ſo Exaſperated his Subjects againſt him, but by other meaſures might very eaſily have been again appeaſed, and deſerved after all rather to be truſted than thoſe Popiſh Souldiers he was ſo fond of to his Ruine, becauſe he had formerly had ſufficient Experience of their Loyalty, till he had made it impoſſible for them to ſerve him without deſtroying their Religion and their Civil Liberties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When his Mortal Enemies, and thoſe who were under the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt forfeitures to his Majeſty were to ſit Judges of his Crown and Dignity, if no further,</hi> &amp;c. The Power of an heated Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Why after all, theſe were the three Eſtates of <hi>England</hi> whom he thus blackens, or a part of them, or rather the Church of <hi>England</hi> Nobility and Gentry, the ſame men that were choſen, and for the moſt part muſt be choſen again if we were to chooſe to morrow as to the Lower Houſe, and as to the Upper the Biſhops and the Peers always are and muſt the be ſame: Nor were they to ſit Judges of his Crown and Dignity (for they muſt have Sworn Allegiance to him again at their meeting) much leſs of his Life or Liberty; but only of his former Actions, his Miniſters, and of the Birth of the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> And he had Reaſon to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected great Candor from them, having had ſo great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of them before. When a Gentleman of the Church of <hi>England</hi> could thus <hi>harangue</hi> it againſt his own Party, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56339:83"/>
Intereſt, we need not wonder if that Unfortunate Prince found ſome <hi>Jeſuits</hi> about him who would perſwade him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to abandon his Crown, Kingdom and People, then the Glorious deſign of forcing <hi>England</hi> once more to ſubmit to the yoke of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Section</hi> 6. Our Author is at a loſs to find the Reaſon why his coming from <hi>Feverſham</hi> to <hi>Whitehal</hi> is not allowed to be a return to his people; now if he pleaſe to look into the former Hiſtory he will find it was not voluntary but forced (tho he was not then known) and in all probability the fear continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him when the force was removed, for then he ſaw he could not go away without the Prince's leave, and that was the true reaſon of his inviting the Prince to <hi>London,</hi> when he could not keep him out if he would. <hi>Pray what had the King done to incur a Forfeiture by his firſt retirement? had he quitted the Realm?</hi> Yes, he had, and the Government too, and neceſſitated his own Menial Servants to ſubmit to the <hi>Prince</hi> by the Famous Addreſs made at <hi>Guild-hall</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>December.</hi> So that the Prince was now actually inveſted with the Government, the whole Nation having ſubmitted to him, and it was at his choice whether he would treat him as a King now; nor had he any great reaſon to do ſo, conſidering how lately he had broke his word to him and the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His return after ſome aſſurance of Fair Treatment, is a plain Diſcovery of the Motives of his withdrawing; and of his intention to Govern.</hi> Had it been parely Voluntary, I would have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Conſequence; but when he did, and ſaid all that he could to have got out of the hands of the <hi>Feverſham</hi> men without Diſcovering himſelf, and was at laſt brought up as Priſoner, and diſcovered by thoſe who knew him after he was Landed; for him, after all this to return to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> is no Argument of his intention to ſtay and Govern us. But admit it were, What proof did he give that he would change his Meaſures? Was not <hi>White-Hall</hi> crowded with <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh Roman Catholicks</hi> as before? Was there any one ſtep towards the Satisfying of his Proteſtant Subjects of his better Intentions towards them? The only Order of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil he made after his return, was apparently in favour of the Papiſts, ſo that by that we may gueſs what would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. The reſt of the Paragraph is either miſtimed, miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56339:84"/>
or nothing to the purpoſe, for I will grant him his Late Majeſty had ſome cauſe, as well as free leave to withdraw the ſecond time.</p>
               <p>So that after all, I Conclude juſt contrary to my Author, the firſt withdrawing was cauſeleſs, and therefore Voluntary, and therefore in his own Notion an <hi>Abdication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the <hi>VIIIth. Section</hi> to the <hi>XXth. Section,</hi> is ſpent in a Controverſie with the Author of the <hi>Preſent State of Affairs,</hi> about the <hi>Abdication</hi> or <hi>Depoſing</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> II. and <hi>Edward</hi> II. and as I am no Friend to the Depoſing <hi>Doctrine</hi> in General, nor have any good Opinion of thoſe Actions in particular nor thoſe Books by me now, which are abſolutely neceſſary to the Diſcuſſing thoſe Queſtions, I ſhall leave the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Author to make his own defence if he pleaſe, and go to his <hi>20th. Section,</hi> where he propoſeth this Queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If its Demanded, Why his Majeſty did not leave Seals and Commiſſioners to ſupply his Abſence? It was Impracticable at this Juncture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if this Anſwer is true; then it follows, that it was impoſſible his late Majeſty ſhould reign any longer, for if he would not Govern us himſelf, and either would not or could not find any other perſon or perſons to ſupply his place, and this was brought upon him by his own Act, then was his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and right at an end: Government ſuppoſeth a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Perſons Governed, if one of them fail, the other fails too, and the blame falls on the party that gives the cauſe.</p>
               <p>Nor was it poſſible for us to continue in a ſtate of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> however it was brought upon us, but after he was gone, it was abſolutely neceſſary that we ſhould ſet up another in his place, or run into Confuſion, and a ſtate of War. And when we had once taken this care for our ſelves conſidering how ill we had been uſed, it was very probable we ſhould not be very willing to return again under his power, and therefore his late Majeſty ought to have continued his Poſt, what Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ſoever he had ſtruggled with, even to the hazard of his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Liberty;</hi> or if he abandon'd his people to have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that they would take care to provide for themſelves as they did, which was to put his <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> in the actual Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Government, for we could then much leſs than he
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56339:84"/>
find any other perſon or perſons to ſet up. But let us hear his Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the Nation was ſo much embroiled, and the Kings intereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſuch an unfortunate Ebb; It would have been very difficult, if not impoſſible to have found perſons who would have undertaken ſuch a dangerous Charge.</hi> Now this muſt be underſtood of his firſt withdrawing, tho' he confounds it with the ſecond, for then I will grant it was not only difficult but Impoſſible. But when he went firſt from <hi>White-Hall</hi> doubtleſs this was well conſidered, and it would put an end to all our diſputes if we knew the true Reaſons which were then alledged for his going. The three Lords which were ſent to treat with the <hi>Prince,</hi> are ſaid to have returned his Anſwer the Evening before the King went away by an Expreſs; but it is Notorious, he reſolved to go before the <hi>Queen</hi> went, and the next <hi>Paris Gazett</hi> told us he was expected every Tide in <hi>France,</hi> ſo that it was no ſecret there; ſo that what ſo ever Anſwer the <hi>Prince</hi> made, he was reſolved to be gone: Yet he had promiſed the Nation and the <hi>Prince</hi> there ſhould be a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> Now if the Nation was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo <hi>Imbroiled, and the Kings Intereſt at ſo low an Ebb,</hi> his going away muſt needs reduce his Kingdoms and Affairs into a much worſe Eſtate. The reſult of all which is, that having well conſidered all things he at laſt reſolved ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſuffer a <hi>Parliament</hi> to meet, and determine the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between him, and his People, and the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange:</hi> He would abandon his People, when no body durſt undertake to ſupply his place by reaſon of the Difficulties; and this is a real and true <hi>Abdication.</hi> For I will ſuppoſe after all that it was abſolutely neceſſary, that a Parliament ſhould meet, and that we muſt have been abſolutely ruined one way or other, if one had not met, for if <hi>James</hi> the II. could have reſetled himſelf without one then. It is paſt all Controverſie he would after that never have ſuffered one to meet and act freely, who would abandon his Kingdom ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſuffer a Parliament in this Extremity, when he had no other way to ſave himſelf. And after he was gone nothing but a Meeting of the three Eſtates could have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Authority to Re-Eſtabliſh our ſhattered Government, and ſettle the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:56339:85"/>
But (ſaith my Author) <hi>Granting ſuch a repreſentation had been engaged in; The Commiſſions muſt either have extended to the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Parliament, or not, if not they would neither have been ſatisfactory, nor abſolutely neceſſary, nor ſatisfactory, for the want of a Parliament was that which was accounted the great Greivance of the Nation as appears from the Prince of</hi> Orang's <hi>Declaration where he ſays expreſsly,</hi> That his expedition is intended for no other deſign but to have a free and lawful Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as ſoon as was poſible.</p>
               <p>Now here our Gentleman leaves us in the Dark, without telling us what he thought, but §. 25. He reaſſumes it and ſhews <hi>that if the Commiſſioners were limited, the greateſt part of the Grievances might have been counted unredreſs'd, if unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it would be</hi> in their Power <hi>to do a great many things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Crown.—And his Majesty having been lately mistaken in ſome of whoſe fidelity he had had ſo great an aſſurance, he has ſmall encouragement to be over confiding for the future.</hi> That is, it is fit he ſhould truſt no body ſo far. Now I think I have ſufficiently proved that we were in ſuch circumſtances, that if we had not had a Parliament we had been certainly ruin'd; And therefore any Deputation without a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to hold a Parliament would have ſignified nothing, and a Commiſſion that had not extended to all thoſe Grievances which the Majority of the three Eſtates ſhould have judged neceſſary to be redreſs'd would have ſignified as little, ſo that whatever the difficulties or diſtruſts of the King were at that time he ſaw he muſt yield the point after he had ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as long as was poſſible; and now when he had now paſſed his Word, it was too late to revoke it, and therefore there was that neceſſity added to the other of holding one: Now Sr. if we had yielded this point, there had been an End of the Engliſh Liberties for ever: If he had yielded it, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience could have followed, which did not certainly attend his <hi>Deſertion</hi> of us; but if he had ſtayed, he might in all probability have ſaved his main Stake, and have regained the Affections of his people again, and ſo have ended his Days in Honour and Peace in his own Palace, and amongſt his good Subjects. At leaſt there was ſo great a probability of all this, that no man but he would have taken the other way. Nor he neither if he had ſuffered this Queſtion to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56339:85"/>
have been debated in his Privy Council, and had heard what all ſides could have ſaid for it.</p>
               <p>Sect. 21. He tells us <hi>this expedient</hi> (the appointing of a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative) <hi>was not abſolutely neceſſary; for the Adminiſtration of Juſtice might have proceeded regularly without any ſuch Deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by virtue of thoſe Commiſſions which the Judges, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Peace had already from the King.</hi> So that here was no need of Seals or Commiſſioners tho the Nation was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled to that heigth, that no body durſt have undertaken this dangerous Charge, as he tells us the Section before, and the King was gone. Thus men looſe themſelves when they meddle with what they do not underſtand. The Tumults which aroſe that very day in <hi>London,</hi> and ſpread themſelves (with the news of the Kings withdrawing) all over the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do ſufficiently confute this airy Notion. And at this time both the Judges and Juſtices of the Peace were at al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as Low an Ebb of Authority and Credit with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as their Maſter, by reaſon of the many unqualified men which had been imployed, and the things they had done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law; he could not but know how the late Lord Chancellor, <hi>Sir Roger Leſtrange</hi> and many others were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the People, and yet he tells us the <hi>Adminiſtration of Juſtice might have proceeded regularly,</hi> yes, we might have lived without any King, Magiſtrates, or Execution of Juſtice at all, if all men would have been quiet and minded their own buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Section</hi> 22 We have a whimſey of a Journey of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt into <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>that five Lords were appointed by him to ſign bills in his Name, but the Judges and Juſtices acted by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their former Commiſſions, without any new Authority from theſe Repreſentatives of his Majeſty.</hi> Now to what end is all this; why to prove <hi>that Commiſſions will hold tho the King is abſent.</hi> Who ever doubted this, for without this had been allowed, he could have had no repreſentative. But I thought he would have given us an inſtance of a King that had Stole out of his Kingdom, and had left no body to have ſupplied his place (which <hi>Charles</hi> I. did) and yet after he was gone no body knew whether, to return no body knew when, his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had been Governed by his Judges, and Juſtices of the Peace; and then this ſhould have been an Example for <hi>England.</hi>

                  <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was firſt King of <hi>Poland</hi> and hearing of his brothers Death ſtole away without Leaving any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty: But then the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> call'd a <hi>Dyet</hi> and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it an <hi>Abdication,</hi> and proceeded to the Election of a New King as if he had been Dead. The Inſtances of this nature muſt be very rare, but who ever heard of a Prince that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf from his people, or was forced away and yet no body was put in his place? Certainly <hi>James</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw what would follow; and in ſome ſort conſented to it, rather than to the ſetting of a Parliament.</p>
               <p>§ 26. He undertakes <hi>to prove in the laſt place that we have no Grounds either from the Laws of the Realm; or from thoſe of Nature to pronounce the</hi> Throne <hi>void, upon ſuch a retreat of a Prince as we have before us.</hi> This is bold and very peremptory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering there had then a Vote paſſed for it in the Lower houſe of the Convention; And that this Gentleman is a Clergy-man and knows very little of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>no Statute ſo much as pretended to ſupport this Deſerting Doctrine,</hi> he might have better called it this right of providing for our ſelves, when we had no body to take care off us. There is no Statute to enable us to meet and choſe a new King if the whole <hi>Royal Line</hi> ſhould happen to be extinct, yet this may very probably happen at one time or another. What ſhall we therefore continue in a State of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy for ever?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither has it any foundation in common Law: For common Law is nothing but Ancient uſage and Immemorial Cuſtom. Now Cuſtom Suppoſeth Precedents and Parallel Caſes: But it is granted on all hands, that the Crown of</hi> England <hi>was never judged to be demiſed, by the withdrawing of the Prince before.</hi> Such a withdrawing as this I believe never happened in <hi>England</hi> before; nor ever will again; and it is Stupendioutly wonderful that it happened now. There was nothing asked of the King but what he ought to have granted freely <hi>(viz)</hi> the calling of a Free and Lawful Parliament, which he ſaid he was reſolved to have had tho the <hi>Prince</hi> had not entered <hi>England,</hi> and ſo ſoon as he was retired he would hold ſuch a Parliament, then he came further and promiſed to hold a Parliament the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> and ſent thee Noble-men to the Prince to adjuſt the Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, who had as good an Anſwer as they could expect,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56339:86"/>
but before it was poſſible the late King ſhould know what it would be, <hi>whileſt all men reſted ſecure under the Expectation of that meeting,</hi> The King for Reaſons wholly unknown to us, burns the Writs, ſends away the Seals, withdraws himſelf, and disbands his Army. Now if he can find a caſe Parallel to this <note place="margin">Declaration at <hi>Guild-Hall.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay ſaith he our Laws are not only ſilent in the maintenance of this Paradox, but againſt it as I ſhall make good by two Inſtances.</hi> The firſt of theſe is that of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth who was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fly, without leaving any repreſentative yet returned, and regained the Crown. King <hi>Edward</hi> was ſurprized under pretence of a Treaty and ſent Priſoner to <hi>Warwick</hi> Caſtle, and made his eſcape out of Cuſtody; after this <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was again Crowned, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth declared a Traytor in Parliament, and an Uſurper of the Crown, and all his Eſtate confiſcated; and the like Judgment paſſed againſt all his Adherents, and all the Statutes made by him were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked. After this <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth returned into <hi>England,</hi> and pretending to lay aſide all Claim to the Crown, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeek the recovery of his Lands which belonged to him, as Duke of <hi>York,</hi> which he confirmed to the men of <hi>York</hi> by his Oath; being thus received in the North, he won over his Brother <hi>Clarence,</hi> and haſted to <hi>London,</hi> and there he took poor King <hi>Henry</hi> his Priſoner again; and in a Battel ſlew the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> who came to reſcue King <hi>Henry,</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Battel defeated <hi>Margaret</hi> the Wife of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; took, and in cold blood murdered Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the Eldeſt Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and not long after <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now what ſaith our Letter-man to all this, <hi>If it had been a known Law of</hi> England, <hi>that a Prince had</hi> Ipſo facto <hi>forfeited his Crown by going beyond Sea, without leaving a Deputation, tho his departure ſhould happen to be involuntary; it would have been a great Advantage to</hi> Henry <hi>the Sixth.</hi> Yes doubtleſs his departure did facilitate the Recrowning of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, for he was not ſo well beloved as <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth was, and it is apparent the Nation ſwore Allegiance to <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, <hi>de novo,</hi> for that very cauſe, for no body then queſtioned but that <hi>Edward</hi>'s was the better Title, and the Crown was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56339:87"/>
to <hi>Henry</hi> and his Heirs Male, and for want of ſuch Iſſue to <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> and his Heirs; and when <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth after this came up to <hi>London,</hi> every body forſook <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and he was retaken and impriſoned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſiſtance. Now after two Victories what wonder was it if <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth <hi>exerciſed all Acts of Soveraignty,</hi> (and Tyranny too) <hi>before the calling of a Parliament,</hi> and in it reſtored all his own party, and attainted King <hi>Henry</hi>'s. He might as well have proved it lawful to ſtab and murder Kings and Princes, and to ſwear and forſwear from the ſame ſtory.</p>
               <p>His next Inſtance is the flight of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond from <hi>Worceſter</hi> fight, which was nothing to the purpoſe neither, for that Prince had done nothing to forfeit his right, and was ready to have done any thing to aſſure his ſubjects of theirs: But <hi>James</hi> the Second had as is confeſſed on all hands violated the rights of his Subjects above any Prince that ever ſwayed this Scepter, and would rather throw up the Government, than ſuffer a Parliament to meet to redreſs their Grievances, and this was the only reaſon, why he, as our Author ſaith, <hi>Had fewer friends to ſtand by him than his Brother had after the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Battel of</hi> Worceſter <hi>in</hi> 1651.</p>
               <p>The true Fountain of the Law that is to Determin this difficult and rare Caſe is our Fundamental Conſtitution, and the General Laws and Practiſe of other <hi>Nations</hi> in the like or ſimular Inſtances. And as there is an <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith in <hi>Theology,</hi> ſo there is an <hi>Analogy</hi> here too, for thoſe who are ſufficiently Qualified to judge by; but then they muſt be no young ſmatterers in Law, Hiſtory or State Politicks. Nor was this Queſtion determin'd by ſuch, but by the whole three Eſtates upon Reaſons altogether unknown (perhaps) to this Gentleman, but which may be ſufficient to ſatisfie all the Princes in Chriſtendom when they ſhall be laid before them. In the mean time the Judgment of the States is concluſive to us, and tho' we know not all the Reaſons they might have, yet we now know enough to acquieſs and be ſatisfied. But then this has been ſo very well laid down, and purſued by the Author of <hi>the Caſe of Allegiance in our preſent Circumstances conſidered in a Letter from a Miniſter in the City, to a Miniſter in the Country;</hi> that I will rather refer my Reader to that Book, than tranſcribe it to no purpoſe.</p>

In the 29. <hi>Sect.</hi> He tells us the laſt refuge of the Caſe of <hi>Dereliction</hi> are the Laws of Nature, <hi>but a very little storm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will ſerve to drive it from this last Retrenchment.</hi> Bold and like an <hi>Hero,</hi> conſidering whom he engageth with.</p>
               <p>For (ſaith he) <hi>the Law of Nature is nothing but the reaſon of the thing,</hi> very true. <hi>Now Impartial reaſon has always a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the circumſtances of Action, and makes allowances for Surprize, for ſtreightneſs of time, for reſentment upon Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Provocation, and never takes Advantage of an Omiſſion which may be fairly Interpreted, from any, or all of theſe cauſes.</hi> Now tho he ſaith <hi>the preſent caſe needs not any ſuch allowances;</hi> Yet I will be ſo fair as to give all theſe Advantages and put it upon this fair Iſſue.</p>
               <p>1. Was not the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtitution acknowledged by the Late King to be ſo much in his favour, That he ſaid in his Firſt Speech to the Council, <hi>I have been reported a Man for Arbitrary power, but that is not the firſt Story that has been made of me And I ſhall make it my endevour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Government both in Church and State as it is now by Law Eſtabliſhed. I know the Principles of the Church of</hi> England <hi>are for</hi> Monarchy, <hi>and the Members of it have ſhewed themſelves good and Loyal Subjects, Therefore I ſhall always take care to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and Support it: I know too that the Laws of</hi> England <hi>are Sufficient to make the King as Great a Monarch as I can wiſh; and as I ſhall never Depart from the Juſt rights and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Crown; So I ſhall never invade any Mans Property:</hi> Yet after all this Look upon nine of the ten <hi>Propoſals</hi> made by the the Biſhops, Look upon the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, Look upon the Declaration made by the Lords and Commons the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>February</hi> laſt paſt and you will ſoon be ſatisfied in how many inſtances he had violated the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, and Sought the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and utter Subverſion of this <hi>Loyal, Monarchical</hi> Church of <hi>England.</hi> This conduct Laſted to the very moment they knew the Dutch preparations were made againſt him?</p>
               <p>After this what could be done or ſaid that was omitted, to obtain a Redreſs in Parliament? Was there any other way to Secure us than that of a Parliament? Was this grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before it became Impoſſible to hinder it? And when all mens Eyes were upon this, did he not then Deliberately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56339:88"/>
to defeat our Expectations and to withdraw and leave us in a State of Anarchy and Confuſion? Here was no <hi>Surprize, streightneſs of time, no juſt reſentment,</hi> except he were angry that we could not contribute to our own Ruin, and enſlaving; that we would not cut up our Laws, Liberties and Religion with our Swords, and Sacrifice our <hi>Deliverers</hi> to our <hi>Oppreſſors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor were theſe violations only perſonal Injuries, but they extended to the whole Church and Kingdom, and to the whole Conſtitution and every branch of it; nor were they ſuch as would have ended with his Late Majeſties life; but were to have been intailed upon us and our poſterity for ever, for the Queen might have brought forth every year at that rate the Pretended Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> his birth is proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>an excellent Church, and we do well to take due care to continue its Eſtabliſhment; but to diſpoſſeſs our Prince, upon this ſcore, has as little Divinity as Law in it.</hi> I may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this in the words of the Apoſtle. <hi>But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A Brother or a Siſter is not under bondage in ſuch a caſe: but God hath called us to Peace.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 15. We did not diſpoſſeſs our Prince, but he deſerted us becauſe we would not give up the Legal Eſtabliſhment of our Church and our Civil Liberties to boot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To endeavour to Preſerve our Religion by ſuch methods will make it more fatal to us in the Event than Atheiſm it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, it were better to renounce the whole Apoſtles Creed and every article of it, than to endeavour to preſerve our Religion by a defection from a Perſecuting Prince. In truth this is Loyalty with a Vengeance.</p>

                  <hi>And if Dominion were founded in grace,</hi> we of the Proteſtant Religion ſhould be able to maintain our poſſeſſion of what we have, againſt any Religion that ſhould pretend to out us, if we were to be tried by any other Chriſtian Judge but the Infallible Gentleman at <hi>Rome.</hi> When I firſt read theſe two paſſages I concluded the piece was written by a <hi>R.

               <p>This Concluſion will ſerve me and him differently, And therefore I ſhall add no more but this. The Author of this Letter wrote it in an heat before things were well underſtood or at all Determin'd, and therefore deſerves much Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much that I have ſaid in Anſwer to it was not known to him, and I am perſwaded he himſelf will now ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge too the weakneſs of many things which he then Advanced. In ſhort I deſign nothing by this Anſwer but the Service of their Majeſties, the Peace of <hi>England,</hi> And the Preſervation of our Religion our Laws and Ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And could theſe have been preſerved any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, the Memory of his Late Majeſty ſhould have been ſtill ſacred to me notwithſtanding his Miſ-Government. Whileſt this Piece was preparing to the Preſs there was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his Paper printed in two ſheets in <hi>Quarto,</hi> wherein the Author has taken notice of ſome paſſages in this Letter which I thought fit to omit as not being of any moment as to the main queſtion depending; and therefore if the reader is not ſatisfied without ſo minute an Anſwer he may have recourſe to that Paper.</p>
