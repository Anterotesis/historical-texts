         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SOBER and SERIOUS
CONSIDERATIONS,
Occaſioned by the Death of
His Moſt Sacred MAJESTY,
King Charles II.</head>
            <p>ALTHOUGH I may ſay, in the words
of a worthy Author, That in our
times there have been many good
Books, which may be ſaid to echo
one another; this Age being as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in Words, as barren in Works, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to ſpeak much, and do nothing: Nevertheleſs in
matters of Devotion, or Honour of God, (as the ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
ſaith) it is apparent, that a Man can never ſay too
much, that which he can never do enough; and that in
ſo great ſcarcity of worthy Acts, we ſhould not be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of good Words. To which I may further add, That
where a People have been much corrupted, and
poyſoned with falſe, wicked and ſeditious Principles, there
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49614:4"/>
is great need of ſober, ſerious, and ſound Diſcourſes, to
rectifie the ſaid evil, and to prevent and hinder the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
thereby threatned to the Nation; for elſe wicked
and ſeditious Principles will produce (whenever oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
is offered) wicked and rebellious Practices. Now,
in the way to ſerious and ſound Conſiderations, which
God by his Providences ſeems to call upon us for at this
time, it cannot be unfit, although by way of digreſſion, to
commend the uſefulneſs of the time of <hi>Lent;</hi> that time of
ſeriouſneſs and conſideration. The Antiquity whereof,
as a late Author obſerves, is ſuch; <q>It is like the River
<hi>Nilus,</hi> we can ſcarce find the Head, it being mentioned
by <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> two of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Scholars, by
<hi>Origen,</hi> who lived not long after them, by the Famous
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> where they mention the forty days of <hi>Lent,</hi>
as a thing known and long obſerv'd before their time:
as alſo, we have the Precedent of Faſting from our Bleſſed
Saviour, and he enjoyning the ſame as a Duty to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly, no Man, who believes he hath a precious
and immortal Soul to ſave, can make any doubt or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
Whether a Solemn time of Religious Faſting and
Abſtinence, a time of calling our ſelves to an Account, a
time of Repentance and ſober Conſideration, can be unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
but highly Advantageous as to our Eternal Welfare:
and therefore cannot look upon it otherwiſe, than as an
excellent and wholeſome Conſtitution of the Chriſtian
Church, in requiring a Religious Obſervation of <hi>Lent,</hi> in
Commemoration of our Bleſſed Saviour's Faſting and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation;
and accordingly, our Mother, the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
hath excellently expreſſed the uſe of it in the Collect
for that Sunday in <hi>Lent. O Lord! who for our ſakes didſt
Faſt forty days and forty nights; give us Grace to uſe ſuch
Abſtinence, that our Fleſh being ſubdued to the Spirit,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49614:4"/>
we may ever obey thy godly Motions in Righteouſneſs and
true Holineſs, to thy Honor and Glory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We alſo know well, that the grand Reaſon and Ground
of the prevalency of Vice and Wickedneſs in the
World, is chiefly and primarily from the want of ſober and
ſerious Conſideration; for this is an undoubted Maxim;
That inconſiderate Men, are wicked Men; for it
muſt needs be ſo, when Men are led by their ſenſual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
which ſtick cloſe to them, their Reaſon lies as it were
aſleep. It had need be therefore awakened by ſerious
Conſideration; for if Reaſon be out of Act, and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
Sin will be committed. Now, how hardly are Men
brought to this neceſſary duty, of a ſerious view and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon themſelves, their Lives and Converſations
(eſpecially if they be evil) and in order to their higheſt and
greateſt Concern, the Salvation of their Souls, is too e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
to any conſidering Man; as if they thought their
Souls were the vileſt and worſt part of themſelves, leaſt
worth regard.</p>
            <p>Let us further conſider, That it is found by Practice
and Experience, (the beſt Inſtructer) that the religious
Obſervation of this time of <hi>Lent,</hi> hath proved to be a
mighty reſtraint to Prophaneneſs and Debauchery; yea,
even where men are moſt exquiſite in wickedneſs. That it
hath been a matter of wonder to Travellers, to ſee what
an Appearance, at leaſt, there is of Demureneſs, Sobriety and
Seriouſneſs generally all men take upon them at this time:
I ſhall give it you in the words of a worthy Gentleman
of our own Church and Nation, a great Traveller and
Obſerver in foreign parts; when ſpeaking of <hi>Italy</hi> he
ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Edwin Sands <hi>in his</hi> Europae Speculum.</note> That, notwithſtanding their Vice,
during the time of <hi>Lent,</hi> the People of
all ſorts are much Reformed, no ſuch
blaſpheming, nor dirty ſpeaking as before<q> their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49614:5"/>
Vanity of all ſorts laid reaſonably aſide, their Pleaſures
abandoned; their Apparel, their Diet, and all things
elſe compoſed to Auſterity, and a State of Penitence:
They have daily then their Preaching, with Collection
of Alms, whereto all men reſort, and to judge of them
by their outward ſhew: They ſeem generally to have
very great Remorſe of their Wickedneſs; inſomuch as,
I muſt confeſs, I ſeemed unto my ſelf in <hi>Italy</hi> to
have beſt learned the right uſe of <hi>Lent;</hi> there firſt to
have diſcerned the great fruit of it, and the Reaſon for
which thoſe Sages in the Church at firſt did inſtitute it.
Neither can I eaſily accord (as the ſaid worthy Author
goes on) to the Fancies of ſuch, as, becauſe we ought
at all times to lead a Life worthy of our Profeſſion,
think it therefore ſuperſtitious to have one time wherein
to exact or expect it more than other; but do thus ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conceive, that the corruption of Times, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
of Man's Nature is ſo exorbitant, that it is a
hard matter to hold the ordinary ſort of Men, at all
times, within the Liſts of Piety, Juſtice and Sobriety:
It is fit therefore there ſhould be one time at leaſt in the
year, and that of a reaſonable continuance according
to the practice of all Men, (for the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> have
their <hi>Lents)</hi> to conſtrain Men, how wicked and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſoever, for that time at leaſt, to recal themſelves to
ſome more ſevere Cogitations and Courſes; leſt Sin, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no ſuch Bridle to check it at any time, ſhould at
length become head-ſtrong and unconquerable in them;
as alſo to inure Men, though but to a bare ſhew of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
they might afterwards perhaps more ſeriouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in it.</q>Thus we have the Relation of the manner
of Obſervation of <hi>Lent</hi> in foreign parts, among the
<hi>Romaniſts,</hi> with his Judicious Comment thereupon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49614:5"/>
Now certainly, we have as great Reaſon to be obliged
to the ſtrict Obſervation of this time, as others, upon the
Reaſons aforeſaid: For it is too evident, Vice and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
grows upon us and abounds, and had need have
Reſtraints put upon it, leſt it ſwallow us up; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(inſtead of making a mock at the Religious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of this Solemn Time among the <hi>Romaniſts)</hi>
let us learn Vertue and Goodneſs from our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries;
and laying aſide our Vanity and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
let us become grave and ſerious; ſober, penitent
and reformed: For ſhall it be ſaid, when the whole
Chriſtian World are all ſolemnly ſober, ſerious, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
are humbling their Souls before God with Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Mortifications, and are upon their Knees before
God, and frequent and fervent in their Devotions, That
we in <hi>England</hi> (that own our ſelves to be Reformed,
and better Chriſtians) are taken up with our Jollities
and Feaſtings, yea, our Debauches and Exceſſes, and
have not ſo much ſenſe of our Sins, and Tranſgreſſions
of the Divine Laws, and our great Provocations of the
Divine Majeſty, as to be ſo far diſpleaſed with our ſelves
for the ſame, as to deny our ſelves now and then a meals
Meat, or at leaſt ſomewhat of our Exceſſes, or from our
more pleaſant food, in the ſenſe of our great unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
by reaſon of our horrid Ingratitude in our many
heinous Sins and Offences againſt the Supreme Majeſty
of Heaven; and thereby taking an actual Revenge upon our
ſelves for the ſame; or ſo far however, at leaſt, as the ſame
Abſtinence may promote, and further in us a ſolemn, ſerious
Conſideration of our Ways and Doings, the ſtate of our
Souls, and may enflame and add force to our Devotions to
God, both in behalf of our ſelves and others; yea, the
whole Church of God?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49614:6"/>
Let us conſider alſo, of this outward Appearance, and
Face of Religion; and to be ſerious, although it be but
for a time, what effect it may have upon us: Who knows
not, but it may ſomewhat make Impreſſion on mens Minds,
as to fall in love and likeing of ſincere and true Piety
and it may in time prevail upon them, to become honeſt
and upright, and not only lay aſide their Wickedneſs for
a ſeaſon, but wholly abandon their Luſts: For this
reſtraint for a time muſt mightily convince them,
That they have a power over themſelves to reſtrain their
diſordered and vitious Appetites for a time; and then,
why not longer if they pleaſe? It will alſo inure
and accuſtom them to the duties of Religion, and denial
of their ſenſual Appetites; but, however, they are more
worthy of Commendation, and are doubtleſs leſs wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who thus far ſubject themſelves to Authority, than
ſuch who will not be perſwaded to lay aſide their ſins for
a time, and who will obſerve no time of Humiliation of
their Souls, and extraordinary Devotions, and of Seriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Conſideration. Eſpecially, if we conſider how
far a formal and hypocritical Humiliation of a wicked
<hi>Ahab</hi> had acceptance with God; as the deliverance of
him from a temporal Judgment, and that it ſhould be
ſuſpended during his days.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider further: How highly Advantageous
the Religious Obſervation of the time of <hi>Lent</hi> may prove to
ſuch Chriſtians, who are deſirous, and will but endeavour
ſincerely to ſet about the Religious Duties of this Holy Faſt;
of Conſideration, and ſerious Reflection upon themſelves;
of Reading, Meditation, Faſting and Prayer, Repentance,
by putting them upon this great Work; which, if it were
not impoſed upon them, they would perhaps very careleſly
and ſlightly paſs over, or poſſibly never find a time to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themſelves to theſe Duties at all; and if it ſhould be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49614:6"/>
but only to lay aſide our Sins for a ſeaſon, as I touch'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
they being then eſtranged, and, as it weree, mancipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from their Luſts and Habits of Sin for a time, and ſo far
in a greater Capacity to diſcern and apprehend Divine
Truths, and the Excellency of Chriſtianity, of Vertue and
true Goodneſs, and to taſte of that preſent Felicity which
is in the very practice of it, (which if Men had but once
a Reliſh of, they would doubtleſs never return to live
upon Husks with Swine any more) which elſe, by the
continual ſteam of their Luſts and Vices, while they
wallow in them, would be ſo blinded and infatuated in
their Underſtandings, not able to know their right hand
from the left, not to diſtinguiſh between Light and
Darkneſs, Good and Evil; which, together with the
Advantage to themſelves of their extraordinary Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for God's Grace to Aſſiſt them in their honeſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and then conſulting at that time alſo a good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Director of their Souls, for his ghoſtly Councel
and Advice, eſpecially how to avoid the occaſions of Sin
for the future, and to be armed againſt ſuch Aſſaults as
they may meet with in their Chriſtian Courſe; and how
to frame their holy Reſolutions of Amendment of their
Lives, ſo, that they may be ſucceſsful to them for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that they may vow, and perform their Vows to
God. All which afore-mentioned Duties, are doubtleſs
the Chriſtian Duties, as at other times, ſo eſpecially what
this time puts us upon.</p>
            <p>And as to ſuch Perſons as are truly vertuous and good,
how pleaſant and acceptable muſt needs ſuch a time be
to them, a ſeaſon of extraordinary Exerciſe of Piety,
Charity and Devotion, having this more Solemn time
of Conſideration and Examination of their Hearts and
Ways, their Slips and Deviations from their Holy Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and making their Accounts even with God, and en-enjoying
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49614:7"/>
his Favor (for as we ſpeak in our Temporal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
<hi>That often and even reckoning makes long Friends;</hi>
ſo without queſtion, this is the beſt way to keep friendſhip
with Heaven) and humbling their Souls before God, in a
ſenſe of their own Sins and Tranſgreſſions: And then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
the wickedneſs of the Nation they live in, and
ſupplicating God for pardon; and more eſpecially, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth their Souls in fervent and frequent Devotions
both publick and private, in Reading, Meditation and
good Conference, in renewing of their Vows and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
with God, reſigning themſelves up to their Lord
and Maſter, the ever Bleſſed Jeſus; and participating of
that Bleſſed Feaſt, the Sacrament of the Body and Blood
of their Crucified Saviour, there receiving the Pledge,
Seal and Aſſurance of the pardon of their Sins, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
and Love of God, and from that Bleſſed Feaſt of
<hi>Eaſter,</hi> that time of <hi>Jubile,</hi> run with Alacrity and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of Heart (like the Sun in his Courſe) that Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Chriſtian Race, the end whereof will be an eternal
weight of Glory; which will as far exceed all our
Thoughts and Hearts, as it now exceeds our Deſerts.</p>
            <p>Now, when theſe things are duly conſidered, none I
hope will cry out with <hi>Judas,</hi> What means this Waſt?
for can we take too much of wiſe, ſober, ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
about our eternal Concernments (the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Buſineſs of our Lives?) And although good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
do this at other times alſo, eſpecially before they
approach the Holy Sacrament; yet, why not now alſo,
more ſolemnly and ſeriouſly, together with holy Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
and Faſting joyned to it, (which adds advantage to
our Prayers) as it did to the Prayers of <hi>Cornelius?</hi> And ſome
Men may poſſibly be poſſeſt by long cuſtom in Sin, ſuch a
ſtubborn Devil, who will not out without Prayer and Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Mark 9. &amp; 29.</hi> And by this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49614:7"/>
means make this time highly Advantageous to us, for the
promoting of Piety in our Souls, and making Religion not
only our Profeſſion, but, eſpecially at this time, our Trade;
which, indeed, ought to be the great Buſineſs of our
Lives, our greateſt end and deſign we drive in the
World.</p>
            <p>Let us all now conſider, That God Almighty, by his
extraordinary Providences, calls upon us to be ſerious,
when the <hi>Cedars</hi> fall, and thoſe who are his Vicegerents,
and are Stiled by him, <hi>Gods on Earth do dye like Men;</hi>
when he hath ſignified his Diſpleaſure againſt us for our
great Sins and Provocations, and hath bereft us (as it
were) of the Light of our Eyes, and the Breath of
our Noſtrils; deprived us of our late Gracious Sovereign,
the beſt of Princes: But yet nevertheleſs <hi>(in midſt of
Judgment remembring Mercy)</hi> hath richly again ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
that great Loſs unto us, which nothing (but the
furniſhing us with ſuch a Juſt and Gracious Prince we
now have upon the Throne) could have made up to us;
a Prince who hath often (when a Subject) hazarded his
Life for our Honor and Defence; and hath freely, of
his own good Will and Pleaſure, given us ſuch great
Aſſurance of Confirming to us the preſent Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
both in Church and State; ſuch a Prince (as, I
have read, <hi>Plato</hi> diſcribes) <q>Under whom we may expect
true Quietneſs and Remedy from all Evil; in whom, by
Divine Ordinance from above, there meeteth in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the Right Majeſty of a King, and the Mind of a
Wiſe Philoſopher, to make Vertue Governeſs and Ruler
over Vice: for Men (as he ſpeaks) ſeeing the true I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of Vertue in their Prince, and in the Example of
his Life, do willingly grow to be wiſe of themſelves,
and do fall in love, liking and friendſhip unto it, and do
uſe all temperance and juſt dealing.</q> And thus the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49614:8"/>
Goodneſs, by the intermixing of Judgment and
Mercy, deſigns to break our ſtony Hearts, and ſeems to
ſpeak to us (as he did once to the People of <hi>Iſrael) Oh! that
there were ſuch a Heart in them that they would fear me,
and keep all my Comandments always, that it might be well
with them and with their Children for ever, Deut. 5. 29.</hi>
And therefore, have we not great Reaſon now to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and to conſider our Ways and Doings, all our great
Sins and Provocations, and to abhor our ſelves in Duſt
and Aſhes for the ſame; eſpecially, in conſideration of
that national Guilt that we lie under; which cries aloud
againſt us to Heaven?</p>
            <p>Let us ſeriouſly conſider, that general great Contempt
of God and Religion, which ſo much abounds in the
Nation; as if we had loſt that natural inſtinct of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
(if I may ſo call it) that Senſe of God, which the
Law of Nature hath impreſt upon the Minds of all
Men. Oh! the Atheiſtical Diſcourſe, of wicked Men,
which we meet with in every place, their prophane
Merriment, drolling upon God and Religion, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures; as if Men were reſolved to defie their
Creator, and to hunt and chaſe God and all Religion out
of the World? What a general, moſt audacious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Divine Laws, with a high hand, as if we
had no dependance on him, and were not his Creatures,
and our breath in our Noſtrils; the great Contempt of
his Miniſters and Meſſengers, the Reverend and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Clergy of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> although our
Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi> The great
Contempt of his publick Worſhip and Service among us,
as if he were an Idol, and not the Living God. Alas!
if we look into our Churches, may we not ſee (nay,
how can we but ſee) in moſt of them, the Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Deſolation, as I may call it; either horrid ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49614:8"/>
in our Geſtures and Behaviour there, in thoſe
Sacred places, rather many times like people at a play, than
at their Devotions, trifling with the things of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
or may we not ſee many times, the publick
Worſhip and Service of God in the Churches, Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and Performed almoſt to the very bare walls of the
Church, attended by the Poor, the Halt, the Blind and
the Lame? a few of the meaneſt of the People; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if there be no Sermon to Attend and Sanctifie the
Solemnity; and yet there being ſo many people among
us, who have their time lying ſo upon their hands, that
they know not well how to diſpoſe of it: But this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
was, I conceive, much occaſioned from erroneous
and wicked Principles and Opinions of our late times of
Uſurpation, as that we were not obliged to give God
the worſhip of the Body as well as of the Heart; and that
it was very ſcarce, if at all, the Worſhip of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Sermon to attend it.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider ſeriouſly, thoſe horrid Sins of Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt our Governors, ſpeaking evil of Dignities,
our Seditions and Rebellions againſt our Sovereign Prince;
and the ſad and diſmal Conſequences of the ſame, in
the late times of Uſurpation; the Depoſing, Dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Murdering of the Lord's Anointed, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Royal Family to infinite Dangers and Hazards;
the Deſtruction of thouſands; the Devaſtations, Miſery
and Ruine of the whole Kingdom. Let us conſider,
with Horror and Amazement, the Inſolence and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
of thoſe Rebel Saints, whoſe very beſt pretences
were a more deſperate Affront, both to Government and
Religion, than perhaps any Age or Hiſtorian can paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel;
but whoſe worſt Practices were villainous, not only
beyond Example, but Belief; as a late worthy Author
hath obſerved: which Crimes (it is much to be feared)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49614:9"/>
are not yet expiated, although forgot; but cry aloud to
Heaven for Vengeance; eſpecially, conſidering how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there have been among us in this Nation, who were
ſo far from Repenting of the ſaid horrid Villainies, that
they owned and avowed thoſe very Principles of Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Diſloyalty, which promoted and were the cauſe
of the ſame; and with audacious Impudence, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many ſteps onwards in the ſame Path of Diſloyalty,
and towards the perpetrating of the ſame Wickedneſs
again.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider alſo, of our Pride and Wantonneſs
in Religion, our running greedily into Errors, Hereſies
and Schiſms, with the Conſequences of them; Hatred,
Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Sedition, Envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Murthers; the loſs of true Religion, Peace and
Unity: and how we have by this means cloathed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
(and that which ſome would call the Proteſtant
Religion) in a deformed Dreſs, in a Fools Coat; made
it Ridiculous, yea, Loathſom to all ſober and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Perſons in the World.</p>
            <p>And therefore, now to make us ſenſible of the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the late times; and eſpecially, conſidering there is
a generation riſen up ſince, who are many of them igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the ſame; I ſhall make a ſhort Scheme, Draught
and Repreſentation of the Riſe, Progreſs, Fruit and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Fanaticiſm and Schiſm. We may underſtand,
That there was a happy Reformation of Religion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
and compleated in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
of Bleſſed Memory, by the Wiſdom, Moderation and
Judgment of our Wiſe Reformers, the Reverend, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Pious Divines, the Biſhops and Clergy of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> in Convocation Aſſembled; who
propoſed to themſelves the keeping of the Golden Mean,
Reforming no farther from <hi>Rome</hi> than was fit, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49614:9"/>
and commendable; and indeed, no farther reced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Rome,</hi> than ſhe had receded from her ſelf,
and from Antiquity; and therein doing no more than
what had been the deſires of many others, famous and
worthy Men, who nevertheleſs lived and died in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of that Church; and what was thought upon
good grounds, That other Parts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> would
have attempted and effected, if they could have had a
lawful Oppertunity and Authority for the doing thereof,
as we had in <hi>England.</hi> In ſhort, as the Worthy Dr.
<hi>Fearn</hi> truly ſtates the Caſe of our Reformation in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
               <q>We (ſaid he) had juſt Cauſe to Reform, and
ſo had our Adverſaries, the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> We, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
did what we ought; if they had done what
they ought, and had cauſe to do, no breach or diviſion
had followed. And further: We, in doing what we
ought, preſerved the Faith entire together with Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
they would neither caſt off their Errors, which
clogged and corrupted the Faith, nor retain, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
but cut us off (as much as in them lay) from the
Catholick Church: So that it is clear (ſaith that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Author) to whom the Diviſion muſt be imputed.</q>
Now we muſt underſtand, preſently after the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this happy Reformation of Religion, in Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, there aroſe a diſcontented and diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
Faction, although curb'd and kept under by her,
called a while after <hi>Puritans,</hi> which were (like Mothes
in a Cloth, eating and fretting the ſame) continually
murmuring againſt the ſaid excellent Reformation; find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great fault with Government, Liturgy, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Biſhops and Governors of the Church; inſtead
of being thankful to God for the ſame, and of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and chearful Subjection (as good Chriſtians ought)
to this Excellent Conſtitution. Yea, the ſaid Faction
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49614:10"/>
did proceed to repine and complain againſt the ſame, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to Conform to it, and ſo continued to do all King
<hi>Jame</hi>'s Reign; abuſing the Favor and Indulgence of that
good Prince, granted to them in the Conference at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>-Court;
increaſing and growing more numerous, by
their pretences to Piety and Purity of Religion, with their
frequent Sermons and Lectures (then ſuperſtitiouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the Main, if not the All, of Religion; and then
alſo, very much perverted and abuſed to promote Faction
and Diſcontents againſt the Eccleſiaſtical Government)
until at laſt, growing to a Head, about the middle of
the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, they then arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to the height of Boldneſs and Inſolence; and by the
means of that black Parliament, 1640. (in the Choice
of whoſe Members of the Houſe of Commons, that
Faction had a great hand) together with the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of their Brethren, the <hi>Scots;</hi> they became like an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
and overflowing Flood, and carried and bore down
all before them in the Nation: And, as the only pious
and godly People, and true Proteſtants, fit to Rule and
Govern the Kingdom, that Parliament (having by impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
and ſpecious Pretences, obtained of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
a Confirmation for their ſitting as long as they
pleaſed) boldly then managed a War and Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their Sovereign: and when by this means, this
Nation (not to mention <hi>Ireland)</hi> had lain divers years
weltering in Blood (God in juſt Judgment upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſuffering them to proſper in their Wickedneſs;)
they then ſeized into their hands all the Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
the Revenues and Lands, the Jewels and Goods of
the Crown, the Supports of the Royal Dignity; depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and moſt barbarouſly Impriſoning their Liege Lord
and Sovereign, <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of ever Bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
(who then flying to his own Country-men,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49614:10"/>
the <hi>Scots,</hi> for Protection, was ſold, and Betrayed by
them) and retaining Him in Priſon in <hi>Carisbrook</hi> Caſtle
in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> not ſuffering Him to enjoy ſo
much as one of his Servants or Chaplains to Attend
Him: Then alſo forcing into Baniſhment the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
to live upon the Charity of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks;
and what ſome Loyal Subjects in <hi>England</hi> ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
over to them, with the peril of their Lives.
That Faction, then further proceeded on, to overthrow
the Government of the Church; to caſt out Prelacy, as
a piece of Popery; totally diſſolved all Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
ſacrilegiouſly ſold all Church-Lands and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues;
alſo caſting off, as Popiſh and Antichriſtian, the
Holy Feaſts and Faſts of the Church; as <hi>Chriſtmas,
Eaſter,</hi> &amp;c. turned Churches into Stables; alſo in the
mean time, all-a-long, miſerably debauching and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Chriſtian Sound Doctrine; (as that wiſe Prelate,
Arch-Biſhop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> charged them with, long before,
in his <hi>Survey of the Holy diſcipline.</hi> His words are
theſe; <hi>That the Puritans did pervert the true meaning, both of
Scripture and Fathers, to ſerve their own turn;)</hi> eſpecially
in theſe particulars following: Not to mention that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
of God's deſigning from all Eternity the greateſt
part of Mankind to deſtruction, merely from the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of his Will; a Doctrine highly diſhonourable to
the Divine Majeſty. Firſt, That we are ſaved by Faith
alone; when yet they ſaw this was ſo interpreted, as
if they did define Righteouſneſs by the ſole Opinion or
Perſwaſion of the Mind, and did ſeclude good Works.
That we are juſtified by the imputation of Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
to us, as if we had fulfilled the whole Law
our ſelves, and that we are cloathed with this Garment of
our Elder Brother, and ſo accepted. That the <hi>Apostle</hi>
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the <hi>7th</hi> of the <hi>Romans, 14 verſe,</hi> to the end
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49614:11"/>
of the Chapter, ſpeaks of himſelf in his Regenerate
State, and not as unregenerate, (the braveſt Cordial for
an Hypocrite, that poſſibly could be.) That we are led by
the publick Authority of the Spirit of God in his Word,
common to all Chriſtians: Hence ſaith every Sect, is
the Word of God Pure and Sincere, according to the
Senſe of the Holy Spirit. That nothing is to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in, or about the Worſhip of God, but what there
is a direct Rule, and Direction for, out of the Scriptures;
that all things muſt be according to the Pattern in the
Mount. That, provided we give God the Worſhip of
the Heart, it matters not whether we give him bodily
Worſhip. And that, bowing in the Church and Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God and Chriſt, is Idolatry, or at leaſt Superſtition
and Will-Worſhip. That Forms of Prayer are unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
or at beſt, to be uſed as Crutches to ſuch as are lame,
and cannot pray without them. That Schiſm and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are very venial Sins, if Sins at all; laying ſuch a
ſtreſs upon Preaching, (as to uſe the word of a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner,
upon his coming into <hi>England)</hi> That our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was turned into All Preach, Nothing but Preach; as
if reading of the Scriptures, Prayers, Thankſgiving
and Praiſing of God, could not be the main of the
Worſhip of God, except it were accompanied with a
Sermon. Moſt abominably neglecting to Celebrate the
Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, for ſeveral years
together in many places; diſcouraging and ſcaring
Men from their Duties therein, by Preaching. That
Kings and Princes are intruſted by the People; and when
they failed in their Truſt, the People might fail in their
Duties to them; and reſiſt and oppoſe them, and call
them to an Account for their breach of Truſt; and, at
laſt, lawfully depoſe them. Theſe with many others, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
among them; thus they prophaned all that was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49614:11"/>
Sacred: And further, proceeding and proſpering in their
Wickedneſs, they fell ſoon after at variance among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
(many other Factions ariſing out of the former)
eſpecially one great Faction, called <hi>Independents;</hi> who
then ſcuffled, with their Elder Brethren, the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
for the Government, (abominating <hi>Presbytery</hi> as
much or more than <hi>Epiſcopacy)</hi> got into their Hands,
by the Aſſiſtance of the then Army, who (by Force)
kicked their Maſters, the <hi>Parliament,</hi> out of Doors,
(That Aſſembly being then juſtly puniſhed by <hi>God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi>
in the ſame kind that they had ſinn'd themſelves,
by the Inſolence and Rebellion of their own Servants
and Souldiers) and only about Forty or Fifty profliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Villains of the then <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> the ſaid
Army's Creatures, ſuffered to Sit and Vote in the <hi>Houſe
of Commons,</hi> were declared, by the Power of the Sword,
to be the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the Repreſentatives of
all the People of <hi>England:</hi> By which pretended Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but contrary to all Law, Juſtice, and Reaſon, yea,
Common Senſe, they proceeded to the full height of
their Villainy, (moſt impudently, under pretence of Law,
and for the Security of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and of
the Godly Party, and the <hi>Liberty of the Subject)</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulled
Kingſhip, arraigned their Soveraign Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their pretended <hi>High Court of Juſtice;</hi> condemned
and executed him moſt barbarouſly, before the Gate of
his Royal Palace of <hi>White-Hall;</hi> ſold all the Jewels of
the Crown, all the Crown-Lands and Revenues: and,
having made his Loyal Subjects <hi>Delinquents,</hi> forced them
to compound for their Eſtates, and ſold the Eſtates of
many of them. In ſhort, thus kill'd, and took Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
and all this abominable Wickedneſs was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under the Shew and Face of <hi>Religion, Godlineſs,
Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Right.</hi> But, as One well obſerves; <q>One
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49614:12"/>
of the greateſt Tragedies acted in the Life of Man,
(which makes Curious Perſons to queſtion, Wiſe Men
to wonder, Good Men to groan, and the Wicked to
Rejoyce) is, To ſee an Innocent Man oppreſſed by
Colour of <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
               </q> But a while after, the ſaid two
Grand Factions, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> (thoſe
Brethren in Iniquity) falling again together by the Ears,
they very ſoberly and ſeriouſly killed one another, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at <hi>Dunbar</hi> in <hi>Scotland)</hi> where Thouſands of the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> were ſlain by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and his Army;
ſome of whom (as I was, at that Time, credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed)
in cold Blood, and after Quarter given, and the
Fight over. And afterward, innumerable Factions more
ariſing out of the former every Day, having run down all
Church-Government whatſoever, and every Body being
left to the Liberty of his own ignorant wanton Mind
(and Conſcience, as they call'd it) every Man was left
to do what was <hi>Right in his own Eyes,</hi> (there being
no <hi>King in Iſrael)</hi> there was nothing but Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
among them; (ſaving that, by a long Sword held
over them, they were reſtrain'd from killing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.)
All the Reverend Prelates of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and moſt of the Orthodox Clergy, then reputed
and accounted either <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or <hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected: Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
that worthy Man, Dr. <hi>Couſins,</hi> Dean of <hi>Durham,</hi>
who was forced to fly into <hi>France;</hi> who being ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
was therein reſolutely defended by Monſieur <hi>Dailee,</hi>
the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>-Miniſter at <hi>Charenton</hi> by <hi>Paris;</hi> who
writes thus over into <hi>England:</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Tuus Coſins, imo noſter
admodum probatur; Beſtiae ſunt, &amp; quidem Fanatici, qui

Fanaticks, who count Dr. <hi>Couſins</hi> a <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
               </q> Thus they
were (good Men) grievouſly perſecuted and driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Priſons, Dens, and Holes, or forced into Baniſhment.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49614:12"/>
Yet, of all our worthy Prelates, in midſt of their great
Sufferings, and Baniſhment among <hi>Papiſts,</hi> I have heard
of none of them, who ever deſerted the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in her forlorn Condition, but only Dr. <hi>Goodman,</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter:</hi> 
               <q>Who (as Biſhop <hi>Gauden</hi> relates it)
was, it ſeems, by extremity of ill Uſage, driven beyond
his Pace, and ſomething beyond his Patience: For,
thus provoked beyond all Meaſure and Merit, (as he
thought) by thoſe, who much profeſſed Reformation,
(and yet much, in his Senſe and Experience, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and deſtroy the Church of <hi>England)</hi> it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if, dying and dejected, he choſe rather to depart
in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which (as <hi>Iſaiah)</hi>
he thought now decayed, and diſſolved at leaſt.</q> In
this deſperate State of the Church and Kingdom, at laſt,
(to compleat this lamentable Tragedy) that Monſter,
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> did aſcend the Throne, and took upon him
to be Lord Protector.</p>
            <p>Thus, in ſhort, (as a worthy Author expreſſeth it)
<q>When a Flouriſhing Nation had been embroyled in a
bloody War, and as vertuous a Prince as ever ſate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Throne, had been Murther'd and Martyr'd, an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd
Church had been Plunder'd and Diſſolv'd,
and Fellow-Subjects had been enraged againſt each
other, with implacable Zeal and Cruelty, and ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into numberleſs Schiſms and Factions.</q> And, (as
the Pious and Learned Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> hath obſerved)
<q>When the Declination of Chriſtian Practice was, at
laſt, ſo great among us, as to tear up the very
Root and Foundation, all Natural Moral Juſtice and
Honeſty; and, in place thereof, to ſet up a New
Body of <hi>Carneades</hi> his Philoſophy, inſtead of the old
Heathen dry Principles of Integrity and Uprightneſs,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49614:13"/>
that one Law of Intereſt and Paſſion, and Self-Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
So that, (as <hi>Machiavel</hi> thought) Religion
would emaſculate and enfeeble Common-wealths. We
have more reaſon to complain, (ſaith he) That it hath
debauched and corrupted Lives;—That Chriſtian
Men are the impureſt Part of the World; That <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>'s
after-game hath proved more lucky and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
to him, than his firſt Deſignment did; That
his Night-walks hath brought him more Proſelytes,
than his unlimited Range of going up and down, to
and fro, over the Face of the Earth; That, as Sin
by the Law, ſo <hi>Sathan</hi> by the Faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath
taken occaſion, and ſo deceived and ruined us more
deſperately, more univerſally, than by all the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
Idolatrous Cuſtoms of Heatheniſm he hath been
able to do.</q> And let us ſeriouſly conſider, That all
this complicated Maſs of Wickedneſs, (not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd
under the Sun) was committed and done in the
Face of the World, by thoſe who ſtiled themſelves, and
would needs be accounted the only <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Things being brought to this Concluſion and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot;
What an eaſie Perſwaſion might prevail with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and conſidering Honeſt-hearted Men in Exile, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to abandon and renounce this <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion,
as a Religion to be abhorred by all Men; as being as
oppoſite to the true Chriſtian Religion, and what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
(in truth) was profeſſed by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as Darkneſs was to Light? And a great part, if
not all this Miſchief, aroſe, and was carried on (as I
humbly conceive, with ſubmiſſion to better Judgments)
from a furious and mad Antipathy and Averſeneſs againſt
<hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Papiſts;</hi> which made them to imagine they
never could run far enough from <hi>Rome,</hi> until they came
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49614:13"/>
to <hi>Munſter:</hi> Where I will leave them, with their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-<hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
(if all ſuch who are oppoſite to <hi>Rome</hi>
muſt be <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as of late many in <hi>England</hi> would
have made them, and that by a Law alſo.) But, Alas!
theſe abominable and horrid Impieties, what honeſt and
pious Heart can ſeriouſly conſider of, and not diſſolve
into Tears; and humbly and affectionately beg of <hi>God,</hi>
not to lay theſe Sins to <hi>England</hi>'s Charge; but to
wipe out the Guilt thereof from the Nation? More
eſpecially, conſidering what a loud Cry innocent Blood,
yea, the Blood of <hi>The Lord</hi>'s <hi>Anointed,</hi> hath to Heaven
for Vengeance; eſpecially upon <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> and ſuch as
retain the fore-ſaid wicked Tenents and Principles,
which were productive of all the ſaid Villainies.</p>
            <p>Let them further ſeriouſly conſider Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own
Words, in his laſt <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> pag. 30. cited
by a Worthy Author: <q>Nothing (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter)</hi>
that I know of, in the World, doth ſo ſtrongly tempt
ſome ſober Conſciencious Men, to think <hi>Popery</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the Concord of Churches, and a violent Church-Government
neceſſary to our Peace, as the woful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the Errors and Schiſm; the mad and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
Sects, that ariſe among thoſe that are moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them.</q> To which purpoſe, the Worthy Dr.
<hi>Parker</hi> (ſpeaking of the <hi>Phanaticks</hi> endangering Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ſeveral ways) ſaith thus: <q>I know no other
grounds of Fear or Danger from them, unleſs this
may prove one at laſt, That by their wanton and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
Peeviſhneſs to the Ingenious and Moderate
Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they give their
Governours too much Reaſon to ſuſpect, That they
are never to be kept in order by a milder, and more
gentle Government, than that of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
and force them, at laſt, to ſcourge them into better
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49614:14"/>
manners, with the Bryars and Thorns of their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us further conſider ſeriouſly, the abounding of
Debauchery and Wickedneſs among us at this Day,
which can portend nothing but Miſchief to us; the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Oaths, Blaſphemies, and Curſes, that continually fly
about our Ears, almoſt in all Companies, and in every
Place, more or leſs; yea, as we paſs along the Streets,
enough to amaze us: What abounding in Swiniſh Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs
and Exceſs? How have our Times curiouſly
ſtudied to find out variety of Liquors, to make an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
Sacrifice thereof to <hi>Bacchus?</hi> What Fulneſs of
Bread, and Idleneſs? what Intemperance, Gaming, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,
and Laſciviouſneſs; and the Conſequents of
theſe, Quarrelling and Duelling? having, as it were,
loſt the Senſe of Good and Evil, our very Natural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
and Shame, we are become impudent and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
in Sin. And, which is moſt ſad to conſider, theſe
are thoſe Rotten Bones, (as one hath well obſerved) which
would lie hid under the Painted Sepulchre of Honor:
Theſe ſome would make the Accompliſhments of a
Gentleman. The Learned Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> obſerves,
<q>That many irrational Sins, through ſome Local cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,
have gotten the Reputation, not only of ſinleſs
and lawful, but of laudable alſo; as Duelling, and in
favour of Sins of Uncleanneſs: whereby it is become
a more creditable thing among us, To have been guilty
of defiling and invading another Man's Bed, than to
be the Innocent Perſon which hath been thus robb'd
by the Adulterer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Let us conſider ſeriouſly of theſe things, (as
a Divine of our own hath well obſerved) <q>How that
<hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> are apart, and by themſelves,
the moſt deſperate and dangerous Cauſes of Miſery,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49614:14"/>
and Calamity, and Ruin to Mankind: And that,
when ever they ſhould combine Intereſts, and joyn For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
what Government can withſtand their Fury; in
that there is no Wickedneſs, that is neceſſary to the
carrying on the Cauſe, that they will not undertake?</q>
Do we not therefore ſtand in great need of <hi> Sober and
Serious Conſideration, </hi>and of humbling our Souls before<hi>God </hi>in Duſt and Aſhes, for all theſe before-mentioned
Abominations, and making our Peace with an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Majeſty; and, by frequent and fervent Devotions,
imploring his Mercies, and, in the Language of our<hi>Church </hi>upon<hi> Aſh-Wedneſday, </hi>ſay;<hi> Almighty and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi>God,<hi> who hateſt nothing that Thou haſt made, and
doſt forgive the Sins of all them that are Penitent; Create
and make in us new and contrite Hearts, that we, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
lamenting our Sins, and acknowledging our Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
may obtain of Thee, the </hi>God<hi> of all Mercy, perfect
Remiſſion and Forgiveneſs, through </hi>Jeſus Chriſt<hi> our Lord?</hi>And further, to enlarge our Devotions to<hi> God; That
He would pleaſe to bleſs and proſper our Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Lord, the King's Majeſty, and his Gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,
and all the Royal Family: That He would furniſh
his Majeſty's Royal Heart with Wiſdom, to go in and out
before this great People, committed to his Charge by the
Supreme </hi>Lord<hi> of all the Kings of the Earth: That </hi>God<hi>would ſupport and ſtrengthen him under that great Weight
of Government, that now lies upon his Shoulders, in the
Governing of a Licencious People, very much tainted with
with Schiſmatical, Seditious, and Wicked Principles; which
can be no pleaſing Task for any Prince to undergo: That</hi>God<hi> would be pleaſed to direct and guide his Counſels,
and cloath his Enemies with Shame and Confuſion; and,
That upon his Head his Crown may flouriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:49614:15"/>
And, in the next place, abhorring that which is evil,
let us cleave to that which is Good; for, I hope, we
need not be exhorted, not to be again Authors of our
own Ruin: And that, as we cannot be ſo ſenſeleſs, but
abominate the horrid Crimes afore-mentioned, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
deſire our own Welfare and Happineſs; ſo to lay
aſide all Murmuring and Diſcontent, all Schiſm and
Faction, all Sedition and Rebellion, to yield all Loyal
and Faithful Subjection, to Our Gracious Sovereign, <hi>the
Lord</hi>'s <hi>Annoynted;</hi> according to the Pure and Sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Principles of Chriſtianity, of our <hi>Mother,</hi> the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> whoſe true Sons have (as one
ſpeaks) been ever found by Experience, to be Cordial
Friends to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> and which Church,
is the greateſt Example of Loyalty, that perhaps ever
appeared in the Chriſtian World: unto whom, let us
ſubmit our ſelves, as the worthy Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
us; His words are theſe; <q>Uniform Obedience
is due from us, to the Commands of that Church,
wherein we were born; the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
which of all others, in the Chriſtian world, hath
moſt adhered to the univerſal Church of the firſt, and
pureſt Ages.</q> Let us Conform our ſelves therefore, to
this beſt Conſtituted Church in the World; who hath
kept to that Excellent Rule, <hi>Quod ſemper, quod ubique,
quod ab omnibus receptum fuit;</hi> and adhered to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and true Antiquity. Let us live peaceable and
quiet Lives, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty; and adhere
to our Holy Chriſtian Religion in all things; and make
our Religion the great Buſineſs of our Lives: For, <hi>Inter
Chriſtianos &amp; Gentiles non tantum fides debet, ſed etiam
vita diſtinguere;</hi> we ought to be diſtinguiſht by our
Lives and Converſations, as well as by our Faith and
Profeſſion: For this is moſt certain, That true Piety,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49614:15"/>
Vertue and Goodneſs, Integrity, Humility, Loyalty, and
Peaceableneſs, are the moſt proper Fruits and Effects of a
well-inſtructed pure Religion, of a ſound Faith and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion.
As it is therefore, doubtleſs, the Great Intereſt of
Princes, to Protect, Countenance and Support the true
Religion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> which is repleat with nothing
but Humility, Fidelity, Juſtice, Wiſdom, Moderation,
Temperance, Sobriety, Subjection, Loyalty, Peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Unity, Love and Charity: So, alſo, it is their great
Intereſt, to take care to propagate among their Subjects,
good and ſound Principles of Religion, Subjection and
Loyalty: and to that end, That there be a total Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of all erroneous and ſeditious Books and Diſcourſes;
and that together with the Sacred Scriptures, and good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſms,
there might be permitted none but ſound Tracts
of Practical Divinity, well, and wiſely compoſed, to come
into the Hands of their Subjects; according to which, there
ſhould alſo be conſtant Means, of inſtructing all Men by
Preaching; but more eſpecially, the Youth and younger
ſort, by frequently Catechiſing them: This being well ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
it were no matter, what became of a many Tracts
of Religion currant amongſt us, if they were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Flames; which do but diſtract and diſturb
(many of them) miſlead, if not poyſon, Peoples Minds
with bad Principles: and by thoſe means (in time) there
might be made a happy Reformation of Men's Minds
and Manners.</p>
            <p>Let us in the next place conſider, That it is the great
Intereſt of Subjects, to Copy out the <hi>Holy Chriſtian
Religion</hi> in their Lives and Converſations; and then
moſt of our great Complaints would without queſtion
ceaſe; all Diſorder and Confuſions be no more heard
of in the World: If Men, whom the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> hath
differenced from Beaſts, by Rational and Immortal Souls,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49614:16"/>
would not lay aſide their Manhood, their Reaſon, and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
into Beaſts, and be led and hurried by their Senſes,
Appetites, and Paſſions. They might, therefore, eaſily
be perſwaded to entertain, what would certainy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
their True Happineſs and Intereſt; the Excellent
<hi>Religion</hi> of the Holy <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> it being the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of God, in ſending his <hi>Son</hi> into the World, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Welfare and Happineſs of Mankind, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole World. And can any one, not void of all
common Reaſon or Senſe, think that ever God gave us
Wiſe, and Underſtanding, Vigorous and Active Souls,
merely to animate Human Bodies; to Eat, and Drink,
and Sleep to gratifie our Senſes, our brutal Parts; to
provide only for our Bodies; to be mere Senſualiſts and
Epicures; and to acquire and heap up Riches? Doubtleſs,
our Noble, Excellent and Immortal Souls were given
us for more noble and excellent Employment and End;
to be raiſed up above theſe things, to be buſied, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with the Contemplation of God, of our Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Creator,</hi> his Excellencies and Perfections, and all his
wonderful Works; to Adore, Love and Honor Him in
all that we are or have; <hi>That whether we Eat or Drink;
or whatſoever we do</hi> in Word or Deed, <hi>we ſhould do
all the Praiſe, and Glory of God;</hi> and in all things,
to be regulated by his <hi>Laws.</hi> Now ſhall we forget God,
and be more degenerate, than the Beaſts which Periſh:
<hi>For the Ox knoweth his Owner, and the Aſs his Maſter</hi>'s
<hi>Crib?</hi> To come more cloſe to us, We, that own our ſelves
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> do we believe the Religion we Profeſs?
If we do; why, doth it ſignifie ſo little to us, as
it doth? Why, do we not live ſomewhat anſwerable to
it? Or, if we do not believe it, Why do we own the
Profeſſion? Either we muſt be guilty of abominable
Hypocriſy, or, of Atheiſm and Irreligion: And once
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49614:16"/>
take away Religion, and the Senſe of God out of the
World; you do, as it were, take the <hi>Sun</hi> out of the
Firmament; you take away, the Diſtinctions of <hi>Good</hi>
and <hi>Evil,</hi> bring your ſelves to be Beaſts, wallowing in
all manner of Filthineſs and Senſuality: You reduce the
World, into its firſt <hi>Chaos</hi> of Confuſion; deſtroy the
Happineſs of Man; overthrow all Rule, Order, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Peace in the World. It hath been found, by
univerſal Experience, in all Ages of the World, the
great Peace, Happineſs and Proſperity, which hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
riſen to the World from Religion; and the true
lively affecting Senſe of God and Obedience to his <hi>Laws,</hi>
from the Exerciſe of Vertue and true Goodneſs. And that
on the contrary, when Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed;
that Mens Luſts and Paſſions quickly diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the World, and overthrew the publick Peace of States
and Kingdoms; brought in War, Miſchief, Blood and
Ruine, turning a Fruitful Land, into a Barren Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
For how is it poſſible that ſuch men, as are unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to God, ſhould be True and Loyal to their Sovereign,
his Vicegerent upon Earth? That ſuch as are men of no
Religion, men of no Principles, and walk by no Rule,
but are Slaves and Drudges to their Appetites and Luſts,
ſhould ever, in time of Danger and Tryal, ſtick faſt to
the Crown and Government, and perform the Duties of
Loyal and Obedient Subjects, and dye for their Prince.</p>
            <p>And, as for ſuch among us, as have been led away, by
the ſpecious Pretences of Fanaticks, in the ſimplicity
and honeſty of their Hearts, into the Schiſm and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(as I make no queſtion, there have been ſome) let
your Eyes be now opened, and behold the proſpect of
your Folly, into which, you have been miſerably ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by your Leaders and Guides; and, as you tender
your own ſafety, to withdraw from the <hi>Tents</hi> of <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49614:17"/>
that State of Schiſm and Antichriſtianiſm, as the
Ancient Fathers accounted it. Come out of this <hi>Babylon,</hi>
and renounce, with Abhorrence, all Seditious and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Tenents and Opinions; all diſloyal Principles and
Practices whatſoever, and return into Communion of
your Mother, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> For however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Ignorance, heretofore, might extenuate your
Crimes; yet now it will not, when, it will certainly be
no leſs, than Sin againſt Knowledge and Experience;
it will be wilful and affected Ignorance, ſhutting your
Eyes againſt clear Evidence and Demonſtration; which
will no more excuſe you (notwithſtanding, your pretences
of Conſcience) than it did the <hi>Jews,</hi> in Crucifying our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;</hi>
or thoſe that killed the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> becauſe their wicked
Conſciences told them, That therein they did God good
Service. And it cannot but be matter of great wonder, that
after ſuch clear and evident Diſcovery and Detection, of
the abominable Hypocriſie and Wickedneſs of <hi>Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm,</hi>
That ever there ſhould remain any one among
us, at this day: Thoſe, therefore, that ſtill remain ſuch,
muſt needs be looked upon, as having moſt proſtituted
and malicious Souls; who are in Judgment, given up to
a reprobate Mind; whoſe end is Deſtruction, as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi>
ſpeaks. And it is a matter of great wonder, That
there are ſo many in our days, ſtill to remain ſo ſottiſh;
as when they make uſe of the Rules of Prudence and
Diſcretion, in all their other Concernments; yet as to
their greateſt Concernment, their Immortal Souls: they
lay them aſide, and every, or, any pitiful Schiſmatick
and Impoſter; or any piece of Folly, Ignorance, Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs,
and Ignorance muſt ſerve their turn, be the
Director and Guide of their Souls: and yet, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
they will profeſs to believe, That Miracles are cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the <hi>Church.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49614:17"/>
To perſwade us all now to learn to be Dutiful and Loyal
<hi>Subjects,</hi> to our Prince and Liege Lord the King, our Gracious
Sovereign; Let us conſider, (as one of late hath well obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<hi>That the Worth, Excellency and Providence of a Prince,
are not ſufficient to make a Kingdom or Nation Happy:</hi>
His <hi>Subjects,</hi> ought to Contribute their Proportions alſo
to it. Let us, therefore, abhorr and deteſt, and caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
thoſe <hi>Seditious Principles</hi> of the late times; That we
may do <hi>Evil,</hi> that <hi>Good</hi> may come; and That a lawful
Prince, may be withſtood and reſiſted, when-ever they
themſelves ſhall judge, that <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> is invaded
or in Danger. For, when theſe dangerous Opinions prevail
among <hi>Subjects,</hi> in what Circumſtances muſt needs that
Prince be, when-ever an Opportunity offers it ſelf, our
late times have ſufficiently verified by plain Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
Let us entertain therefore, in our Minds, the Honeſt
Chriſtian, Loyal <hi>Principles</hi> of the Church of <hi>England:</hi>
Let us be obedient Sons unto Her: Let us be of humble,
peaceable and complying Tempers; for this is an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
Truth, That it is a far leſs Crime, to commit
an Error on the right Hand; that is to ſay, in a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Compliance with juſt and lawful Authority, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
thereby, <hi>Order, Government, Peace</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity:</hi>
Than, on the left; that is to ſay, to commit an Error,
in diſobedience to juſt Authority: in this ſence, it may
be well ſaid, <hi>Melius eſt Humilitas in malis, quam Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia
in bonis:</hi> For, as the firſt proceeds from Humility
and dutiful Subjection to Authority, and is the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of publick Order, Government, Unity and Peace;
wherein, the Welfare of Mankind, principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in this World: So, the other, is the product
of Pride, Preſumption and Inſolence; and over-turns
all <hi>Government, Order</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> in the World; and
brings in nothing but Diſturbances, Strife and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49614:18"/>
Rebellion, Blood and Ruin: and in ſhort, if Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
would be Loyal, Kingdoms could not be miſerable.
But, I would not herein be miſunderſtood, to plead for
Sin in any caſe, for the obtaining the greateſt good; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though,
a <hi>Heathen</hi> once ſaid, <hi>Iniquiſſimam pacem, juſtiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo
bello antefero;</hi> he preferr'd an unjuſt Peace, before a
moſt juſt War: But this, I am confident of, We cannot be
innocent, when-ever we diſobey a juſt Authority; except,
the unlawfulneſs of the thing commanded, be as clear
and apparent, as our Duty of Obedience is. And for
my own part, I would chuſe rather to run to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
extent of what is lawful; before I would refuſe
Active Obedience to a juſt and lawful Authority, either
in Church or State: and I think I have the Holy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<hi>Religion</hi> on my ſide, to juſtifie me herein. And I
am ready to think alſo, that according to this Rule, all
our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks</hi> will be Tryed one day at
the <hi>Great Tribunal;</hi> when their Proud, Ignorant, Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
and Froward Conſciences, ſhall be no excuſe to
them.</p>
            <p>It doubtleſs, therefore, very much concerns us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
ſeriouſly of the great danger there is in thoſe no
ſmall Sins of <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> to ſuch, as are really
and truly ſuch. And we are more eaſily deceived in theſe
kind of Sins; in regard, <hi>Satan,</hi> herein, is notably tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into an Angel of Light. And ſuch Perſons, who
are not ſo eaſily tempted to Intemperance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery,
yet, herein greedily ſwallow down his Baits;
and ſpiritual Pride, that is ready to attend ſuch Men, as
are free from Debauchery and Prophaneneſs, many times
helps forward the Temptation; likewiſe the greateſt
Hereticks and Schiſmaticks that ever were in the World,
have had very fair outſides at leaſt; I mean, of good and
pious Converſations. How much therefore, doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49614:18"/>
us to have a great Care of that Sin, that attends ſuch
as are poſſibly otherwiſe good Men; but, nevertheleſs,
of all Vices, is one of the greateſt and moſt pernicious:
For (as one well ſaid) <q>Whereas all other Vices proceed
from ſome ill in us, ſome ſinful Imbecility of our Nature,
This alone,ariſeth out of our good Parts.</q> Now to let
us know, what theſe Sins are, <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaketh thus
in his <hi>Inſtitutes;</hi> 
               <q>They are called <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi>
who, making a Diviſion, do break in ſunder the
Communion of the Church, which, is contained in
two Bonds, <hi>viz.</hi> The Agreement of true Doctrine,
and Brotherly Love; whereupon St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (ſaith
he) putteth this difference between <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> and
<hi>Hereticks;</hi> becauſe the latter, <hi>viz. Hereticks,</hi> corrupt
with falſe Opinions the ſincerity of the Faith; and
the former, <hi>viz. Schiſmaticks,</hi> even where there is like
Faith, do break the the Bond of Fellowſhip.</q> But
yet, we are farther to conſider, to make an <hi>Heretick;</hi>
There muſt be not only frror in <hi>Intellectu,</hi> but, <hi>Pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia
in Voluntate;</hi> not only Error in the Underſtanding,
but Obſtinacy in the Will; for as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaketh;
<hi>Qui ſententiam ſuam, quamvis falſam atque perverſam, nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae
pertinaci animoſitate defendunt; quaerunt autem cauta ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitudine
veritatem, corrigi parati cum invenerint, nequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
ſunt inter Hereticos deputandi:</hi> They that do not
pertinaciouſly and ſtubbornly defend their erroneous and
corrupt Opinions; but with great Care and Ingenuity
ſeek the Truth, are ready to ſubmit unto it when they
find it, theſe are not to be reputed in the number of
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> ſo true is that ſaying, that no truly good
Man, can be an <hi>Heretick,</hi> although he may be in an
Error.</p>
            <p>And to back what I have ſaid, and to convince
you of the Danger of Hereſie and Schiſm, let me
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49614:19"/>
preſent before you, in brief, what the Worthy and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſpeaks in his Treatiſe of <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
               <q>There is (ſaith he) no one Vice, which hath fallen
under ſo much of the Diſpleaſure, and Correption, and
and ſevereſt Diſcipline of the Holy Fathers of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church, as this of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and the Ingredients
and Preparatives to it, have done. They judged,
That it was contrary to the Faith, even when it had
not, in reſpect of Doctrinal Points, any Hereſie joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it: That it was contrary to Charity; yea,
contrary to all the Advantages, that belong to a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church. <hi>Quiſquis ab Eccleſia ſegregatus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteriae
jungitur, a promiſſis Eccleſiae ſeparatur,</hi> St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian.</hi>
Whoſoever is ſeparated from the Church, is
joyned to an Harlot; he is ſeparated from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<hi>God</hi> hath given to his Church, from the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of Prayer, and the Sacraments: That it was as
bad as Hereſie, according to St. <hi>Chryſoſtom:</hi> That
there was never any Hereſie in the Church, which
was not founded in it: That conſtantly it is forced,
in its own Defence, to conclude in ſome Hereſie or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
All which, being put together, will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
(as the ſaid Author ſpeaks) to keep Men from
being in love with the Guilt or Company of <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</hi>
But (ſaith he) It is further branded with
theſe Super-additions of Terror, That there is ſcarce
any Crime ſo great, as Schiſm: <hi>Non eſſe quicquam
gravius Sacrilegio Schiſmatis,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin. Ingens flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
Schiſmatis Traditioni junxerunt,</hi> Optat. No Crime
ſo great; not Idolatry, not Sacrilege: That it hath
been under the peculiar Mark of <hi>God</hi>'s Indignation,
as in Caſe of the Ten Tribes, and of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>
who are ranked with the <hi>Gentiles, Matth. 10. 5.</hi> and
ſo in the Story of <hi>Core:</hi> That it is the <hi>Anti-Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49614:19"/>
mentioned by St. <hi>John. Ab Eccleſia qui ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
Haereticus eſt, &amp; Antichriſtus,</hi> Proſper: He that is
a Separatiſt from the Church, is an <hi>Heretick</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</hi>
The worſhipping and ſerving of the Devil,
<hi>Ignatius.</hi> And, in a word, ſo great a Crime, that it is
not expiable by Martyrdom, to him that continues in
it, and hath not repented, and returned from it. Much
more of this Subject, is every where to be met with
in the Antient Monuments; and nothing of Alleviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be had for any, who have not the Excuſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary
Seduction of Error, or Simplicity, to plead
for them: And the ſureſt way to do that effectually,
to qualify them for that Plea, is, To forſake their
Courſe, to get out of that ſo dangerous a Snare. Nay,
it is further obſervable, how unſafe it hath been deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by theſe, for light and inconſiderable Cauſes, to
break this Unity; it being very hard, if not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
to receive ſuch an Injury, or Provocation, from
the Governours of the Church, as may make a Rupture
or Separation excuſable: And for the truly <hi>Catholick</hi>
and Univerſal Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is not, in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>'s
Opinion, poſſible, that there ſhould be any
juſt Cauſe for any to ſeparate from it; nor conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Apology to be made for thoſe, that on any (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
true or falſe) pretended Cauſe whatſoever, have
really incurred this Guilt. From which Premiſes, thus
acknowledged and undeniable, the Concluſion follows
irrefragably; That it is not the Examination of the
Occaſion or Cauſe, or Motive of any Man's Schiſm,
that is worth the producing or heeding in this Matter:
The one thing that is of force and moment, and, by
Conſequence, pertinent to be enquired into, is, The
Truth of the matter of Fact, whether this Charge be
ſufficiently proved, or confeſſed; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Whether he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49614:20"/>
that is thus accuſed, ſtands really guilty of Separation
from the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And he further deſcribes this Sin of <hi>Schiſm:</hi> 
               <q>It is
(ſaith he) a voluntary dividing, or a ſeparating or
receding of any Member, from the Unity of the Body,
<hi>(i. e.</hi> The Church of <hi>Christ);</hi> and ſo, that the <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick</hi>
is he, that divides himſelf from the Church of
<hi>God,</hi> not that is cut off, or ſeparated; he that goes
out, and with-draws, or recedes of his own Accord,
not he that is caſt out by the Governours of the Church.
But the Offender, or guilty Perſon; who is therefore
ſaid to accuſe, to caſt, to condemn himſelf, throwing
himſelf, by his voluntary Receſſion from the <hi>Church,</hi>
into that very Condition, into which the Adulterer,
and obſtinate Offender is caſt by the Cenſure of the
<hi>Church.</hi>
               </q> And the ſaid Worthy Author concludes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
with this Caution:</p>
            <p>
               <q>But how deſirable and valuable ſoever, an entire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
Peace with all Chriſtians, with all Men, (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Approbation of our willing, cheerful
Obedience, and Submiſſion of our Judgments and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
to our Superiors) muſt for ever be deemed by
all true Diſciples of <hi>Christ:</hi> Yet muſt not the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace
of this Treaſure be attempted by the Admiſſion
of any Sin, any more than the Glory of <hi>God</hi> might be
projected by the Apoſtle's Lye.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much I thought fit to Tranſcribe out of this
Worthy Author. To which I may further add Mr. <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabon</hi>'s
Excellent Rule, (taken out of St. <hi>Cyprian, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.
69.</hi> as it is ſet forth by a late Author of our own)
<q>That whenſoever the Pious People adhere to their
lawful and true Biſhop, they are <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Church;</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that whoſoever ſeparates himſelf from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
it cannot be doubted, but that he is not in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49614:20"/>
the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </q> Theſe things deſerving the moſt ſerious
Conſideration of all Men; but more eſpecially, of our
<hi>Diſſenters;</hi> who have very much Guilt of this ſort
lying upon them, it is very much to be feared. As
for their Pretences of Conſcience, St. <hi>Bernard</hi> will An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
them; <q>
                  <hi>Non est Conſcientia ſine Scientia, nec verae
ſi caeca:</hi> It is not Conſcience, without Knowledge;
nor can it be true, if blind and ignorant.</q> For, if
Pretences of Conſcience, that is to ſay, Men's ſtubborn
and perverſe Minds, (at the beſt, their Weakneſs, and
and affected Ignorance) muſt juſtify, and bear them out
againſt <hi>God</hi>'s Law, againſt Lawful Authority; then
it will be no matter, what becomes of the Laws of <hi>God,</hi>
when their Conſciences muſt command, and bear Rule
againſt them: and thoſe who killed the Apoſtles, becauſe
their Conſciences told them, That therein they did <hi>God</hi>
good Service, ſhall be acquitted at <hi>God</hi>'s Tribunal at
laſt. It therefore much concerns all our <hi>Fanaticks</hi> to
beware, and be aſſured, That (without Repentance)
their Damnation ſlumbereth not: if poſſibly they eſcape
<hi>God</hi>'s Judgments, even in this Life; which, it is much
to be doubted, they will not; eſpecially, when the Sin
hath become, in great part, General and National: For
particular Perſons are to expect their Judgment and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
in the other Life; but Nations, Kingdoms,
and Societies of Men cannot then be puniſhed as ſuch,
as our Divines hold. And, in conſideration of the great
miſchief and danger in Schiſms, and Rents among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
I mean, ſuch as profeſs to own that Name, in
the Chriſtian World: May we not, therefore, well Pray
earneſtly to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> as our Mother the Church
of <hi>England</hi> directs us, for the Good Eſtate of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
Church; <hi>That it may be ſo guided and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by</hi> God's <hi>Good Spirit, that all who profeſs, and call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49614:21"/>
Chriſtians, may be led into the way of Truth, and
hold the Faith in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Spirit, in the Bond of Peace,
and Righteouſneſs of Life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot poſſible therefore favour of a Chriſtian Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
or Temper, to be of peeviſh, froward, contentious
Spirits; but to ſtudy Peace at Home, in the Church we
live in: And, in the next place, it is doubtleſs our great
Duty, as Chriſtians, not to be wid'ning the Chriſtian
Church's Wounds abroad; but rather, earneſtly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
if poſſible, to heal them, to promote the Peace
and Unity of <hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> That all ſober Chriſtians,
throughout the World, might be united together: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
(in regard of the Luſts and Paſſions of Men,
and that there are ſo few ſincere and true Chriſtians
in <hi>Chriſtendom)</hi> it ſeems to be a Work next to impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to be effected; although, indeed, all good Chriſtians
could willingly joyn with that Worthy Man, who ſaid;
<q>Who would not be ready, with the loſs of his Life, to
Redeem and free Chriſtianity from that horrid Scandal
of <hi>Diſcord</hi> and <hi>Diſſention?<bibl> Mar. Bucer.</bibl>
                  </hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Differences among Chriſtians in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World, I heartily wiſh, they were leſs than they
truly are at this Day: But this is moſt certain, That
by their Paſſions and Animoſities, on all Hands, they
are made greater than they truly are; when we all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in the main and principal Foundation of our <hi>Faith,</hi>
contained in the <hi>Three Creeds;</hi> that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the
<hi>Athanaſian,</hi> and the <hi>Nicene Creed.</hi> This, one would
think, ſhould make us more kind and treatable one to
another; eſpecially, not to damn one another to the
Pit of Hell and Deſtruction, as too many do. But in
this reſpect, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by their Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſhew themſelves to be the better Chriſtians; who,
to their Honor, abound in Charity to their bitter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49614:21"/>
the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and allow unto them a poſſibility
(though not without Difficulty) of Salvation in their
Communion; who yet have nothing in return for their
Charity, but Hereticks and Damnation: But certainly,
they very weakly and abſurdly argue from it, That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ſafeſt for us to go over to them. Juſt as if
I being in a tyte, well-built, and ſound Ship, ſhould
leave it, and go over into an unſound and leaky Veſſel;
upon this preſumption, That poſſibly I may, (with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
and danger) come ſafe to Land in the ſame. But
certainly, we may better argue with them, and ſay,
Amend the apparent Leaks and Faults in your Veſſel;
and if there be any Faults in ours, we are willing to
amend them alſo; that we may both with ſafety, and
in Chriſtian Love and Unity, accompany one another in
our Courſe for the Celeſtial Port; which we both por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
to intend, and aim at. And to this purpoſe, let me
preſent you with what the Worthy Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio
Medici,</hi> ſpeaks to this purpoſe:</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have not (ſaith he) ſo ſhaken hands with thoſe
deſperate <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> (meaning the <hi>Romaniſts)</hi> who
had rather venture at large, their decayed bottom.
than bring her in, to be new Trim'd in the <hi>Dock:</hi>
who had rather promiſcuouſly retain all, than abridge
any; and obſtinately be what they are, than what they
have been; as to ſtand in Diameter, and Swords point
with them—And then ſpeaking of the <hi>Reformation,</hi>
he ſaith; As there were many <hi>Reformers,</hi> ſo likewiſe
many <hi>Reformations</hi>—ſome angrily, and with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity;
others calmly, and with Mediocrity, not
rending, but eaſily dividing the Community, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an honeſt poſſibility of a <hi>Reconciliation;</hi> which,
though peaceable Spirits do deſire, and may conceive,
that Revolution of Time, and the Mercies of God
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49614:22"/>
may effect: yet that Judgment, that ſhall conſider the
preſent <hi>Antipathies</hi> between the two Extreams, their
Contrarieties in Condition, Affection and Opinion,
may with the ſame hopes expect an Union in the <hi>Poles</hi>
of <hi>Heaven</hi>—It is, ſaith he, as uncharitable a point
in us, to fall upon thoſe popular Scurrilities and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious
Scoffs of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> whom, as
to a Temporal Prince, we owe the duty of good Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
I confeſs, there is cauſe of Paſſion between
us; by his <hi>Sentence,</hi> I ſtand Excommunicated: <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
is the beſt Language he affords me: yet can no
Ear witneſs, I ever returned to him the name of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi>
Man of Sin, or Whore of <hi>Babylon:</hi> It is the
Method of Charity, to ſuffer without Re-action. Thoſe
uſual <hi>Satyrs,</hi> and <hi>Invectives</hi> of the Pulpit, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
produce a good Effect on the Vulgar; whoſe
Ears are opener to <hi>Rhetorick</hi> than <hi>Logick:</hi> yet, do they
in no wiſe confirm the Faith of wiſer Believers, who
know that a good Cauſe needs not be patron'd by Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
but can ſuſtain it ſelf upon a temperate Diſpute.</q>
The true Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> conſider this,
and that Paſſion and unnatual Heats and Tranſports, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
do advantage a <hi>Good Cauſe;</hi> and that Uncharitableneſs
and much more Cruelty, is unworthy and unbecoming
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and therefore, avoid them. But Alas! their
Adverſaries, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> (as if they were faultleſs, and
had not given juſt Occaſion of Offence) Retort in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
nothing but <hi>Damnation</hi> and moſt bitter <hi>Reproaches:</hi>
yea, brutiſh <hi>Revenge</hi> and <hi>Cruelty;</hi> which diſingenious
Dealing, how much it hath been to their <hi>Reproach</hi> and
<hi>Diſhonor,</hi> to the diſadvantage of their <hi>Cauſe,</hi> in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World, I ſhall leave them ſeriouſly to conſider:
For honeſt and ingenious Souls, are not to be impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by <hi>Club-Law,</hi> to receive for Articles of Faith, ſuch
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49614:22"/>
Doctrines and Opinions, which have no <hi>Foundation</hi>
from the Scriptures, and the Antient and Primitive
Church.</p>
            <p>Alas! The great Diſorder and Confuſion, that is upon
the face of the <hi>Chriſtian World,</hi> at this day, is not to be
ſo much wondered at; if we conſider, the <hi>Corruption,</hi>
the <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> which abounds in the Hearts of moſt
Men in the World, which corrupts all things: Why
therefore, ſhould it not in proceſs of time (as it did
among the very <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves) corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave
the Holy and Pure <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
eſpecially, in time of Proſperity (that like Sun-ſhine
Weather, corrupts moſt things ſubject to Corruption,
even the very Humors of our Bodies) and breed
Abuſes in the <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi> Plenty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
ſtrangely prevailing upon Men's Minds, yea,
ſometimes the beſt of Men; to corrupt them with Pride,
Idleneſs, Covetouſneſs: And by this means, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> came to be debaſed; to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
both in Doctrine, Worſhip and Government, and
ſo to degenerate from its primitive Purity and Integrity;
and was made uſe of, as a Means and Inſtrument of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
Honor, Splendor and Riches; and of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thoſe great Vices of Pride, Covetouſneſs, Idleneſs,
and Luxury: and this inſtead of making Men Virtuous,
and Good, and rectifying their Lives, and Directing
them in the <hi>Ways of Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> conducting them
to <hi>Heaven.</hi> Thus, I humbly conceive, from the <hi>Pope's
Primacy of Order,</hi> aroſe the Supremacy of Juriſdiction;
and from thence, <hi>Papal Tyranny,</hi> packing of <hi>General
Councils,</hi> corruption in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
other Miſchiefs to the <hi>Church;</hi> the great dividing
and endangering <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and laying it many times
in War and Blood. And on the other hand, how this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49614:23"/>
               <hi>Holy Religion</hi> of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S Chriſt</hi> hath been miſerably
corrupted and abaſed, by <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks?</hi>
how hath it been made abſurd and ridiculous to all the
World, by their Pride and Folly, their ignorant Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
Peeviſhneſs and Animoſities? Who (out of a
mad blind Zeal againſt <hi>Popery)</hi> never could think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſafe, and far enough ſeparated from <hi>Rome,</hi> until
they fell into <hi>Religious Frenſy;</hi> yet, would then not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
account themſelves <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> yea, the
beſt of <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> and what a long train of diſmal
Conſequences there followed the ſame, the World can
witneſs, and more eſpecially of late Years, we in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as you have heard before. Oh! may I therefore
exhort us again, to bewail our Follies, and abandon
them! to Renounce all <hi>Schiſm, Contention, Fanaticiſm,</hi>
that Plague of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and living vertuous and
good Lives; and in Conformity and Subjection to our
<hi>Mother, the Church of England,</hi> her wholeſom and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Conſtitutions. Oh! Let us learn this moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
Duty from our Adverſaries, the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi>
who, are very Reſpectful towards their <hi>Eccleſiaſtical
Governors,</hi> and very Conformable to the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi>
of their <hi>Church;</hi> and abhor to do any thing that may
prejudice the Order, Peace, and Welfare of the ſame,
in any kind (for which I cannot but have a great reſpect
for them, and in which, I ſhall endeavour to follow their
Example in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> wherein I was born,
and for ſo doing they cannot, I hope, juſtly blame me.)
And although they are poſſibly led by a blind Obedience,
or Impicit Faith, as we call it, and are thereby many
times miſled: yet their fault, ariſing from a diffidence of
themſelves, and obedience to their Superiors, will be
very pardonable, (eſpecially of ſuch as are born and bred
in that Communion) it being a fault on the Right-hand,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49614:23"/>
and far leſs than what our Fanaticks, and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are guilty of; who out of Pride, Ignorance, and
Preſumption, refuſe Subjection to the Spiritual Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
which <hi>God</hi> hath ſet over them; and thereby break
the Unity and Peace of the <hi>Church.</hi> Let us therefore
heartily pray, as our Mother the Church teaches us:</p>
            <p>Almighty God, who ſheweſt to them that be in Error
the Light of thy Truth, to the intent that they muſt return
into the Way of Righteouſneſs: Grant unto all them that
are admitted into the Fellowſhip of Christs Religion, that

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude, and ſay, <hi>ſufficit tentaſſe;</hi> Let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
I have done my Endeavour in a good Cauſe.
For certainly, if the Promotion of the Honour of
<hi>God,</hi> the Advancement of True Religion and Vertue;
if the Promoting of Loyalty and Fidelity, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Happineſs of my Gracious Sovereign; if
the Deteſtation of Errours, of Atheiſm and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Vice, and Wickedneſs, of Fanaticiſm, Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
Schiſm and Rebellion, and repreſenting them in
their proper colours; if promoting the Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as now by Law E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd,
(the beſt Chriſtian Church in the World) of
Piety and Unity amongſt all her Members; if promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Peace of Chriſtendom, and more eſpecially the
Honour, Happineſs and Proſperity of this Nation; yea,
of all his Majeſties Dominions; I ſay, if the honeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of the ſame, be a commendable and worthy
Deſign, it is all I intend in the Writing, and now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Publick theſe (although ſudden) yet ſerious
Thoughts. Therefore I hope I may meet with a pardon
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49614:24"/>
for the meanneſs, and unworthineſs of the performance
to ſo good an end. And as for any one that ſhall find
fault with my weak and unworthy management, of ſo
worthy, ſo good a Cauſe, it is no more than what I do
my ſelf. Let him but be pleaſed to undertake the Cauſe,
and manage it better, and I aſſure him, I ſhall be ſo
far from being offended with him, That I ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
well pleaſed and rejoyce therein, and return him
my thanks. And it is yet my Hopes, this Eſſay may
animate and encourage eminent and able Champions
in ſo worthy a Cauſe; which, without doubt, is the
moſt excellent, moſt honourable, moſt worthy, the
beſt in the World, and merits the aſſiſtance of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
Heads, Pens, and Tongues that are extant among
us.</p>
