            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

high eſteeme, as the perfit loue of friends. How many great Potentates haue, in their inwarde thoughts, preferred the loue of ſome eſpeciall one in their pleaſures to ſolace with, and in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to participate with in all paſſions both of body and minde, to be as a ſecond ſelfe!</p>
            <p>Such is the effect of Loue, that many haue hazzarded life, and what euer the earth did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord them in theyr loue, to make it knowne.

            <p>Oh rare loue, oh kingly and royall preſident for all people to note, what hath happened ſince the ſixteenth of Iuly now laſt paſt, the day of this famous King of Denmarks firſt arriuall in <hi>Tilbery Hope,</hi> where he was entertayned, and brought from his Ship with his chiefe delight our dread Soueraigne, and the Prince, louingly welcomed by the Queene and States, and ioyfully receyued by all their Subiects, who with duty and zeale, made it knowne in all the beſt manner ſo ſhort time would giue leaue; yet ſuch it was, as his Princely minde was much delighted in the ſame, and no doubt doth applaude this hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Citie, both for beawtie, wealth, and pleaſure: a moſt excellent note and honorable appearance of his gracious acceptance of their loues ſhewed, may be gathered, by his ſodaine and ſilent comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in perſon to view the ſtate of this Citie, and rare monuments thereof, who hauing ſeene it the laſt of Iuly in all royaltie, the Citizens in their rich attyre, the houſes garniſhed, and ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of people of all eſtates, in this manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing came to view it.</p>
            <p>The next day being Friday, and the firſt of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, this royall King, knowing the zeale and loue of our Nation, whoſe loyaltie he neede not diſtruſt, accompanyed with the Earles of Nottingham, Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, and others, in their Coaches came to S. Paules Church, where he walked, and viewed the ſame, and from thence, to the top of the Steeple, where he
<pb facs="tcp:713:5"/>
tooke much delight to behold the beautious ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of London, the pleaſant Gardens and Fields adioyning, the richnes of the Thames, ſo ſurniſhed with Ships of great countenance and worth, as he graciouſly applauded the excellency thereof. But amongſt all other things, he admired moſt, when the noble men accompanying him, did report the being of a Horſe vpon that place, comming vp ſuch a way of great danger and ſo <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ye, that he tooke very good notice thereof, and wonderfully did admire the ſame.</p>
            <p>From thence he tooke his Coach with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and paſſed on to the Exchange, viewing the beauty of Cheape-ſide, and the riches of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, the Goldſmiths, Mercers, and other wealthy trades, all the way ſetting their commodities to ſale: A ſight which may delight any Prince in the world to behold.</p>
            <p>To grace this Royall Exchange, ſo named by our late Royall Queene, his Grace walked round about the Pawneaboue, and viewed with great pleaſure the ſame. Then came hee to the Marchants walkes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, where it was told his Highneſſe the maner of our Marchants, and the houres of their meetings, where from all Countreys there was dayly newes to be heard by one meanes or other: Heere they make great exchanges of their Marchandize, make their traffike to forraigne Countreyes, ſhip their men for ſeruice; ſo that their greateſt affayres were euery day twice there effected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:713:6"/>
There-hence proceede they by Cornchill, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtreete, and Fanchurch, to the Tower of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where our gracious Soueraigne, his deare eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Brother King <hi>Iames,</hi> met his Highneſſe, and with Kingly welcomes entertayned him, and in his owne perſon conducted him to the offices of the Iewell houſe, Wardrope, of the Ordinance, Mint, and other places, where, to their Kingly preſence, in the Iewell houſe were preſented the moſt rare and richeſt Iewels, and beawtifull Plate, ſo that he might well wonder thereat, but cannot truly prayſe, or eſtimate the valew thereof by many thouſands of pounds.</p>
            <p>The like in the Wardrope, where, for rich Robes, beſet with ſtones of great price, faire and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pearle and Gold, were ſuch, as no King in the world might compare: Beſides the rich furniture of hangings, cloathes of eſtates, Cuſhions, Chaires, and Kingly furniture for his Palaces, as may cauſe much admiration, and bring great content to the beholders</p>
            <p>But paſsing then on to the office of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he well viewed the warlike prouiſion of the great Ordinance, which at an houre is ready for any ſeruice to be commaunded. Ouer euery peece the Ladles and Spunges hang to lade them withall: and the Traces and Collors for the Horſes to draw them away, when they ſhall need to ſerue.</p>
            <p>The armory and ſtore of ſmall ſhot ſo well main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and kept, the numbers ready fitted of all ſorts
<pb facs="tcp:713:6"/>
of Muskets, Caliuers, Petronels, Dags, and other ſeruiceable weapons, as Pikes, Halbards, Targets, Sheelds of ſundry faſhions, for varietie, antiquitie of the things, and the relating of their vſes, did make him with great and honorable admiration to behold them all very well, and commend them.</p>
            <p>Theſe rare, rich, and moſt admirable pleaſant ſights ouer-gone, their Maieſties aſcend to the Mint, which they viewed, and from thence to the Lyons, and other wilde beaſts there kept and maintained for his Highneſſe pleaſures and paſtimes, all kingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and ſuch varietie, as I thinke the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring in one Countrey more ſtore, as it hath bin noted by many great Trauellers, who haue ſeene the greateſt Courts of the world.</p>
            <p>From this place, as they went to take their Barges, the King of Denmarke walked a turne or two vpon the Tower Wharfe, viewing the rich and forcible Ordinance there placed, whereof there was no ſmall ſtore, as his Maieſtie might well remember, by the honorable peale was made him the day before, at their ſetting forwards from the Tower, to goe through the Citie.</p>
            <p>When their pleaſures were well delighted with theſe ſhowes, the Tide ſeruing to ſhoote the Bridge, they tooke their Barges, and were rowed to his Maieſties Houſe, White Hall. At their going from the Wharfe, an honorable peale of great Ordinance was diſcharged, the Officers vſing great diligence and foreſight, and the Gunners applying themſelues
<pb facs="tcp:713:7"/>
very paynefully for the performance thereof, the time being ſo ſhort, as truly they did all deſerue great commendations.</p>
            <p>This day brought with honor to end, they repoſe themſelues this night, and in the morning very earely, being Saturday, they hunted in the Parke of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and killed a Bucke.</p>
            <p>Then paſſed they on to <hi>Hyde</hi> Parke, where they hunted with great delight, ſpending the reſt of the forenoone in following their paſtime, and about the time of dinner returned, and there dyned; and about foure a clocke, their Barges being by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement ready at the Priuy ſtayres, they went by water to Greenewitch.</p>
            <p>The next day, being Sunday, her Maieſty was churched, to the great ioy of all the beholders, the two Kings being preſent at that time, where they heard a learned Sermon.</p>
            <p>This day they ſolace in their priuate delites, the Kingly Brothers, the Queene, Prince, and Nobles of both Realmes, ſhewing by all the meanes they can, their loues, by variety of delight to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe time, and bid them welcome.</p>
            <p>On Munday, the fourth day of Auguſt, the Queene, who had not beene partaker of any their Kingly ports, accompanyed their Royall perſons, and the Prince, who were attended on by the Nobility, and gallant Courtyers, at which time, their ſport was to run at the ring; in following which, they ſpend that afternoone, where ſundry of the young Noblemen
<pb facs="tcp:713:7"/>
prooued their skill at that exerciſe, but none exceld his Maieſty, and the Denmarke King, at whoſe good ſucceſſe the Queene was very much delighted, and tooke great pleaſure therein.</p>
            <p>The next day, being the ſolemne obſeruation of his Maieſties thankſgiuing for freeing his Highneſſe from the treacherous practiſes of the <hi>Gowryes,</hi> the forenoone of that day they ſpent in thankefulnes to God, whereof his Maieſtie hath a moſt religious and zealous care. The afternoone, for their delight, were the Beares and Bulls brought, in which ſport ſome time was ſpent, but made the ſhorter, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the honorable exerciſe of Tilting: the Lords and Courtiers being readie armed, vpon notice giuen them, repayred to the Tilt-yard, euery one with his ſeuerall deuice, moſt gallantly mounted, and richly armed.</p>
            <p>To honor this royall preſence the more, the King of Denmarke armed very rich, and mounted on a moſt ſtately Courſer, came to the Tilt, and ran eight courſes, the firſt foure with the Lord of Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingam, whobrake their ſtaues moſt gallantly, three a peece, and foyled the other. Then the noble and moſt toward Earle of Arundell ranne with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of Denmarke, and brake three ſtaues a peece, to the great ioy of all the beholders. Then follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the reſt of the Tilters as they were appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo gallantly behauing themſelues, as was both honorable and delightfull to that moſt gracious and royall companie. Night growing vpon them, they
<pb facs="tcp:713:8"/>
were enforced to giue ouer their ſport, where, taking their humble leaues of the two Kings, the Queene, and Prince, they left the Tilt yard, and being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, returned to the Court, where, beſides for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer graces, and fauours ſhewed them by all their royall perſons, they receiued many thanks, and ſo ſpent the reſt of the euening in other delightfull ſport, till time of night called them to reſt.</p>
            <p>At this honorable exerciſe, the toward and moſt hopefull Prince ſhewed himſelfe in his Armour, beeing gallantly mounted, and a hart as powerfull as any, though that his youth denyed ſtrength. For this dayes exerciſe, all the Maſters of Defence and profeſſors therof, were ſummond with their weapons to ſhew their skill, that the King of Denmarke might ſee the manner of our fight, and the varietie of weapons practiſed for mens defence, as well in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate quarrels, as their Countries ſeruice: but the time ouerſlipt, the Challenger Fencers, when they had marched with their Drums and Ancients about the Tilt yard, departed.</p>
            <p>The next morning, the King of Denmarke being deſirous to ſee ſome of their practiſe, they which were readie in the Towne, hauing warning to giue their attendance, in the morning early repaired to the Tilt yard, and there, in preſence of the two Kings, many of the Nobilitie and Courtiers, ſhewed both manhood and skill, wherein the Kings tooke great pleaſures, and gaue them Kingly thanks and fauours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:713:8"/>
This ſport was made more ſhort, by reaſon of the Kinges going from Court, to ſee our Kinges Houſes neereſt <hi>London,</hi> and to hunt in their Parkes: After they had broken their faſtes, they ſet forwarde with their Traynes to <hi>Richmonde;</hi> there that night they hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and lay: and the next day dyned at <hi>Hampton</hi> court, and there hunted, and killed Deate, with great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: And ſurely the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> was very much delighted, with the gallantneſſe of theſe royall Pallaces of his Maieſties; as did appeare by his earneſt noting of them, and often recounting of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes and pleaſures.</p>
            <p>From thence, they proceeded to <hi>Windſore;</hi> where he was entertayned by the King, moſt royally: heere was preſented vnto him, the Knights of <hi>Windſore;</hi> beeing all goodly Gentlemen, and ſuch as had ſerued Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in her Warres; and for ſeruice done, preferred in their latter yeares, to this place of reſt: and are called by name of, <hi>King Iames Knightes of Windſore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe goodly auncient Gentlemen, beeing in their Roabes of Purple and Scarler, with the Garter, and <hi>Sainct Georges</hi> Croſſe vpon them.</p>
            <p>Which goodly, and charitable maner, when the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> was poſſeſt withall, and the order of their firſt foundation, and continuance, the King highly commended the Founder, and in cha<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itie wiſht, the ſucceſſors to the worldes end, might continue ſo hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an action as that: whereof, by Gods grace, there is no doubt, his Maieſtie from his firſt comming,
<pb facs="tcp:713:9"/>
hauing ſo graciouſly and moſt bountlfully ſhewed his zeale to that honorable action, by augmenting their portions, which were poſſeſt of thoſe places.</p>
            <p>Long did they not make ſtay in <hi>Windſor,</hi> by reaſon that the time began to ſhorten, for the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markes</hi> departure, wherefore after ſome time ſpent in hunting, they ma<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e their returne to the Court at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where her Maieſtie lay: and on Fryday, the eight of Auguſt there ariued, and ſo reſted till Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dav following.</p>
            <p>The next morning then, being Saterday the ix. of Auguſt, the tyde ſeruing fit for their purpoſe, this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and royall King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> being now to take his farewell of thoſe he helde in eſteeme; with great curteſie, and many thankes, to thoſe of the Counſell, and Nobilitie, which ſtayed from following the Kings hee gaue them a Princely and moſt louing farewell: and ſo of many others of Honour and Worſhip, with many rich and bountifull Rewardes to the Officers of the Kinges Houſehold, and Guarde.</p>
            <p>Which done, the Barges giuing their attendance, theſe two Royall Kinges, the Queene and Prince <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> came aborde them; and were rowed by all induſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous meanes downe the Riuer of <hi>Thames,</hi> ſo low as <hi>North-fleete,</hi> or there aboutes; where they had their Trayne attending, and their Coaches: ſo paſſed they on the way to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> leauing the way to <hi>Graueſend:</hi> all the way followed with ſuch numbers of people, as well from <hi>London,</hi> as other places, that it was to be wondered at.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:713:9"/>
Time hath brought them neare the Citie of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;</hi> where they are met with the Mayor and Bretheren of the Citie, who with reuerence, deliuered his Mace vnto his Maieſtie; which graciouſly did accept the ſame, and redeliuered it to the Mayor, willing him to keepe it, and to vie it with Iuſtice, as before: Which done, the Mayor taking his Footecloth-Horſe, which was ready, and rode on before his Maieſtie, bearing the Mace before him throughout the Cittie, to the houſe of the Right worſhipfull <hi>Sir Peter Bucke</hi> Knight, one of his Highnes Officers of the Nauie: which houſe was the lodging of the king of <hi>Denmarke:</hi> whom our King there left to his repoſe, and returned himſelfe to the Houſe of the reuerend Byſhop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> Doctor <hi>Barlow:</hi> and the Queene &amp; Prince to their Lodgings, which were all ſeuerall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>The next day, being Sunday, which Holy appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted day of the Lord, their Maieſties came to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrali Church the Colledge, where they heard a moſt learned Sermon, by a reuerende graue and learned Doctor.</p>
            <p>The Sermon ended, their Dinners prepared aborde the Shippes, and their Boates and Barges attending them. They ſette forwardes to the Waters ſide, where euery Officer in his place, ſerued: the Right Honourable Earle of <hi>Nottingham</hi> Lord High <hi>Admy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> beeing preſent, Sir <hi>Robert Manſell,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Treuor,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>The King had a Note deliuered him, contayning
<pb facs="tcp:713:10"/>
the names of euery Shippe, what burthen they weare, and what Munition and Men they had: which Note, his Highnes obſerued, and viewed euery Shippe as they rowed alongſt, keeping their way, vntill they came to the Shippe, prepared for them to dine: which Shippe was perfumed with ſweete and pleaſaunt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume, and hanged with Cloth of Golde all the ſides within: wherein three Chaires of Eſtates was placed, for the two Kinges, and Queene.</p>
            <p>The dinner was furniſhed with all kinde of Daintie prouiſion, in ſuch aboundaot manner, that the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> marueyled where ſuch ſtore of meate ſhould be dreſſed: And to ſee the manner of it, his Maieſtie tooke occaſion, after dinner, to goe vppon a ſpacious Gallarie made vpon Lighters, betweene the two royal Shippes the <hi>Elizabeth Ionas,</hi> and the <hi>White Beare;</hi> neere which two Shippes, ridde a great Hulke, which was furniſhed with Ouens for Baked meates; and had in it three faire Ranges to roaſt with: all which, his Maieſtie in perſon ſaw; and thorowout that Shippe, went from place to place, noting euery roome.</p>
            <p>The time paſsing away, the Kinges tooke their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, accompanied with the Queene, Prince, and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and rowed on towardes <hi>Chartham,</hi> where they had ſight of all the Shippes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which were rich in Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes, Pendants, Hagges, and Streamers: and withall, ſo furniſhed with goodly Men, as might ioy their Maieſties to beholde: All which, made ſo glorious a ſhow, that might well amaze the miode of a man to thinke on, being a Friende; but torrifie the heart of the
<pb facs="tcp:713:10"/>
proudſt Enemie, to ſee it.</p>
            <p>When their Maieſties had viewed the whole Fleete, they were rowed to the ſhore; where on a Hill, very conuenient, they might ouer-looke the whole Nauie, there was ordayned places for them: When being ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the word giuen, euery Shippe, in their due courſe, diſcharged orderly their whole Ordinaunce, in ſuch order and forme, the one Shippe after the other, as was greatly pleaſing to their Maieſties; and gayned great credite to the Gunners, performets of that ſeruice. The great Shot then diſcharged, was two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred, beſides the Health at dinner; which was begun with Shot, and anſwered.</p>
            <p>This welcome moſt Honorably performed, the Kinges gaue the Lord high <hi>Admyrall,</hi> and the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers thankes, for their paines, and care taken herein, and returned to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> to their Lodgings. That euening, the Gunners of the Nauie, ſhewed very exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and rare Fier-workes.</p>
            <p>The next morning, being Monday, and the xi. of Auguſt, the Kings, the Queene, and Prince, with their traynes, ſet forwarde towardes <hi>Graueſend,</hi> by the way ſo followed with people, as was wonderfull, and did make the trayne of Courtiers admire: yea, ſuch was the multitude of people, <hi>Londoners,</hi> &amp; others, which came to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> that thouſands could get no lodginges, or meate for their money.</p>
            <p>The time hath brought theſe Royall perſons, neere to the Towne of <hi>Graueſend,</hi> where the Port Re<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne of the Towne, with his Brethren, in very decent manner, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb facs="tcp:713:11"/>
them ſelues to his Maieſtie, and offered his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto his Highneſſe: which graciouſly accepted the ſame, and deliuered it againe vnto him,</p>
            <p>So paſſed their Maieſties forwards to the waters ſide; at whoſe comming, they were ſaluted with a mightie peale of Ordinaunce from the King of <hi>Denmarkes</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myrall, and ſo from all the reſt of his Fleete: who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing finiſhed, the two Block-houſes of <hi>Tylberie</hi> and <hi>Grauesend</hi> began; and thundered ſuch a <hi>Volye</hi> of Shot, as was highly to be commended.</p>
            <p>Aborde the Royall Shippe of the <hi>Denmarke</hi> Kings, are theſe Princes gone; where a moſt hartie welcome they receaue, and great cheare. The Ordinaunce often times diſcharging, vpon Healthes to all Friends: which Ordinaunce was anſwered by our two Block-houſes in ſuch order, as deſarues commendations.</p>
            <p>After dinner, the Gunners of the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Shippes, ſhewed their rare deuiſes of Fire-workes: the beautie of which was not to be ſeene, by reaſon of the brightneſſe of the Sunne, which dimmed the ſame.</p>
            <p>Dinner ended, and the tyde (which ſtayeth not) ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to goe for <hi>London,</hi> our gracious King &amp; Queene hauing brought his kingly Brother to his owne Shipp, from whence he brought him, after many kinde Adues giuen on euery ſide, as well by the Princes, as their Noble trayne, they commende his Maieſtie to Gods protection, and heartily wiſh his ſafetie in his owne Countrey: which ſolemne farewells accompliſhed, the King, Queene, and Prince, tooke their Barges to come for the Court, leauing the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:713:11"/>
Gods pleaſure, and fauour of the Windes; who ſent after them, a token of Princely loue, in the thundering noyſe of all the Ordinaunce from all his Shippes.</p>
            <p>Theſe Royall Companies parred, as you haue hearde, the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> tooke order for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be giuen to all Offices of his Maieſties Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde: which, as it is ſayd, was moſt bountifull. And for other places, aborde the Shippes to the Maiſters, like Rewardes.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I recounted in two ſeuerall Pamphlets, the whole Diſcourſe, and royall Entertainement of this moſt Royall King: whoſe pleaſures, and great wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in all places, no Prince but may admire.</p>
            <p>And moſt worthely was the loue of all men beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed on his Highneſſe, for all courteſie and louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoures might be exſpected from a King of his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, was not wanting in him; as his gracious counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce ſhewed in all places. Beſides which, it hath very ſeldome, or neuer been ſeene, ſo many Straungers togeathers in this Lande, ſo well gouerned, and ſo kindly vſed: Such was his Princely care of them, and our Nation, for breeding of quarrells by any of his people, that of all other Vices, their charge was to keepe them from beeing druncke: and withall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vppon them a heuy puniſhment, for any that ſhould offende, contrary to his commaundement: for the execution of this his Maieſties pleaſure herein, hee appoynted a Marſhall, who had diuers men, as Officers vnder him, to haue a vigilent care
<pb facs="tcp:713:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ouer them; which with all diligence performed the ſame: and ſuch as they found druncke, were brought to a Houſe appoynted for their Priſon; wheare their Thumbes were chayned togeather, and nayled by it to a poſt: where they remayned till ſome ſuite was made for their deliuerie, &amp; hartie repentance for their faults; the due execution whereof, kept them in ſuch awe, that you ſhould ſeldome after the firſt weeke, ſee any of them out of order.</p>
            <p>A comfortable hearing it is to all Chriſtians, to ſee ſo vile a ſinne reformed. God graunt vs all to follow like examples of well doinges: preſerue our dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Lord King <hi>IAMES,</hi> the Queene, the Prince, and all the reſt of their Royall iſſue: And ſende this famous kingly Brother, a faire winde, and a ſafe and pleaſant paſſage to his deſired Port. <hi>Amen.</hi>
