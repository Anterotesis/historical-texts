            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for the safety and welfare of the Kingdome: so likewise wee presume
to command respectively our petitionary desire to your Honours: First,
that your Honours would be graciously pleased to condiscend to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
pleasure and just Command, without repugnance and opposition; for
a distractes varience between a King and his Subjects, is the first ground
and <hi>principium</hi> of confusion to a Nation. Therefore wee humbly implore
your Honours to conjoyne with his Majestie in a reciprocall concord,
that the knot of peace and tranquillitie may be tyed so securely fast, that
all the hell-guided Conspiracies of Forraigne Enemies may be annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and abollished. That you would likewise endeavour to concatenate
the affections of the people to his Majesty, that his Royall Prerogative and
Imperiall Throne be not violated, and trampled downe by the malicious
aspersions of such as are ill-affected and dangerous persons in the Realme.
That the divisions and distractions in the Kingdome may bee allayed and
asswaged, to the comfort of his Majesty, the Honour of his Parliament, and
the perpetuall peace and prosperity of the Realme. In the meane time my
diurnall prayers assiduous Supplications shalbe invocated upon the mighty
and Almighty assistance and auxiliation of God that all your deliberation
and determining Counsels may be directed to the right object, and for my
part I wil confirm my resolutions, &amp; am fully intended to assist you with
my full power and Forces, and I shall likewise diligently endeavour to

shall labour to quallifie, and by Gods divine providence assisting us wee
shal crowne England with an Olive Branch of Victorious Tranquillity in
the Kingdome.</p>

an effect of the bloudy Counsells of the Papists and other ill-affected persons,
who have already raised Rebellion in the Kingdome of Ireland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And by reason
of many disorders, we cannot but fear they will proceed not onely to stirre up the
like Rebellion and Insurrections in this Kingdome of England, but also to back
them with forces from abroad.</p>
               <p>For the safety therefore of His Majesties Person, the Parlament and Kingdom
in this time of Imminent danger, It is ordered by the King, Lords, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
