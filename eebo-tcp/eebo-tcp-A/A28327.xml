         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

was, or ſhall be done;
<note n="*" place="margin">Becauſe a Dream is but a Dream.</note> either for the Stile or

who loves mirth and
ſport, friends of old to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to the Muſes. It is
but a Dream, and that I may
declare without reflection. If
it be a Crime for me to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105107:5"/>
dream, then muſt we accuſe
nature it ſelf; for it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to reſtrain our rov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fancies (eſpecially when
we are aſleep) as it is to bind
the very winds.</p>
            <q>
               <l>For what all day we do or</l>
               <l>think, we keep</l>
               <l>The ſame, oft-times, in mind</l>
               <l>when we're aſleep.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The night doth receive
both our cares, and delights,
and repreſents the ſame as it
were in a ſtanding fog or
miſt, when ſleep creeps in
upon us. For though the
efficacy and power of the
ſoul be divided, and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
into ſeveral parts by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105107:5"/>
ſleep, yet it is in its force, and
being deluded by vain fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
in the very ſhadow of
death, goes about the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this life, the counſels
of men, yea and idle toys.
So that mortals have not
tranquility always, without
toyl and labour. When the
day is ended, we take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of our cares, and
toys to bed with us, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they ſtrike our ſleeping
members with fears, or tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles
them with joy. But
now I beg in to go on: if any
hath pleaſure in a Dream, let
him beſtow the loſs of a little
time therein.</p>
            <p>It was in the latter part of
the night, when (being in a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105107:6"/>
deep ſleep) I thought I was
walking amongſt certain
Hills near a City, divers and
ſpring-like pleaſures had
cloathed the Earth (the cold
winter being gone,) and when
in the entry of a thick Grove
I was thinking upon the
Nymphs of the Woods, and
was moving my fancy to
write a Song to <hi>Sylvanus</hi>: I
am carried into a great Cave
whereinto a natural row of
trees made one entrie: the
leaves whereof did caſt a
ſhade over the ſame: Cloſe
by, and at the top of a moſt
clear Fountain there was Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
made of Turf, Garlands
ſtrowed on the Ground, and
certain remainders of a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105107:6"/>
banquet. The ground
as yet wet with Wine, did
make it appear that there had
lately been a Feaſt in that
place. There came a certain
Marriage-ſound, and Light
from the fartheſt end of the
Cave; whereby it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that there were ſome of
the Nymphs brought to her
Marriage-chamber by her
new Bridegroom. As I was
admiring this ſecret place, I
eſpied ſome Verſes, written
on the neareſt Beech Tree.</p>
            <q>
               <l>There is a power, or pleaſure,

            </q>
            <p>I had juſt done reading,
when behold one of a moſt
mageſtick preſence did ſhew
himſelf to me, out of the
ſpace betwixt the light and
the darkneſs, I thought him
to be the very image of all
the graces. His habit and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105107:8"/>
countenance, did denote him
to be both Man and Woman,
and his original to be from
<hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi>: the reſt
of his apparel could both ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate
a Man, and augment
wantonneſs in a Woman: His
Head beſet with Roſes, and
Gems, his Hair perfum'd,
and trim'd up in curled
Locks, did ſweeten the very
Air. But frequent and tart
Vomits, the ſymptoms of an
overburdened ſtomach, did
deform all thoſe pleaſures. I
did eaſily conjecture him to be
ſome God of Banquets, &amp; an
unknown preſes of joy. For
he was of a delicate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
and did ſeem to be
very merry, he was pleaſant
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105107:8"/>
in his carriage, young in his
years, and ruddy with wine,
and was picking his teeth
with a ſilver pin, as if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of ſome of the meat
had been ſticking therein. In
the mean while he comes
ſtreight up to me (you would
have thought that ſome <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
Statue had been
moving;) and that he might
ſeem to deſpiſe riches, he
trampled upon <hi>Jewels</hi> throne
before him as he walked. A
Boy did follow him at a little
diſtance, who, being of a
lively countenance and brave
attire, did reſemble Luxury.
A delicate Maid alſo (that
the female ſex might not
be wanting) did attend him,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105107:9"/>
carrying in her hand a Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
garniſhed with Gold, and
whatever the Muſes, and my
Lady Pleaſure did invent to
ſtir up wantonneſs in the
minds of Mortals. Thoſe
two did obſerve the motions,
and footſteps of their Maſter;
for preſently (he having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them a ſign) they come
up to him and began to ſing.
This unuſual, and altogether
divine melody, did raviſh
me, and being o'recome with
the ſweetneſs thereof, I began
to fall aſleep, when behold
this <hi>Androginus</hi> (for ſuch an

My garb alſo becomes me, for

me as a God, Women as a

the ſame Genius; neither is
this without reaſon. The

this wine is ſo common
with us, that our very ſlaves
laſhes it out like water, and
with that word deſired us to

In the entry where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we ſee the naked ſtatue of
<hi>Venus,</hi> made of white marble,
as if ſhe had been coming

out of the foaming waves.
To what end ſhall I hide her

Boy of laſcivious carriage,
like to his Mother, arm'd

wherewith he burns and

ſhake one of love's darts.
Near the wall upon the

to ſpeak, ſometime to hold
his peace, when he was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating

incontinently he walking
haſtily, and throwing his

his whole ſpeech with
his fooliſh geſture. He was
making a Song in praiſe of

darkneſs, which he had never
ſeen ſober,<note n="*" place="margin">That is to ſay he was always drunk before four in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, which holds good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in the perſon of a crackt brain'd demi poet.</note> and did ſo much
extol it, that he had almoſt
obſcured the whole Heavens,
and was like to have turned
the world into another <hi>Chaos.</hi>
So he begins.</p>
            <q>
               <l>No Sun as yet did give the</l>

his <hi>Venus,</hi> Love his

him) the god <hi>Comus</hi> is given
in Marriage to <hi>Nox.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Becauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling is for the moſt part done in the night, therefore the Author makes a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage betwixt the god thereof and darkneſs.</note> So
when he had run over the
ſubject of what he had to ſay,
and ended his ſpeech more
obſcure than night it ſelf, he
took out of his pocket a little
ſtone book, and began to
mutter ſome ambiguous
words. I thought I had been
at <hi>Athens</hi> in the School of
the Stoicks: But coming up
to him with a chearful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
I pray you Sir, ſaid
I, (if I be not troubleſome to

as it were out of a deep

This he ſpoke, and was going
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105107:24"/>
to deſcribe the whole family

But caſting my eyes about
the Room, I ſpied an old
Man of a lively countenance,
upon whom when I had
looked more attentively, Is
this my very good, and dear
Friend <hi>Tabutius,</hi> or do my
eyes deceive me? yes ſays
he, very joyful to ſee me;
you behold your friend, full
of years, and brought here
from the very <hi>Inſubrians,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">A People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Gallia Ciſalpius,</hi> now called Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</note>
And doth ſleep, ſay I to him
again, carry ſuch an old age
upon its wings? It is ſo ſays
<hi>Tabutius,</hi> and I am now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
ſeriouſly upon my
youth, as if I had not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my habitation but my
age. In the mean time up
comes <hi>Aderba</hi>; and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105107:25"/>
his arms about his neck,
whilſt he was ſpeaking, did
kiſs him moſt tenderly; but
<hi>Tabutius</hi> taking us aſide to
the furtheſt part of the room,
began his Speech in this
manner.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Cimmerian</hi> God is
not unknown to me; in my
youth, my blood did boyl
within me, as well as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
I ſpent ſome part of
my time in ſports and revels.
We have no ſpring without
bloſſoms; but it is not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by nature to bloſſom at
all ſeaſons; Therefore hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
laid aſide all trifles, I ſet
my ſelf to ſerious matters, to
quietneſs, and to learn wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
I beheld the type of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105107:26"/>
a diſſolute and corrupt life,
only to reprehend, and laugh
at it. Imagine me to be <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſſes,</hi>

you to be ſtrangers to
this place,<note n="*" place="margin">they have been younger it ſeems than <hi>Tabuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>; for young men are ſooner taken with Luxurious and Venereal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights than old men are.</note> and not ſo much
as frequent the ſame in your
thoughts. This <hi>Comus</hi> is a
fomenter of vice, inſnares
the ſpirits of men with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and effeminates them:
Theſe two whom you ſee
there, Luxury, and Laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
are vices, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
what ever is
good in man. What is the
reſt of that wanton rabble,
but noxious blaſts of wind,
that can hardly blow upon
you without danger of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105107:26"/>
There is no love here,
but diſſimulation, no true
friends, but Lords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
Do you not behold
their pleaſant, and jovial
countenances? under thoſe
do they hide their envy and
malice. If you be not cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
their feigned courteſie
will deceive you: Neither
can you ſo much as admit of
a benefit from them without
hurt; <hi>Comus</hi> he's baniſhed
candor, and ingenuity, but
he's made diſſimulation and
deceit free Citizens. They
are courteous until they
think they have obliged you;
But then they aſſume the
command, and if they have
not a friend altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105107:27"/>
to their will, they
begin to hate him. But to
ſpeak the truth, ambition did
firſt introduce thoſe faults,
and the good uſe of feaſts,
and friendſhip was loſt, after
the moderate offices of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
were ſtain'd with
Luxury, I had rather ſpeak
by example than by words.
You know your ſelves that
love and frugality are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent.
In a Feaſt there
ſhould be neatneſs, but a
comely and well-beſeeming
neatneſs. Without prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality,
trouble, or oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Diſhes to refreſh, not
overcharge the ſtomachs of
your Gueſts, they ſhould not
ſuffer the ſmoak of their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105107:27"/>
Kitchins to allarm the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels,
as if their houſes were
ready to be turn'd into
flames, nor ſhould they let
all their neighbours know
that they are to feaſt their
Gueſts. As a wiſe man lives,
ſo doth he likewiſe care for
his friend, and diſpoſes him
to ſobriety no leſs by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
than by his words.
But to what purpoſe is a
grave Speech againſt luxury,
if his Actions be diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his Speech,</p>

            </q>
            <p>I hate thoſe men, who have
wiſe Speeches in their
mouths and folly in their
minds, have a care that your
good behaviour do not diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
from your natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
thereto. He can eaſily
confute luxury in words,
who hath begun ſo to do in
his good carriage, and I dare
do it, eſpecially amongſt
you, whom I know inclined
to vertue. Such friends
would I deſire always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with me, to ſuch would
I ſtill keep a free Table.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:105107:28"/>
            <q>
               <l>But of a Gormandizer I'm

               <l>Who cares not for my ſmall

            </q>
            <p>I ſo prepare Meat to my
Friends, and orders my
Feaſt, as if I were to Sup a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
neither is it a ſhame
for me to ſhew my frugality,
wherewith none but unſober
men will be offended. To
what purpoſe is it to be ſo
prodigal, and to be at as
much charge for one Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as a mans Eſtate will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him for many dayes?
how ſweet is that fare that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expelleth hunger, that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth,
but not deſtroys the
vigor of the mind, that feeds
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105107:29"/>
but doth not overcharge: A
Gueſt ſhould be ſent away,
that as he came, ſo the next
day he may return. He
pays too much for his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
who loſeth his health
thereby: and he takes too
great a price for the expence
he hath been at, who uſeth
authority to endanger mens
healths by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But ſays <hi>Tabutius,</hi> let
us go to the next room, where
we may diſcourſe with more
freedom, and greater ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie?
So he leads the way and
we follow. Here was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but quietneſs. The
Torches and Lamps did caſt
a dull light. Sleep had
ſweetly diffuſed it ſelf
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105107:29"/>
amongſt them. Some whom
the fume of the Wine had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate,
were lying along the
chairs, others lying with their
heads together on the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were as yet hugging their
jugs. <hi>Aderba</hi> pleaſed with
the ſight, what, ſays he, are
thoſe alſo Poets? But I told
him, that <hi>Comus</hi> was the
Muſes <hi>Apollo</hi> in this place.
Then <hi>Tabutius</hi> looking with
a great gravity, ſpoke in this
maner all thoſe ſhews which
you ſee, and have ſeen are
deceitful and hurtful; yet
with ſuch is the mind of man,
through bad cuſtom cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
Therefore conſult
your reaſon, and deſpiſe ſuch
impoſtures; for there is no
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105107:30"/>
true liberty but in wiſdom,
nor glory but in vertue.</p>
            <q>
               <l>To ſhun a vice is vertue, ſure
you'l grant,</l>
               <l>Wiſdom begins when we do
folly want.</l>
            </q>
            <p>If you regard your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
be ſtrangers to this place,
to ſit, drink and babble are
the ſolemnities of their
Feaſts: by ſuch is ſobriety
o'recome. But if we will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
her precepts, whatever
is above hunger, and thirſt,
will be noyſome to us; And
is it not a great trouble to a
ſober man to ſit all day &amp; all
night at a Banquet? It would
be a folly to relate their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105107:30"/>
ſpeeches when they in
vite you. They will tell you
that you ſhall ſit as ſhort
time as you pleaſe, you ſhall
eat and drink what you will;
and that there ſhall be no
Cups preſs'd upon you more
than if you were at home;
but when they begin to grow
warm with wine, then they
change their ſpeech.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Come, pray you, eat and drink
and merry be,</l>
               <l>And pleaſe your ſenſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites

            </q>
            <p>Spare ſome hours to your
Genius and friends, ſay they,
let ſerious matters alone till
to morrow, you ſhould not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105107:31"/>
overwhelm your minds with
clouds of care; for Feaſts
were ordain'd to this end,
for men to refreſh their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
minds with mirth.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Old <hi>Cato's</hi> Vertue did grow

            </q>
            <p>Imitate him, and lay aſide
your ſevere gravity for a
ſhort time, that you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
more freſh, and lively,
to your cares and troubles.
They muſt be obeyed, though
againſt your will, and ſo the
Dinner is prolonged till late
in the night, and the Supper
till the morning; and Meat
finds no reſt to digeſt for
drinking.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:105107:31"/>
Then the Gueſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(for the moſt part) are
as laſcivious, as the Maſters
of the Feaſt; for the very
Air cannot pleaſe them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

They care not for pure wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherewith men by a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105107:32"/>
wholeſome inſtinct of nature,
did uſe to quench their
thirſt. Then there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementative
conteſt about
their Seats; every one ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
refuſes the place, but
they would all have it with
equal deſire. Here did <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butius</hi>
make a pauſe, and as if
he had been gathering mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a further diſcourſe, he
deſired us to lay up thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
matters in our minds,
whereof he had been treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and withall did give us
an invitation to walk. With
that he riſes himſelf, and
leading us along ſlowly, he
promiſed us a long narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
We had taken two or
three turns through the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105107:32"/>
room, when one of thoſe who
were ſleeping, did awake, and
being troubled that the
Lights burned ſo dully, he
runs and pours more Oyl
therein, by which darkneſs,
in a moment was expelled.
So that with the new Light,
there was alſo a new occaſion
given to <hi>Tabutius</hi> to inlarge
his broken off diſcourſe. But
whilſt we are preparing our
ſelves to hear, behold our
good friend <hi>Eupantus</hi> comes
running out of the dining
Room, dragging his Cloak
after him as if he had been in
great haſt, yet ſhewing Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
not Luxury in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
He was beginning
to ſpeak, but <hi>Tabutius</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105107:33"/>
him; how now ſays
he, do you forſake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and mirth of <hi>Comus</hi>
after this manner? where are
your Garlands? and why do
not you mask your ſelf as
well as others? I would do
any thing, replies <hi>Eupantus</hi>
to get out of this place; for
I have not found the God
<hi>Comus</hi> here, but hiſſing, and
reproach; Calumny he's
thrown her drunken poyſon
upon me. So many tongues,
ſo many ſtripes, which could
hardly be digeſted by the
ſtomach of ſome ſelf-denied
Philoſopher. I was welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this unexpected pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
before I knew my
Crime; But asking what my
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105107:33"/>
fault was, they anſwered that
I had offended the God of
Feaſting by a twofold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.
Then <hi>Tabutius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting
him; by what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
I pray you, ſays he?
the very ſame replyed <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantus,</hi>
whereby you taught
me two vertues: to wit, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and ſilence. I offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
indeed, becauſe I did
eat, drink, and ſpeak little;
and I was reprehended as a
Scholar of Pythagorical gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
becauſe I did hold my
peace. This is to be regra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that you ſhould be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated,
and reproached,
becauſe you knew to bridle
your tongue. Yes ſays <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantus,</hi>
baniſhment is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105107:34"/>
for me by the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
of this drunken rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Therefore I am reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to prevent them, and to be
gone this ſame night, that it
may be known I go of my
own accord, and not by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion.
After ſuch like
ſpeeches were ended, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
for his friend <hi>Virus</hi>:
did you not ſee him ſays he
to <hi>Tabutius</hi>? For they ſay
he is alſo wandering in this
place of darkneſs; but he
will fall into ſome misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
if he do not beware, and
get him gone quickly. Lay
aſide your fear for <hi>Virus,</hi> ſays
<hi>Tabutius:</hi> he hath been cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect
enough, and is
gone already, and we are
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105107:34"/>
going the ſame way. Go you
before in a good time, and
we will follow you. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
incontinently bidding
us farewell, he went out of
the Palace by a poſtern Gate.
Then <hi>Tabutius</hi> thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the adventure of <hi>Eupan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
began to reaſſume his
Diſcourſe in this manner.</p>
            <p>This talkative humour,
(for the want of which <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantus</hi>
was reprehended,)
is now one of the greateſt
faults committed in a Feaſt,
and it's become ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
as to aſſume the name
of vertue; too much talk he's
repreſſed Eloquence, and
boldneſs, modeſty. But O
ſuch ſpeeches! there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105107:35"/>
that's ſerious, good, or
grave therein, &amp; words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from their mouths
with great imprudence. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are they blame worthy, not
to premeditate what they
ſpeak, and to ſpeak unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
what proceeds from
their mouths only.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Quod enim in corde ſobrii,</l>
               <l>Hoc ipſum in lingua ebrii.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <l>What a man doth ſober think,</l>
               <l>The ſame he vents when he's
in drink.</l>
            </q>
            <p>As the mind of man, ſo
is his ſpeech: one ſpeaks of
his Merchandize, another of
his Actions at Law, the third
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105107:35"/>
of his Riches, and another
of his Pleaſure and luſts, and
another boaſts of his Pride
and Arrogance. Modeſty,
Ingenuity, honeſt Poverty,
and wiſdom are ill-ſpoken
of, as Enemies to Vice. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
any man ſpeaks or does
in a Feaſt, is blown in the
ears of the whole Aſſembly,
and a number of drunken
criticks, ſlanders mens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and blames the
judgment of others, becauſe
they are deceived in their
own. There are ſome of
them again, who regards no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their Gold, nor no
man but themſelves. They
look upon Learning as idle
toys, and deſpiſe not only
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105107:36"/>
Learning it ſelf but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
thereof. But ſeeing we
have begun to ſpeak of
Learning and its effects, let
us (laughing at their idle o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions)
make a little, but
uſeful digreſſion concerning
the ſame. It is an excellent
effect of Learning, when a
man gives his good life, and
carriage, as an example to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
when his writings are
not ſo much regarded as his
deeds. It's more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
to be good, than
learn'd, though both be
praiſe-worthy. It's the
goodneſs of your wit may
make you learned, but it's
the excellency of your ſoul
free from terrene paſſions,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105107:36"/>
&amp; taken up with more pure,
and ſpiritual objects, muſt
make you good. So you
ſhould exerciſe your wit to
make your mind glorious;
none are content with the
bloſſom, all ſeeks the fruit.
Erudition is the flower, and
wiſdom is the fruit. But we
are oft-times deceived with
the ſhadow of unprofitable
ſtudies; for what we do on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for pleaſure, is either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
or hurtful; and
to be curious to know trifles,
is no better than to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all: <hi>Quae ſive conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas
nihil tacitam conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam
juvant: ſive proferas,
non doctior videberis ſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:105107:37"/>
But now we have walked
enough, let us take our Seats,
ſays <hi>Tabutius,</hi> and begin our
ſpeech where we digreſſed.
Feaſts ſays he, for the moſt
part are the very Seminaries
of babbling. Sometime they
cry out, now they ſpeak all
at once.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Fit ſtrepitus tectis, vocemque
per ampla volutant</l>
               <l>Atria.</l>
            </q>
            <p>I deteſt that company,
where you cannot hold your
peace without reproach,
when it would be a folly to
ſpeak. And it is a folly to
ſpeak, when none are ſilent.
As one loſeth his labour, who
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105107:37"/>
plays on an Inſtrument near
to a great fall of water from
a high place; ſo it fares
with that man, who would
begin any good diſcourſe in
<hi>Comus</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">To begin a grave diſcourſe amongſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en babblers.</note> Company; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I think he ſpeaks beſt
who holds his peace. Yet
this was <hi>Eupantus</hi> his crime;
but if we would look aright
into the thing, it was becauſe
he was ſober, and had not
put his judgment out of its
proper place through intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.
Now I have ſaid
that garrulity proceeds from
ebriety. It was a good ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Bias,</hi> when at a Feaſt
one call'd him a Fool, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was ſilent: but what
Fool can hold his peace, ſays
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105107:38"/>
he, above Cups. I will add
alſo the anſwer of <hi>Zeno,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> as a
great Elogy of ſilence. A
certain man of <hi>Athens,</hi> feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome of <hi>Philip</hi> King of
<hi>Macedon</hi>'s Embaſſadours,
did alſo invite certain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
when all were
ſpeaking, and every man
putting in his fine witty tale,
only <hi>Zeno</hi> was ſilent; The
Embaſſadours admiring the
ſame, yet entertain'd him
courteouſly, and drinking
to him, deſired him to ſhow
them, what they ſhould ſay
to their King concerning
him. Nothing, ſays he, but
that there was an old Man in
<hi>Athens,</hi> who could be ſilent
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105107:38"/>
in his Cups. Let us follow
therefore and put in practice
that laudable Speech, and
deſpiſe thoſe drunken, and
fooliſh babblers, to whom
the very name of a grave, and
quiet man, is hateful. Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Antiquity did oppoſe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
to ebriety; and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
did give this defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of Ebriety; <hi>vanilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentia
in vino,</hi> A babbling
in Wine; drinking, ſaith <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi>
is not very blameable,
if it be done with ſilence. But
a drunken Man cannot but
play the Fool, and is ſtill
prating in all places. How
deſervedly is <hi>Eupantus</hi> to
be commended, who did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the authority he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105107:39"/>
his judgment, in the
midſt of ſuch talkative mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
There ſhould be ſome
amongſt ſo many who ſhould
give ear, and they cannot do
ſo unleſs they be ſilent. Yet
I do not approve of a
ſpeechleſs Feaſt; it's comely
they ſpeak if they time it
rightly, and do not ſpeak too
much, but with ſober men,
with few, and with their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals:
but in <hi>Comus</hi> his
Feaſts there is ebriety, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and diſparity. Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now adays, is neither
thought fine, nor pleaſant,
wherein ebriety is not predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant.
Ebriety (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>
moſt excellently) kindles and
diſcovers every Vice, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105107:39"/>
Shame, that is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
an hinderance of bad
practices; For there are
ſome who abſtain to do evil,
more through ſhame than
fear of puniſhment. Where
too much Wine hath intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
the brain, what ever ill
lyeth hid in man, comes out
ſuddenly. Ebriety doth not
beget<note n="*" place="margin">Yes it both begets and brings forth vice.</note> but brings forth vice.
The libidinous man, in
drink, doth not wait for a
Bed to ſatiate his Luſt
therein; the haſty man doth
bridle neither tongue, nor
hands; pride domineers in
the proud, cruelty in the
cruel, and envy in the
envious. After this manner
they live, and they go by
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105107:40"/>
Cups, as by degrees, to fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
madneſs. One drinks
your good health, another
your Miſtreſſes, another your
good fortune, ev'ry man
quaffs it out; and if you do
not the like, you wrong the
God of Banquets, and your
Friends. He who drinks to
you, as he was made quaff it
out, ſo he preſſes you to do
the like, or elſe muſt do it for
you, whereby he cannot favor
another mans health, unles he
drown his own, and ſo vices
begun when men are in
drink, grow ſtrong when
they are ſober. Then begin
they (being mad with drink)
to ſing wanton and laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Songs, which is followed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105107:40"/>
by a confuſed bellowing of
the whole multitude. But
how opportunely he's the
ſeries of my diſcourſe
brought me to ſpeak of
this! for do you not hear
this very ſame kind of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
either I am deceived, or
the ſame is performing we
are ſpeaking of, and with
that holding his peace, he did
give both of us liberty to go,
and behold, while he himſelf
took a little repoſe. Then tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Aderba</hi> by the hand, let us
go, ſay I, and behold with
our eyes this fooliſh cuſtom.
So making no delay, I came
to the door, leading <hi>Aderba</hi>
along with me, where we did
ſee with our eyes, all that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105107:41"/>
               <hi>Tabutius</hi> had told us to be
true.</p>
            <p>But another ſhow, worthy
the taking notice of, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it ſelf to us an, old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
full of years and wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles,
carrying in her viſage,
the deſerved puniſhment of
her former impiety, that is
a noſe ſhorter, than what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had given her, dragging
a great Munkey in a chain,
which did ſo obſerve the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its Leader, that men
would have thought the old
woman had been teaching
the beaſt to dance a Carrant.
<hi>Comus</hi> in his merry humour
commanded this old Hag to
come to him, whom he moſt
kindly ſaluted again<note n="*" place="margin">Becauſe a Bawd is one of <hi>Comus</hi> his eſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites.</note> and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105107:41"/>
again. This honour made
her ſo bold as to place her
ſelf at the head of the Table,
and as the only Prieſt of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
enjoyn'd the whole
company to live and love.
Whereupon <hi>Aderba</hi> ſeeing
the confidence and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of this deformed Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
inquired of an old man
ſtanding near him, what ſhe
was. This woman ſaid he,
was of old the Nurſe, now the
Mother and Friend of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>;
all her buſineſs is to
make new marriages every
day, and to find out conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
places for Lovers,
where they may enjoy their
ſtoln imbraces with ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
nay, ſhe is able to bring
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105107:42"/>
               <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> together
without the help of a golden
ſhower, and that you may
know her fidelity to the
bawdy intereſt, ſhe hath loſt
her Noſe in the Service.
Then ſaid <hi>Aderba,</hi> I pray
you Father, do me the favour
to tell me how ſhe came by
that misfortune, whereupon
the old man taking us aſide,
and conjuring us to ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
began this Story as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>There was a Lady in the
Country of the <hi>Cimmerians,</hi>
wife to a perſon of Quality,
and in her, had beauty, and
chaſtity (Graces ſeldom
found in one perſon) centred
themſelves, according to the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105107:42"/>
common opinion of all. But
as Vices are oft-times veiled
with vertuous Pretenſions;
ſo this Lady, chaſt till mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
was immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with an unlawful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
(ſuch is the efficacy
of immoderate luſt) and
placed that kindneſs due to
her husband, upon a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
whom ſhe had ſeen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
in a Bath. At
firſt her Husband admired
what occaſioned the coldneſs
of her conjugal duty, and
obſcured the uſual ſerenity
of her pleaſant countenance,
endeavouring by all careſſes
imaginable, to baniſh out of
her thoughts, thoſe melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick
ſymptomes of a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105107:43"/>
troubled mind: But when
he could by no means reduce
her to her former compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency:
he preſently ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
ſome new love was
ſtriving with his, for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty.
For although
ſhe did carefully conceal her
licentious paſſion, with the
veil of hypocriſie; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
by her diſcreet
deportment, to ſuppreſs her
laſcivious deſires, yet the
perplexity of her mind, her
unquiet nights, her intter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
diſcourſes, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other tokens of a heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with luſt, were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
arguments to him of
her adulterous deſires. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this Gentleman, raging
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105107:43"/>
with jealouſie, did take ſuch
notice of her behaviour, that
<hi>Argus</hi> did not more carefully
obſerve the motions of <hi>Io</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">the mistris of <hi>Jupiter</hi> whom <hi>Juno</hi> turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a cow, and ſet <hi>Argus</hi> who had one hundred eyes to watch her</note>
then he did hers. And at
laſt to try her fidelity, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
a journey, thereby
thinking to detect her diſeaſe,
and confirm himſelf in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.
So taking Money,
and other neceſſaries for
three weeks ſtay; away he
goes the next morning, The
Lady (loth to loſe ſuch a fair
opportunity of obtaining her
deſires,) ſent for this old
woman, as the fitteſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereby to put her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
in execution, to whom
ſhe diſcovers her paſſion,
will, and pleaſure, and giving
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105107:44"/>
her a piece of money, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
her larger rewards, after
the performance of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
The time appointed by
them for hergallant to come,
was the ſame night; ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
ſhe goes in ſearch of
the Souldier, and finding
him, did inform him of
the paſſionate love the Lady
had for him. Whereunto
he conſented, being forward
enough of himſelf; and
therefore promiſed to be
walking before the Gate, at
the time appointed. In the
mean while leaſt her love
ſhould grow cold, ſhe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Bed, Banquet, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Wines, wherewith to
entertain her martial Gallant.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105107:44"/>
The Sun did leave our Horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
as aſhamed to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their wickedneſs,
when the Souldier mindful
of his appointment, makes
haſt to the Lady's Houſe, but
the Gate being ſhut (for he
was not to knock) he walked
too and again, till it ſhould
be opened to him. In the
mean while, the Husband
(lurking in ſome Friends
Houſe all that day) at night
made homeward; and when
he came near the Gate, he
perceiv'd a Souldier, walking
before the ſame, whom he i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin'd
to be the <hi>Mars</hi> of his
<hi>Venus</hi>; ſo he went in, making
as little noiſe as poſſible;
and running in a fury into
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105107:45"/>
his Wife's Chamber, he finds
her ſitting, ſolacing her
ſelf with the thoughts of her
approaching content: but
her Husbands ſudden return
did ſtrike her with ſuch a
terrour, that ſhe ſate like a
Statue (ſuch influences ha's
ſudden ſurprizal upon the
ſpirits of women, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
them of their natural
vigour,) her guilty conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
fearing his rage and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
ſhould force him to
give her the juſt reward of
her merits. On the other ſide,
his paſſion had ſo deprived
him of his natural faculty of
ſpeaking, that he was forced
only to breath out that reveng
which his rage would not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105107:45"/>
ſuffer him to utter in words.
Neither need he uſe many to
convince her of her bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
for her preparation,
and her good meat already
upon the Table did accuſe
her, and then the luſty young
Souldier walking before the
Gate, all high preſumptions
of ſome diſhoneſt intention.
But to be ſhort (reſolving to
make that a night of torment
to her, which ſhe had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for pleaſure,) he ſtrip'd
her naked, and ſo led her to a
Pond, in the middle whereof
he tied her faſt to a poſt,
thinking by that means to
cool the heat, that had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
her malady, and his
jealouſie. There ſtood the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105107:46"/>
Lady like <hi>Andromede</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">A Lady of exquiſite beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tyed to a Stake at the Sea ſhore to be devoured by a Sea monſter, but reſcued by <hi>Perſeus.</hi>
               </note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
ſome new <hi>Perſeus,</hi> to
reſcue her from the fury of a
jealous husband; but the
anxious Husband goes to
bed, there to pacifie his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
mind with a little reſt.
All this while, the Souldier
(who had promiſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
the ſweeteſt delights <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
could afford,) was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
expecting the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gate, and when he
had waited long in vain, he
goes to the old womans
houſe, where he finds her
half naked, going to bed; at
what rate, ſaith he, muſt I
buy this promiſed delight
from the Lady? I have ſpent
the better part of the night in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105107:46"/>
waiting for the opening of
the Gate, but it may be a
deep ſleep hath made her
forget her appointment, go
your way, and deſire her to
let me know her pleaſure, and
if ſhe have a mind I ſhould
come, I am ready; if not, to
defer it till her conveniency
ſhall ſerve. Without delay
the old woman putting a
Mantle about her ſhoulders,
and taking the young man
by the hand, lead him to a
poſtern door, and with a Key
ſhe had got from the Lady,
ſhe goes in; but ſhe had not
gone far, till a lovely milk-white
Statue preſented it
ſelf to her view, whoſe ſnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
whiteneſs did give light,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105107:47"/>
in the obſcurity of the night.
This unexpected ſight did at
firſt ſurprize the old woman;
but finding it to be the Lady
(without ſo much as condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her misfortune,) ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
the Souldiers Meſſage
to her, which in ſpight of
her preſent condition was
yet very acceptable to her.
The Lady no leſs crafty than
fair, begins to accoſt the old
woman with perſwaſive lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
promiſing her great
Rewards, and giving her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances
of perpetual friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
if ſhe would untie her &amp;
help her to have private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with her Gallant.
To be ſhort ſhe is perſwaded
to ſuffer her ſelf to be tyed to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105107:47"/>
her place (a ſhow if expoſed
to publike view, would have
forced laughter from the
moſt dejected of men.) The
Lady puts on the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Cloaths, and goes with
all ſpeed to enjoy her long
deſired pleaſure. The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
imagining her at the
firſt to be the old woman, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to know the Ladies
commands; but her voice
diſcovered her to be his
wiſhed, and long waited for
prey, where we leave them to
enjoy thoſe pleaſures, which
love could afford. Now we
return to the Gentleman,
whoſe penſive ſpirit wearied
with long watching, did at
laſt give place to ſleep. He
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105107:48"/>
dreamed his wife had got
loſe, and not regarding her
honour, was acting with the
Souldier, and that he was
transformed into a Satyre;
whereupon awaking ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
he felt with his hand
if his body was not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
with hair<note n="*" place="margin">Becauſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres are ſo.</note>, or if he
had horns and feet like to a
Satyre. But if he had not
Satyres horns, yet queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
by this time he had the
horns of a Cuckold; Then
leaping out of his bed, he
runs to the window (as it
were to examine the truth of
this dream) and calls his wife
by her name, but the good
old woman underſtanding
too late, the danger ſhe had
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105107:48"/>
put her ſelf in, thought it
her ſafeſt way not to anſwer,
thinking by that means to
keep her ſelf unknown; but
the Gentleman more enraged
at her obſtinate ſilence, takes
up a Knife lying upon the
Table, runs down to the
place where ſhe was, takes
his ſuppoſed Wife by the
Noſe, and cuts it clear off,
then throwing it at her face;
baſe woman ſaith he, worthy
of a greater puniſhment and
diſgrace than this, take that
and preſent it to your Lover,
as a token of your affection
towards him; and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
his wife, (as he
thought according to her
merit) he returns to his bed,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105107:49"/>
there to think of this by-paſt
action, and to find ſome quiet
for his troubled mind. What
ſhall I ſay of the poor old
woman? ſhe is almoſt dead
with the pain of her wound,
and the fear of a further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
not daring to vent her
grief by howling for fear of
being diſcovered. At laſt,
the <hi>Lady</hi> took her leave of her
Souldier, &amp; returned to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
what fortune had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
for her, but coming to
the Pond, the ſadneſs of the
old womans condition, made

Husband, eſteeming her ſelf
moſt happy to have eſcaped
his fury; and now ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to conſolate the old
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105107:49"/>
Woman, and bidding her
take a good heart, and tells
her, that as ſcars of wounds
were marks of Honour
to the Sons of <hi>Mars</hi>; ſo
that of hers, would be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
ſign of her fidelity
to the intereſt of <hi>Venus,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
alſo, that ſhe would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the defect of her natural
Noſe, with an artificial One
of Gold. With this laſt
promiſe, the old Woman a
little pacified, (who could
have been content to loſe her
ears alſo for that mettal) tied
the Lady again; and taking
up her cloaths, away ſhe
marches; the Lady had not
ſtood long at the Stake, till
(recollecting her ſpirits, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105107:50"/>
with the fear of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
further rage; the old
womans misfortune, afforded
her this trick, whereby to
inveigle the underſtanding
of her jealous Husband; and
therefore, at firſt, with a low
and mournful voice did
ſpeak up to him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

Thy wronged power that ever

            </q>
            <p>After ſhe had ſpoke in this
manner, ſhe ſeemed for a
while to have ſome private
diſcourſe with the Deity, and
to ſpeak to her more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
than a little before. Then
with a loud voice, directing
her ſpeech to her Husband,
Come hither, ſaid ſhe, thou
moſt cruel of all men, who
intended the eternal diſgrace
of thy moſt chaſt Conſort;
and behold that <hi>Juno,</hi> in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of my innocence, ha's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
this face to its former
beauty, which thou, by thy
tyrannical hands, had moſt
impiouſly deformed. The
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105107:52"/>
Gods knows my innocence;
therefore I do not regard
what a wicked man either
doth or thinks. O bleſſed
night, more glorious to me
than all the former days of
my life, ſtill to be celebrated
by me while I live; go on
officious tears, and run on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
account. My face
ought now to be wet with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of joy, after it is reſtored
to its former beauty by the
ſpecial favour of the Gods.
But I call upon you, cruel
and bloody Hang-man, come
hither and underſtand thy
wickedneſs; that thou mayſt
avert the wrath of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Goddeſs, if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by thy ſudden repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105107:52"/>
The Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a great confuſion at
her diſcourſe, knew not what
the matter could be; at firſt
he thought it to be ſome
dream, or illuſion of the
night, and that ſuch Miracles
might rather be dream'd of
than be in reality. But when
he found certainly that he
was awake, and had his mind
free, nor did the woman ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from her railings and
curſes, all his fierceneſs was
overcome by a vehement
fear, and the thoughts of her
innocence did ſucceed it.
Riſing therefore out of his
Bed, he lights a Candle to
try the truth of the matter.
And without delay, he goes
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105107:53"/>
down ſtairs, and comes to his
wife, at whoſe ſight, being
bound, he now trembles. Then
beholding her face with the
help of the light, he finds it
whole, and ſound, without ſo
much as a ſcar. Whereat
ſtanding ſtupid with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he began both to deteſt
his wickedneſs, and to fear
the ſudden vengeance of the
angry Goddeſs<note n="*" place="margin">Juno.</note>. Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
throwing himſelf on
the ground, wet as yet with
his wifes blood, he breaks
out in tears and cryes. And
with the ſame fervency, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precating
the wickedneſs of
his impious fury, he looſeth
his moſt chaſt Spouſe, and as
a ſignal teſtimony thereof,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105107:53"/>
brings her again to her
bed. So the Lady reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
both her Noſe and the
affection of her Husband.
But the old woman, bribed
with Money, packing up bag
and baggage, did remove to
the Palace of <hi>Comus,</hi> that the
whole buſineſs might be the
better conceal'd. She dwels
now in this place, and uſing
the old Trade, ſhe is daily
preparing crafty venereal
Scenes. If you have a fancy
for any mans wife, for a maid,
or for a widow, ſhe will find
a way to bring you together;
and by her means you ſhall
find the full pleaſure of love.
For you muſt underſtand
that in this land of darkneſs,

ready to do them all ſervice

            <p>The Old Man ending his
Story, with a joyful laughter,
did joyn himſelf to the reſt
of the multitude. Then did
we return to the place from
whence we came with a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
celerity, &amp; find <hi>Tabutius</hi>
ſleeping where we left him,
who receiving us with heavy
eyes, did ask us if we had
ſeen enough of <hi>Comus</hi> diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
folly, and told that he
had been ſleeping while we
were abſent, which he would
expel with another diſcourſe.
I had begun to ſpeak of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105107:55"/>
Ebriety, ſays he, now perhaps
you have ſeen part of it. But
what good man would not
loath it? They loſe their
judgment leſt they ſhould
find their feet, when it is time
to depart, you muſt be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
or at leaſt go ſtaggering
from the Table, leſt you ſeem
not to be kindly entertain'd.
It is alſo almoſt natural to
ſome to begin and end the
day in drinking. Their
thirſt begins betimes in the
morning after their prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
night ſurfeit, neither
can it wait till Dinner. They
hate the day, and ſit up
whole nights, that they may
enjoy the benefit of light in
darkneſs, with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105107:56"/>
delight. They rejoyce</p>
            <q>Craſſos tranſire dies lucem<expan>
                  <am>
                     <g ref="char:abque"/>

paluſtrem.</q>
            <p>They had rather make<note n="*" place="margin">To make light in darkneſs with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of camps in their drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rooms.</note>
day then have day; for they
eſteem more of Torches, and
Lamps, than of the glorious
Sun, and they enjoy the
night, but loſe the day; for
when we watch when we
ſhould ſleep, we muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſity
ſleep when we ſhould
watch. And leaſt any thing
ſhould be wanting to their
folly, they guard themſelves
againſt ebriety by all devices
imaginable; and herein is
the victory purchaſed by art,
he is the braveſt fellow, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105107:56"/>
deſerves praiſes, and lawrels
beſt, who is able to ſee his
Pot-companions overcome,
and lying at his feet, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he be ſcarce able to
ſtand himſelf? But when you
have obtain'd the victory,
and when after they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it over, and are lying ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſleeping or vomiting at
your feet, and when by true
valour forſooth you have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
them all, yet the full
bottles ſhall overcome you.
Then comes palleneſs and a
trembling of the members,
and a more pitiful leanneſs,
torments you, through ebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
than through hunger.
Then faintings and ſuch like
ſtaggerings, though ſober, as
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105107:57"/>
when they are in drink. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thoſe comes Dropſies, and
a ſwelling in the belly, while
the womb receives more than
it is able to contain; then
there is a breaking out of a
wateriſh bilous humour, and
a waſting of the body, pains
in the joynts, a debilitation
of the nerves, and a palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therein: Then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Vertigo's in the head, the
pains of the eyes, and ears,
the torments in the brain, and
the ſeveral ſorts of ſome ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
ſome lent feavers. So
that multitude of diſeaſes are
the puniſhment of Luxury.
For if we will follow the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of Phyſitians, we will
find that all thoſe dreggy
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105107:57"/>
clouds of ſickneſs, are ſent
forth of the fen of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
A great part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
doth deſtroy the
ſtrength of the body by their
exceſſive pleaſures, ſo they
bear the evils of extream old
age before their time. If E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
would ceaſe, the life of
man ſhould be more happy,
and our Clergy need not
be at the pains of making ſo
many elaborate Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
Good Gods! how
violently doth wronged Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
revenge her ſelf? Scarce
doth miſerable mortals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
their bodies by their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot,
but they find the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof. We may
therefore the more eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105107:58"/>
this ſoul fault of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs,
becauſe they ſuffer ſo
much for what they do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in that nature, their very
ſin turns their puniſhment.
What need I ſpeak more to
you, to make you deteſt this
vice? Let them drink and
debauch, but know aſſuredly,
that pain, ſtupidity, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
diſeaſes, and death it
ſelf, ſhall be the inſeparable
concomitants of their intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.
When <hi>Tabutius</hi>
had put a period to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
we were entertained
with a pleaſant ſight. One
of thoſe infamous fellows
who were ſleeping in the
room beſide us, burning with
drought, gets to his feet, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105107:58"/>
ſnatches a Pot out of the arms
of one of his companions ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
next him, and when he
had taken a great pull of the
liquor, ſleep coming upon
him again, he laid himſelf
down on a high ſeat, where
again he was falling aſleep,
ſupporting his head with
his hand, which did alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his nods; but when it
began to be heavier than his
breech, he fell headlong from
the bench, and daſh'd his
pate againſt a bottle full of
Wine, wherewith the Veſſel
breaks; and giving the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a great wound in the
forehead, did wet thoſe were
lying by him: ſome of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakned
with the ſudden noiſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105107:59"/>
take their Comrade up, ſtays
the blood, and incontinently
binding up the wound with
a linnen cloth, carries him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
Then <hi>Aderba</hi> addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
himſelf to <hi>Tabutius,</hi> we
have ſeen a fine ſport ſaith
he; but whether worthy of
laughter, or commiſeration
I know not. But now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to your diſcourſe ſaith
he to <hi>Tabutius</hi>; and becauſe
you have ſpoken enough
concerning ebriety, let us
hear you ſpeak againſt the
multitude of Gueſts at a feaſt;
for (as I do remember, you
did diſlike of that in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place. Whoſoever
doth make a Feaſt, ſaith
<hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butius,</hi> ſhould invite but few.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105107:59"/>
But now they think it a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to have a multitude of
Gueſts. Yet which of the
Muſes, or Graces ever had
multitude in eſtimation. If
we like to be merry, and the
innocent pleaſure of honeſt
divertiſement, we muſt not
think to find thoſe amongſt a
multitude; yet we ſee that
great numbers are affected by
all; and as <hi>Craſſus</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">One of the <hi>Roman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls.</note> uſed to
ſay, that no man was to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd rich, but he who
could maintain a whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
upon his own charges;
ſo may I ſay that none is
rich, but he who can make a
Feaſt upon his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes.
Every man affects
this ſplendour even with the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105107:60"/>
ruine of his fortune, that he
may frame himſelf to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of laſciviouſneſs, and
follow the faſhion of the
times and place wherein he
lives.</p>
            <p>The third fault is inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and that is for the moſt
part in a multitude, when
people are invited of divers
inclinations, fortunes, ſex,
age and dignity. Let this
ſaying of <hi>Epicure,</hi> be always
in your memory; to take
heed firſt with whom you
eat, and drink, before what
you eat and drink. Now
here ſits the ignorant with
the learned, the rich with the
poor, the man with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the old with the young,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105107:60"/>
and the noble with the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian.
As you cannot mix
water with fire without noiſe,
ſo neither thoſe without bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.
The worſt amongſt
them takes upon them to
ſpeak, and the better ſort
takes all the authority upon
them. Yet the baſer ſort
finds their protectors, and
thinks it a diſgrace, that their
liberty ſhould either be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpised,
or neglected. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I think it prudently
done to be ſilent, and more
prudently done not to go to
ſuch meetings at all, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if you are to feaſt with
drunkards, a multitude, and
not your equals. Friends
are as equals, they are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105107:61"/>
but few, and joyned
together by vertue, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety.
Amongſt ſuch, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
and hilarity are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence; For as waters
are more pleaſant, which
run with a gentle, and eaſie
noiſe, ſo are Feaſts, wherein
are honeſt, pleaſant, and well
timed diſcourſe, which are
three vertues in a ſpeech
proceeding from ſo many
graces.</p>
            <p>An honeſt diſcourſe is,
what is ſpoken without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
offence, and whereto mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
has preſcribed laws,
offence comprehends, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and ſcoffing, either
againſt thoſe who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
or abſent. Scoffing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105107:61"/>
(according to <hi>Quintilian</hi>)
is a reflecting ſpeech with
laughter. Flattery is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation,
and deceit in
mens words, which is worſe
than ſcoffing; Modeſty and
ſhamefaſtneſs, enemies to
both thoſe vices, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
rudeneſs and obſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Let all thoſe faults
and crafty deceits in your
ſpeech, be removed far from
you; for whether you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
them in plain terms, or
veil them with your own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
they remain the ſame in
effect. But leſt any man
ſhould accuſe me of too
much gravity, I would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
make my gueſts merry,
by my jovial diſcourſe. It
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105107:62"/>
will be both a merry and
profitable diſcourſe, if it po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the mind as well as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
the ears. I would have
innocent ſports, the graces
and the muſes at Feaſts, but
not prone to riot and laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs,
I would have wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
alſo preſent, but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with the ſtern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of a capricious gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
For the ſoul has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
its own honey and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctar,
and this divine miſtreſs
of all vertues, doth ſometime
proffer you the cup of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
pleaſure. We ſhould
not, ſaith <hi>Varro,</hi> have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
in Feaſts, concerning
too ſerious and anxious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but delectable, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105107:62"/>
ones, whereby our
wit may be made more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and fine; Which ſurely
falls out, if we diſcourſe of
thoſe things pertaining to
the common profit of our
life, and which would be no
ill ſpent time, to ſpeak of
them in our ordinary affairs.
And in fine, it is both profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and pleaſant to inſtruct,
and be inſtructed, if it be
timed aright. I would have
a ſpeech in the firſt place, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
upon an apt occaſion,
and good ground. That it
ſeem neither catched before
it come to you, or intruded,
or affected, which is worſt of
all.</p>
            <p>There are three forms of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105107:63"/>
ſpeaking: diſſertation or
reaſoning, narration, and
queſtion. When you reaſon,
though you deſire praiſe
therein, yet you muſt ſeem to
decline the ſame. Let your
voice be pleaſant, and fluent,
and your geſture taking.
Speak in ſuch manner, that
you may ſhow your ſelf rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to hear; yea to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
if any man ſpeak bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than your ſelf: you
ſhould ſtir up your hearers
to give their opinion, with
ſome pauſes, now and then,
in your diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>In a Narration you muſt
be ſerious in true matters,
pleaſant in what is feigned,
and perſpicuous, and brief
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105107:63"/>
in all Diſcourſe of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
others with praiſe; of
what concerns your ſelf with
modeſty: ſelf vaunters are
loathſome to all company.
As ſome mens ſtomachs loath
ſome meats, out of ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
antipathy; ſo do ſuch
men offend the ears of their
Hearers. For (according
to <hi>Socrates</hi>) we muſt not
make uſe of thoſe meats, that
do not ſtir up an appetite
in us, ſo we muſt evity thoſe
ſpeeches, by which we fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
our own praiſe, more
then the delight of our Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>Now remains the Queſtion
to be treated of, which has an
anſwer annexed thereto. Let
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105107:64"/>
that be eaſie, familiar, and
ſuitable to your company.
As the clouds obſcure the
light of the Sun, ſo hath
difficult queſtions the ſame
effect upon hilarity.</p>
            <p>Your Queſtions muſt be
eaſie, (ſaith a Wiſe man)
known Problemes, decent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogations,
and not too
ſbtile, leſt they confound
the ignorant. It's a folly
to play the Divine and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
at a Feaſt, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when we are warm with
wine. But I will forbear to
enlarge any more upon that
Subject, and will ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of an anſwer to a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
becauſe it is annexed
thereto. Whereof there are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105107:64"/>
three ſorts. The firſt is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
one; when we ſay we
know or we know not. The
ſecond is a courteous one,
when we mix our anſwer
with civility. The third is
a ſuperfluous one; when we
go over the banks, ſo to ſay,
and when the Queſtion is
overwhelmed with a torrent
of garrulity, you ſhall hear it
demonſtrated by a homely
example. You go to the
houſe of <hi>Socrates</hi> to inquire
if he be at home, ſome brisk
fellow will give you the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
anſwer, he is not;
another more civil, will give
you the ſecond anſwer, he is
not at home, he is gone to the
haven; and if he think not
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105107:65"/>
that ſufficient, he will add,
ſome of his friends in <hi>Ionia</hi>
are landed, and he is gone to
welcome them. The third
again, to whom prating is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
pleaſant, will confound
his anſwer with a long
ſpeech, as if it could not be
known that <hi>Socrates</hi> was
from home, unleſs he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
from the Queſtion, by
making a narration of the
whole ſtate of <hi>Greece.</hi> Are
you enquiring for <hi>Socrates,</hi>
ſaith he, he is not at home,
he went to the haven betimes
in the morning, to entertain
ſome of his <hi>Ionian</hi> friends,
to whom <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> reſiding
at <hi>Miletus,</hi> with <hi>Tiſſaphernes</hi>
the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105107:65"/>
did write, who before
helped the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>
and now in favour of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades,</hi>
ſuccours the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>;
<hi>Alcibiades</hi> is about to
agree <hi>Tiſſaphernes</hi> with the
<hi>Athenians</hi>; that he may
have liberty to return to his
Country. So enlarging his
diſcourſe, he repeats the
whole Eighth Book of
<hi>Thucydides,</hi> until the taking
of <hi>Melitus,</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades</hi>
his ſecond baniſhment. But
I need preſcribe no more
Rules of this nature, you are
a rational man, and therefore
take what anſwer you think
will pleaſe beſt, according
to the Subject, Perſon and
Place where you are. I ſhall
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105107:66"/>
end my diſcourſe with this
of <hi>Quintilian.</hi> We ſhould
beware, ſaith he, that our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
be neither petulant nor
proud, nor diſagreeing with
the time, and place, and that
they ſeem not prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand,
or brought from
home with us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tabutius</hi> had ſcarce made
an end of ſpeaking, when the
door opening, we ſee a man
ſet in his head thereat, with a
viſor on his face, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Jupiter,</hi> who ſo ſoon as
he ſaw us, came ſuddenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the room, and ſaluting
each of us, through his viſor,
he complemented us with
his nods and geſtures. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently
taking me by the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105107:66"/>
hand, he fil'd the lap of my
Cloak, with a ſhower of ſweet
hail<note n="*" place="margin">Deſerts in <hi>Comus</hi> his Feasts.</note>;
I admiring the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and what <hi>Cimmerian Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
are you, ſaid I, who
ſtrike me with ſuch a ſweet
tempeſt. Then uncovering
his face, Behold me your
friend, ſaith he, having
changed my habit, but not
my affection. I looking
upon the man, as if my eyes
had deceiv'd me; are you
here alſo, ſaid I, <hi>Hyleus</hi>? and
what means this bravery?
There are nocturnal Plays to
be celebrated here this night,
ſaith he, and I am to make
one therein. There will be
ſome here preſently, who will
dance the old and pleaſant
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105107:67"/>
dances of the Muſes, and
Graces. Then did he ſo run
out in the praiſe of dancing,
both by his countenance and
geſture; that he could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refrain from the ſame,
whilſt he was ſpeaking to us.
While we were lending our
eyes and ears to his folly, in
comes a Black-a-moor Boy,
with a Torch in his hand, his
very colour made him one of
darkneſs companions. His
deportment did denote him
to be one of <hi>Hyleus</hi> his train.
This Boy coming up to his
Maſters ear, out of breath,
and whiſpering ſomething
therein, did name one <hi>Chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus</hi>
and <hi>Myrtilla,</hi> whereat
<hi>Hyleus</hi> being greatly moved,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105107:67"/>
having ſcarcely ſaluted us,
and reaſſuming his diſguiſe,
flings himſelf into the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting
Room. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<hi>Tabutius</hi>; Love is not
without madneſs, and a
burniug luſt ſtirs up this
young man to nocturnal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.
So it is always in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
his Feaſts, after they
have eat and drunk more
than plentifully, then comes
their dancing, the laſt dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of their laſcivious hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
For after the Table is
drawn, thoſe Rites muſt be
performed, though with a
ſtaggering motion. But
what can be done with a
good grace, where they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keep a <hi>decorum</hi> or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105107:68"/>

But he who has a mind for
a Maid, makes dancing, (oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times)
an introduction
thereto, and leads his Lady
as his Bride, ſhe follows him
keeping the ſame meaſure,
which inflames the young
Gallant. So it comes to paſs,
that young womens bellies
deceive men oft-times, as
well as their painted faces;
ſhe will dance as a Maid who
is preſently to become a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who will bring forth a
Child, before ſhe know a
Husband, or perhaps a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to it. To augment her
Dowry, ſhe brings both Cow
and Calf to her Husbands
Houſe. And before the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
has well begun to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105107:70"/>
the Ground, the Seed is
almoſt ripe. I have known
ſome of them, who, in the
very heat of their nuptial
Rites, did call for the help of
<hi>Juno,</hi> and <hi>Lucina</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Women in travel uſed to call for the help of thoſe Goddeſſes.</note>, and
were brought to bed, in the
very imbraces of their new
Husbands, and that ſame
night, and in the ſame bed,
both a Bride, and a Woman
lately delivered. But if
Men would do as a young
Gentleman did of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
there would not
be ſo many, who bring up the
children of other men. This
man did not think a woman
his wife, whom he had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
after another man had
defloured her. She who
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105107:71"/>
came as a Virgin, was found
(though too late) to be with
child, and was brought to
bed the ſecond month after
their marriage. This, though
it vexed, yet did not cauſe
the Husband bewray his
mind, by any harſh uſage to
her, or to her Child, but
comforting her, and mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her anxiety, by flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſſimulation; do not
vex your ſelf, my dear, ſaith
he, and let not your untimely
birth trouble you, the ſixth
part of a year may make you
a Mother, and me a Father;
Nature gives not always the
ſame time to bring forth, yea
ſhe grants a ſhorter time then
two months to ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105107:71"/>
But to be ſhort, after
the new-married Lady had
recovered her ſtrength, and
had ſacrificed to <hi>Juno</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The firſt time that women lately delivered went abroad, they ſa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

did her Husband at length
declare himſelf. Therefore
to remove the diſgrace from
his Family, he commanded
her to be gone; for his affairs
urged him to have another
wife. She obeyed him
(though againſt her will)
and ſo departed; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(having taſted the
ſweet pleaſure of conjugal
imbraces) it was hard for her
to want a Husband, ſhe fil'd

               </gap> houſe with her
complaints. The report of
this divorce comes preſently
to the ears of the Governour
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105107:72"/>
of the place, who was Uncle
to the Lady, he taking it as a
great wrong done to him, in
the perſon of one of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
ſends for <hi>Battus</hi> (for
that was the Gentleman's
name) and after he had blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this his raſh act, in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent
and grave Speech, he
did endeavour to reconcile
the young Lady to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
partly by threats, and
partly by intreaties. Then
<hi>Battus,</hi> who until that time
had been ſilent, began to
ſpeak very ſmoothly. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
thought it, ſaith he, an
uncomfortable thing to live
without a wife, and that it
was laudable, and praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:105107:72"/>

            </p>
            <p>For a man to bring up
Children to be a Monument
to himſelf and kindred.
Therefore I ſuffered my ſelf
to be married to this woman,
after I had examined the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of marriage, and
ſtrength of my Eſtate; As I
was reſolved to reckon as
many Children as years,
as the greateſt expence I
could be at, and thinking
my ſelf able to give an ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
out of my Rents, and
Eſtate, ſufficient to entertain
ſo great a number, I accepted
of both Wife and Dowry.
But O what a ſudden, and
prodigious fruitfulneſſe!
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105107:73"/>
Scarce two months were at
an end, when I hear the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a young Child; I was
a Father before I had well
laid aſide the name of a
Bridegroom; and without
doubt ſhe who brought forth
in her ſecond month, would
have augmented my Family
every year with ſix Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
ſo I ſhould have had an
Army of them, in a very
ſhort time; but I was not a
<hi>Craſſus</hi> to maintain them.
God forbid I ſhould throw
my ſelf, and my Children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to poverty.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Sir, I beſeech
you to pardon me, and to
ſeek a richer Husband to
your Neece, who is able to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105107:73"/>
beget, and bring up Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
not only every two
months, but every month
once. So he eluded the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
fair ſpeeches, broke
his ſeverity, and puniſhed
the trick put upon him, by
his diſcreet and witty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tabutius</hi> would have
gone on in his Diſcourſe,
when a loud noiſe makes all
the Pallace Eccho; Whereat
thoſe who were ſleeping in
the room, riſing haſtily, did
ruſh into the great Hall; But
<hi>Tabutius</hi> ſmiling, This is the
end of <hi>Comus</hi> Feaſt, Go you
and behold; but as for me, I
will not loſe my repoſe for
any new ſight. While we
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105107:74"/>
are riſing, in comes <hi>Hylaeus</hi>
his Boy to the Room, who
could ſcarcely draw his
breath with running. What
makes you ſo afraid, ſaid I?
and where is your Maſter?
Fury poſſeſſeth my Maſter,
ſaith he, and I am undone,
unleſs I ſave my ſelf by flight.
But do you not know, ſaid I,
to him again, that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
is our good Friend? if
you have done any fault, and
be flying from your Maſter's
wrath, we will intercede for
you. Take that pains for
another, ſaith the Boy; for I
am innocent. My Maſter
with an inconſiderate bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
has begun a conflict,
which I think he will not end
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105107:74"/>
ſo well; and juſt now, being
obliged by the (I know not
what) punctilio's of honour,
to take reparation of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
done him by his rival,
he has ſtirred up a number
of drunken people againſt
him. O what a madneſs is
this! He might have been
content with the moſt ardent
affection of <hi>Cires</hi>; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
his perfidious <hi>Myrtilla.</hi>
But (alas) I am partly the
cauſe of it, who told him that
<hi>Chereſtratus</hi> was here. To
gain my Maſter's affection, I
have thrown him into mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
danger. After thoſe
words, <hi>Tabutius</hi> taking the
Boy by the hand, deſired him
to relate that buſineſs more
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105107:75"/>
diſtinctly from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
The Boy was not hard
to be intreated, albeit he
would rather have fled.
Then taking his breath a
little, he begins his Story in
this manner.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Chereſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
a rich, and generous
young Gentleman, adorned
with Learning, and the
knowledge of his Arms, who
paſſionately loved a Noble
young Lady, of an exquiſite
beauty in our City; But ſhe
had placed an ardent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
long before, upon my
Maſter, who did not, for a
time, much regard it. Thoſe
things fall oft-times out in
<hi>Cupid</hi>'s Kingdom, and one
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105107:75"/>
beauty pleaſeth not all men;
But <hi>Chereſtratus,</hi> concealing
his paſſion from <hi>Myrtilla</hi> (ſo
was the Lady called) for
ſome cauſe or other; the
greateſt part of his conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was, to ſolace himſelf
under her windows, in the
night time, with the ſweet I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea
of his earthly Goddeſs.
His friend <hi>Panentus,</hi> finding
out his Malady, did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to cure him thereof, by
alluring him to come to the
Countrey, thereby to draw
the fewel from his growing
fire, by pleaſant Country di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements.
In the mean
time, the mind of the Lady
is exaſperate, by the harſh u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of her Mother, (for <hi>Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylla</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:105107:76"/>
did live under her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody,
after the death of her
Father) and when ſhe could
not digeſt the contumely,
(aſſuming confidence) ſhe
reſolved by a clandeſtine
flight, to put her ſelf in the
power of her Sweet-heart
<hi>Hyleus.</hi> Her waiting-woman
<hi>Circe,</hi> a comely and witty
Maid, did augment her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
temerity with all her
Rhetorick. This woman
ſaining one day to go to the
Temple, did ſecretly ſteal
into our houſe, and having
declared to my Maſter, her
Ladies intentions, began to
entreat him not to forſake a
Lady, afflicted by the too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid
ſeverity of her Mother,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:105107:76"/>
and that he would aſſiſt her,
who loved him; for <hi>Jupiter</hi>
would be moved (ſaith ſhe)
to come down from Heaven,
to aſſiſt ſuch a Beauty. Then
taking forth a coſtly Gold
Chain, (which did once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Father of her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
wherein the skill of the
Artificer, had repreſented by
divers colours of Gems, the
rape of <hi>Proſerpina,</hi>) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it to my Maſter, as a
pledge of her Ladies fidelity.
My Maſter taken both with
the Gift, and the Bearer
thereof, condeſcended to all
her Ladies deſires, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
his honour to fulfil her
commands. But while he is
ſpeaking to the Maid, ſhe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105107:77"/>
admiring his good mine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently
falls in love with
him. Notwithſtanding ſhe
goes on with her Deſign, and
this way of their flight did
pleaſe them beſt, that after
the Setting of Sun, <hi>Hyleus</hi>
ſhould come to the Gate of
<hi>Myrtilla</hi>'s Lodging, receive
her at the entry, and ſo carry
her away. The Plot being
laid, and <hi>Circe</hi> gone, my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
commands his Steward
and Cook, to go to his near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Country Houſe, and there
provide an excellent Supper.
He makes two of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades
conſcious to his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
whom he ſends a little
before night, to one of the
City Gates, that they might
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105107:77"/>
covenant with the Keeper
thereof for a free paſſage.
He himſelf mounting on a
<hi>Theſſalian</hi> Horſe, goes to
<hi>Myrtilla</hi>'s lodging; when he
was come into the ſtreet, and
near the houſe, he made his
Horſe ſtand, and there expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the out-coming of his
Lady; But ſhe being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
beyond her expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at home, could not ſo
ſoon withdraw her ſelf from
the ſight of her Mother. So
<hi>Hyleus</hi> rides by the houſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the next ſtreet, for fear of
ſuſpition, with an intent to
return ſhortly the ſame way.
But now <hi>Circe,</hi> who knew her
ſelf to be in love, would
needs go along with her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:105107:78"/>
to find out <hi>Hyleus,</hi>
the affection to her Miſtreſs
did colour her other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.
But the Lady began
to entreat her, not to hinder
their common deſires, by
her unſeaſonable ſervice;
for how, ſaith ſhe, can I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
my Mother, if you go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with me? and how will
one horſe carry us both? but
comfort your ſelf, you ſhall
come this ſame night; For
when I am gone, I ſhall
cauſe <hi>Hyleus</hi> ſend ſome of his
Servants, who ſhall carry
you away with the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
The Maid being
encouraged with ſuch words,
did commend the advice,
and was content to ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105107:78"/>
Now <hi>Cherestratus,</hi>
who had ſpent ſome days
with his friend, in great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of mind, could not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the want of his Miſtreſs
ſight any longer. Then
making to the fire that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
him, he gives <hi>Paneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
the farewell, takes his
Horſe, and comes to the town
in all haſt. He made the day
and the way alike long, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
did cover the laſt part of
his journey, and the City
Gates were ſhut before he
could reach. He began to
ride about the walls to ſeek
an entry, and coming to that
port, which was ſtanding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
for <hi>Hyleus,</hi> he entred
thereat. Then, as having
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105107:79"/>
gotten his entry by ſome
propitious Deity, he makes
a vow with great confidence,
that if he could gain any
ground on the heart of <hi>Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilla,</hi>
he would hang on
Golden <hi>Cupid</hi> to the ſtatue of
<hi>Venus</hi>; So putting ſpurs to
his Horſe, he gallops ſtreight
to the Ladies houſe. He came
a little after <hi>Hyleus</hi> paſt by,
and making the Horſe ſtand
ſtill juſt before the entry, he
ſalutes the ſame with a ſigh.
But behold at the very ſame
moment the Gate open, and
the Lady prepared for her
flight, ſeeing the Horſe, came
running to the Gentleman,
and with a low voice tells
him that ſhe was ready, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105107:79"/>
that ſhe had rather live for
the time to come with her
Lover, than in the power of
her Mother. So without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
mounting behind him,
ſhe embraces her lovely Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taure<note n="*" place="margin">

with her right arm.
The youth, adoring fortune
by a tacid acknowledgment,
turns his Horſe, and ſpurs
him forward the ſame way he
came, deſiring greatly to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
his lovely prey to ſome
place of ſecurity. So away
they come to the port, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
they got not any hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
by the companions of
<hi>Hyleus</hi>; for not being cal'd
on, they did not take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of thoſe they knew not.
But <hi>Chereſtratus</hi> rode on, at
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105107:80"/>
a round pace, and did not ſo
much as make a ſtop until
he was ten miles out of the
City; then he began to think
of enjoying the fruits of his
labour. The calm night,
and the pleaſantneſs of the
place did invite him; for
the Moon newly riſen, and the
twinkling Stars had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the horrour of the
night. Hard by there was a
pleaſant Meadow encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with a continued row of
Trees, and full of white and
yellow Flowers, you would
have thought that there had
been Stars upon the Earth in
emulation of the Heavens.
<hi>Venus</hi> did ſeem to ſport with
love, on the green and tender
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105107:80"/>
graſs. <hi>Chereſtratus</hi> ſetting
the Lady down, diſmounts
himſelf, and tying his Horſe
to a Tree, gives his <hi>Myrtilla</hi>
the firſt complements in
kiſſes, ſhe lifting up her eyes,
could not diſcern the object
of her joy in the face of her
imbracer; but when ſhe did
not find it to be <hi>Hyleus,</hi> ſhe
had almoſt fallen into a
ſwoun. Then did ſhe with
cries, and tears accuſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and began to tear her
beautiful face and hair. But
<hi>Chereſtratus</hi> after he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
the help of both
tongue and hands, did firſt
perſwade her from doing
violence to her face; Then
did he endeavour to make
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105107:81"/>
her pliable, by his amorous
complaints, Have pity upon
me, ſaith he, elſe I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done:
this is not the firſt
night of my affection;
therefore be not leſs pitiful
then fair. Will you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the decrees of fate? you
are faln almoſt by Miracle
into the hands of your Lover.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Do you reſolve to reſiſt my
true love?</l>
               <l>Doth not the place wherein we
are, you move.</l>
            </q>
            <p>By ſuch like Speeches he
ſtop'd her tears, and buried
her words amongſt her ſighs.
In fine, <hi>Myrtilla</hi> being mov'd
with ſuch manifeſt teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105107:81"/>
of his affection, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
the will of the Gods,
(as ſhe thought) did admit
of his Love. He thereby
growing the bolder, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with kiſſes, ended
with the full fruition of his
deſires.</p>
            <p>A little after <hi>Myrtilla</hi>'s
flight, my Maſter returns, and
coming cloſe up to the Gate,
he hears a noiſe. For the
Ladies flight being known
through the houſe, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate
Mother was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her Daughter from the
Maid, and filling the whole
houſe with fury. But ſhe
flying the old womans
threats, having unlocked the
Gate, comes running out, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105107:82"/>
thinking the man on horſe
back to be the ſame appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to carry her away, ſhe
preſently gets on behind
him. On the other hand,
<hi>Hyleus</hi> thinking he had <hi>Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilla</hi>
behind him, comes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
to his companions
at the Port. Thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
congratulating his
good fortune, accompanied
him to his Countrey-Houſe,
which was at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of a Wood, not above a
a mile from the City. I had
juſt brought a lighted Torch
to the entry, when <hi>Hyleus</hi>
going to ſalute his ſuppoſed
Miſtreſs, did with his eyes
find his error. Being in a
great confuſion, he began to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105107:82"/>
expoſtulate with the Maid;
And what deceit is this? ſaith
he, do you ſell the embraces
of your Lady after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?
had you no Lovers in
the City or do you deſpiſe
men of your own Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and will have none but
Gentlemen to Gallant you.
<hi>Circe</hi> admiring how ſhe
could be carried thither by
<hi>Hyleus.</hi> Pardon me, ſaith
ſhe, I came a Virgin, and
hope ſo to return; yet I might
have followed my Miſtreſs
as a Servant, and run the
ſame fortune with her. What,
ſaith <hi>Hyleus,</hi> came <hi>Myrtilla</hi>
out of Town before you? If
you ſeek only ſport, replied
the Maid, and would hear
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105107:83"/>
from me, what you did your
ſelf, I tell you ſhe was carried
away, and you brought me
hither a little after. But O
the bounty of a courteous
Miſtreſs! who ſuffered her
Maid <hi>Circe,</hi> to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by <hi>Hyleus</hi>; that the
Maid might ſhare of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of her Miſtreſs. Then
did <hi>Hyleus</hi> conſider too late,
that his moſt beautiful prey
had been ſnatched from him,
either by ſecret fraud, or
chance. herefore being
exceedingly vexed, both
with his diſappointed love,
and the affront he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he asked his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whether they had ſeen
an Horſeman at the Port, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105107:83"/>
a woman behind him. We
ſaw one, ſay they, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt <hi>Myrtilla</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him, and he took that
way, which leads to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
betwixt the mountains
neareſt the City, if you pleaſe
to follow, you may overtake
them before they be far gone.
Whereupon they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remount, and ſo depart
with all ſpeed, leaving <hi>Circe</hi>
behind them. We brought
her in, and deſired her to
ſup, which ſhe refuſed; ſhe
gives liverty to her tears, and
laments the misfortune of
<hi>Myrtilla,</hi> that ſhe might
more freely ſigh for <hi>Hyleus,</hi>
and ſo loaths all our dainties
and civilities. In the mean
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105107:84"/>
time <hi>Hyleus</hi> comes to the
ſame Meadow, wherein the
new Lovers had conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
their Marriage, and
were as yet lying ſleeping on
the ground; who, after he
had eſpied a Horſe tied to a
Tree, he looked about him,
and ſees the two Lovers in
each others arms. Knowing
the Lady to be his fair fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
he alights from his
Horſe, with an intent to pull
away <hi>Myrtilla,</hi> and run her
new lover through in her
ſight. But a more happy
Superiour power did miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
this cruelty: For his
companions coming up,
knew <hi>Chereſtratus,</hi> and their
ancient friendſhip did move
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:105107:84"/>
their hearts to mercy; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reſtraining the violence
of <hi>Hyleus,</hi> with their gentle
ſpeeches, they perſwaded him
to wait for the awaking of
the <hi>lovers,</hi> &amp; by their own <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi>
to know the truth of the
matter. When this counſel did
pleaſe them, they bind their
Horſes together, &amp; lie down;
but wearied with their journy
they immediately fall aſleep.
You would have thought, that
ſleep leaving the two Lovers,
had transfus'd it ſelf into <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus,</hi>
&amp; his fellows. For <hi>Chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus</hi>
awaking at that ſame
very moment, and by chance
looking to that place, where
at a little diſtance their horſes
were ſtanding, tyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105107:85"/>
he did admire what had
brought ſadled Horſes there,
at that time of the night.
Then ariſing, and going on a
little, he finds <hi>Hyleus</hi> ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Returning to <hi>Myrtilla,</hi>
he told her that <hi>Hyleus</hi> was
ſleeping hard by them, and
thereby had given them the
opportunity to flie the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time. But my dear,
ſaith he, be not afraid, but
get upon this Horſe, I ſhall
take care, that they return
home, without further harm,
becauſe they have not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
our ſweet repoſe. The
Lady, though trembling, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth,
and now ſhe begins
to be afraid of <hi>Hyleus</hi> as
much, as before ſhe had
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105107:85"/>
loved him. So much could
one night do on a woman,
whereby we may be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Arguments conclude, that
<hi>Cupid</hi> is but a baſtard whom
<hi>Venus</hi> did not bring forth.
But <hi>Chereſtratus</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
concerning the
Chain, could endure no love-token
to be in the poſſeſſion
of his Rival, and as if he had
not poſſeſſed his <hi>Myrtilla,</hi>
except he had that coſtly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of her covenanted flight
in his power, he went and
privately took it from his
neck. Then going to the
Horſes, he took the Bridles
off the heads of the firſt
and ſecond, and threw them
into a River running hard
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105107:86"/>
by, and mounting upon the
third, which was that brave
<hi>Theſſalian</hi> Horſe, whereon
<hi>Hyleus</hi> rode, he followed his
<hi>Myrtilla</hi> at a full gallop, and
brought her ſtreight to the
country of the <hi>Cimmerians.
Hyleus</hi> at laſt awaking, got to
his feet, and highly troubled
with the ſecond flight of the
two Lovers, did chide his
companions as the cauſes
thereof. But preſently miſſing
his Chain, his former
grief and anger turned
into fury, and reſolved now
to follow <hi>Chereſtratus</hi> no
more as a Rival, but as a
mortal Enemy. Then they
went to their Horſes, where at
length, my Maſter did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:105107:86"/>
that he was either to be
content with <hi>Circe,</hi> or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all. And becauſe
the power of the fates did
ſeem to have appointed <hi>Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilla</hi>
for another then <hi>Hyleus,</hi>
they began to think of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home, and ſo without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
making uſe of any thing
inſtead of their Bridles that
were loſt, they return all
three upon two Horſes. But
my Maſter taken with the
comelineſs of <hi>Circe,</hi> did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
(for a while) forget
<hi>Myrtilla,</hi> if his love had not
grown cold by his too much
ſatiety.</p>
            <p>He came as you ſee into
the company of <hi>Comus,</hi> where
he finds <hi>Chereſtratus,</hi> and ſees
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:105107:87"/>
               <hi>Myrtilla</hi> again, which was
the occaſion of the quarrel.
But what do I hear? Their
fury encreaſeth in the inner
part of the houſe, pardon me,
for I muſt be gone, and ſeek
ſome place of ſafety. So <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derba,</hi>
and I go to ſee the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of the buſineſs, leaving
<hi>Tabutius,</hi> meditating on the
Boys narration. But his words
were ſhort of the truth. For
it was no more a Feaſt, but a
Conflict; ſuch as was of old
betwixt the <hi>Lapiths</hi> and <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taurs,</hi>
we ſee <hi>Hyleus</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Magno <hi>Lapithis</hi> cratere
minantem.</q>
            <p>And again <hi>Chereſtratus</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:105107:87"/>
no leſs furious in anger, than
paſſionate in his affection, in
a poſture both of offence and
defence. But one of the
Cooks ſtanding by, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his Sweet-heart <hi>Circe</hi>
of both the Rivals, and when
words would not do it,
ſnatching the Diſhes upon
the Table (the effects of his
luxurious act,) he began to
throw them amongſt them.
One <hi>Bilbius</hi> alſo, a tongue-valiant
man amongſt the
<hi>Cimmerians,</hi> came upon the
head of a ſcurvy company of
Jeſters, but the durſt not

furious combatants; yet they
had almoſt daſh'd out their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:105107:88"/>
brains with ſtones at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
But we did admire
more at one of the dancers,
who in the heat of the <hi>conflict,</hi>
having his head wreathed
with a branch of Lawrel, did
urge the affection of a comely
Maid, and to ſeem worthy of
her affection, he would alſo
play the part of a Poet, and

            <p>After he had ended his
Song, <hi>Aderba</hi> breaking out
in laughter, I'le periſh ſaith
he, if ever this fellow made a

courts his Miſtreſs with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans labour; your

Verſes, when he went to try
if he could expreſs the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

the ſame <hi>Laopyrgus,</hi> with a

firſt pulling the Lute from
this Demi-poet, he afterward
threw his Garland from his
head, at our feet. <hi>Aderba</hi>
taking it up, (before I knew

But the Maid, afraid at this
ſudden accident, did flee
from her abuſed Lover, and
following the Garland, as if
ſhe had thought her ſelf ſafe
under that ſhadow of <hi>Daphne</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Taken here for the Lawrel-tree.</note> threw her ſelf in my arms.
I putting her gently from

mingled themſelves with the
men; ſome to lament the
blood of their friends with
doleful cries, and others to
fight, and to augment the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:105107:90"/>
fury, and amongſt the reſt
was the old woman who
wanted her Noſe Nor was
ſhe content to ſhew her fury
by her cries, but pulling a
Pole out of one of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
hands, did with the ſame
lay about her with more than
feminine force; and though
her thruſts were ineffectual,
yet by her blows ſhe made
many plain-fac'd people like
her ſelf. As if ſhe had been
revenging the loſs of her
Noſe in this Conflict; ſhe
filled all places where ſhe
came with tumult and fear.
When two of <hi>Hyleus</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
had felt the bloody
effects of her rage; at laſt, up
comes two ſtrong fellows,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:105107:91"/>
and according to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of her Noſe, with two
blows cut off both her ears;
While ſhe is howling and
crying for her loſs, in come
a Company of huffing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
amongſt whom was
the Souldier who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
the Noblemans
Wife, and did ſeem to exact
from her Adverſaries, not
only her Ears, but her Noſe
alſo, thinking by that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to ingratiate himſelf
ſo in her favour, as ſhould
move her to bring him, once
more, into the imbraces of
his Miſtreſs. At laſt the
Tables were overthrown,
and the Meat thereon trod
under foot; Some were beat
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:105107:91"/>
down with Stools, ſome were
defending themſelves with
Spits, and all were raging
with divers ſorts of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.
Then <hi>Comus,</hi> leaving
his Pleaſure, comes into the
middeſt of this raging Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to appeaſe them; but
their exaſperate minds
could by no means be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
thereto. Their fury in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
and did threaten
ſome ſudden miſchief. But
the God (becauſe he found
himſelf neglected, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed)
did vaniſh, together
with Luxury and Laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.
But their fury ſtill
continuing, they made uſe
of the Torches, and Lamps,
whereby all the Lights were
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105107:92"/>
put out. Then did Night,
Darkneſs, and all that black
Multitude, which ſtood at
the Palace Gate, break in,
and all this <hi>Cimmerian</hi>
darkneſs did vaniſh. But I
awaking out of Darkneſs,
Silence, and Sleep, did find
all this to be but a <hi>Dream.</hi>
