            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To the Mungrel new Athenian Republican <hi>Tyrants,</hi> or the pretended Parliament (if it needs muſt be ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Shall aſſume the boldneſs to ſpeak a little unto you, (O you men of <hi>Weſtminſter)</hi> and I pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my words, if Providence ſhall pleaſe to bring this my Paper unto your view. And firſt, let me deſire of you not to be angry, if I ſpeak ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to profit then to pleaſe you, forbearing altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe falſe and clawing expreſſions which your Adorers uſe when they addreſs themſelves to ſpeak unto you: I dare not tell you of any humble tenders of my ſmall conſtant devotion to ſerve you in your way, for I am ſure 'tis not the way of Chriſt and God, nor can I acknowledge your ſpurious <hi>Good old Cauſe</hi> under the pretence of Reformation and preſervation of Church and Commonwealth; for I know no ſuch matter, but rather the direct contrary. This being premiſed, <hi>I</hi> do now addreſs my ſelf unto you for the preſent in this manner. Tell us, <hi>O</hi> unhappy men that have been the principal inſtruments of all our woes, and have given life and motion to all our miſeries.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With what impudence could you affirm that there was a neceſſity to dethrone his late Highneſs, and to aboliſh the free choiſe and election of the people, the Repreſentatives: it hath been obſerved that in all innovations and rebellions (which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily have their riſe from pretences of Religion or reformation, or both,) the breach and neglect of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115255:3"/>
Laws hath been authoriſed by that great Patroneſs of illegal actions <hi>Neceſſity.</hi> But let that great rule be received, that no man can be neceſſitated to ſin, our Divines generally damn an officious lie, and the equity binds from any officious ſin; it would ſoon cut the nerves of the eighth Commandment, if neceſſities and urgencies, though real, were propounded a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient excuſe for ſtealing; but that (which you) the Jeſuitical powder-Traitors call <hi>neceſſity,</hi> is no more then neceſſity of convenience, nor ſo much, except we interpret that convenience, may favour your own ends, and ſo is convenient for your deſign; but you uſe <hi>neceſſity</hi> as the old Philoſophers did an occult quality, though to a different purpoſe; that was their refuge for ignorance, this is your ſanctuary for ſin. It is a maxime that you have out of <hi>Livy</hi> to maintain that, <hi>That war muſt needs be juſt that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and thoſe arms pious that are all our livelyhood; I</hi> muſt confeſs it was a thing very incongruous in the late interrupted Parliament, to deſire that thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull men ſhould leave their crutches, and to walk without them; 'tis no leſs unnatural to invite theſe Gentlemen to quit their ſwords whoſe lives and fortunes lean intirely upon them, and that this Juncto of Tyrants who will admit of no rule to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by, but their own wills; we know it was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy miſery of <hi>Athens,</hi> when it ſuffered under the thirty Tyrants: You that take to your ſelves the title of the Lords worthies, forſooth, but good names do not alwayes prove good men, titles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out truth, ſerve but to enhance and diſexcuſe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tell me, you curſed Cannibals, was not his late Highneſs proclaimed as Protector and Supream
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115255:3"/>
Magiſtrate by the Commanders in chief of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in the greateſt ſolemnity imaginable, firſt at the <hi>Exchange</hi> in <hi>London, Weſtminſter,</hi> and afterwards through the three Nations, with the greateſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the ſouldiers good will and liking, and of the peoples reception and entertainment with a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine contra dicente?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Have not the Officers and Souldiers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my afterwards upon more ſerious deliberation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed themſelves unto the Protector as a ſupream Magiſtrate, and ſo did further thereby oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by ſuch a kinde of tranſaction ſubject themſelves by way of the moſt ſolemn engagements unto him as ſupream Magiſtrate?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Did not our addle-brain'd Senators <hi>Fleetwood, Desborow, Lambert,</hi> cobling <hi>Hewſon, Cooper,</hi> thimbling <hi>Barkſtead, Bury,</hi> and the reſt of their Confederates, ſwear to be true to him as Protector, and how hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God and men, yea, to the very Heathen have ſuch things been, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. 12, 13, 14, 15. ſpeaking of the faith which the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Kings had given to the <hi>Babilonian, Shall he proſper, ſhall he eſcape that breaks the Covenant and be delivered,</hi> ver. 16, 18. <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord God, ſurely in the place where the King dwelleth that made him King, whoſe oath he deſpiſed and whoſe Covenant he brake, even with him in the midſt of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon <hi>he ſhall die, ſeeing he deſpiſed the oath by breaking the Covenant, and hath done all theſe things, ſhall he not eſcape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Tell us you <hi>Sear-ſoul'd</hi> men that will ſwear <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> tell me what an oath is? is it not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious affirmation, a promiſe with Gods Seal, and therefore it ſhould concern Chriſtians to be caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous before ſwearing to ſwear liquidly, and to obſerve
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115255:4"/>
conſcionably, 'tis pity ſuch ſlender evaſions ſhould ſatisfie us as hath been ſcorned by Heathen? ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience tell us how that you <hi>Engliſh Tigers,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of oaths, requiring promiſes, and other ſolemnities, have induced multitudes to binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon ſome ſecret, looſe and mental reſervation, which you have framed to your ſelves as a <hi>ſalvo</hi> in caſe of breach: But <hi>I</hi> ſee theſe <hi>Babylonian</hi> Sprats have adviſed more with corrupt wit, then ſound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: Tis an huge advantage that you <hi>(Delphick Devils)</hi> have in this world that can eaſily ſay and ſwear to any thing, and yet withall ſo palliate your falſifications and perjuries, as to hide them from the connuſance of moſt. <hi>I</hi> know conſcionable <hi>Lenthal</hi> hath already defended your perjuries with this <hi>Axiome;</hi> that though you ſwore (ſayes he) to a thing not materially unlawfull, if it impedes a moral good, it becomes void, and though you have taken liberty to ſwear, yet in my judgement (ſayes he) the perſon to whom you ſwore was incapable of an oath; juſt as <hi>Cicero</hi> defends the breach of an oath to a thief, from perjury; and <hi>Brutus</hi> to a Tyrant; as it is in <hi>Appion,</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> eſteem it an honeſt perjury to violate their faith with Tyrants. <hi>I</hi> ſee it is not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for you to caſt your deſires into ſuch ſoft glib ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as will down with moſt of you; yea, with many that would abſolutely diſavow the ſame thing in rough language. O Countrymen conſider whether this way wherein you have gone be not alſo contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the law of the land, and againſt common equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to practice the taking away from any one that which comes unto him by lawfull inheritance, ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or juſt election? whether you would not ſo judge it, if any ſhould diveſt you of what was left you by

your parents? Indeed if men come to power and authority by fraud and violence, as you our new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have done, and for yon to concur in oppreſſing the ſupream Magiſtrate, and in taking from him what belongs unto him, if conſcience be ſuffered to make report, it will be confeſſed to be the higheſt injuſtice; for as to detract from the Standard which is the rule of meaſures, is the greateſt ſin; ſo it is to detract from <hi>Carolus Rex,</hi> or Protector <hi>Richard,</hi> who are the Standards of righteouſneſs in this Kingdom; and for theſe incarnate devils, to ſubject, diſpoſe both King, Protector and People to their own lawleſs Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power and Government, which is but the product of a rabble of vaniſh'd Libertiniſm, Quakers, monſtrous Anabaptiſts, King-killers, Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Jeſuites, Seminaries and Papiſts, old Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder Traitors contrived that Good old Cauſe, Treaſon beyond the Seas, and in private ſecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles here, but now avowed in open general Councels of the Army, by whoſe deſign it is and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hath been to alter the whole frame of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy (both of Church and State) which is the beſt of Governments, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 14. being that of God himſelf over the whole world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 16. and of Chriſt himſelf in and over his Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 6.

            <p>That mammoniſtical Hypocrite, <hi>Hon.

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:115255:6"/>
Though the command of the peoples purſes was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired or practiſed by a ſingle perſon, and was not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſetled by Parliament, under one head?</p>
            <p>To Execute the Laws of the Government ſo made by Parliament, more pleaſing and rational, than to have a body conſiſting of ſo many Knaves, Drunkards, and Whore-maſters, which is monſter like.</p>
            <p>I deſire all Chriſtian people to conſider alſo the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this factious Generation, that have done more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and wrong to Chrifts Goſpel, than ever was offered ſince Chriſts time: never did any in ſo ſhort a ſpace aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to that zenith of villany, as they have done, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend more Godlineſſe, with the practice of ſo much wickedneſſe. I confeſſe they promiſe fair, like thoſe <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes unto, they begin in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with the mention of Sin and Mercy; they have the faces of men, but obſerve them well, we ſhall find they have the teeth of Lions, and the tail of Scorpions: my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſhall be on purpoſe to detect their wiles, that men may avoid them, and not be hurt by them, for they have got above board in theſe times, and ſtile themſelves in their ſcandalous Pamphlets, the Army of God, Gods only good Children; but in very deed their works ſpeak them not to be of God. <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

to themſelves to reform both the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Government of State; then becauſe poſſibly they might meet with ſome oppoſition, they ſecretly entred into a League of Aſſociation; and ſhortly after (find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power they had got with the credulous people) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched themſelves with all kind of ſpoyl, and pillage, and juſtified it upon our Saviours promiſe, <hi>The Meek ſhall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Earth;</hi> and declared their title was the ſame which the Righteous Iſraelites had unto the goods of the wicked Egyptians. This ſtory is worth the reading at large, and needs no application. For the avoiding of this ſhadow of Religion, I ſhall add an Antidote: External holineſſe invites awful regards: there is no mask that becomes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, Innovation, ſo well as Religion; nothing that ſo much conceals deformity, and pretends beauty. 'Tis an excellent thing ſo to diſſimulate piety, that when we act ſtrongly againſt it, in that very artick of wickedneſſe the people Saint us. <hi>Herod</hi> would fain worſhip, when he means to worry. This is that which leads the world in a ſtring, that hallows the moſt Helliſh enterpriſes: for the Common people (which are the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) never ſee behind the Curtain, a handſome gloſſe is with them as good as the Text: ('Tis the Ethick of theſe Hypocrites) Let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the temporal advantages of Religion, and let others take the eternal; Let us uſe it for a cloak or a crutch, and let others expect from it a Crown. The River <hi>Atheneus</hi> is my embleme, whoſe upper waters were ſweet and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but towards the bottom brackiſh; But let all ſober Chriſtians know, that this ſhell of Religion (which our new Maſters do ſo hotly perſue) though it may be of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conducement, that there is nothing that Gods pure and undeluded eye looks on with more abhorrency: we may poſſibly deceive men, but it is in vain to put Ironies upon God. A counterfeit Religion, ſhall find a real Hell,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115255:7"/>
and 'tis pitty that ſuch a ſacred thing ſhould be violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and made ſubſervient to rebellious irregular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
            <p>As for you gentlemen, who have conſpired with the wrath of God in the ſtupefaction of your conſcierc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, though you may for a time ſtruggle with thoſe inward checks, yet there will be a day (if not in this life) when that Witneſſe, that Judge, that Jury, will not be bribed.</p>
            <p>God hath fixed it in the Soul, as an internal Regiſter, as an impartial Diary, as the Cenſor of the affections, and the pedagogue of the paſſions, and you that have by an inveterate wickedneſſe conquered the oppoſitions which God ſeated in your hearts to ſin, may poſſibly conſult well with your preſent advantage and greatneſs, but not at all with his future comforts, for beſides the loſſe of that intimate pleaſure which waits upon inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. There is another wile that theſe Gibeonites have to ſeduce multitudes, and is ſo prevalent with moſt people; Their ſucceſſe in all enterpiſes, as their <hi>Demi</hi>-God <hi>Rogers,</hi> the forge and bellowes of ſedition, Infernal Emiſarie, ſtiles in his Pamphlet againſt Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> the bleſſed and ſucceſſefull Parliament. Seeing it is ſo great a Plea with theſe men, I will firſt ſhew, that ſucceſſe is no argument of a good cauſe; and then, that the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt men have moſt uſed it. Concerning the firſt, <hi>David</hi> in the 73 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> deſcribing the outward eſtate of evil men, ſayes, they were ſucceſsfull in their affaires; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the people thereupon came in apace unto them; yea, ſo proſperous they were in their way, that in a manner, he was non-plus'd at the matter. And <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> the Prophet argues with God about the ſame thing, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 12. why it ſhould be ſo, That they who dealt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115255:7"/>
treacherouſly, ſhould be ſo very happy; whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions alſo in another place he deſcribes more fully in theſe words, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 5 chapt. 26, 27. <hi>Among my people are found wicked men, who lie in wait, and ſet traps and ſnares to catch their brethren, their houſes are full of deceit and wrong,</hi> yea, they do (in their Juſtice and cruelty) ſurpaſſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men: <hi>they take upon them to be Judges, and yet judge not the cauſe,</hi> no not ſo much as <hi>the cauſe of the fatherleſſe, or the right of the needy; and yet they proſper, are become great, grown rich, waxen fat, and ſhine.</hi> Here was proſperity we ſee, here was ſucceſſe, but no honeſty, no goodneſſe. In the 11. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> 36. certain vile perſons (ſo intitled) are propheſied of, <hi>who ſhould do much miſchief againſt the holy people, whom they ſhould kill and destroy, and ſpeak blaſphemous things againſt the God of Gods; they ſhould honour onely the god of forces,</hi> i. e. they ſhould truſt only in their <hi>Militia,</hi> or ſtrength of weapons, for ſafety and protection: (all theſe it ſeems, are the conditions of vile perſons, and ſhould proſper for an appointed time, untill the indignation be accompliſhed (ſaies the Text) which was determined to be done.) VVe know that <hi>Cain</hi> prevailed againſt <hi>Abel,</hi> yet <hi>Abel</hi> was the better man, and offered the better ſacrifice: nay the Phariſees (we know) prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt himſelf for a ſeaſon, had their wills of him, got him Crucified by the common vote and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people, even according to the deſires of their own hearts. And from hence it was believed by a great many, that Chriſt was even ſuch a man as his enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him, a deceiver, and a malefactor: &amp; that it was the Judgement of God upon him for his ſins. <hi>He was deſpiſed, rejected of men,</hi> Eſay 53. 4. Hence it is that ſome of his Diſciples themſelves were ſo ſtaggered at the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that even they made a queſtion, whether he were the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115255:8"/>
man whom they took him to be, becauſe of that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe which his enemies had againſt him. Indeed it is the humor of men to paſſe ſentence upon others, from a view of their outward conditions; if they proſper, then they conclude them good, and beloved of God; if not, then wicked preſently. When the viper was ſeen hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on St. <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, he was judged a murtherer imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and the worſt of men in all the Company. Does not Scripture throughout, and dayly experience both, inform us, that the beſt men are uſually the moſt afflicted? and thus we ſee that to argue from ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe is but a weak kind of arguing. But I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the next place, that the worſt men have alwayes been wont to plead this Argument; one or two exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples amongſt many ſhall be alleged to this purpoſe. The Scripture tells of <hi>Rabſhaketh,</hi> when he moved the people of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (as theſe men do us) to make a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral revolt from good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he pretended that God had ſet him on work, and had ſaid, <hi>Go up against this Land, and deſtroy it,</hi> and his main argument was, his Maſters extraordinary great ſucceſſe, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 36. 10, 19. to which purpoſe he reckoned up (as our Tyrants doe) a great many Cities and Caſtles which he had taken, as <hi>Hamah,</hi> and <hi>Arphad, Sepharvaim,</hi> and <hi>Ivah.</hi> And ſo the Turks to this day argue againſt the Chriſtians, that their Religion excells ours, becauſe they have proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered better, and prevailed more than we have done. Indeed there is no Argument more popular than ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, becauſe the bulk of men is not able to diſtinguiſh the permiſſion of God from his approbation: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be in it ſelf fallacions and feeble, yet the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the conquered denies them the opportunity to diſpute it; for the oppoſition of the ſword will never be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115255:8"/>
confuted by the bare fiſt of <hi>Logick.</hi> I wonder that any would be ſo importunate to preach Laws and Moral reaſons to theſe men with ſwords by their ſides; who are like thoſe in <hi>Livy;</hi> That all Laws are engraven on the hilt of a victorious ſword, to whoſe <hi>Mandamus</hi> all other Statutes muſt ſubmit. But our new Maſters by quoting the ſucceſſe of their undertakings, beſides the plauſibleneſſe and inſinuating nature of the propoſition it ſelf, have the advantage of power to make us believe them; nor is this bait contemptible; many of parts and prudence, yea and of Religion, have been ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by it. The Heathen could ſay, happy Pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is a thing of unhappy preſidency; fortunate ſins may prove dangerous temptations; But for theſe men to ſay that God doth ſignally atteſt the actions of their perſons, or the Juſtice of their cauſe, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to proſper and taper up in the World, is ſuch a deceit, as deſerves our ſerious abhorrency. And now (Reader) let us mix our prayers, that God would for ever baniſh this cur<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

God permitting the Devil to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the Impoſture. And whilſt we are buſie with politick Stratagems, and tortious arms to invade the rights of others, let us all conſider, that this is not the violence which takes Heaven. It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that we are fallen into the dregs of time, we live in the ruſt of the Iron age, and muſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly expect to feel the dotages of a decrepit VVorld: what is become of truth, ſincerity, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
