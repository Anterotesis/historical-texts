            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Of the Parents and Birth of Fryer <hi>Bacon,</hi> and how he addicted himselfe to Learning.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E was borne by most mens opinions on the West part of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; was sonne to a wealthy Farmer, who put him to Schoole to the Parson of the Towne where hee was borne: not with intent that he should turne Fryer (as he did) but to get so much vnderstanding, that he might manage the better that wealth hee was to leaue him. But young
<pb facs="tcp:15238:2"/>
Bacon tooke his Learning so fast, that the Priest could not teach him any more, which made him desire his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster that he would speake to his Father to put him to <hi>Oxford,</hi> that he might not lose that little learning that hee had gained: his Master was very willing so to doe: and one day m√©eting his Father, told him, that hee had receiued a great blessing from God, in that he had giuen him so wise and hopefull a child, as his sonne <hi>Roger Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> was (for so was he named) and wished him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to doe his duty, and to bring vp so his Child, that hee might shew his thankfulnesse to God, which could not better be done then in making of him a Scholler; for he found by his sodaine taking of his learning, that hee was a childe likely to proue a very great Clerke: hereat old <hi>Bacon</hi> was not well pleased (for he desired to bring him vp to Plough and to the Cart, as hee himselfe was brought) yet he for reuerence sake to the Priest, showed not his anger, but kindly thanked him for his paines and counsell yet desired him not to speake any more concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that matter; for hee knew best what best pleased himselfe, and that he would doe: so broke they off their talke, and parted.</p>
               <p>So soone as the old man came home, he called to his Sonne for his bookes, which when he had, he lock'd them vp, and gaue the Boy a Cart whip in the place of them, saying to him: Boy, I will haue you no Priest, you shall not be better learned then I, you can tell now by the Almanack when it is best sowing Wheat, when Barley, Pease, and Beanes: and when the best libbing is, when to sell Graine and Cattell I will teach th√©e; for I haue all Faires and Markets as perfit in my memory, as Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> our Priest has Masse without Booke: take mee this whip, I will teach th√©e the vse of it, it will be more profitable to th√©e then this harsh Latin: make no reply, but follow my counsell, or else by the Masse thou shalt f√©ele the smart hand of my anger. Young <hi>Bacon</hi> thought this but hard dealing, yet would he not reply, but within

the whole world had bin there prepared in the best man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that Art could set them out: whilst h√©e feasted thus their smelling, h√©e waued his wand againe, and there came diuers Nations in sundry habits (as Russians, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, Indians, Armenians) all bringing sundry kinds of Furres, such as their Countries y√©elded: all which they presented to the King and Qu√©ene: these Furres were so soft in the touch, that they highly pleased all those that handled them, then after some odde fantasticke dances (after their Countrey manner) they vanished a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: then asked Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> the Kings Maiesty, if that h√©e desired any more of his skill? the King answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that h√©e was fully satistied for that time, and that h√©e onely now thought of something that h√©e might bestow on him, that might partly satisfie the kindnesse that h√©e had receiued. Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> said, that h√©e desired nothing so much as his Maiestice loue, and if that he might be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of that, h√©e would thinke himselfe happy in it: for that (said the King) be thou euer sure of it, in token of which receiue this Iewell, and withall gaue him a costly Iewell from his necke. The Fryer did with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence thanke his Maiestie, and said: as your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties vassall you shall euer finde me ready to doe you ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, your time of n√©ede shall finde it both beneficiall and delightfull. But amongst all these Gentlemen, I s√©e not the man that your Grace did send for me by, sure he hath lost his way, or else met with some sport that detaines him so long, I promised to be here before him, and all this noble Assembly can witnesse I am as good as my word; I heare him comming: with that entered the Gentleman all be durted (for he had rid through ditches, quagmires<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> plashes, and waters, that h√©e was in a most pittifull case) h√©e s√©eing the Fryer there looked full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly, and bid a pore on all his Deuils, for they had led him out of his way, and almost drowned him. Be not angry Sir (said Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi>) here is an old friend of yours that hath more cause; for sh√©e hath tarried these
<pb facs="tcp:15238:3"/>
thr√©e houres for you (with that hee pulled vp the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, and behinde them stood a Kitchin-maide with a hasting ladle in her hand) now am I as good as my word with you: for I promised to helpe you to your sw√©et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart, how do you like this? So ill, answered the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that I will be reuenged of you. Threaten not (said Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi>) least I do you more shame, and doe you take h√©ede how you giue schollers the lye againe: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I know not how well you are stored with money at this time, I will beare your wenches charges home; with that she vanished away: the King, Qu√©ene, and all the company laughed to s√©e with what shame this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman indured the sight of his greasie sw√©et-heart: but the Gentleman went away discontented. This bone, Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> tooke his leaue of the King and Qu√©ne, and receiued from them diuers gifts (as well as thankes) for his Art he shewed them.</p>

               <head>How Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> deceiued his Man, that would fast for his conscience sake.</head>
               <p>FRyer <hi>Bacon</hi> had one onely man to attend on him, and h√©e too was none of the wisest, for hee kept him in charity, more then for any seruice he had of him. This man of his (named <hi>Miles</hi>) neuer could indure to fast as other religious persons did, for alwayes hee had in one corner, or another, flesh, which hee would eate when his Maister eat bread only, or else did fast and abstaine from all things. Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> s√©eing this, thought at one time or other to be euen with him, which he did one Fryday in this manner. <hi>Miles</hi> on the Thursday night had proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a great blacke-pudding for his Frydayes fast; this pudding put he in his pocket (thinking belike to heate it so, for his Maister had no fire on those dayes) on the next day, who was so demure as <hi>Miles,</hi> hee looked as though hee would not haue eat any thing: when his
<pb facs="tcp:15238:3"/>
Maister offered him some bread, h√©e refused it, saying, his sinnes deserued a greater penance then one dayes fast in a whole w√©eke: his Maister commended him for it, and bid him take h√©ed that he did not dissemble: for if he did, it would at last be knowne; then were I worse then a Turke said <hi>Miles</hi>: so went he forth as if he would haue gone to pray priuately, but it was for nothing but to prey vpon his blacke pudding; that pulled he out, (for it was halfe roasted with the heate of his bum) and sell to it lustily; but he was deceiued, for hauing put one end in his mouth, he could neither get it out againe nor bite it off, so that hee stamped out for helpe: his Maister hearing him, came, and finding him in that manner, tooke hold of the other end of the pudding, and led him to the hall, and shewed him to all the Schollers, saying: S√©e here my good friends and fellow Students what a deuout man my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant <hi>Miles</hi> is, he loueth not to breake a fast day, witnesse this pudding that his conscience will not let him swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: I will haue him to be an example for you all, then tyed hee him to a window by the end of the pudding, where poore <hi>Miles</hi> stood like a Beare tyed by the nose to a stake, and indured many floutes and mockes: at night his Maister released him from his penance; <hi>Miles</hi> was glad of it, and did vow neuer to breake more fast dayes whilst that he liued.</p>

               <head>How Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> saued a Gentleman that had giuen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the Deuill.</head>
               <p>IN <hi>Oxfordshire</hi> there liued a Gentleman, that had through his riotous expences wasted a faire Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that was left him by his father: After which hee grew so poore, that hee had not wherewith to buy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so much bread as would maintaine his miserable life: the memory of his former state that hee had liued
<pb facs="tcp:15238:4"/>
in, and the present want that he now sustained, made him to grow desperate and regardlesse both of his soule and bodies estate; which gaue the Deuill occasion to worke vpon his weaknesse in this manner following.</p>
               <p>On a time, hee being alone full of griefe and care, (griefe for his follies past, and care how to get a poore liuing for the remainder of his dayes) the Deuill came to him and asked him what h√©e wanted (h√©e came not in a shape terrible, but like an old penny-father.) This Gentleman was amazed at his sodaine presence, but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him demand of his wants, h√©e tooke to him courage and said: I want all things, I want money to buy my apparell, money to buy m√©e meat, money to red√©eme my Land, and money to pay my debts: Can, or will you helpe m√©e in this misery? I will, answered the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, on some conditions helpe you to money for to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all these wants, and that sodainly. On any condition, said the Gentleman, helpe m√©e, and I sweare for to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them: I take no oathes (answered the Deuill) I must haue bonds, if you will doe so, m√©et m√©e by the Woods side to morrow morning, and there I will haue the moneys ready: I will, said the Gentleman (for h√©e poore man was glad of it on any conditions, as hee said (before.) The next day hee went to the Wood where the Deuill had promis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The Deuill comming to him said: sonne I will performe my promise vnto you, if that you will seale to the conditions that I haue here already drawne: willingly said-the Gentleman, I will, I pray read them The Deuill read them to this effect; that he lent him so much money as he should haue n√©ed of, to be imployed to these vses follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: First, to red√©eme his morgag'd Land; next to pay his debts: lastly, to buy him such necessaries as h√©e wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<pb facs="tcp:15238:4"/>
this to be lent on this condition, that so soone as he had paid all his debts, that he should be at the lenders dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, and without any delay, fr√©ely to y√©eld himselfe to him vpon the first demand of the aforesaid lender. To this the Gentleman sealed, and had the money carried to his Chamber, with which money h√©e in short time red√©emed his Land, and bought such things as he n√©eded, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise payed all his debts, so that there was not any man that could aske of him one penny.</p>
               <p>Thus liued this Gentleman once againe in great credit, and grew so great a husband that h√©e increased his estate, and was richer then euer his father before him was: but long did this ioy of his not continue, for one day h√©e being in his Studie the Deuill appeared vnto him, and did tell him that now his Land was red√©emed, and his debts paid, and therefore the time was come that hee must y√©eld himselfe to his mercy, as h√©e was bound by bond. This troubled the Gentleman to heare, but more to thinke how that he must become a slaue to a stranger that h√©e did not know (for h√©e knew not as yet that he was the Deuill) but being vrged to answer for himselfe (by the Deuill) h√©e said that h√©e had not as yet paid all his debts, and therefore as yet h√©e was not liable to the bonds strait conditions. At this the Deuill s√©emed angry and with a fearefull noyse transformed himselfe to an vgly shape, saying: Alas poore wretch, these are poore excuses that thou framest, I kn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When h√©e was gone, the Gentleman reuiuing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himselfe in what a miserable state he was now in, then wished he that he had liued and died poorely, then cursed he all his ambitious thoughts, that led him first to desire againe that wealth which he had so vainly by his riot lost: then would hee curse his prodigall expences
<pb facs="tcp:15238:5"/>
that were the originall of all his misery: thus was he tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented along time in his minde, at last he fully resolued to end his wretched life by some violent death, and to that end he went forth thinking to kill himselfe, which he had done, had it not b√©ene for the Fryer: for as he was falling vpon his sword, Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> came by and called to him to hold, which he did. Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> demanded of him the cause why he was so desparate that he would run headlong to hell? O sir, said he, the cause is great, and the relation is so terrible to me, that I would intreat you not to trouble me any more, but to leaue me to my owne wil: his answer filled the Fryer with amazement &amp; pitty both at once, which made him to vrge him in this manner. Sir, should I leaue you to his wilfull damnation, I were vnfit euer hereafter to weare or touch any robe that belongeth vnto the holy Order, whereof I am a Brother; you know (I doubt not) that there is giuen power to the Church to absolue penitent sinners, let not your wilfulnesse take away from you that benefit which you may receiue by it: fr√©ely confesse your selfe (I pray) you vnto me, and doubt not but I will giue your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conscience ease: Father (said this Gentleman) I know all that you haue spoken is truth, and I haue many times receiued comfort from the mother Church, (I dare not say our, for I feare that shee will neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue me for a childe) I haue no part in her benediction, yet since you request so earnestly the cause, I will tell you, heare it and tremble. Know then that I haue giuen my selfe to the deuill for a little wealth, and he to morrow in this Wood must haue m√©e: now haue you my griefe, but I know not how to get comfort. This is strange (quoth Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi>) yet be of good comfort, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiall teares may doe much, which s√©e you doe not spare: soone I will visit you at your house, and giue you that comfort (I hope) that will beget you againe to goodnesse: the Gentleman with these words was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what comforted and returned home. At night Fryer
<pb facs="tcp:15238:5"/>
                  <hi>Bacon</hi> came to him and found him full of teares for his haynous offence, for those teares he gaue him hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, demanded further what conditions hee had made with the Deuil: the gentleman told him, how that he had promised himselfe to him so soone as he had paid all his debts: which he now had done, for he owed not one peny to any man liuing. Well, said Fryer <hi>Bacon,</hi> continue thy sorrow for thy sinnes, and to morrow meete him without feare, and be thou content to stand to the next mans iudgement that shall come that way, whether thou doest belong to the deuill or no: feare not, but do so, and be thou assured that I will be he that shall come by, and will giue such iudgement on thy side, that thou shalt bee free from him: with that Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> went home, and the Gentleman went to his prayers.</p>
               <p>In the morning the Gentleman (after that he had blessed himselfe) went to the Wood where he found the deuill ready for him, so soone as he came n√©ere, the deuill said: now deceiuer are you come, now shalt thou s√©e that I can and will proue that thou hast paid all thy debts, and therefore thy soule belongeth to me. Thou art a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer (said the gentleman) and gauest me money to cheat me of my soule, for else why wilt thou be thy own Iudge: let me haue some other to iudge betw√©ene vs. Content said the Deui<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>l, take whom thou wilt: then I will haue (said the gentleman) the next man that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>meth this way: hereto the Deuill agr√©ed. No sooner were these words ended, but Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> came by, to whom this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man spake, and requested, that he would be iudge in a waighty matter betw√©ene them two: the Fryer said, he was content, so both parties were agr√©ed: the Deuill said they were, and told Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> how the case stood betw√©ene them in this manner.</p>
               <p>Know Fryer, that I s√©eing this prodigal like to starue for want of food, lent him money, not onely to buy him victuals, but also to red√©eme his lands and pay his debts, conditionarily that so soone as his debts were paid, that
<pb facs="tcp:15238:6"/>
h√©e should giue himselfe fr√©ely to m√©e, to this here is his hand (shewing him the Bond) now my time, is expired, for all his debts are paid which h√©e cannot denie. This case is plaine, if it be so that his debts are paid: his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence confirmes it said the Diuell, therefore giue him a iust sentence. I will said Frier <hi>Bacon:</hi> But first tell me (speaking to the Gentleman) didst thou neuer yet giue the Deuill any of his mony backe, nor requite him any wayes: neuer had h√©e any thing of me as yet (answered the Gentleman) then neuer let him haue any thing of th√©e and thou art fr√©e: deceiuer of mankind, said he (speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Deuill) it was thy bargaine, neuer to meddle with him so long as h√©e was indebted to any, now how canst thou demand of him any thing, when he is indebted for all that h√©e hath to th√©e, when h√©e payeth th√©e thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, then take him as thy due; till then thou hast nothing to doe with him: and so I charge th√©e to be gone. At this, the Deuill vanished with great horror, but Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> comforted the Gentleman, and sent him home with a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et conscience, bidding him neuer to pay the Deuils money backe as he tendred his owne safety: which he promised for to obserue.</p>

               <head>How Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> made a Brasen head to speake, by the which hee would haue walled <hi>England</hi> about with Brasse.</head>
               <p>FRyer <hi>Bacon</hi> reading one day of the many conquests of England, bethought himselfe how h√©e might k√©epe it hereafter from the like conquests, and so make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe famous hereafter to all posterities: This (after great study) h√©e found could be no way so well done as one; which was to make a head of Brasse, and if he could make this head to speake (and heare it when it speakes) then might h√©e be able to wall all England about with Brasse. To this purpose h√©e got one Fryer <hi>Bungey</hi> to assist him, who was a great Scholler and a Magician,
<pb facs="tcp:15238:6"/>
(but not to b√©e compared to Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi>) these two with great study and paines so framed a head of Brasse, that in the inward parts thereof there was all things (like as is in a naturall mans head: this being done, they were as farre from perfection of the worke as they were before, for they knew not how to giue those parts that they had made motion, without which it was impossible that it should speake: many bookes they read, but yet could not finde out any hope of what they sought, so that at the last they concluded to raise a spirit, and to know of him that which they could not attaine to by their owne studies. To do this they prepared all things ready and went one Euening to a Wood thereby, and after many ceremonies vsed, they spake the words of coniura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Deuill straight obeyed and appeared vnto them, asking what they would? know, said Fryer <hi>Bacon,</hi> that w√©e haue made an artificiall head of Brasse, which w√©e would haue to speake, to the furtherance of which w√©e haue raised th√©e, and being raised, w√©e will here k√©epe th√©e, vnlesse thou tell to vs the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how to make this Head to speake. The Deuill told him that he had not that power of himselfe: beginner of lyes (said Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi>) I know that thou dost dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore tell it vs quickly, or else w√©e will here bind th√©e to remaine during our pleasures. At these threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings the Deuill consented to doe it, and told them, that with a continuall sume of the sir hotest Simples it should haue motion, and in one month space speake, the Time of the moneth or day h√©e knew not: also h√©e told them, that if they heard it not before it had done speaking, all their labour should be lost: they being satisfied, licensed the Spirit for to depart.</p>
               <p>Then went these two learned Fryers home againe, and prepared the Simples ready, and made the fume, and with continuall watching attended when this Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen head would speake: thus watched they for thr√©e w√©ekes without any rest, so that they were so weary
<pb facs="tcp:15238:7"/>
and sl√©epy, that they could not any longer retaine from rest: then called Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> his man <hi>Miles,</hi> and told him, that it was not vnknowne to him what paines Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Bungy</hi> and himselfe had taken for thr√©e w√©ekes space, onely to make, and to heare the Brasen-head speake, which if they did not, then had they lost all their labour, and all <hi>England</hi> had a great losse thereby: therefore h√©e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated <hi>Miles</hi> that he would watch whilest that they sl√©ep, and call them if the Head speake. Feare not, good Master (said <hi>Mailes</hi>) I will not sl√©epe, but harken and attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head, and if it doe chance to speake, I will call you: therefore I pray take you both your rests and let m√©e a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for watching this head. After Fyer <hi>Bacon</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him a great charge: The second time, Fryer <hi>Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> and he went to sl√©epe, and left <hi>Miles</hi> alone to watch the Brasen head: <hi>Miles,</hi> to k√©epe him from sleeping, got a Tabor and Pipe, and being mercy disposed, sung this Song to a Northren tune,</p>

               <head>How Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> by his Art tooke a Towne, when the King had lyen before it three months, without doing to it any hurt.</head>
               <p>IN those times when Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> did all his strange trickes, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had a great part of <hi>France,</hi> which they held a long t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>er many victories, hee did besiege a strong Towne, and lay before it full thr√©e moneths, without doing to the Towne any great damage, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the hurt himselfe. This did so vexe the King, the h√©e sought to take it in any way, either by policy or strength: To this intent hee made Proclamation<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that whosoeuer could deliuer this Towne into his hand, h√©e should haue for his paines ten thousand C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This was proclaimed, but there was none found that would vndertake it: At length she newes did come into <hi>England</hi> of this great reward that was promised. Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> hearing of it, went into <hi>France,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted to the Kings presence, hee thus <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>pake vnto him: Your Maiestie I am sure, hath not quite forgot your poore subiect <hi>Bacon,</hi> the loue that you shewed to mee being last in your presence, hath drawne m√©e for to leaue my Countrey, and my Studies, to doe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie seruice: I bes√©ech your Grace, to command m√©e so farre as my poore Art or life may doe you pleasure. The King thanked him for his loue, but told him, that
<pb facs="tcp:15238:9"/>
h√©e had now more n√©ed of Armes then Art, and wanted braue Souldiers more then learned Schollers. Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> answered, Your Grace saith well; but let m√©e (vnder correction) tell you, that Art oftentimes doth those things that are impossible to Armes, which I will make good in some few examples. I will speake one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of things performed by Art and Nature, wherein shall be nothing Magicall: and first by the figuration of Art, there may be made Instruments of Nauigation without men to rowe in them, as great Ships to brooke the Sea, onely with one man to steere them, and they shall sayle farre more swiftly then it they were full of men. Also Chariots that shall moue with an vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able force, without any liuing creature to stirre them. Likewise, an Instrument may be made to flye withall, if one fit in the midst of the Instrument, &amp; doe turne an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, by which the wings being Artificially composed, may beat ayre after the manner of a flying Bird. By an Instrument of thr√©e fingers high, and thr√©e fingers broad, a man may rid himselfe and others form all Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yea, such an Instrument may easily be made, whereby a man may violently draw vnto him a thousand men, will they, nill they, or any other thing. By Art also an Instrument may b√©e made, wherewith men may walke in the bottome of the Sea or Riuers without bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly danger: this <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great vsed (as the Ethnick Phylosopher reporteth) to the end he might behold the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Seas. But Physicall Figurations are farre more strange: for by that may be framed Perspects and Looking-glasses, that one thing shall appeare to be many, as one man shall appeare to be a whole Army, and one Sunne or Moone shall seeme diuers. Also perspects may be so framed, that things farre off shall s√©eme most nigh vnto vs: With one of these did <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> from the Sea coasts in <hi>France</hi> marke and obserue the situation of the Castles in <hi>England.</hi> Bodies may also be so framed, that the greatest things shall appeare to be the least, the
<pb facs="tcp:15238:10"/>
highest lowest, the most secret to b√©e the most manifest, and in such like sort the contrary. Thus did <hi>Socrates</hi> perceiue, that the Dragon which did destroy the Citie and Countrey adioyning with his noysome breath, and contagious influence, did lurke in the dennes betw√©ene the Mountaines: and thus may all things that are done in Cities or Armies be discouered by the enemies. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in such wise may bodies b√©e framed, that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and infectious influences may be brought whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man will: In this did <hi>Aristotle</hi> instruct <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> through which instruction the poyson of a Basiliske, being lift vp vpon the wall of a Citie, the poyson was conuayd into the Citie, to the destruction thereof: Also Perspects may be made to deceiue the sight, as to make a man bel√©eue that h√©e s√©eth great store of riches, when that there is not any. But it appertaineth to a higher power of Figuration, that beames should be brought and assembled by diuers flexions and reflexions in any distance that we will, to burne any thing that is apposite vnto it, as it is witnessed by those Perspects or Glasses that burne before and behinde: But the greatest and chiefest of all figurations and things fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured, is to describe the heauenly bodies, according to their length and breadth in a corporall Figure, wherein they may corporally moue with a daily motion. These things are worth a Kingdome to a wise man. These may suffise, my royall Lord, to shew what Art can doe: and these, with many things more as strange, I am able by Art to performe. Then take no thought for winning this Towne; for by my Art you shall (ere many dayes be past) haue your desire.</p>
               <p>The King all this while heard him with admiration: but hearing him now say, that h√©e would vndertake to win the Towne, h√©e burst out in these sp√©eches: Most learned <hi>Bacon,</hi> doe but what thou hast said, and I will giue th√©e what thou most desirest, either wealth, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, choose which thou wilt, and I will be as ready to
<pb facs="tcp:15238:10"/>
performe, as I haue b√©ene to promise.</p>
               <p>Your Maiesties loue is all that I s√©eke (said the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) let mee haue that, and I haue honour enough, for wealth, I haue content, the wise, should s√©eke no more: but to the purpose. Let your Pioners raise vp a mount so high (or rather higher) then the wall, and then shall you see some probability of that which I haue promised.</p>
               <p>This Mount in two dayes was raised: then Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> went with the King to the Top of it, and did with a perspect shew to him the Towne, as plainely as if h√©e had beene in it: at this the King did wonder, but Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> told him, that h√©e should wonder more, ere next day noone: against which Time, he desired him to haue his whole Army in readinesse, for to scale the wall vpon a signall giuen by him, from the Mount. This the King promised to doe, and so returned to his Tent full of Ioy, that h√©e should gaine this strong Towne. In the morning Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> went vp to the Mount and set his Glasses, and other Instruments vp: in the meane time the King ordered his Army, and stood in a readinesse for to giue assault; when the signall was giuen, which was the wauing of a Flagge: Ere nine of the clocke Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> had burnt the State-house of the Towne, with other houses onely by his Mathematicall Glasses, which made the whole Towne in an vprore, for none did know how it came: whilest that they were quenching of the same, Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> did waue his Flagge: vpon which signall giuen, the King set vpon the Towne, and tooke it with little or no resistance. Thus through the Art of this learned man the King got this strong Towne, which h√©e could not doe with all his men without Fryer <hi>Bacons</hi> helpe.</p>

               <p>THE King of England after h√©e had taken in the Towne, shewed great mercy to the Inhabitants, giuing some of them their liues fr√©ely, and others h√©e set at libertie for their Gold: the Towne h√©e kept as his owne, and swore the chiefe Citizens to be his true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. Presently after the King of France sent an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour to the King of England, for to intreat a peace betw√©ene them. This Ambassadour being come to the King, he feasted him (as it is the manner of Princes to doe) and with the best sports as he had then, welcomed him. The Ambassadour seeing the King of England so free in his Loue, desired likewise to giue him some taste of his good liking, and to that intent sent for one of his fellowes (being a Germane, and named <hi>Vandermast</hi>) a famous Coniurer, who being come, h√©e told the King, that since his Grace had b√©ene so bountifull in his loue to him, he would shew him (by a seruant of his) such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull things, that his Grace had neuer s√©ene the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The King demaunded of him, of what nature those things, were that h√©e would doe? The Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour answered, that they were things done by the Art of Magicke. The King hearing of this, sent straight for Fryer <hi>Bacon,</hi> who presently came, and brought Fryer <hi>Bungey</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>When the Banquet was done, <hi>Vandermast</hi> did aske the King, if h√©e desired to s√©e any Spirit of any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased; and if that he did, h√©e would raise him in such manner and fashion as he was in when that h√©e liued. The King told him, that aboue all men h√©e desired to s√©e <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, who could abide no equall. <hi>Vander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast</hi> by his Art raised him, armed in such manner as h√©e
<pb facs="tcp:15238:11"/>
was when h√©e was slaine at the Eattell of <hi>Pharsalia</hi>: at this they were all highly contented. Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently raised the ghost of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who could abide no Superiour, and had slaine this <hi>Pompey</hi> at the Battell of <hi>Pharsalia</hi>: At the sight of him they were all amazed, but the King who sent for <hi>Bacon</hi>: and <hi>Vandermast</hi> said that there was some man of Art in that presence, whom h√©e desired to s√©e. Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> then shewed himselfe, saying; It was I <hi>Vandermast,</hi> that raised <hi>Caesar,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue content to this royall presence, but chiefely for to conquer thy <hi>Pompey,</hi> as he did once before, at that great Battell of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> which he now againe shall doe. Then presently began a fight being <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> which continued a good space, to the content of all, except <hi>Vandermast.</hi> At last <hi>Pompey</hi> was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and slaine by <hi>Caesar;</hi> then vanished they both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>My Lord Embassadour (said the King) me thinks that my Englishman hath put downe your German: hath he no better running then this? Yes, answered <hi>Vander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast,</hi> your Grace shall s√©e me put downe your English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ere that you goe from hence: and therefore Fryer prepare thy selfe with thy best of Art to withstand me. Alas, said Fryer <hi>Bacon,</hi> it is a little thing will serue to resist th√©e i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fryer <hi>Bungey</hi> then began to shew his Art; and after some turning and looking on his Booke, he brought vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them the <hi>Hysperian</hi> Tree, which did beare golden Apples; these Apples were kept by a waking Dragon, that lay vnder the Tr√©e: H√©e hauing done this, bid <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermast</hi> finde one that durst gather the fruit. Then <hi>Vandermast</hi> did raise the ghost of <hi>Hercules</hi> in his habit that he wore when that he was liuing, and with his Club on his shoulder: Here is one, said <hi>Vandermast,</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:15238:12"/>
shall gather fruit from this Tr√©e: this is <hi>Hercules,</hi> that in his life time gathered of this Fruit, and made the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon couch: and now againe shall h√©e gather it in spight of all opposition: As <hi>Hercules</hi> was going to plucke the fruit, Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> held vp his wand, at which <hi>Hercules</hi> stayed and s√©emed fearefull. <hi>Vandermast</hi> bid him for to gather of the fruit, or else h√©e would torment him. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> was more fearefull, and said, I cannot, nor I dare not; for here great <hi>Bacon</hi> stands, whose charmes are farre more powerfull then thine, I must obey him <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermast.</hi> Hereat <hi>Vandermast</hi> curst <hi>Hercules,</hi> and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him: But Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> laughed, and bid him not to chafe himselfe ere that his iourney was ended; for s√©eing (said he) that <hi>Hercules</hi> will doe nothing at your command, I will haue him doe you some seruice at mine: with that h√©e bid <hi>Hercules</hi> carry him home into Germany. The Deuill obeyed him, and tooke <hi>Vandermast</hi> on his backe, and went away with him in all their sights. Hold Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, cried the Embassadour, I will not loose <hi>Vandermast</hi> for halfe my Land. Content your selfe my Lord, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered Fryer <hi>Bacon,</hi> I haue but sent him home to s√©e his wife, and ere long he may returne. The King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land thanked Fryer <hi>Bacon,</hi> and forced some gifts on him for his seruice that hee had done for him; for Fryer <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> did so little respect money, that he neuer would take any of the King.</p>

               <p>THE Peace being concluded betw√©ene the King of England and the King of France; the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land came againe into his Countrey of England, where he was receiued very ioyfully of all his Subiects: But in his absence had happened a discord betweene thr√©e Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the like hath not b√©ene often heard. This it was:
<pb facs="tcp:15238:12"/>
A rich Gentleman of England dyed, and left behinde him three Sonnes. Now for some reason (which was best knowne to himselfe) he appointed none of them by name to be his heyre, but spake to them all after this manner: You are all my Sonnes, and I loue you all as a Father should doe, all alike, not one better then the other: and cause I would alwayes doe rightly so n√©ere as I can, I leaue all my Lands and goods to him that loues me best: These were his last words that he spake, concerning any worldly affaires.</p>
               <p>After he was dead and buried, there arose a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie betwixt them, who should inherit their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Goods and Lands, euery one pleading for himselfe, how that h√©e loued his Father best. All the cunning Lawyers of the Kingdome could say nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, concerning this case, so that they were inforced to begge of the King a grant for a combat: for they would not share the Lands and Goods amongst them, but eu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ry one desired all or else nothing. The King s√©eing no other way to end this controuersie, granted a combat; the two eldest being to fight first, and the conquerour to fight with the yongest, and the suruiuer of them was to haue the Land.</p>
               <p>The day being come that was set for these comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, they all came in armed for the fight, Fryer <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> being there present, and seeing such thr√©e lustie young men like to perish, and that by their owne flesh and bloud, grieued very much, and went to the King, desiring his Maiestie that he would stay the fight, and he would finde a meanes without any bloodshed to end the matter: the King was very glad hereof, and caused the Combatants to be brought before him, to whom he said: Gentlemen, to saue the bloud of you all, I haue found a way, and yet the controuersie shall be ended that is now amongst you: Are you contented to stand to his Iudgement that I shall appoint? They all answered,
<pb facs="tcp:15238:13"/>
that they were. Then were they bid to returne thr√©e dayes after. In that time Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> had caused the Body of their deceased Father to be taken out of the ground, and brought to the Court: the body h√©e did cause to be bound to a Stake, naked from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle vpwards, and likewise prepared thr√©e Bowes and Shafts for the thr√©e Brethren: all these kept h√©e se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly.</p>
               <p>The third day being come, came these thr√©e Brethren, to whom Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> in the presence of the King, gaue the thr√©e Bowes and Shafts, saying, Be not offended at what I haue done, there is no other way but this to iudge your cause: S√©e here is the body of your dead Father, shoot at him; for he that commeth n√©erest to his heart, shall haue all the Lands and Goods.</p>
               <p>The two eldest prepared themselues, and shot at him, and stucke their Arrowes in his Breast. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>en bid they the yongest to shoot: but h√©e refused it, saying, I will rather loose all, then wound that body that I so loued liuing: Had you euer had but halfe that loue (in you) to him that I haue, you would rather haue had your owne bodies mangled, then to suffer his liuelesse Cops thus to be vsed; nay, you doe not onely suffer it, but you are the actors of this act of shame: and speaking this, h√©e wept.</p>
               <p>Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> s√©eing this, did giue the Iudgement on his side, for he loued his Father best, and therefore had all his Lands and Goods: the other two Brothers went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with shame for what they had done. This d√©ed of Fryer <hi>Bacons</hi> was highly commended of all men; for h√©e did not onely giue true Iudgement, but also saued much blood that would haue b√©ene shed, had they b√©ene suffered to haue fought.</p>

               <p>IT was reported about the Countrey, how that the King had giuen Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> great store of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The report of this wealth made thr√©e Th√©eues plot to rob Fryer <hi>Bacons</hi> house, which they put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise one Euening in this fashion. They knockt at the doore, and were let in by <hi>Miles</hi>: No sooner were they in, but they tooke hold of him, and led him into the house, and finding Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> there, they told him that they came for some money, which they must and would haue ere they departed from thence. H√©e told them, that h√©e was but ill stored with money at that time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desired them to forbeare him till some other time. They answered him againe, that they knew that h√©e had enough, and therefore it was but folly to delay them, but straight let them haue it by faire meanes, or else they would vse that extreamitie to him that h√©e would b√©e loath to suffer. H√©e s√©eing them so resolute, told them that they should haue all that h√©e had, and gaue to them one hundred pounds a man. Herewith they s√©emed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and would haue gone their wayes. Nay said Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Bacon,</hi> I pray Gentlemen at my request tarry a little, and heare some of my mans Musicke; you are hyred rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable well already, I hope in courtesie you will not deny m√©e so small a request. That will w√©e not, (said they all.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miles</hi> thought now to haue some sport with them, which h√©e had, and therefore plain lustily on his Tabor and Pipe: so soone as they heard him play (against their wils) they fell a dauncing<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and that after such a laborious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they quickly wearied themselues (for they had all that while the bagges of money in their hands.) Yet
<pb facs="tcp:15238:14"/>
had Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> not reuenge enough on them, but bid his man <hi>Miles</hi> leade them some larger measure as hee thought fitting, which <hi>Miles</hi> did. <hi>Miles</hi> straight ledde them out of the house into the fields, they followed him, dauncing after a wilde Anticke manner: Then led h√©e them ouer a broad dike full of water, and they followed him still, but not so good a way as h√©e went (for he went ouer the Bridge, but they by reason of their dauncing, could not k√©epe the Bridge, but fell off, and dauncing through the water) then led hee them through a way where a horse might very well haue b√©ene vp to the belly; they followed him, and were so durtie, as though they had wallowed in the myre like Swine. Sometime gaue h√©e them rest onely to laugh at them: then were they so slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie when h√©e did not play, that they fell to the ground. Then on the sudden would h√©e play againe, and make them start vp and follow him. Thus kept h√©e them the better part of the night. At last h√©e in pitie left playing, and let them rest. They being asleepe on the bare ground, h√©e tooke their money from them, and gaue them this Song for their farewell, To the tune of, <hi>Oh doe me no harme good man.</hi>

               <head>How <hi>Vandermast,</hi> for the disgrace that he had receiued by Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> sent a Souldier to kill him; and how Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> escaped killing, and turned the Souldier from an Atheist to be a good Christian.</head>
               <p>FRyer <hi>Bacon</hi> sitting one day in his Study, looked o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the dangers that were to happen to him that
<pb facs="tcp:15238:15"/>
moneth, there found he, that in the second w√©eke of the moneth, betw√©ene Sunne rising and setting, there was a great danger to fall on him, which would without great care of preuention take away his life. This danger which he did fores√©e, was caused by the <hi>Germane</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurer <hi>Vandermast,</hi> for he vowed a reuenge for the disgrace that he had receiued. To execute the same, hee hyred a <hi>Walloon</hi> Souldier, and gaue him one thousand crownes to do the same, fifty before hand, and fifty when hee had killed him.</p>
               <p>Fryer <hi>Bacon,</hi> to saue himselfe from this danger that was like to happen to him, would alwayes when that he read, hold a ball of Brasse in his hand, and vnder that ball would he set a bason of Brasse, that if hee did chance to sl√©epe in his reading, the fall of the Ball out of his hand into the Bason, might wake him. Being one day in his Study in this manner, and asl√©epe the <hi>Walloon</hi> Souldier was got in to him, and had drawne his sword to kill him: but as hee was ready for to strike, downe fell the Ball out of Fryer <hi>Bacons</hi> hand, and waked him. Hee s√©eing the Souldier stand there with a sword drawen, asked him what hee was? and wherefore hee came there in that manner? The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier boldly answered him thus: I am a <hi>Walloon,</hi> and a Souldier, and more then this, a villaine: I am come hither, because I was sent; I was sent, because I was hyred; I was hyred, because I durst do it; the thing I should doe, is not done; the thing to be done, is to kill th√©e: thus haue you heard what I am and why I come. Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> wondered at this mans resolution; then asked hee of him, who set him on worke to b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

He answered, Of that which many doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, the chiefe principles of which were these: to goe to an Ale-house, and to a Church with one deuation, to abstaine from euill for want of action, and to doe good
<pb facs="tcp:15238:15"/>
against their wills. It is a good profession for a deuill (said Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi>) Doest thou beleeue hell? I bel√©eue no such thing, answered the Souldier. Then will I shew th√©e the contrary, said the Fryer: and presently raysed the ghost of <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostata,</hi> who came vp with his body burning, and so full of wounds, that it almost did affright the Souldiour out of his wits. Then <hi>Bacon</hi> did command this spirit to speake, and to shew what hee was, and wherefore hee was thus tormented? Then spake hee to it in this manner: I sometimes was a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Emperour; some count greatnesse and happinesse: I had a happinesse beyond my Empire, had I k√©ept that, I had b√©ene a happy man: would I had lost my Empire when I lost that, I was a Christian, that was my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse; but my selfe loue and pride made me to fall from it; for which I now am punished with neuer ceasing torments, which I must still endure: the like which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy is now prepared for vnbel√©euing wretches like my selfe, so vanished he away.</p>
               <p>All this while the Souldier stood quaking, and sweat as he had felt the torments himselfe; and falling downe on his kn√©es desired Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> to instruct him in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter course of life, then he had yet gone in. Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> told him, that he should not want his helpe in any thing, which he performed, instructing him better: then gaue he him money, and sent him to the warres of the holy land, where he was slaine.</p>

               <p>NOt farre from Fryer <hi>Bacon,</hi> dwelt an olde man that had great store of money which hee let out to vse, and would neuer doe any good with it to the poore, though Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> had often put him in minde of it, and wished him to do some good whilest he liued. Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> s√©eing this, by his Art made an Iron pot, which s√©emed full of gold, this being done, h√©e went to this rich
<pb facs="tcp:15238:16"/>
Vsurer, and told him, that he had some gold which he had gathered in his time that he had liued; but it being much in quantity, h√©e feared that if it were knowne, it would be taken from him, because it was vnfitting a man of his coat should haue so much: Now he desired him that h√©e would let him haue some hundred pounds, which was not the sixe part of his gold, and he should k√©epe it for him. The Vsurer was glad to heare of this, and told him that he should haue it, and that he would k√©epe his gold as safe as he himselfe would: Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> was glad to heare of this, and presently fetcht the pot: at the sight of which the Vsurer laughed, and thought to himselfe, how all that gold was his owne, for hee had a determination is gull the Fryer, but he gulled himselfe. S√©e h√©ere is the gold (said Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi>) now let me haue of you one hundred pounds, and k√©ep you this gold till I pay it backe againe: Very willingly (said the Vsurer) and told him one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds out, which Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> tooke, and deliuered him the pot, and so went his way. This mony did Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> giue to diuers poore schollers, and other people, and bid them pray for old <hi>Good-gatherers</hi> soules health (so was this Vsurer call'd) which these poore people did, and would giue him thankes &amp; prayers when they met him, which he did wonder at; for he neuer deserued the praiers of any man. At last this old <hi>Good-gatherer</hi> went to looke on this pot of gold, but instead of gold he found nothing but earth at which sight he would haue died, had not his other gold hindred him, which hee was to leaue behind him: so gathering vp his spirits, hee went to Fryer <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> and told him he was abused &amp; cheated; for which he would haue the law of him, vnlesse he made him restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> told him, that he had not cheated him, but bin his faithfull steward to the poore, which he could not chuse but know, either by their prayers, or their thanke: &amp; as for the law he feared it not, but bid him doe his worst. The old man s√©eing Fryer <hi>Bacons</hi> resolution, went his way, and said, that hereafter he would be his owne steward.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MIles</hi> chanced one day vpon some businesse, to goe some sixe miles from home, and being loth to part with some company that he had, he was belated, &amp; could get but halfe way home that night: to saue his purse hee went to ones house that was his Masters acquaintance: but when he came, the good man of the house was not at home, and the woman would not let him haue lodging. <hi>Miles</hi> s√©eing such cold entertainment, wished that he had not troubled her, but being now there, he was loth to goe any further, and therefore with good words he perswaded her for to giue him lodging that night. She told him that she would willingly do it, if her husband were at home, but he being now out of towne, it would bee to her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit to lodge any man. You n√©ede not to mistrust me, (said <hi>Miles</hi>) for I haue no thought to attempt your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie: locke me in any place where there is a bed, and I will not trouble you till to morrow that I rise. She thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her husband would be angry if she should deny any of his friends so small a request, consented that he should lye there, if that he would be locked vp: <hi>Miles</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and presently went to bed, and she locked him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the chamber where he lay.</p>
               <p>Long had not he b√©ene a bed, but he heard the doore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; with that he rose and p√©eped through a thinke of the partition, and saw an old man come in: this man set downe his Basket that he had on his arme, and gaue the woman of the house thr√©e or foure sw√©et kisses, which made <hi>Miles</hi> his mouth runne with water to s√©e it: Then did hee vndoe his Basket, and pulled out of it a fat Capon ready roasted, and Bread, with a bottle of good olde Sacke: this gaue h√©e vnto her, saying: Sw√©etheart, hearing thy Husband was out of towne, I thought good to visite th√©e, I am not come emptie

handed, but haue brought some thing to bee merrie withall: lay the cloth sw√©ete Hony, and let vs first to Banquet, and then to bed. She kindly thanked him, and presently did as he had her: They were not scarce set at the Tadle, but her husband returning backe, knockt at the doore. The woman hearing this, was amazed, and knew not what to doe with her old Louer: but looking on her apron-strings, she straite found (as women vse to doe) a tricke to put her selfe fr√©e from this feare; for sh√©e put her Louer vnder the bed, the Capon &amp; Bread she put vnder a Tub, the buttle of Wine shee put behinde the Chest, &amp; then she did open the doore, &amp; with a dissembling kisse welcomed her husband home, asking him the reason why that he returned so quickly. He told her, that hee had forgot the money that hee should haue carried with him, but on the morrow betimes he would he gone. <hi>Miles</hi> saw and heard all this; and hauing a desire to taste of the Capon &amp; the Wine, called to the Goodman. He asked his wife who that was? She told him, an acquaintance of his, that intreated lodging there that night. He bid hee open the doore, which she did, and let <hi>Miles</hi> out. H√©e see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Miles</hi> there, bid him welcome, and bade his wife to set them some meate on the table: she told him, that there was not any ready, but prayed him to k√©epe his stomacke till to morrow, and then she would prouide them a good breakefast. Since it is so <hi>Miles</hi> (said the goodman) wee must rest contented and sl√©epe out our hunger. Nay stay, said <hi>Miles,</hi> if that you can eate, I can find you good meate; I am a Scholler and haue some Art. I would faine s√©e it (said the goodman) You shall, quoth <hi>Miles,</hi> and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently. With that <hi>Miles</hi> pulled forth a booke out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and began his Coniuration in this fashion:</p>

                  <l>And therefore come inuisible.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Now he is come, (quoth <hi>Miles,</hi> and therefore tell m√©e what meat you will haue mine Hoast? Any thing <hi>Miles,</hi> (said the Goodman) what thou wilt. Why then (sayd <hi>Miles</hi>) what say you to a Capon? I loue it aboue all meat (said the Goodman.) Why then a Capon you shall haue, and that a good one too. <hi>Bemo</hi> my spirit that I haue raised to doe m√©e seruice, I charge th√©e, s√©eke and search about the earth, and bring me hither straight the best of Capons ready rosted. Then stood hee still a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as though hee had attended the comming of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and on the sudden said: It is well done my <hi>Bemo,</hi> h√©e hath brought me (mine Hoast) a fat Capon from the King of <hi>Tripolis</hi> owne Table, and bread with it. I but where is it <hi>Miles</hi> (said the Hoast) I s√©e neither Spirit nor Capon. Looke vnder the Tub (quoth <hi>Miles</hi>) and
<pb facs="tcp:15238:18"/>
there you shall finde it. He presently did, and brought (to his wiues griefe) the Capon and Bread out. Stay (quoth <hi>Miles</hi>) we doe yet want some drinke that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and good; I thinke (mine Hoast) a bottle of Malligo Sacke were not amisse, I will haue it: <hi>Bemo,</hi> haste the to <hi>Malligo,</hi> and fetch me from the Gouernours, a Bottle of his best Sacke. The poore woman thought that hee would haue betrayed her and her louer, and therefore wished that h√©e had b√©ene hanged, when that hee came first into her house.) H√©e hauing stood a little while, as before, saide: Well done, <hi>Bemo,</hi> looke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the great Chest (mine Hoast:) H√©e did so, and brought out the Bottle of Sacke. Now (quoth hee) <hi>Miles</hi> sit downe, and welcome to thine owne Ch√©ere: You may s√©e Wife (quoth hee) what a man of Art can doe, get a fatte Capon, and a Bottle of good Wine in a quarter of an houre, and for nothing, which is best of all: Come (good wife) sit downe, and bee merry: for all this is payd for, I thanke <hi>Miles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sh√©e sate, but could not eate a bit for anger, but wished that euery bit they did eate might choake them: Her old Louer too that lay vnder the bed all this while, was ready to bepisse himselfe for feare, for h√©e still looked when that <hi>Miles</hi> would discouer him. When they had eaten and dranke well, the goodman desired <hi>Miles</hi> that hee would let him s√©e the Spirit that fetched them this good ch√©ere: <hi>Miles</hi> s√©emed vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, telling him that it was against the Lawes of Art, to let an illiterate man see a Spirit: but yet for once hee would let him s√©e it, and told him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that hee must open the doore, and soundly beat the Spirit, or else hee should b√©e troubled hereafter with it: and because hee should not feare it, h√©e would put it into the shape of some one of his neighbours.

in all hast went to Fryer <hi>Bacon,</hi> and desired of him some help to recouer his Loue againe, whom he feared was vtterly lost.</p>
               <p>Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> (knowing him for a vertuous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) pittyed him; and to giue his griefes some release, shewed him a Glasse, wherein any one might s√©e any thing done (within fifty miles space) that they desired: So soone as he looked in the Glasse, hee saw his Loue <hi>Millisant</hi> with her Father, and the Knight, ready to be marryed by Fryer <hi>Bungye</hi>: At the sight of this hee cryed out that he was vndone, for now should hee lose his life in losing of his Loue. Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> bids him take comfort, for he would preuent the marriage; so taking this Gentleman in his armes, hee set himselfe downe in an inchanted Chaire, and suddenly they were carryed through the ayre to the Chappell. Iust as they came in, Fryer <hi>Bungye</hi> was ioyning their hands to marry them: but Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> spoyled his sp√©ech, for he strucke him dumbe, so that he could not speake a word. Then raised he a myst in the Chappell, so that neither the Father could s√©e his Daughter, nor the Daughter her Father, nor the Knight either of them. Then tooke he <hi>Millisant</hi> by the hand, and led her to the man she most desire: they both wept for ioy, that they so happily once more had met, and kindly thanked Fryer <hi>Bacon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It greatly pleased Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> to s√©e the passion of these two Louers, and s√©eing them both contented, hee marryed them at the Chappell doore, whilest her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Knight, and Fryer <hi>Bungye</hi> went groping within, and could not find the way out. Now when he had married them, he bid them get lodging at the next Village, and he would send his man with money: (for the Gentleman was not stored, and hee had a great way to his house) they did as he had them. That night hee sent his man <hi>Miles</hi> with money to them; but hee
<pb facs="tcp:15238:19"/>
kept her Father, the Knight, and Fryer <hi>Bungye</hi> till the next day at noone in the Chappell, ere be released them.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman and his new married wife made that night a great Supper for ioy of their marriage, and bid to it most of the Village: They wanted nothing but Musicke, for which they made great moane. This want, Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> (though he was absent) supplied: For after Supper there came such a Maske, that the like was neuer s√©ene in that Village: For first, there was heard most sw√©et still Musicke, then wind Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke: Then came thr√©e Apes, and three Monkeys, each of them carrying a Torch: after them followed sixe Apes and Monkeyes more, all dressed in Anticke coats: these last sixe fell a dancing in such an odde manner, that they mooued all the beholders to much laughter: so after diuers Antick changes, they did reuerence to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome and Bride, and so departed in order as they came in. They all did maruell from whence these should come: but the Bridegroome knew that it was Fryer <hi>Bacons</hi> Art that gaue them this grace to their Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. When all was done, to bed they went, and enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their wishes. The next day he went home to his owne house with his Bride; and for the cost hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on them, most part of the Townes-folke brought them on their way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miles</hi> made one amongst them too; he for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters sake was so plyed with Cups, that he in three dayes was scarce sober: for his welcome, at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he gaue them this Song: To the tune of, <hi>I haue beene a Fidler, &amp;c.</hi>
