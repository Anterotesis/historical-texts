            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And to pray for their Sacred Maje≈øtle's, our Soveraign Lord and Lady, King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> they are ≈øuch Strangers to his Heart, that

               <p>I'll tell you how you may be quit of this Eccle≈øia≈øtical Copy-holder; all his Tenure and Title to the Pulplt is Copy-hold, get but his Notes, or his Copies from him, and the Pulpit will not hold him, he mu≈øt come down and hire a Journey Man of more Skill, if any ≈øuch can be had, for Money, ≈øo to deba≈øe him≈øelf to be Surrogate to a rich Fop, that with his ≈øilk Ca≈ø≈øock, and Scarlet Hood runs away with the Galm, whil≈øt poor Thred-bare Crape takes all the pains.</p>

               <p>So that if God be not the more merciful, and Their Sacred Maje≈øties the more careful of their Academies, the generality of the Clergy mu≈øt be like the <hi>Scribes and Phari≈øees,</hi> in our Saviour's time, painted Sepulchres, Gay without, fine Ornaments without, but within, nothing but Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and dead Men's Boues.</p>
               <p>Ju≈øt as we were in the Church of <hi>England</hi> (I remember) fifty years ago, in the Reign of that great Ma≈øter of Ceremonies, little Doctor <hi>Laud,</hi> that did ≈øo di≈øcountenance lively and edifying Sermons, or almo≈øt any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that a Man mu≈øt have travell'd for it, and far too, if he heard any

               <p>This confu≈øed Noi≈øe of the People, is not Articulate, but an un-intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and bruti≈øh Braying, one Man's Voice drowns the Accent and Articulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another, and therefore is no more Intelligible than the Latine Ma≈øs, and I ≈øuppo≈øe that the be≈øt Rea≈øon that can be given for it, is, that it keeps the people ignorant, if they cannot read, of at lea≈øt one half of the P≈øalms.</p>
               <p>The next ≈øtep may be, if this be ≈øuffered, that the people ≈øhall read one half of the Chapters two; and then though the vulgar cannot kept toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from hearing the Scripture, they ≈øhall be debarr'd one half; in time, we may go further, we are ju≈øt in the Popi≈øh Road, that debars the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar from the whole Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Read but the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.11.23, 26.31, 33. And if you fear God, you will never do ≈øo any more; Latin Prayers, or Prayers in an unknown Tongue, or an unintelligible Tongue al≈øo, are Prophe≈øies or Preachments in
<pb facs="tcp:62180:13"/>an untelligible Tongue, by the Confu≈øion of which, God is not the Author but the Devil, and the Pope invented the≈øe Contu≈øions, by them to beget, the Mother of Popi≈øh and Ceremony Mongers Devotion, Ignorance. For ≈øaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.11. If I know not the Voice, I ≈øhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that ≈øpeaketh a Barbarian, and he that ≈øpeaketh ≈øhall be a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian unto me.</p>
               <p>Here is a plain Scripture again≈øt this confu≈øed Noi≈øe, no man can know the meaning of a Voice that is not Articulate; But what cares a Ceremony. Monger for Scripture? Give him his God, give him his Mammon, give him his <hi>popi≈øh</hi> Mimickry; but whil≈øt he makes him≈øelf a <hi>popi≈øh</hi> Ape, he makes dull <hi>Engli≈øhmen</hi> both Apes and A≈ø≈øes.</p>
               <p>All the Rea≈øon that ever any of them can give for this profane Folly, is, that the Singing boys do it, and the great Heads do it, and therefore, the ≈øilly people, like the Papi≈øts ≈øay, mu≈øt not we believe and practice as the Church believes and practi≈øes? meaning, by the Church, the Clergy, the rich, the great, and the gay Clergy.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of Bowing at the Name of</hi> Je≈øu.</head>
               <p>THere is but one of the≈øe ≈øaid Irregular and Illegal and Irrational Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies afore-mentioned, that have any colour of Law, and that is the Canon for bowing at the Name <hi>Je≈øu;</hi> but that Canon is nail'd by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Rea≈øon, as well as by the Act of Uniformity, which enacts great Penalties, even Deprivation, if any Ceremony monger ob≈øtinately per≈øi≈øt in the Practi≈øe of any Ceremonies, except tho≈øe alone that are contained in the Common-Prayer-Bock; of which that ≈øame of bowing at the Name of <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> or <hi>Je≈øu;</hi> and all their other Bowings and Cringes to the Altar, to the Ea≈øt, are none at all; I prote≈øt, I wonder at the Ceremony mongers Audacity and Fool-hardne≈øs, that he ≈øtill dare to do it, in defiance of the Law, Rea≈øon and Scripture; except he think to ≈øet the Convocation-Hou≈øe over and above, and on the Top of the Parliament-Hou≈øe, where it will ≈øtand mo≈øt Totteringly, and ≈øubject to the Storms.</p>
               <p>Let no man therefore think this Di≈øcour≈øe to be bold, or over-hold, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law of God and Man, Holy Scriptures, and right Rea≈øon on my ≈øide, and can therefore with ≈øuch great Advantages baffle them all, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der rather at my incorrigible Ceremony-monger, that will take no warning till he be forc'd publickly to recant the Schi≈øms and Mi≈øchiefs his Noddle has forc'd in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>The ≈øtrength of his Mai-Guards, like that of Hell and Popery, lies all in ≈øtopping the ≈øeveral Avenues of Light, that none may enter into the <hi>Kingdom of Darkne≈øs,</hi> for they hate the Light, <hi>becau≈øe their Deeds are Evil,</hi> and therefore would, if they could, keep the Keys of the Pre≈øs doors, as well as the Pulpit doors, that no glimmering may appear without Licen≈øe. Thus the Devil Rages the more, becau≈øe his time is ≈øhort, and Frets and Fumes when you di≈øcover his Cloven-Foot, e≈øpecially when he has long been ador'd, of which he is mo≈øt Ambitious, as an Angel of Light: But, Ble≈ø≈øed be God, that is above the Devil? Truth and Light are his Glorious Attributes, as Error and Darkne≈øs are the properties of Heil.</p>
               <p>And if the Devil were not great in men, and greatly ≈øtrong, they would ≈øubmit to Law and Rea≈øon, to God and his Holy Writ, to the Laws of the Land. Equity and Con≈øcience, and not call to the Bevil and the Goaler, to help them to wreek their Malice upon Innocent men, that only ≈øhow them their dirty Faces in a Gla≈øs.</p>
               <p>God's Will be done, I ≈øay with <hi>Chry≈øostome</hi> to <hi>Eudoxia</hi> the Empre≈øs, <hi>I fear nothing but Sin; and I mu≈øt Sin, except I reprove my Brethren, and not ≈øuffer Sin upon them; for as they have Sinn'd before all, 'tis ≈øit they ≈øhould Recant before all;</hi> And ≈øo all of them will, except they be pa≈øt ≈øhame, and con≈øequently pa≈øt Grace: When Sick Men are deadly Sick, and their whole Con≈øtitution ≈øo Di≈øtemper'd and out of Frame, that the very N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Come, then, give Glory to God, Confe≈øs and Recant publickly in the Church, where thy Non≈øen≈øe was committed, and defy the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanitles of this wicked World. Oh! but may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For it is evident in Holy Scripture, that God never gave him any ≈øuch Commi≈ø≈øion, Place, Office or Authority to keep the Keys of the Church, any more than the Speaker of the Hou≈øe of Commons, or Chair-man to a Committee, has power to turn out of the Hou≈øe, or let in any of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Members; For does a Bi≈øhop differ from another Presbyter, more than the Chair-man from the re≈øt of the Committee, or he that gives the Rule of the Court at Se≈ø≈øion, differ from the re≈øt of his Brethren and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Ju≈øtices, he is no better man, nor the more learned, wi≈øe nor more hone≈øt a man, though he be Ordain'd to be the mouth of them (that's all) to

               <p>Ordination? What is it more then chu≈øing, approving or ≈øetting a Man a part for an Office, to do bu≈øine≈øs relating to this life or a better? I will not ≈øay, in Church or State, or as a Clergy-man or Lay-man; for the≈øe are idle, ungrounded, vain and odious names of di≈øtinction, where God and Holy Scripture never made any ≈øuch di≈øtinction, and has not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded our notions of things but has been, and yet is the cau≈øe of mo≈øt of our Confu≈øions, in, what Men mi≈øchievou≈øly di≈øtingui≈øh and call Church and State; which are not two things, nor two di≈øtinct Bodies, if you make them ≈øo, you mu≈øt make two Kings, and two di≈øtinct Heads to the≈øe di≈øtinct Bodies, and that is one too much.</p>
               <p>And if you make a Clergy-man and a Lay-man, two di≈øtinct ≈øorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, you make a Man that God never made; And, if ≈øo! Then Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man! [I mu≈øt Catechize you,] Who made you ≈øo? God? It is fal≈øe; For God in Holy Scripture does not call the Preachers, but the Hearers, not the Bi≈øhops, Presbyters, and Mini≈øter's the Clergy, but the Hearers and Flock are God's Clergy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>The Presbyters which are among≈øt you, <hi>I</hi> exhort, who am al≈øo a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, or Elder, or Elderman, or Grand Senior; no greater name can well be given. St. Peter was a Presbyter, can there be a greater Di≈øciple of Chri≈øt? And the Presbyters to whom he preach't, and were under him are the ≈øame with Bi≈øhops, and tho≈øe Presbyters al≈øo to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> preach't at <hi>Ephe≈øus,</hi> and are called Presbyters in one ver≈øe, are called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops
<pb facs="tcp:62180:17"/>in another, and their Auditors or Flock are called (the Clergy or) God's Heritage, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3.</p>
               <p>How came Ca≈ø≈øock men, and Lawne-≈øleev'd-men, (fir≈øt) to make an Impropriation of this Word (Clergy or God's Heritage) to them≈øelves for≈øooth?</p>
               <p>I'le tell you: Fir≈øt, it is clear that in all the Holy Scriptures this word (Clergy or God's Heritage) is never mentioned except in this place, 1 <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, When the Pope and Bi≈øhops made Encroachments and U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations upon the Princes and Emperours, taking their Dominions into the Church, and St. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony, then, the Pope and Bi≈øhops feeling their own ≈øtrength, that they had ≈øtrength enough of them≈øelves (as a di≈øtinct Body) to go alone; then they ≈øet up for them≈øelves, and made a new and di≈øtinct Corporation in the World, called The Church, The Clergy, The Clergy, The Lords Spiritual, which is (a Title ab≈øolutely and by Name) forbidden as a prophane Name, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. and al≈øo in the very next words in the ≈øame Ver≈øe, they are forbid to Rob the people of the good Name (of Clergy or God's Heritage) becau≈øe God gave the Flock that Name, and <hi>Peter</hi> charg'd the Bi≈øhops, as our Saviour did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they ≈øhould not be Lords, nor Domineer, nor exerci≈øe Lord≈øhip, as the Princes of the Gentiles do: For, there was no ≈øuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinction, nor prophane Names of di≈øtinction, as Clergy and Layety, Spiritual Lords and Temporal Lords, there was but one ≈øort of Clergy, the Flock; and but one ≈øort of Lords (Temporal) The Princes, or Temporal Lords; for it is a Je≈øuitical Tenet (which we practice, and an old Popi≈øh Tenet and Errour) in making Dominion to be Founded in Grace; or to talk of Spiritual Lord≈øhip, <hi>quatenus</hi> Spiritual Men, or Apo≈øtles: for it is <hi>totidem Verbis,</hi> and by Name forbidden the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles.</p>
               <p>I grant, that a more Honourable Office or Officer cannot be in Nature, than a good Presbyter, or Bi≈øhop; nor can that Holy and Spiritual Office be more debauch't and prophan'd than by making ≈øteps of Divinity to mount over all Humanity; This is to Rancounter and Ruffle the whole cour≈øe of Nature; and make Heaven, a pair of Stairs (whither go you ≈øo fa≈øt?)

Cu≈øtom can beget nothing upon a Man of Rea≈øon, a Man who≈øe Rea≈øon is not clouded; and yet Cu≈øtom has a Brood in the World far more numerous, than Truth could ever beget; becau≈øe Truth, the Father of wi≈øe men, can never beget any thing, but upon Rea≈øon the Mother of true Devotion: But the≈øe Mothers are but few, and therefore there are but few of the Breed, very few rational Men, and rational Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, in compari≈øon of the Numbers of tho≈øe that go the broad Way, and go in at the broad Gate that leadeth to De≈øtruction; and many there be that go in thereat, namely, all tho≈øe, who≈øe Religion and Wor≈øhip has no other Ground, except Cu≈øtom (in Conjunction with Mother Ignorance) for their foppi≈øh Devotion; and Covetou≈øne≈øs, for their Knavi≈øh Super≈øtition.</p>
               <p>Thus the poor ≈øilly naked <hi>Indians,</hi> In <hi>America,</hi> (I have catechized, them) and ask'd them the Rea≈øon, Why they did bow to ≈øuch an Idol, that was nothing more than other.

               <p>Oh! but the Prie≈øts are cra≈øty, and have ≈øome more Rea≈øon (though a wicked One) to bow to nothing; they do not bow for nothing, they get a Place by it, and Preferment; and therefore are forc'd to get as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fools as they can to be their Di≈øciples and Followers; for, when Owles are alone, they are houted at, but not Birds that fly in Flocks, tho they be Jack-dawes.</p>

               <p>For all Promi≈øes and Vowes are either broken or kept, but the Promi≈øes and Vowes of God-fathers and God-mothers in infant Bapti≈øm, are ≈øeldom or never kept; but are broken Vows, and broken Bonds and Promi≈øes.</p>
               <p>The Sureties Promi≈øe and Vow, that the poor In≈øolvent Child (that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ≈øpeak for it ≈øelf) ≈øhall when it can hear (for Faith comes by hearing) have Faith; and when it can ≈øpeak, and gets Wit, then it ≈øhall have Grace to confe≈øs and repent.</p>
               <p>But, ≈øuppo≈øe the Child live to have Wit enough to be a Ceremony-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; Had ever any Man or Woman of them the Grace to confe≈øs, recant and repent?

               <pb facs="tcp:62180:24"/>
               <p>Again, ≈øuppo≈øe the Child prove Deaf, or Dumb, or a Fool, the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Vow they do not know what; nay, if it live to be hang'd, as many are for Thieves, Witches, Murderers; Hlow is the God-fathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers Vow and Promi≈øe perform'd, when they vow'd and promi≈øed for poor Child in Bapti≈øm, that it ≈øhould for≈øake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ≈øinful Lu≈øts of the Fle≈øh. 2dly, They vow and promi≈øe that Child ≈øhall believe all the Articles of the Chri≈øtian Faith; do they not break their Vow, If poor Child prove to be a sceptick, a Hobbi≈øt, or an Athle≈øt? 3dly, They vow that the poor Child ≈øhall keep God's Holy Will and Commandment, and walk in the ≈øame all the days of its Life; Do they not break their Vow, if, poor Child, for whom they ≈øwore a ≈øolemn Vow and Promi≈øe, in the pre≈øence of God, being an Oath, happen to turn Apo≈øtate, Papi≈øt, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan, or Infidel, are not the Sureties all for≈øworn?

               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> Then the Sureties promi≈øe that which no hone≈øt Man can hone≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promi≈øe, who makes Con≈øcience of a Vow, becau≈øe he promi≈øes that which is impo≈ø≈øible for him to perform.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the In≈øolvent Child be bound by Sureties and good Bayl, if he leave them in the lurch, he wrongs them not, he gave them no ≈øuch Commi≈ø≈øion, Power, Deputation, Authority, or Reque≈øt to promi≈øe and vow in his Name: And therefore that talk of a Vow in Bapti≈øm, it non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen≈øe, idle, and vain: How can a Man break a Vow, or a Bond that he never made; but his Sureties made it in his behalf; Ay, without his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, knowledge, care, or de≈øire: How is Child concern'd therein, any more than other Children in the World? I have to hear Non-≈øen≈øe, much more to preach it, except I were ≈øure, I was to preach to none but Fops, that ≈øwallow every thing that the Prie≈øt puts in their Mouth (like the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer God) without chewing.</p>

               <p>But, ≈øuppo≈øe the Fool and his Money be ≈øoon parted, and a Man get nothing but Hell by another Man's Graces of Faith and Repentance, by relying thereon, as Church of <hi>England</hi> holds; then much more Non≈øen≈øe it is for Church of <hi>England,</hi> on ≈øuch idle and fal≈øe Principles, to talk of Faith and Repentance to be performed, (tho never ≈øo much promi≈øed to be performed) by Proxy, or by Sureties.</p>
               <p>If God Almighty would (like ≈øome Creditors) take Sureties, and <hi>quem pro quo,</hi> that if Child could not perform and pay Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then fall upon the Sureties, and make them ≈ømart for it; then you ≈øpeak to purpo≈øe.

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Suppo≈øe (which is po≈ø≈øible) that the Sureties are In≈øolvent and have not Faith and Repentance for them≈øelves, then all this great Fat is in the Fire; they can never perform nor pay a Debt for another, that have not wherewith to di≈øcharge their own Debts, let them promi≈øe, and vow and be Bound in as many Bounds as they plea≈øe for other People; any Fool or Beggar can promi≈øe to pay a Thou≈øand pounds for another, but what ≈øignifie Promi≈øes, Vows, or Oaths, made only to be broken and for≈øworn?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> Which is the ≈øadde≈øt Ca≈øe of all, (or not a Pin to chu≈øe) ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe that poor Child is baptized without Sureties, as are the greate≈øt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by far, in this populous own; and in private Bapti≈øm, neither Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor the Sign of the Cro≈øs is required; then they mu≈øt bring Sureties afterwards to Church, and then it ≈øhall be ≈øigned with the Cro≈øs. But half the Pari≈øhes in this Town have no Churches, and they are not obliged to carry Child to another Church. Now you are gravell'd, Mr. <hi>Ceremony-monger,</hi> and you do not know what to do, or ≈øay.</p>
               <p>Again, tho≈øe that have Churches, will not, nor cannot, for Love nor Mony, get ≈øuch good patur'd and kind Sureties, to promi≈øe, vow or ≈øwear for the Child; What will you do now? now you are wor≈øe gravell'd.</p>
               <p>For either the Child in private Bapti≈øm, without Sureties, and the Sign of the Cro≈øs, is baptized aright, truly and fully, or no?</p>
               <p>If not, then half of the Kingdom are unchri≈øtned Infidels; there's one of the two Sacraments half lo≈øt by your fooli≈øh Rea≈øonings, and fond Doctrines; except you confe≈øs that the Child is rightly baptized without Sureties, or the Sign of the Cro≈øs.</p>
               <p>Which if you do, I have conquer'd thee, and thy ≈øilly Doctrine, of making Faith and Repentance requi≈øite, before a Child be capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øm: And when you had made ≈øo great a Flaw in Divinity, you ≈øodder it wor≈øe with a non≈øen≈øical Whim≈øey of Sureties performing Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for poor Child by promi≈øing both, Sureties, Spon≈øores, Cu≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers not more ≈øilly than Ancient, even in the 2d, or 3d. Centuries, as I remember, but have no time to turn to it, but an Error not ≈øo old as that of <hi>Papias, viz.</hi> Chri≈øt's reigning here upon Earth a thou≈øand Years per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonally, as the Millenaries hold; and a hundred more Errors of older Stile.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:62180:25"/>
               <p>Be≈øides, the Vow and Promi≈øe of Sureties gives either true Faith and Repentance, or not: If only fal≈øe, it is nothing worth, 'tis fal≈øe Coin, it cannot, ≈øhall not pa≈øs current any longer: If true Faith and Repentance come thereby, then is this believing and penitent Child capable al≈øo of the other Sacraments of the Lords Supper; for no other Qualifications can be requi≈øite; Faith and Repentance fits them for Heaven and Glory; and if ≈øo, it mu≈øt needs fit them for the means of Grace, in the way to Glory. St. <hi>Augu≈øtine,</hi> good Man. was thus run to the Wall with this Argument, and ≈øo mu≈øt Church of <hi>England,</hi> 'till they get a better Rea≈øon for Infant-Bapti≈øm, than they tell us in their Catechi≈øm and Common-Prayer-Book, and mu≈øt rationally fall into the Error of <hi>St. Augu≈øtine,</hi> who put the Holy-Supper, like Spoon-meat, down the Childrens Throats, thus prophaning, becau≈øe not di≈øcerning the Lord's Body.</p>
               <p>But the Sureties do it for them; then let them eat and drink al≈øo for them, take both the Sacraments in their Name and ≈øtead, and go to Heaven al≈øo in their Names and ≈øtead.

               <p>Be≈øides, Uniformity is an unnatural, impo≈ø≈øible, and therefore an irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, wicked, and vain attempt: Go, teach God to make a new Heaven, with Uniformity of Stars, and Skies ≈øpangled uniformly, they are now all of different Forms and Features: Go, reach him to make Men uniform, they are all now of different Forms and Features; Go teach him to make a new Earth, and ≈øet a new Face on it; The Landskip now looks ≈øo much the more lovely by the Variety, which God and Nature ≈øeems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in; And wilt thou (thou ≈øilly Ceremony monger, and Projector) be wi≈øer than God?</p>
               <p>If thou had≈øt ≈øeen our ble≈ø≈øed Saviour ≈øometimes ≈øtand and pray, ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times kneel and pray, ≈øometimes ly on a Bed or Couch, and eat the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper; ≈øometimes fall on his Face and pray; if thou had≈øt ≈øeen this variety, thou would≈øt have Excommunicated him, then capla≈øs'd and jal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, if thy fiercene≈øs had not kick't him, and ≈øpurn'd him up, had≈øt thou but had an Act of Uniformity to back thee.</p>
               <p>We are bound to honour God with our Sub≈øtance, In Works of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (the greate≈øt Duty) but how much; when, and how, in particular, is left to the di≈øcretion and liberty of every Man, no rule of Impo≈øition is, or can be made about it.</p>
               <p>We are obliged to honour God with our Bodies, the lea≈øt thing in true Wor≈øhip, for bodily Exerci≈øe profiteth little, but how much, when, and how in particular, is le≈øt to the di≈øcretion and liberty of every Man, no Rule of Impo≈øition is or can be made about it.</p>
               <p>Then, you'l ≈øay, the Church of <hi>England</hi> was mi≈øtaken in one of her XXXIX. Articles, that ≈øays, The Church has power to appoint Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: And al≈øo the King and Parliament were mi≈øtaken in the Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, that enjoint all Bi≈øhops and Clergy-men, on pain of Deprivation, to ≈øub≈øcribe, a≈ø≈øent, and con≈øent to all and every thing, as true, which is contained in the Common-Prayer Book.</p>
               <p>Here is a heavy Charge, Convocation-Hou≈øe, and Parliament-Hou≈øe, both upon my back; but, come, one at once, and I'le deal with them both, one after another, as well and as fa≈øt as I can.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt then, I ≈øay, in general, that any Decree under Heaven, that is either unlawful, or Impo≈ø≈øible to be obeyed, is not at all Obligatory: This is ≈øo plain, that it needs no further Proof, it is like the Light of the Sun, ≈øelf-evident; if the Sun ≈øhine, no man doubts it, but he that is blind, or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62180:26"/>winks on purpo≈øe, le≈øt he ≈øhould be convinc'd. And as to that Article, <hi>viz.</hi> The Church has power to enjoin Ceremonies‚Äîit confounds all the Ceremony-mongers among≈øt us. And in all my Travels, Reading, and Di≈øcour≈øes, I never met with any Man; Bi≈øhop, Prie≈øt, or Lay-man, that ever did, could, or dur≈øt explain what is there meant by Church.</p>
               <p>If it be taken for the Clergy, either in (or out of) Convocation, or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, <hi>viz.</hi> That they have of them≈øelves a <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> a Divine Right, to enjoin Ceremonies to the People of <hi>England,</hi> they all incur a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> that claim ≈øuch a Power, and ju≈øtly, for they there by ≈øet up a Legi≈ølative power, independent of, and di≈øtinct from the King and Parliament, (the only Legi≈ølators) and is of mo≈øt pernicious Con≈øequence, and found to be ≈øo in all Ages; And by the Statutes of Provi≈øors, made both by Popi≈øh and Prote≈øtant Kings and Parliaments, condemn'd as mo≈øt pernicious and in≈øufferable, by invading the only Legi≈ølative power, [Kings, Lords, and Commons] the great Fundamental of our Government, and ≈øetting up a Thing called, A Church, independent of, and equal with, or above the State, and bearding the State, if it be ≈øo bold as not to plea≈øe them, or ≈øhould dare to di≈øplea≈øe them. Better it is, not to be a State, than to be ≈øuch a pitiful State, at this precarious rate, that dare not but be Prie≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridden: Our Noble Ance≈øtors, in Popi≈øh Times, ≈øcorn'd the motion, and were true Engli≈øh Men: This di≈øtinction of Church and State, is a Popi≈øh and pernicious di≈øtinction; two higher powers is one too much.</p>
               <p>But if by the Church in that Article, be meant, the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Repre≈øentatives of the whole Body of the people, the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Canon-makers will by no means acknowledge that; for that makes them Cyphers, and [as many people account them] u≈øele≈øs Tools: And never did King and Parliament, neither, make Laws coercive in matters of Religion, or Uniformity in Religion, but Confu≈øion, Divi≈øions, Schi≈øms, Tumults, Sedicion, Blood, Ruine, and civil Wars, were the di≈ømal con≈øequences in <hi>England;</hi> whereas there would be none of the≈øe, no di≈ø≈øentions, no penalties, no complaining in our Streets, if the Legi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power, un≈øuborned by Prie≈øt-craft, make no Laws but what are proper for their cognizance, and for the peace, welfare, good manners, and good abearing in the State: And then, where there is no Law, there can be no Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion; and tho≈øe odious Names of Di≈ø≈øention and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Conformi≈øt and Nonconformi≈øt, will find an eternal Grave.</p>
               <p>I'le give but one In≈øtance in that ≈øame Act of Uniformity, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires all Clergy-men to give their a≈ø≈øent and con≈øent to all and every thing (for Truth) which is contained in the Common-prayer Book.</p>
               <p>But, who made the Kings and Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> infallible Popes, ≈øince the Church of <hi>England</hi> confe≈ø≈øes ≈øhe may Err?</p>
               <p>And how irrational and unaccountable is it for men that confe≈øs their ignorance, and yet with the ≈øame mouth will vote a Law, or Impo≈øition of their Sen≈øe in Religion upon all Mankind under their Juri≈ødiction? For ought they know, they may command and enact that all Clergy-men ≈øhal a≈ø≈øent in their Judgments, and con≈øent in their Wills, to a palpable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, lie, or untruth; or el≈øe, take their choice, to ≈øtarve, lie down and die; for Farm they may not, Thra≈øh they cannot, and if they Beg, they are ≈øent to <hi>Bridewel.</hi>

               <p>But that is not only ≈øilly, and uncertain, but fal≈øe and contradictory in the Common-prayer book, and therefore both the ≈øaid <hi>Aera's</hi> cannot be true.

               <p>They cannot both be true, but one of them is a Mathematical untruth, (and which no body can deny); yet Bi≈øhops and Curats mu≈øt all a≈ø≈øent and con≈øent, that this fal≈øhood is a truth, and ≈øuch a fal≈øhood it is, and of ≈øo evil con≈øequence, that it makes a blunder, and confounds all our wi≈øe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of uniformity in Common-prayers, Epi≈øties, Go≈øpels, and Le≈ø≈øons: And if we do not confe≈øs and ≈øub≈øcribe that this fal≈øhood and untruth is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>I can give ≈øeveral other in≈øtances of our irrational Doctrine and Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, but I am loth to offend, let them even go on, they'l give me but little thanks for my pains already; but, I thank God, I do not find the fault, to expo≈øe it to ≈øhame, but to cure it, I know how: And, let me tell you, it requires ≈øome skill in the Cure, Why may not Lightning ≈øometime come from a black Cloud? and a dull By-≈øtander ≈øee better ≈øometime, than he that play?
