         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62180:3"/>as alſo whenwe pay our due Reſpects to the Thrones below; but the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies here expos'd, are the Baſtard-brood that Popery and Foppery begot in our Proteſtant Church; and which neither the Laws of God, nor the King, does legitimate.</p>
            <p>For when the Popiſh Ceremony monger was at the Reformation exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſhut out of our Proteſtant Church, he had ('till now) Intereſt enough (notwithſtanding) to make my Ceremony monger his Surrogate, or dull Tool: And the duller Tool, the fairer Candidate for the place; ſo he had but wit enough to remember his Creator, and know his Cue: And ſince Popery (plain bare fac't Popery) was inconſiſtent with the Laws of our holier Church, and being Adulterate, and conſequently Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, Therefore a Popiſh Ceremony in Maſquerade, an Eccleſiaſtical Symn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>That Redemption (which St. <hi>George,</hi> the Champion of <hi>England</hi> gave to the Virgin ready to be ravaged by the Dragon) may be fabulous; but it is certain, that your Lordſhip cannot better deſerve the moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable (George and) Garter, nor more immortalize your great Name, than by improving your happy Talent, and Intereſt in their Sacred Majeſties, that they may (by redeeming the Church from Popiſh-like Slavery, in non-ſenſical and illegal Ceremonies) grace with freſh Luſtre, that old (but ſometimes ſullied) Flower of the Crown—Defender of the Faith: That ſo, as our Renowned King <hi>William,</hi> the Conqueror (of Hearts, and therefore the Conqueror) of Kingdoms, may perfect a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us in the Church, without Blood, as well as our late miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous (becauſe not ſanguinary) Redemption in the State; Whereby Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay, we had no Scripture, if Writing be not Preaching: Beſides, if I ſhould not thus teach my Ceremony Monger by the Preſs, I could not Admoniſh him at all; for my Pulpit is a narrow place, though it ſtand aloſt; and few Ceremony-Mongers deſire to be cured.

               </gap>ike men that have filthy old Ulcers on their Legs, they hate to be dreſt before folks; they had rather It ſhould Feſter, than be known. There is not one word in the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Biſhops, in our Common-Prayer-Book, or in Holy Writ, that gives a Biſhop more Authentick Orders to preach, than a Presbyter or Prieſt; only the King's Maodate makes him the King's Commiſſioner: But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to God or the People, a Biſhop has no better or freſher Character to Teach, or Adminiſter the Holy Sacraments, than any Preſbyter, or than himſelf; whilſt he was but Preſbyter; Nor has any King or Parliament, Biſhop, or Synod, any Power, any lawful Power to ſilence me for teaching Truth: The Character is Indelible; when they anſwer what I have Writ, concerning <hi>Imprimatur</hi>'s, or Reſtraint of the Preſs (in my late <hi>Speech with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doors</hi>) they ſhall hear further from me.</p>
            <p>For no Fleſh alive has more Authority than our Lord Jeſus, and the Apoſtles had, which was for Edification, not Deſtruction; to do good, not harm; to Advance, not to Depreſs Truth; to ſave Mens Lives, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Properties, not to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>But ſome may object to me, that the late King did ſilence me, ſhut me out of my own Pulpit, and baniſh't me from my Houſe and Home, my Self and my Family, for three or four years laſt; not only againſt Law, Equity and Conſcience; but without Law or any Colour, Proceſs or Form of Law; and yet I ſubmitted in quietneſs and ſilence, and made no noiſe in the World, nor to the World; not ſo much as Groaning or Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but far down ſilently.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, by confeſſing that it is (all of it) a great Truth, and I was by Arbitrary Power and Oppreſſion, to my Damage! ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Pounds, thus ſilenc'd (as a foreſaid) by Will and Pleaſure: a word from the Court ejected me from my Pulpit and my Houſe: but alſo a word from the Court recall'd me, about a month before the <hi>Dutch</hi> Landed.</p>
            <p>But to whom could I complain? To the Throne? I did, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, for that oppreſt me. To the Righteous God, I made my humble Appeal, and he heard in Heaven his dwelling Place, and laugh'd my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to ſcorn, yea the Lord has had them in Deriſion; and thoſe that baniſh'd me from my Houſe without Law, and without a Cauſe, are by God's Righteous Hand and Judgment, turn'd out of their Houſes and Homes; and before they went, recanted their Oppreſſion towards me; but going away in haſte, his Apoſtles could not hear me Reſtitution for the injuſtice.</p>

               <p>You think (now) that this is a Romance, and not literally true; well then, ſo let it go; 'Tis ſo much the fitter for this Character of a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-monger, which is all a Romance.</p>

               <p>And a Romance is as like a true Roman Hiſtory, as my Ceremony-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is like a Papiſt, he is not a Papiſt, (he ſays) no, he is not a bare-ſac'd Papiſt, I'll do him right; but to ſee to, he is as like a Papiſt as ever he can look, and his Devotion as like Popery as ever it can look: He does not ſay the Maſs indeed in Latine; but his Hood, his Cope, his Surplice, his Rocker, his Altar Rall'd in, his Candles, and Cuſhions, and Book there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his bowing to it, his bowing or rather Nodding at the name <hi>Jeſu,</hi> his Organs, his Violins, his Singing Men, his Singing-Boys, with their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate Jabbering and Mouthings, (as Unintelligible as Latine-Service) and ſo very like Popery that I profeſs (when I came from beyond Sea, about the year 1660. to Pauls and White-Hall) I almoſt thought, at firſt bluſh, that I was, ſtill, in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Portugal;</hi> only the Candles on our Altars, moſt Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſically, ſtand unlighted, to ſignifie, what?

The dead in Sin, bury the Dead for Sin, to ſo liſeleſs and ſpiritleſs a thing is Religion reduc'd by my Ceromony-Monger; nay, ſome of them in their pretended prayer before Sermon, do mock both God, and the people, praying, or pretending to pray as the mouth of the people in the pulpit and yet (like good <hi>Hannah's</hi> private prayer) their Lips only move, but their Voice is not heard.</p>
               <p>Old <hi>Eli</hi> thought the good Woman was Drunk or a Fool, to talk to her ſelf; but ſhe deſigned only private prayer.</p>
               <p>But certainly the Maſter of the Ceremonies, is either a Fop, or a Mad-man, or elſe takes all the People for a Fop of his own making, to have only a handſome gaze at the perſon, whilſt he Acts his <hi>Mammery</hi> in the pulpit.</p>
               <p>Why does the pulpit ſtand aloſt? But that the preacher ſhould lift his Voice like a Trumpet, that all the Church may hear, or elſe what does he do there? The papiſts indeed do vindicate pictures in Churches, as being the Lay-man's Hiſtory, though he know not a Letter in the Book, his Eyes may read by ſeeing a picture; and thus my Ceremony-monger brings up his Fops in Ignorance, and Ignorant Devotion; they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the matter, and cannot ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> to they do not know what; It is no matter for that, for (juſt like popiſh Maſs, called <hi>Secreta,</hi> which the prieſt mumbles to himſelf, ſo our Foppiſh Ceremony-monger that muſt be like a popiſh pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To be fopt by an Old Fop, that is as much or more an Hypocritical Knave than a Fool.</p>
               <p>And I am the more apt to believe it now, becauſe the mumbling Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, never mumbled ſo much, and ſo long in the pulpit-prayer before Sermon, as now a days in this Juncture and Revolution in the Kingdom, and change in the Throne; to pray for the Abdicated King, would be to own him and Popery with his Mouth, but he dare not do that, they have only his heart at preſent.</p>
               <p>And to pray for their Sacred Majeſtle's, our Soveraign Lord and Lady, King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> they are ſuch Strangers to his Heart, that
<pb facs="tcp:62180:12"/>he chuſes rather not to pray at all, in his own prayer before Sermon; or not at all to be heard, till ſuch time, as it may be gueſs'd, he had done it to himſelf, talking (as they ſay Witches do) to himſelf in the Pulpit; moſt prophanely mocking God and the People, by pretending to ſpeak, when he only mumbles with his Lips; for if his Voice be heard, the crafty Hypocrite thinks that ſome Body will tell (becauſe the Tongue tells) who he is for: Where as now the Fox lies learing and lurching, to ſee which King will get the better, and then, (and not till then) he will declare himſelf, and in the Interim, his Ambo-dexter reſerves himſelf; for he is true to no Intereſt, nor to any Religion, but that which moſt tends to the Advancement of his only God, <hi>Mammon,</hi> and his Curate only runs the Riſque, in praying for King <hi>William,</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, (for I am quite tired and ſick of him) his Church-Work is juſt like his Church-Clock, moved extraneouſly, by outward Weights, Wheels, Springs or Plummets, but has no inward or ſpiritual Life or Motion; ſuch is his prayers, ſuch his Sermons, (though he have a Budget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) Dead, Dull, ſpiritleſs, lifeleſs, <hi>frigid,</hi> and perfunctory Devotion; he never converts any Man, except to ſilly Ceremonſes, Becauſe himſelf is not converted to any thing; elſe his Words die before they reach the Heart of his Hearers, for how can they well come to the Heart of his Auditors, when they never came in, nor from his own Head nor Heart; he is the great Stock-Logg of the Church, that has neither Fire nor heat within, the little he has, is all out-ſide, ſuperficial, and without; it takes up a great deal of <hi>Rome</hi> indeed, but 'tis good for nothing in the World, but the dung-hil; he is that Salt that has quite loſt it's Savour, if over he had any, and good for nothing, but to be troden under Foot of Men; and reliſh'd by none but ſuch as have loſt their Taſte, or never had any.</p>
               <p>I'll tell you how you may be quit of this Eccleſiaſtical Copy-holder; all his Tenure and Title to the Pulplt is Copy-hold, get but his Notes, or his Copies from him, and the Pulpit will not hold him, he muſt come down and hire a Journey Man of more Skill, if any ſuch can be had, for Money, ſo to debaſe himſelf to be Surrogate to a rich Fop, that with his ſilk Caſſock, and Scarlet Hood runs away with the Galm, whilſt poor Thred-bare Crape takes all the pains.</p>
               <p>Yet, even theſe are ſcarce to be had for Love or Money; for the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony-monger has ſo polluted the Fountain of Learning the <hi>Univerſities,</hi> that where ſhall a man ſooner meet with noyſie Impudence, and gingling Nonſence, (a ſounding Braſs, and rinckling Cymbal) than in the two great St. <hi>Maries</hi> Pulpits in the <hi>Univerſitiis?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that if God be not the more merciful, and Their Sacred Majeſties the more careful of their Academies, the generality of the Clergy muſt be like the <hi>Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> in our Saviour's time, painted Sepulchres, Gay without, fine Ornaments without, but within, nothing but Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dead Men's Boues.</p>
               <p>Juſt as we were in the Church of <hi>England</hi> (I remember) fifty years ago, in the Reign of that great Maſter of Ceremonies, little Doctor <hi>Laud,</hi> that did ſo diſcountenance lively and edifying Sermons, or almoſt any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that a Man muſt have travell'd for it, and far too, if he heard any
<pb facs="tcp:62180:13"/>thing but the Common prayer and Organs, above four times in a Year. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, now there is to many Sermons in <hi>Print,</hi> that we have plenty in the Pulpit, though generally ſuch diſcrepant, Heterogeneous, and Immetho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Stuff, as being compoſ'd of ſeveral printed Sermons, a patch here, and a patch there deſcrib'd, that they are like a Beggars Coat, or a Tall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's Cloak bag, made up of party-colour'd Liſts and Parches, they are ſo diſ-compoſ'd by the <hi>Plagiary,</hi> in wiſe Prudence, like a Thief that takes By-Roads, for fear of being known, purſued, ſound out, and taken by the Hue and Cry.</p>
               <p>Therefore this <hi>Plagiary Reader,</hi> conſcious of Guilt, diſguiſes all diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, if poſſible, like the crafty Hare that makes falſe Steps and Doubles in the Snow, when ſhe is near her form, for fear of being track'd by her Steps, and Trac'd.</p>
               <p>Thus this Chattering Jay has nothing good about him, but the Gay Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, his Carcaſe is worth nothing but to Dung the Land; ſo that the Church, you ſee, can breed Vermine as well as the Barn.</p>

               <p>THis is ſuch another Nonſenſical Ceremony, that it is Point-blank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Holy Scripture, as well as againſt Reaſon and edification; and neither Canon of the Church, nor Rubrick, or Rule in the Common-Prayer Book, to vouch it, and puniſhable therefore, by the Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</p>
               <p>If ſo, then where is the Brains, you'l ſay, of all our Ceremony-Mongers? Where do you ſay?

That's the Teſt, that's the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial!</hi> that firſt gave them Entrance into a Proteſtant Church; and the Papiſts finely laugh at us, and deride us, for being their Apes as I have heard the Popiſh Friers beyond Sea Jear at us for the <hi>Mimickry</hi> grave <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Noddles, that have no other Reaſon not Religion for what they do, but that they are the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Baboons,</hi> in ſpight of Holy Scripture, Right Reaſon, true Religion, and the Laws of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>This confuſed Noiſe of the People, is not Articulate, but an un-intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and brutiſh Braying, one Man's Voice drowns the Accent and Articulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another, and therefore is no more Intelligible than the Latine Maſs, and I ſuppoſe that the beſt Reaſon that can be given for it, is, that it keeps the people ignorant, if they cannot read, of at leaſt one half of the Pſalms.</p>
               <p>The next ſtep may be, if this be ſuffered, that the people ſhall read one half of the Chapters two; and then though the vulgar cannot kept toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from hearing the Scripture, they ſhall be debarr'd one half; in time, we may go further, we are juſt in the Popiſh Road, that debars the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar from the whole Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Read but the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.11.23, 26.31, 33. And if you fear God, you will never do ſo any more; Latin Prayers, or Prayers in an unknown Tongue, or an unintelligible Tongue alſo, are Propheſies or Preachments in
<pb facs="tcp:62180:13"/>an untelligible Tongue, by the Confuſion of which, God is not the Author but the Devil, and the Pope invented theſe Contuſions, by them to beget, the Mother of Popiſh and Ceremony Mongers Devotion, Ignorance.

If I know not the Voice, I ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that ſpeaketh a Barbarian, and he that ſpeaketh ſhall be a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian unto me.</p>
               <p>Here is a plain Scripture againſt this confuſed Noiſe, no man can know the meaning of a Voice that is not Articulate; But what cares a Ceremony. Monger for Scripture? Give him his God, give him his Mammon, give him his <hi>popiſh</hi> Mimickry; but whilſt he makes himſelf a <hi>popiſh</hi> Ape, he makes dull <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> both Apes and Aſſes.</p>
               <p>All the Reaſon that ever any of them can give for this profane Folly, is, that the Singing boys do it, and the great Heads do it, and therefore, the ſilly people, like the Papiſts ſay, muſt not we believe and practice as the Church believes and practiſes? meaning, by the Church, the Clergy, the rich, the great, and the gay Clergy.</p>
               <p>And if this muſt be a Reaſon, why may we not as well believe and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, as doth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let all things be done to edifying, (ſaith the Apoſtle) and ye may all Propheſie, or read, for if Reading be not Preaching or Propheſing, we have abundance of dumb Prophets, if it be not a <hi>Bull,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.31. <hi>Ye may all Propheſie,</hi> read or preach, <hi>one by one, that all may Learn, and all may be comforted;</hi> Implying evidently, that there can be no Learning, no comfort, no Edification in our confuſed and banling Superfuelon; which is juſt like the Goſſips Chat, where all Tongues wag, and all are Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and no Hearers.</p>

               <p>But, I wonder who taught the Women, whoſe chiefeſt Beauty is modeſt Silence, who taught them to prate in the Church? They are ſo full of Tongue, you'l ſay, that perhaps a little teaching would ſerve.</p>
               <p>I never ſuffered ſuch a confuſed babling in my Church of <hi>All-Saints,</hi> Let them play the fools, and popiſh Apiſhneſs, ſome where elſe, I never would permit them, at which abundance of people took Snuff, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might not be ſuperſtitious Apes, they would not come there at all: a good riddance of them; they left the Room to their betters; for we want nothing there ſo much as <hi>Room.</hi>

               <p>Let no man therefore think this Diſcourſe to be bold, or over-hold, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law of God and Man, Holy Scriptures, and right Reaſon on my ſide, and can therefore with ſuch great Advantages baffle them all, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der rather at my incorrigible Ceremony-monger, that will take no warning till he be forc'd publickly to recant the Schiſms and Miſchiefs his Noddle has forc'd in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>The ſtrength of his Mai-Guards, like that of Hell and Popery, lies all in ſtopping the ſeveral Avenues of Light, that none may enter into the <hi>Kingdom of Darkneſs,</hi> for they hate the Light, <hi>becauſe their Deeds are Evil,</hi> and therefore would, if they could, keep the Keys of the Preſs doors, as well as the Pulpit doors, that no glimmering may appear without Licenſe. Thus the Devil Rages the more, becauſe his time is ſhort, and Frets and Fumes when you diſcover his Cloven-Foot, eſpecially when he has long been ador'd, of which he is moſt Ambitious, as an Angel of Light: But, Bleſſed be God, that is above the Devil? Truth and Light are his Glorious Attributes, as Error and Darkneſs are the properties of Heil.</p>
               <p>And if the Devil were not great in men, and greatly ſtrong, they would ſubmit to Law and Reaſon, to God and his Holy Writ, to the Laws of the Land. Equity and Conſcience, and not call to the Bevil and the Goaler, to help them to wreek their Malice upon Innocent men, that only ſhow them their dirty Faces in a Glaſs.</p>
               <p>God's Will be done, I ſay with <hi>Chryſostome</hi> to <hi>Eudoxia</hi> the Empreſs, <hi>I fear nothing but Sin; and I muſt Sin, except I reprove my Brethren, and not ſuffer Sin upon them; for as they have Sinn'd before all, 'tis ſit they ſhould Recant before all;</hi> And ſo all of them will, except they be paſt ſhame, and conſequently paſt Grace: When Sick Men are deadly Sick, and their whole Conſtitution ſo Diſtemper'd and out of Frame, that the very N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Come, then, give Glory to God, Confeſs and Recant publickly in the Church, where thy Nonſenſe was committed, and defy the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanitles of this wicked World. Oh! but may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It ſeems the Clergy (then too) would favour Kings, in what was for their own good, and if it were for their own good, would alſo permit the King to take a Text and preach in their Cathedral Church; how hard hearted, or ſtrait-lac't ſoever our Archdean proves, and will not ſuffer our Kings to have the Keys neither of the Church nor Pulpit; I ſay, therefore, ſome Kings would therefore keep the Keys of the Church themſelves, and truſt never a D.

               <p>But what if I prove that our Kings at their Coronations, have at the ſame time been ordain'd Clergy-men, they are no more excluded (then) by our Laws from the power of the Keys, then Mr. <hi>Archdeen,</hi> or the Pope himſelf.</p>
               <p>What is Ordination, but the ordering, deſigning or ſetting a Man a part to ſome office? if, to the Miniſtry, then there are certain ſignificant Words to that purpoſe, and what more ſignificant words for Ordination to the Prieſt-hood, or making a Man a Clergy man, than thoſe the Biſhops uſes to our Kings, namely, with Unction, Anthems, Prayers and Impoſition of Hands (as is uſual in the Ordination of Prieſts) with the ſame Hymn,—

               <p>And ſurely (of old) the very <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf look't upon our Anointed Kings as Clergymen, elſe why did the <hi>Pope</hi> make <hi>Hen.</hi> 2, his Legate <hi>De Latere</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> the uſual office of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (uſually ſtyled) <hi>Legati Nati?</hi>

               <p>Therefore, Mr. Arch-deacon, you talk like an unthinking Black-coat, ſtockt with a little ſuperficial Learning, when you ſay, our Laws exclude the King from the Keys of the Church, to which he has as good right as your D. D. Divinity ſhip.</p>

               <p>All the Male-Adminiſtrations in Eccleſia ſtical Government, take their Riſe and Original from our Ignorance of the Power of the Keys; or who are the Clavigers, Key-keepers, or Porters to let them in, and turn them out of the Church?</p>
               <p>The bulky Clergyman called a Biſhop, an Ordinary, or a <hi>Dioceſian,</hi> he (we ſay) keeps the Church-Keys, he Excommunicats and Excludes Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners out of the Church, and he alone receives them, and lets them in: (but that's falſe, the ſneaking Regiſter and Surrogate do that Job.)</p>

               <p>For it is evident in Holy Scripture, that God never gave him any ſuch Commiſſion, Place, Office or Authority to keep the Keys of the Church, any more than the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, or Chair-man to a Committee, has power to turn out of the Houſe, or let in any of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Members; For does a Biſhop differ from another Presbyter, more than the Chair-man from the reſt of the Committee, or he that gives the Rule of the Court at Seſſion, differ from the reſt of his Brethren and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Juſtices, he is no better man, nor the more learned, wiſe nor more honeſt a man, though he be Ordain'd to be the mouth of them (that's all) to

Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were choſen and ordain'd by the whole Church; <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3 Perhaps the chief Church-members laid their Hands upon, or ordain'd the Miniſters, Miſſioners or Meſſengers of the Church, but the worſt Member had as much power and vertue to ordain a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Elder, or Biſhop, as the beſt Biſhop or presbyter, if the Majority of Votes had ordain'd and ſo appointed, as is clear from Scripture, and the practiſe of the primitive Church, and ſhall be more particularly inſiſted upon in the Concluſion of the Chapter of Ordination.</p>
               <p>Ordination? What is it more then chuſing, approving or ſetting a Man a part for an Office, to do buſineſs relating to this life or a better? I will not ſay, in Church or State, or as a Clergy-man or Lay-man; for theſe are idle, ungrounded, vain and odious names of diſtinction, where God and Holy Scripture never made any ſuch diſtinction, and has not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded our notions of things but has been, and yet is the cauſe of moſt of our Confuſions, in, what Men miſchievouſly diſtinguiſh and call Church and State; which are not two things, nor two diſtinct Bodies, if you make them ſo, you muſt make two Kings, and two diſtinct Heads to theſe diſtinct Bodies, and that is one too much.</p>
               <p>And if you make a Clergy-man and a Lay-man, two diſtinct ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, you make a Man that God never made; And, if ſo! Then Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man! [I muſt Catechize you,] Who made you ſo? God? It is falſe; For God in Holy Scripture does not call the Preachers, but the Hearers, not the Biſhops, Presbyters, and Miniſter's the Clergy, but the Hearers and Flock are God's Clergy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>The Presbyters which are amongſt you, <hi>I</hi> exhort, who am alſo a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, or Elder, or Elderman, or Grand Senior; no greater name can well be given. St. Peter was a Presbyter, can there be a greater Diſciple of Chriſt? And the Presbyters to whom he preach't, and were under him are the ſame with Biſhops, and thoſe Presbyters alſo to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> preach't at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and are called Presbyters in one verſe, are called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb facs="tcp:62180:17"/>in another, and their Auditors or Flock are called (the Clergy or) God's Heritage, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3.</p>
               <p>How came Caſſock men, and Lawne-ſleev'd-men, (firſt) to make an Impropriation of this Word (Clergy or God's Heritage) to themſelves forſooth?</p>
               <p>I'le tell you: Firſt, it is clear that in all the Holy Scriptures this word (Clergy or God's Heritage) is never mentioned except in this place, 1 <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t.</hi> 5.3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is as clear that the word Clergy, or Gods Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, belongs as much at leaſt to the Layety, (as they call them in ſcorne) if not more than to Presbyters, or Biſhops, or Paſtors, who by another proud word too call themſelves <hi>Divines,</hi> for diſtinction ſake from the Flock, juſt as they have rob'd the Layety of their good name Clergy, which by God was given to the Layety in Holy Writ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When the Pope and Biſhops made Encroachments and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations upon the Princes and Emperours, taking their Dominions into the Church, and St. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony, then, the Pope and Biſhops feeling their own ſtrength, that they had ſtrength enough of themſelves (as a diſtinct Body) to go alone; then they ſet up for themſelves, and made a new and diſtinct Corporation in the World, called The Church, The Clergy, The Clergy, The Lords Spiritual, which is (a Title abſolutely and by Name) forbidden as a prophane Name, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. and alſo in the very next words in the ſame Verſe, they are forbid to Rob the people of the good Name (of Clergy or God's Heritage) becauſe God gave the Flock that Name, and <hi>Peter</hi> charg'd the Biſhops, as our Saviour did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they ſhould not be Lords, nor Domineer, nor exerciſe Lordſhip, as the Princes of the Gentiles do: For, there was no ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, nor prophane Names of diſtinction, as Clergy and Layety, Spiritual Lords and Temporal Lords, there was but one ſort of Clergy, the Flock; and but one ſort of Lords (Temporal) The Princes, or Temporal Lords; for it is a Jeſuitical Tenet (which we practice, and an old Popiſh Tenet and Errour) in making Dominion to be Founded in Grace; or to talk of Spiritual Lordſhip, <hi>quatenus</hi> Spiritual Men, or Apoſtles: for it is <hi>totidem Verbis,</hi> and by Name forbidden the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
               <p>I grant, that a more Honourable Office or Officer cannot be in Nature, than a good Presbyter, or Biſhop; nor can that Holy and Spiritual Office be more debauch't and prophan'd than by making ſteps of Divinity to mount over all Humanity; This is to Rancounter and Ruffle the whole courſe of Nature; and make Heaven, a pair of Stairs (whither go you ſo faſt?)

               <p>AND now, you may ſee by the Picture I have drawn, that a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony-monger's Soul, and Conſcience is neither rul'd by Holy Scripture, Right Reaſon, nor by the Law of the Land; but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all theſe, ſome of them are ſuch only through Cuſtom, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, blind Devotion, implicite Faith, and apiſh Imitation; others, and thoſe no ſmall Fools, upon deſign, duckoy'd by Avarice and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But, Cuſtom is a ſecond Nature, even in Religion too, or more properly, Superſtition: Cuſtom is the Father, and Ignorance is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Devotion: As ſoon may an Ethiopian change his Skin, or a Leopard his Spots, as a Ceremony-monger his foppiſh Superſtition, he is ſo accuſtomed to it. Cuſtom can beget nothing upon a Man of Reaſon, a Man whoſe Reaſon is not clouded; and yet Cuſtom has a Brood in the World far more numerous, than Truth could ever beget; becauſe Truth, the Father of wiſe men, can never beget any thing, but upon Reaſon the Mother of true Devotion: But theſe Mothers are but few, and therefore there are but few of the Breed, very few rational Men, and rational Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in compariſon of the Numbers of thoſe that go the broad Way, and go in at the broad Gate that leadeth to Deſtruction; and many there be that go in thereat, namely, all thoſe, whoſe Religion and Worſhip has no other Ground, except Cuſtom (in Conjunction with Mother Ignorance) for their foppiſh Devotion; and Covetouſneſs, for their Knaviſh Superſtition.</p>
               <p>Thus the poor ſilly naked <hi>Indians,</hi> In <hi>America,</hi> (I have catechized, them) and ask'd them the Reaſon, Why they did bow to ſuch an Idol, that was nothing more than other. Wood and Trees of which it was made: They had all one and the ſame Anſwer, namely, Cuſtom, and their Peel's Peel's, What are they? but a certain crafty ſort of Men amongſt them, that lead the reſt of the Fops by the Noſe, by ſome Superſtitions of their own Invention, Peel's, that is, Prieſts of the Devil, whom they worſhip in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owing Idolatry! for they never worſhip God, (whom they acknowledge in dark apprehenſion) for they ſay, God is good; and ſome of them will ſay. God is a good Man, and will not hurt them, and therefore they worſhip the Devil to aſſwage his miſchievous Wrath.</p>
               <p>Even ſo, our Engliſh foppiſh Ceremony-mongers anſwer, (when I ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techize them) and ask them the Reaſon of their bowing to the Altar
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62180:23"/>when there is no Idol, and to the Eaſt when there is nothing Divine more than in the South and North, and the Altar nothing, but a piece of Wood, made of the ſame Wood and Trees with the Pues, the Stools and the Pulpit: then, juſt like the naked <hi>Indians,</hi> that are but juſt one degree (if they be ſo much) remov'd from a Monky, anſwer, that it is a Cuſtom and their (Peel's: or) Prieſts do ſo, and therefore the poor Apes imitate, that's all.</p>
               <p>Oh! but the Prieſts are craſty, and have ſome more Reaſon (though a wicked One) to bow to nothing; they do not bow for nothing, they get a Place by it, and Preferment; and therefore are forc'd to get as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fools as they can to be their Diſciples and Followers; for, when Owles are alone, they are houted at, but not Birds that fly in Flocks, tho they be Jack-dawes.</p>
               <p>I have ask'd ſome of them a Reaſon for their confus'd and profane. irrational and unſcriptural babling together the Reading Pſalms! and all their Anſwer is, that [It is granted, that) It is a confus'd Noiſe, and therefore unintelligible; but their prieſts do ſo, and the Singing Boys; and they are accuſtomed to it: It is a very honeſt Confeſſion; but is this Man-like, or Baboon-like?</p>
               <p>I have ask'd ſome account alſo, of others, how the Organs got into Church, to make ſuch a Noiſe, and at ſo great a Charge and Expence, In the firſt purchaſe and continuance; <hi>Judas</hi> his Queſtion is proper here, To what purpoſe is this waſte? Had they not better be ſold, and the Organiſt's Sellary retrench'd, and given to the poor?</p>
               <p>They anſwer, that Mr. Alderman was willing withal, and that he could not ſtay a long Hour or two out of his Counting-houſe, at Devotion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſleeping; and therefore, how clunch-fiſted ſoever he uſed to be at other times, yet on this occaſion he nimbly opens his Purſe to pay the Muſick, for that it either keeps him from ſleeping, or joggs and awakens him, and makes him ſtare and look up; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ay, ſay no more; you have ſaid enough, and you deſerve to be a Laureat, as well as Sir <hi>John Suckling's</hi> Alderman; come, clap the Lawrel upon the Alderman's Head.</p>
               <p>But of all the brisk Reaſons of my Ceremony-mongers, that of a She Ceremony-monger was very ſurprizing, when being ask't why ſhe, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of plain Scripture, ſpoke in the Church, anſwered nimbly, That her Tongue was ſo uſ'd to wagg at home, that it could not lie ſtill in the very Church? and yet the ſame Church-pratter, was ſilenc'd, when queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, why ſhe, in imitation of the Doctor's bowing his Noddle to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, Madam Limberham made a Courteſy, and bow'd both her Knees? no Reaſon could be got for that Mimickry; that is no more like, than an Apple is like an Oyſter.</p>
               <p>And all the Reaſon that ſome Biſhope can give, why they ordain many times, rude, illiterate, unthinking Don's to the Pulpit, to teach others, and know nothing of the Matter, nothing of their own Knowledge, no Divinity is concocted or digeſted, and made their own, and in their Head and Heart, (the Body of the Law is digeſted by a Lawyer, before he is fit to come to the Bar; and the Body of Phyſick, by Phyſitians, before they are fit to feel the Pulſe, or be Licenſed).</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62180:24"/>
               <p>His Anſwer is, That he truſt; to his Deacon, or Arch-deacon, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Faith, He believes as the Arch-deacon tells him; and that the form and manner of ordaining Deacons, Prieſts, and Biſhops, requires no more: well, it is well, 'tis very well anſwer'd, and moſt Epiſcopally;</p>
               <p>And why do you Confirm, and lay Hands ſuddenly upon ſo many igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Perſons that underſtand not one Article of Faith, nor can ſo much as ſay the Creed? The anſwer is, The Common-prayer Book requires no more than to believe oy Implicit Faith, the fitneſs of all that the Pariſh Prieſt ſays is fit, he muſt take it for granted, and believe as the Prieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and ſee with other Mens Eyes; but that is the Fault (Brother!) of your Conſtitution, that obliges you no more Work and Inſpection, than any Mortal can perform.</p>
               <p>Beſides, where do we read (except in the Maſs Book, and Common-Prayer Book) of ſuch a thing in Scripture, as Confirmation by a Biſhop? That Scripture of little Children coming to Chriſt, and he laid his Hands upon them, and bleſſed them, is, in the Common-Prayer Book, apply'd to infant Baptiſm, in the Office of Publick Baptiſm; and moſt incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly (too) for that purpoſe; for <hi>Jeſus</hi> baptized none, neither Men, Women, nor Children, but his Diſciples did that; Nay, the great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of the Gentlies went about confirming the Diſciples by ſound Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but he baptized very few; one, or two, or three, he confeiles that he did baptize, and if he had baptized any more, he had forgo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did not make ſuch a buſineſs of it in his own Perſon: And as for laying Hands upon any Children, or other, there is not the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ſuch Matter. How came it then into the Church; I'le tell you:</p>
               <p>Infants being not able to make a Confeſſion or Profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, which two are required of all perſons before they be baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (as ſaith the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Doctrine Catechiſtical in the Common-Prayer Book, and ſo ſaid St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but I believe neither of them).</p>

                  </gap>, becauſe the Sureties do promiſe (a wiſe Reaſon, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iſes may be broken) they ſhall perform both Faith and Repentance, when they come to Age.</p>
               <p>Ay! Here's a wiſe Reaſon for a Learned Church, and enough to make all Rational Men (that have not loſt their Reaſon) be Anabaptiſts, or, at leaſt, like Witches, to deny their Baptiſm ſo Infancy.</p>
               <p>For all Promiſes and Vowes are either broken or kept, but the Promiſes and Vowes of God-fathers and God-mothers in infant Baptiſm, are ſeldom or never kept; but are broken Vows, and broken Bonds and Promiſes.</p>
               <p>The Sureties Promiſe and Vow, that the poor Inſolvent Child (that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak for it ſelf) ſhall when it can hear (for Faith comes by hearing) have Faith; and when it can ſpeak, and gets Wit, then it ſhall have Grace to confeſs and repent.</p>
               <p>But, ſuppoſe the Child live to have Wit enough to be a Ceremony-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; Had ever any Man or Woman of them the Grace to confeſs, recant and repent? And then the Promiſe of the Sureties is not worth more than ſome Lord's Promiſe, nor worth a Farthing.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62180:24"/>
               <p>Again, ſuppoſe the Child prove Deaf, or Dumb, or a Fool, the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Vow they do not know what; nay, if it live to be hang'd, as many are for Thieves, Witches, Murderers; Hlow is the God-fathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers Vow and Promiſe perform'd, when they vow'd and promiſed for poor Child in Baptiſm, that it ſhould forſake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh. 2dly, They vow and promiſe that Child ſhall believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; do they not break their Vow, If poor Child prove to be a sceptick, a Hobbiſt, or an Athleſt? 3dly, They vow that the poor Child ſhall keep God's Holy Will and Commandment, and walk in the ſame all the days of its Life; Do they not break their Vow, if, poor Child, for whom they ſwore a ſolemn Vow and Promiſe, in the preſence of God, being an Oath, happen to turn Apoſtate, Papiſt, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan, or Infidel, are not the Sureties all forſworn? And though they be, or be not, there's the miſchief, no good can poſſibly come of it, but that which is lucumbent upon Parents, and which Sureties ſeldom or never mind, namely, <hi>Chriſtian Education;</hi> and if ſo, they ſhould not Swear and Vow in the Child's Name, that the Child does or ſhall believe and repent; It is enough to promiſe good Education (if the God-fathers and God-mothers be barren, or old and paſt Children; in ſuch caſe, it is enough to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> kind and careful of another Man's Child: But if they have Children of their own, or likely to have any, it is too much, becauſe Charity ſhould begin at Home. And therefore the ſaid Vow and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is, but uſually like the common Diſcourſe of Hectors and Bullies; (I ſwear and Vow, they cry on all Occaſions) when they intend nothing; by Vowing and Swearing, but forſwearing; and adding a Lye to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Vow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then the Sureties promiſe that which no honeſt Man can honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſe, who makes Conſcience of a Vow, becauſe he promiſes that which is impoſſible for him to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Inſolvent Child be bound by Sureties and good Bayl, if he leave them in the lurch, he wrongs them not, he gave them no ſuch Commiſſion, Power, Deputation, Authority, or Requeſt to promiſe and vow in his Name: And therefore that talk of a Vow in Baptiſm, it non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, idle, and vain: How can a Man break a Vow, or a Bond that he never made; but his Sureties made it in his behalf; Ay, without his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, knowledge, care, or deſire: How is Child concern'd therein, any more than other Children in the World? I have to hear Non-ſenſe, much more to preach it, except I were ſure, I was to preach to none but Fops, that ſwallow every thing that the Prieſt puts in their Mouth (like the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer God) without chewing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Suppoſe another Man's Faith or Repentance (that has enough of both) for his own Salvation, and alſo Merits (called Works of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation by the Papiſts) to ſpare, heaped up and running over, which the Saints departed, St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> St. <hi>Winifred,</hi> St. <hi>Francis,</hi> St. <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> St. <hi>Coleman,</hi> &amp;c. has left at their Departure, as a laſt Legacy to the Pope (as the Papiſts hold) Faith and Repentance enough to ſave all the Whores and Rogues in the World, to whom the Pope gives, no Sells, to any that has Money, and is willing to Buy.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62180:25"/>
               <p>If Works of Supererogation be true, it is the firſt Market I would make; I had rather buy Heaven than a Knight-hood, or a Biſhop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ick.</p>
               <p>But, ſuppoſe the Fool and his Money be ſoon parted, and a Man get nothing but Hell by another Man's Graces of Faith and Repentance, by relying thereon, as Church of <hi>England</hi> holds; then much more Nonſenſe it is for Church of <hi>England,</hi> on ſuch idle and falſe Principles, to talk of Faith and Repentance to be performed, (tho never ſo much promiſed to be performed) by Proxy, or by Sureties.</p>
               <p>If God Almighty would (like ſome Creditors) take Sureties, and <hi>quem pro quo,</hi> that if Child could not perform and pay Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then fall upon the Sureties, and make them ſmart for it; then you ſpeak to purpoſe. But, God is Juſt, the Soul that ſinneth it ſhall die, and the Soul that believes and repents ſhall be Saved, but I fear the beſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant has nothing to ſpare for a poor Inſolvent Child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Suppoſe (which is poſſible) that the Sureties are Inſolvent and have not Faith and Repentance for themſelves, then all this great Fat is in the Fire; they can never perform nor pay a Debt for another, that have not wherewith to diſcharge their own Debts, let them promiſe, and vow and be Bound in as many Bounds as they pleaſe for other People; any Fool or Beggar can promiſe to pay a Thouſand pounds for another, but what ſignifie Promiſes, Vows, or Oaths, made only to be broken and forſworn?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> Which is the ſaddeſt Caſe of all, (or not a Pin to chuſe) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that poor Child is baptized without Sureties, as are the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by far, in this populous own; and in private Baptiſm, neither Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor the Sign of the Croſs is required; then they muſt bring Sureties afterwards to Church, and then it ſhall be ſigned with the Croſs. But half the Pariſhes in this Town have no Churches, and they are not obliged to carry Child to another Church. Now you are gravell'd, Mr. <hi>Ceremony-monger,</hi> and you do not know what to do, or ſay.</p>
               <p>Again, thoſe that have Churches, will not, nor cannot, for Love nor Mony, get ſuch good patur'd and kind Sureties, to promiſe, vow or ſwear for the Child; What will you do now? now you are worſe gravell'd.</p>
               <p>For either the Child in private Baptiſm, without Sureties, and the Sign of the Croſs, is baptized aright, truly and fully, or no?</p>
               <p>If not, then half of the Kingdom are unchriſtned Infidels; there's one of the two Sacraments half loſt by your fooliſh Reaſonings, and fond Doctrines; except you confeſs that the Child is rightly baptized without Sureties, or the Sign of the Croſs.</p>
               <p>Which if you do, I have conquer'd thee, and thy ſilly Doctrine, of making Faith and Repentance requiſite, before a Child be capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: And when you had made ſo great a Flaw in Divinity, you ſodder it worſe with a nonſenſical Whimſey of Sureties performing Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for poor Child by promiſing both, Sureties, Sponſores, Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers not more ſilly than Ancient, even in the 2d, or 3d. Centuries, as I remember, but have no time to turn to it, but an Error not ſo old as that of <hi>Papias, viz.</hi> Chriſt's reigning here upon Earth a thouſand Years per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, as the Millenaries hold; and a hundred more Errors of older Stile.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:62180:25"/>
               <p>Beſides, the Vow and Promiſe of Sureties gives either true Faith and Repentance, or not: If only falſe, it is nothing worth, 'tis falſe Coin, it cannot, ſhall not paſs current any longer: If true Faith and Repentance come thereby, then is this believing and penitent Child capable alſo of the other Sacraments of the Lords Supper; for no other Qualifications can be requiſite; Faith and Repentance fits them for Heaven and Glory; and if ſo, it muſt needs fit them for the means of Grace, in the way to Glory. St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> good Man. was thus run to the Wall with this Argument, and ſo muſt Church of <hi>England,</hi> 'till they get a better Reaſon for Infant-Baptiſm, than they tell us in their Catechiſm and Common-Prayer-Book, and muſt rationally fall into the Error of <hi>St. Auguſtine,</hi> who put the Holy-Supper, like Spoon-meat, down the Childrens Throats, thus prophaning, becauſe not diſcerning the Lord's Body.</p>

               <p>Therefore to ſalve this Sore, make room then for Confirmation, a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Sacrament.

               <p>WHat! ſhall we have no Ceremonies at all then? Oh! yes, your fill, ſo you'l be content, and not impoſe your ſmall ſenſe upon others in Canons, and Acts of Uniformity; which are not only vain Attempts hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, (even ſince the firſt General Council of <hi>Nice</hi>) but all the great Wars in Chriſtendom, upon the ſcore of Religion, the Innocent Blood ſpilt betwixt the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Athanaſians,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> the Animoſities.

               <p>It is very ſtrange that Chriſtians will not be content with the Impoſition and Acts of Uniformity, which God, the Holy Jeſus and his Apoſtles have provided. Haſt thou Faith (ſaith the Apoſtle) have it to thy ſelf? Haſt thou a ceremony, thou art fond on, it may be good, it may be bad, make much on't, keep it to thy ſelf; to thine own Maſter thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>We have general Rules, as to honour God with our Subſtance, or Eſtates, in Works of Charity, which is the greateſt Thing in Religion, and without which all thy Faith and Hope is nothing, as ſaith St. <hi>Paul;</hi> or is a dead Carrion, as ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> becauſe Charity, the Soul of Faith, is de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when thou evidences thy Faith to be a nothing Faith, a dead Faith, by deſtroying Charity, in killing and impriſoning thy Brother for Faith's ſake; and perhaps thy weak Brother, for whom Chriſt died, through thy Impoſition, and Penal Acts of Uniformity; Acts that are not only miſchievous in breaking the Peace and Unity of the Brethren, not only uncharitable in beating thy Son, or thy Brother, becauſe he is blind; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him to his Sight, in the Spirit of Meekneſs, is the Apoſtle's Rule, blows will never cure his Blindneſs.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Uniformity is an unnatural, impoſſible, and therefore an irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, wicked, and vain attempt: Go, teach God to make a new Heaven, with Uniformity of Stars, and Skies ſpangled uniformly, they are now all of different Forms and Features: Go, reach him to make Men uniform, they are all now of different Forms and Features; Go teach him to make a new Earth, and ſet a new Face on it; The Landskip now looks ſo much the more lovely by the Variety, which God and Nature ſeems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in; And wilt thou (thou ſilly Ceremony monger, and Projector) be wiſer than God?</p>
               <p>If thou hadſt ſeen our bleſſed Saviour ſometimes ſtand and pray, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times kneel and pray, ſometimes ly on a Bed or Couch, and eat the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper; ſometimes fall on his Face and pray; if thou hadſt ſeen this variety, thou wouldſt have Excommunicated him, then caplaſs'd and jal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, if thy fierceneſs had not kick't him, and ſpurn'd him up, hadſt thou but had an Act of Uniformity to back thee.</p>
               <p>We are bound to honour God with our Subſtance, In Works of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (the greateſt Duty) but how much; when, and how, in particular, is left to the diſcretion and liberty of every Man, no rule of Impoſition is, or can be made about it.</p>
               <p>We are obliged to honour God with our Bodies, the leaſt thing in true Worſhip, for bodily Exerciſe profiteth little, but how much, when, and how in particular, is leſt to the diſcretion and liberty of every Man, no Rule of Impoſition is or can be made about it.</p>
               <p>Then, you'l ſay, the Church of <hi>England</hi> was miſtaken in one of her XXXIX. Articles, that ſays, The Church has power to appoint Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: And alſo the King and Parliament were miſtaken in the Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, that enjoint all Biſhops and Clergy-men, on pain of Deprivation, to ſubſcribe, aſſent, and conſent to all and every thing, as true, which is contained in the Common-Prayer Book.</p>
               <p>Here is a heavy Charge, Convocation-Houſe, and Parliament-Houſe, both upon my back; but, come, one at once, and I'le deal with them both, one after another, as well and as faſt as I can.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, I ſay, in general, that any Decree under Heaven, that is either unlawful, or Impoſſible to be obeyed, is not at all Obligatory: This is ſo plain, that it needs no further Proof, it is like the Light of the Sun, ſelf-evident; if the Sun ſhine, no man doubts it, but he that is blind, or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62180:26"/>winks on purpoſe, leſt he ſhould be convinc'd. And as to that Article, <hi>viz.</hi> The Church has power to enjoin Ceremonies—it confounds all the Ceremony-mongers amongſt us. And in all my Travels, Reading, and Diſcourſes, I never met with any Man; Biſhop, Prieſt, or Lay-man, that ever did, could, or durſt explain what is there meant by Church.</p>
               <p>If it be taken for the Clergy, either in (or out of) Convocation, or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, <hi>viz.</hi> That they have of themſelves a <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> a Divine Right, to enjoin Ceremonies to the People of <hi>England,</hi> they all incur a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> that claim ſuch a Power, and juſtly, for they there by ſet up a Legiſlative power, independent of, and diſtinct from the King and Parliament, (the only Legiſlators) and is of moſt pernicious Conſequence, and found to be ſo in all Ages; And by the Statutes of Proviſors, made both by Popiſh and Proteſtant Kings and Parliaments, condemn'd as moſt pernicious and inſufferable, by invading the only Legiſlative power, [Kings, Lords, and Commons] the great Fundamental of our Government, and ſetting up a Thing called, A Church, independent of, and equal with, or above the State, and bearding the State, if it be ſo bold as not to pleaſe them, or ſhould dare to diſpleaſe them. Better it is, not to be a State, than to be ſuch a pitiful State, at this precarious rate, that dare not but be Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridden: Our Noble Anceſtors, in Popiſh Times, ſcorn'd the motion, and were true Engliſh Men: This diſtinction of Church and State, is a Popiſh and pernicious diſtinction; two higher powers is one too much.</p>
               <p>But if by the Church in that Article, be meant, the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Repreſentatives of the whole Body of the people, the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Canon-makers will by no means acknowledge that; for that makes them Cyphers, and [as many people account them] uſeleſs Tools: And never did King and Parliament, neither, make Laws coercive in matters of Religion, or Uniformity in Religion, but Confuſion, Diviſions, Schiſms, Tumults, Sedicion, Blood, Ruine, and civil Wars, were the diſmal conſequences in <hi>England;</hi> whereas there would be none of theſe, no diſſentions, no penalties, no complaining in our Streets, if the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power, unſuborned by Prieſt-craft, make no Laws but what are proper for their cognizance, and for the peace, welfare, good manners, and good abearing in the State: And then, where there is no Law, there can be no Tranſgreſſion; and thoſe odious Names of Diſſention and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Conformiſt and Nonconformiſt, will find an eternal Grave.</p>
               <p>I'le give but one Inſtance in that ſame Act of Uniformity, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires all Clergy-men to give their aſſent and conſent to all and every thing (for Truth) which is contained in the Common-prayer Book.</p>
               <p>But, who made the Kings and Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> infallible Popes, ſince the Church of <hi>England</hi> confeſſes ſhe may Err?</p>
               <p>And how irrational and unaccountable is it for men that confeſs their ignorance, and yet with the ſame mouth will vote a Law, or Impoſition of their Senſe in Religion upon all Mankind under their Juriſdiction? For ought they know, they may command and enact that all Clergy-men ſhal aſſent in their Judgments, and conſent in their Wills, to a palpable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, lie, or untruth; or elſe, take their choice, to ſtarve, lie down and die; for Farm they may not, Thraſh they cannot, and if they Beg, they are ſent to <hi>Bridewel.</hi>

               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:62180:27"/>
               <p>And this is our very caſe this day; We may not chuſe what Chapters for Leſſons, what Collects, Epiſtles and Goſpels, we liſt to read, but muſt read thoſe that are appointed for the day: And the laſt year they were all falſly appointed, or elſe thoſe words in the Common-prayer Book are falſe, that fixes and aſcertains Eaſter Sunday (the <hi>Aera,</hi> or beginning of the Account, whence all the Leſſons, Collects, Epiſties and Goſpels, are computed, nominated, and appointed).</p>
               <p>But that is not only ſilly, and uncertain, but falſe and contradictory in the Common-prayer book, and therefore both the ſaid <hi>Aera's</hi> cannot be true. As for example, by one Common-prayer Book Rule, the laſt Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Sunday ſhould have been kept upon <hi>April</hi> 8, becauſe Eaſter Sunday (whence all other Feaſts, Leſſons, Collects, are computed all the year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) is always the firſt Sunday next after the firſt Full Moon which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens after <hi>March</hi> 25, which was <hi>April</hi> 8, laſt paſt: But by another Rule in the Common prayer Book, it was (and ſo we kept it) upon <hi>April</hi> 15 laſt paſt.</p>
               <p>They cannot both be true, but one of them is a Mathematical untruth, (and which no body can deny); yet Biſhops and Curats muſt all aſſent and conſent, that this falſhood is a truth, and ſuch a falſhood it is, and of ſo evil conſequence, that it makes a blunder, and confounds all our wiſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of uniformity in Common-prayers, Epiſties, Goſpels, and Leſſons: And if we do not confeſs and ſubſcribe that this falſhood and untruth is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>I can give ſeveral other inſtances of our irrational Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, but I am loth to offend, let them even go on, they'l give me but little thanks for my pains already; but, I thank God, I do not find the fault, to expoſe it to ſhame, but to cure it, I know how: And, let me tell you, it requires ſome skill in the Cure, Why may not Lightning ſometime come from a black Cloud? and a dull By-ſtander ſee better ſometime, than he that play?

               <p>So that—no Biſhop—no King (<hi>Stephen,</hi> or <hi>John</hi>) and a Biſhop— no King (<hi>Stephen,</hi> or <hi>John</hi>); for that Rich Biſhops, like other Rich Lords, are a Strength to the Crown, when it does not diſpleaſe them; and on the contrary, have been too great and dangerous when controul'd, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſty and moroſe; a King had as good be a Slave in <hi>Turky,</hi> as to be at the mercy of ſuch Popiſh-like Eccleſiaſtical Pride.</p>

               <p>So that I alſo am ſo much a Friend to that Proverb—No Biſhop, no King—and ſo very much a Friend to Biſhops, that where there is one now in England, I wiſh there were twenty; and as old as I am, I hope to live to ſee it: and yet not take one Farthing from the preſent Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benrs, nor in the leaſt diminiſh the vaſt Revenues and Grandeur of, my Lords, the Biſhops that are in poſſeſſion; let them keep it (I ſay) till they die; and die they muſt, and then their Biſhopricks being vacant, (by Death however, if not ſooner juſtly forfeited) it will be no Injury to any Man, to ſhare out and divide the vaſt Incomes to many Biſhops, who muſt take the pains, and perform the Work of a Biſhop, in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perſons, which is now done by Proxies, Sureties, and Implicite Faith.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>I</hi> doubt not but that all my Lords the Biſhops would be of my mind herein, as to the Work of a Biſhop, which they themſelves; and all Engliſh-men, find to be ſo great a Work, and a Burden ſo much too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy for any ſingle Shoulder, that they are forc'd to perform the great Acts of a Biſhop, in Ordinations, Confirmations, Excommunications, Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only by Foppiſh as well as Popiſh like Implicite Faith, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with other Mens Eyes, and hearing with other Mens Ears, that it is no wonder that they err ſo often.</p>
               <p>Oh! but the Wages then muſt be divided, as well as the Work, Fleſh and Blood cannot bear this Doctrine:</p>

               <p>But that is the Fault of the Perſon, not of the Conſtitution; If that were true, it might be amended; but it is falſe, for it is not the Fault of the Perſon only, but the Fault of the Conſtitution, which obliges no Biſhop in his Office, and performance of theſe great Epiſcopal Acts, but only to the knowledge of a Novice, or implicite Faith.</p>
