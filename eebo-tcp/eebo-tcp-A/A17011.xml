         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Then lette the Miniſteriall Cleargie of <hi>England</hi> yeelde mee patience; for I defend the doctrine and opinion of all godly and famous profeſſors of Diuinitie, all Popes, Fathers, and Doctours that euer were in the Church, all Councelles particular and generall, all forren &amp; domeſticall Vniuerſities, Schooles, Colledges, and places of chriſtian learning, ſince the time of Chriſt, to <hi>Martine Luther:</hi> where ſo many thouſandes or millions of miraculouſly approoued holy Saintes, haue liued and died, in

wiſh it, that fauour I intreate, is the way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace, to peace with heauen, to peace with earth, with all others, with our ſelues. All things deſire peace, and ſeeke for reſt, and your wiſedomes are not, will not, cannot be againſt it. And to knowe the way of peace, there is a ground in Artes, vppon which all knowledge is grounded; <hi>Quae conueniunt vnitertio, conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt inter ſe, &amp;c.</hi> Thoſe thinges that agree in a third thing, agree among themſelues, and ſuch as diſagree in a third, diſagree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For if things agree, they muſt needes agree in ſomething, if they agree not in that wherein they ſhoulde agree, of neceſſity they muſt be at variance; and at greater difference, by howe much their difference is greater, in that wherein they ſhoulde conſent; this is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in all communities and agreements. That which maketh peace and vnitie with God and man, is true Religion, that bindeth them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That which vniteth Chriſtians, is the one certaine rule and promulgation of that faith; that which concordeth man with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the inferiour appetites to reaſon, is the grace which that Religion giueth, and by howe much wee differ moſt in theſe things, by ſo much our diſagreement with God, with men, with our ſelues is greater. The Kingdomes, and Countries, Kings and Rulers of <hi>Spaine, Fraunce, Italie, Polonia, Sueuia, Tranſiluania, Bohemia, Auſtria, Bauaria, Sauoy, Lorraine, Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie, Burgundy,</hi> and other Countries agree in theſe things, and they are at perfect vnitie and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14694:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
peace; and vntill they did agree therein, they were not. And all other Countries and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes agree more or leſſe, as they agree here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; there is no Religion wherein <hi>England</hi> can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with any, becauſe the Religion thereof is different from all; neither can any twoo Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Nations haue this peace together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no twoo of them bee of one Religion. If wee will agree in this poynt with Catholicke Nations, wee ſhall agree with God, becauſe true Religion is our vnion with him, wee ſhall agree with Angelles, for the ſame is approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with them, wee ſhall agree with all glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoules in Heauen, for this is neceſſarie to the communion and communication of Saints; wee ſhall be at concorde with the happy patient Chriſtians in Purgatorie, wee ſhall haue peace with our ſelues, with all Catholicke Chriſtians in the worlde, that be, that euer were before vs, or ſhall be after.
