            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O City of harlots, though now thou ſitteſt like a Queen, among the virgin Daughters of Sion, and by thy ſorceries art become mighty; thou, that haſt ſubdued that terrible

            <p>Abating of ſin, is the allaying of Judgement, unfined hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation: the onely Antidote againſt diſtruction; ballance thy ſorrowes with thy ſins, thy repentance with the true effects, then tell me, are not thy tranſgreſſions ſealed, thy dayes numbred.</p>

            <p>O City of blood! how haſt thou ſlaine the Prieſts of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114367:3"/>
Lord; and caſt them out, (like Dung) from the Inheritance of the God of <hi>Iacob,</hi> how haſt thou exalted in their roomes, Prophets that propheſie falſly; becauſe the people love to have it ſo: thy adulterate Pallate loathed <hi>Manna,</hi> choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather <hi>Egiption</hi> morſells, ſtinking garlick before the bread of Heaven. Thou haſt pull downe Ceremony, and ſet up hereſie, caſt out innovation, and brought in confuſion, the baſeſt of thy people wing'd with thy ſhelter, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed ſtalles for Pulpits; as if no <hi>Rabby</hi> ſo ſeraphicall as an ambitious Mechannick (under the falſe gloſſe of illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) to make the Proſelite. Rotten ſticks do yeeld a light, but not profitable, if ſtarres appeare by day, 'tis no leſſe then ominous; and what influence theſe <hi>Glo-wormes</hi> have on thy diviner part, to act thy ſoule for heaven, to the judicious eye is held miraculus; ſhall not theſe things be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thee.</p>
            <p>O City of pride, hath <hi>England</hi> trembled, and art thou exalted, what a miſeable ſoleciſme is this <hi>humilem deum, &amp; ſuperbum hominem,</hi> to have a humble God in heaven, and a proude man on Earth! Oh bluſh for ſhame, if yet be left one drop of grace within thy veines, ſhould one of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers ariſe from his bed of earth, behold our garbes, and take a ſtrict ſurvey of all our vaine attire; would he not ſtand amazed, and diſacknowledge us his generation, being ſo divercified in moode and figure from our <hi>quondam dayes</hi>? what a monſtrous birth flowes from thy fruitfull wombe? what prodigious meteors, apparitions of men and women, ſe we dayly in our ſtreetes? what? the glorious Queene become ſo baſe a whore, to proſtitute under every hedge, to open her quiver to every arrow, to act every new invented ſin, to embrace lovers of all ſorts, of all faſhions, knoweſt thou not that Pride goes before diſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi>16.18. Therefore becauſe the Daughters of <hi>Zion,</hi> yea and perſons too, are haughty, walking with ſtretcht out necks, and with wandring eyes, walking and minſing as they go, &amp;c. the Lord ſhall make their heads bald, and diſcover their ſecret
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114367:4"/>
parts, <hi>Eſa.</hi>3.16.17. and becauſe thy wantonneſſe is ſo exceeding great, as to act thy ſhame in publike, with ſuch brazen impudency; inſtead of ſweet ſavour, there ſhall be a ſtinck, and inſtead of a girdle, a rent; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of dreſſing (frizlig podering) the hare baldnes inſtead of a ſtomack, ſackcloth, &amp; burning inſtead of beauty; yea thy men ſhall fall by the ſword, and thy ſtrength in the battel; then ſhall thy gates mourne, and thou being deſolate ſhall ſit upon the ground. <hi>Eſa.</hi>3.24,25,26.</p>
            <p>O City of ſin! how do thy ſtreetes ring with oaths? &amp; thy houſes with ſuch hydeous blaſphemies, enough to blaſt the univerſe, and make it crack into a diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The very Pagan Gods (whereof the Divell was one) durſt never (without death) be ſo blaſphemed, as is (by thee) that glorious Diety whoſe Character thou beareſt, by whoſe name thou art called Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; do not thy horrid oathes, thy helliſh execrations Peale lower then the thunder, though thoſe elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall jarrs makes the earth to quake, and the very roof of heaven to tremble. To ſlay a man is death; but to murder the Sonne of God, a twelve-penny fine is a ſufficient expiation; nay it were well if that were done; our iniquity intollerable! good lawes; bad executioners.</p>
            <p>In a word, what cryes, what cruelties, what yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the poor, what clamours of diſtreſſed ſoules, what roaring of the bruiſed bones, what craſhing of broken limbs, proclames thy ruine? what drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe and open vomitings, what whoredoms and unheard of filthineſſe? (the nomination whereof would ſparkles bluſhes in a heathen cheek) what
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114367:4"/>
prophanations of the Lords day, what tragicall ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies and bloody expreſſions, what unmercifull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions infects the very aire, and like ſo many ſhrill Alarmes, trumpets forth thy deſolation. <hi>Niniveth</hi> had bnt forty dayes to breath repentance in, thou haſt had many thouſands; but ſhe repented, go to ſinners ſchoole O City of abomination; coppy out, practice <hi>Niniveth.</hi> Art thou ſure of her priviledges haſt thou forty dayes to turne thee in? Generall ſorrow may beget a generall ſafety; but without a ſpeedy humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, expect a ſpeedy deſolation; what is thy Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more then other Beloveds? this City more then other Cities? The Lord is juſt, and his ſpirit will not alwayes ſtrive: when the Lyon roares, all the Beaſts of the Forreſt tremble, when the Lord ſhall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his voice, and the Almighty Thunderer blow upon a people, is then the time, to ſit downe to eat and drinke, for to morrow they muſt dye? the great <hi>Belteſhazars</hi> joynts uncymented, his whole frame fell into an Earthquke, when the finger of heaven was penning out his doome, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. Oh that thou hadſt an eye to ſee, an eare to heare, a heart to conſider, thy grievous ſin, thy great reproach, thy approahing ruin, ſhall the Lord whiſtle for an executioner from farre; behold the Sonne eut of thy bowels, longs for thy dayes of mourning, and the Lord will reinforſe that Arme, thon haſt ſtrengthned, exalted, to deſtroy thee.</p>
            <p>Therefore if any roome for ſighs, if any way for teares be left unto the throne of grace, ſtep into the gap, quench the wrath gone forth, make an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114367:5"/>
for the people; if but tenn faithfull ones, be found within thy ſpecious walles, cry aloud, ſpare not; the Lord will do great things for the tenns ſake, And the everlaſting God gracious and mercifull, who forgiveth iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin, pardon thy rebellions, and grant thee favour in his ſight, that thou mayſt live to laugh thine enemies in the face; to be the joy and comfort of this dejected Nation, and the glory of the world; for his ſake, that bought thee with his own hearts blood, Jeſus Chriſt true, God bleſſed for ever.
