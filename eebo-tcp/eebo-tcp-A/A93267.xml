         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DECLARATION
OF
Sundry <hi>Grievances</hi> concerning <hi>Tinne and Pewter,</hi> worthy the ſerious Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Honourable Houſes of PARLIAMENT, in the behalfe of the <hi>Pewterers,</hi> and
People of the three KINGDOMES.</head>
            <byline>By <hi>I. S.</hi> A deſirer of his Countries Freedomes.</byline>
            <opener>Humbly ſheweth,</opener>
            <p>THAT Tinne the Native and Royall commodity of this Nation, hath formerly ſet on worke many thouſand Families of Engliſh men in their
owne Land, who by the Manifacture thereof have been inabled to ſupport themſelves, to the Honour of the Nation, the comfort of their
Families, and uſefull to the Publick where they have lived; But of later yeares by reaſon of Oppreſſion they are much decayed, and greatly
impoveriſhed, by which the whole Nation and Kingdome is much diſhonoured and abuſed; the working our Native Commodity almoſt wholy
become the Trade of Strangers, as will clearely appeare by the Particulars following. Viz.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by the covetouſneſſe of a few particular men, who to make themſelves rich though in the Kingdomes Ruine, have by indirect meanes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
Patents to themſelves to have (like the Soape-men) the ſole Trade in their own hands, and have hereby not onely advanced the price neare one
halfe upon the Nation, but limiting and binding the Free People in the uſe, buying, working, and ſelling their Native Commodities; ſo as by theſe
meanes they have been forced to leave their Calling ore; elſe to follow them in other Countries, ſometimes to their utter undoing, and Kingdomes
diſhonour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas former PARLIAMENTS have taken great Care that all liquid Meaſures ſhould be made of Pewter, according to the ancient
Standard of the Kingdome, the deareneſſe of the ſaid Commodity inforced the poorer ſort of People to buy whited Iron; a deceitfull out-Landiſh
commodity, French Juggs, Flanders Cans, &amp;c. So by the poverty of ſome, but fraudulency of moſt, all ſort of People are deceived in their
Meaſure, eſpecially the poore and Traveller in things of neare concernment, as Ale, Beere, Milk, Oyle, &amp;c. Yea, the Strangers that live amongſt us
have great cauſe of complaint to the great diſhonour of our Nation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, although Tinne is at this great price, it is preſumed, not in any City or Towne in England out of Cornewall is one block of Tinne
to be bought for any Money; When in Amſterdam, Roan, Paris, Conſtanſtinople, Legorn &amp;c. there is very great quantity of Engliſh Tinne in the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Engliſh Merchants ſuppoſed Tinne-Patentees; ſo as thoſe whoſe Livelihood hath depended upon the foreſaid Commodity, have been forced
to buy it in Holland or elſewhere, and it is at preſent ſold in LONDON at 18 pence a pound, having never been ſold at the Mines for above 3 l. <hi>per</hi>
a hundred weight, little more then 6 d. a Pound, a ſad thing to conſider that a free People ſhould be ſo abuſed in their owne Native Commodities.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Whereas in moſt part of the World Engliſh wrought pewter hath beene in very great eſteeme, as many Merchants can teſtifie, till now
of late yeares, ſince they have beene ſupplyed and incouraged with Tinne unwrought in great abundance, and the Patentees having gotten a power
did prohibit without their Licence the tranſportation of wrought Pewter: which Licence could not be attained for any part where their unwrought
Tinne, ſold; to the great diſcouragement of the Merchant, and the undoing the Manefacture of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Forraine States having ſupply of Tinne, in their wiſdome for the good of their owne people; As Holland, part of France, and Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
&amp;c. prohibited the bringing in of wrought Pewrer as formerly. Excepting for private uſe doe ſet on worke their owne Nation, and ſupply
many parts of the World with debaſed falſe mettle: bringing without Controwle great quantities into Scotland and Ireland ſtriking the Kingdomes
Roſe and Crowne upon it. A knowne Marke in forraigne parts to teſtifie the juſt goodneſſe of Pewter, according to the Lawes of this Land. By
meanes whereof, Our Engliſh Nation is greatly abuſed, and if not timely prevented, the Manifacture will come to nothing.</p>
            <p>It is therefore humbly deſired and conceived for the prevention of the fore-mentioned evills, or worſe for the future; The ſupporting of many
thouſand Families whoſe Livelyhoods depend upon the Manefacture of the aforeſaid Commodity, The maintaining the Ancient Eſteeme of Engliſh
Pewter, which is made to a perfect Standard of goodneſſe, and the Honour of the Nation; Theſe few things amongſt many other may prove very
worthy the ſerious Conſideration of the Honourable Houſe of PARLIAMENT, Of whoſe Care for the freedome and good of the Common-Wealth,
The Experience of this Age (to their Prayſe) will tell Poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <label>1.</label> That Proviſion may be made that the Kingdome of England be furniſhed with Tinne as formerly, and that any Engliſh man may be free
to trade in the ſaid Commodity from the Mines in Cornwall &amp;c: to any part of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <label>2.</label> That all Tinne may be wrought into Pewter, or caſt into Barres before it be tranſported, which will be a good meanes to uphold the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,
and to keepe the Tinner from falſifying it: which otherwiſe may eaſily be done, and hath beene much uſed, as may be clearely proved by
many Returnes of falſe Mettle from beyond the Sea, and Experience at home.</p>
            <p>
               <label>3.</label> For the benefit of the State at leaſt 20 ſhillings in every hundred weight may be paide by way of Cuſtome; Kings Revenue or otherwiſe upon
Tinne tranſported unwrought more then wrought Pewter.</p>
            <p>
               <label>4.</label> That wrought Pewter may be prohibited from being brought into any part of the three Kingdomes from beyond the Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <label>5.</label> That Exciſe upon Tinne may be payde by the firſt buyer, from the Tinner in Cornwall &amp;c: which may be done with eaſe by one Office to
prevent Many. So the Commodity will come alike to all men.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It is deſired after ſo many yeares bondage, and for almoſt five yeares, this Commodity hath beene kept out of the PARLIAMENTS Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by the Enemy, but now at laſt by the Bleſſing of God, and Vigilancie of our Armyes, both the Tinne and the greateſt part of the weſt Countrey
is under their Command, and having for a long time waited, doe not know but this may be the bleſſed Opportunity that the Honourable PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT
in their grand wiſedome will thinke upon ſome way of Redreſſe in this Particular for the Honour and Credit of our Nation, the Weale,
and Comfort of all Sorts of People, from the greateſt to the leaſt, that they being delivered from thoſe Taske-Maſters the Patentees, may be free
men to get their bread, by the working of their Native Commodity, and have meaſure according to Lawes provided in that behalfe. For the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
whereof, the Peoples eyes are upon Your Honours, for whom they are in Duty bound to pray, &amp;c.</p>
