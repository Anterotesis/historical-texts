            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <lg>
               <l>WE have layn under Hatches many years,</l>
               <l>Enthrall'd at firſt with Jealouſies and fears:</l>
               <l>Since then, th'Indulgence of Pope <hi>Oliver</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Pardon'd all ſins did to his Riſe refer.</l>
               <l>Then Dapper <hi>Dicky</hi> did ſucceed his Sire,</l>
               <l>A very gentle, proper, ample Squire,</l>
               <l>A Man of Wax, that each Fool work'd upon:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fleetonian,</hi> or a <hi>Lambertonian,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>They then prevailing, did prepare a Pack</l>
               <l>Of all-together Knaves, walk, What d'yee lack:</l>
               <l>This was the Rumpin, Thumpin, Rumpin <hi>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MP,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To Rhyme to which, my Wits I'm forc'd to Pump.</l>
               <l>The Rump had not ſate long, but it began</l>
               <l>To ſtink i' th'Noſtrils of th'Soulderian.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Wallingford-Houſe</hi> gave light to <hi>Hewſons</hi> Eye,</l>
               <l>To finde the ready way to Butchery.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Sultan Lambert</hi>'s Pride, with paces even,</l>
               <l>Trac'd <hi>NOLL</hi> in Mr. <hi>Sterry's</hi> way to Heaven:</l>
               <l>He ſway'd the Officer with Swadling Clout,</l>
               <l>Untill Your Excellency gave him the Rout:</l>
               <l>You murther'd him in point of his Repute,</l>
               <l>In that you Vanquiſh'd him without Diſpute;</l>
               <l>That, ſince <hi>(My Lord)</hi> You have appear'd, the Elſ</l>
               <l>Is <hi>A la mort,</hi> and may go <hi>Hoyle</hi> himſelf.</l>
               <l>Thus hath our late ſo famous Government,</l>
               <l>Been, by the Teeth of Malice, torn and rent;</l>
               <l>Which, to patch up again, the Cobler comes,</l>
               <l>The Botcher, and the Tinker, with their Thumbs:</l>
               <l>But your approach diſpers'd that Rabble Rout,</l>
               <l>Baniſh'd our Fears, and gave our Hopes no doubt:</l>
               <l>So that we ſee your Word's of greater force,</l>
               <l>Than the huge Menaces of Foot or Horſe;</l>
               <l>That, like <hi>Cyneas,</hi> you a Conqueſt gain</l>
               <l>Where e're you come, and yet not any ſlain.</l>
               <l>A Civil Garland hath Renown'd you more,</l>
               <l>Than all his Bloody Triumphs did before:</l>
               <l>Your Prudence hath brought Peace unto our Gates,</l>
               <l>And knit the diſlocated Joynts of States;</l>
               <l>That, by inſtinct, We ſenſibly do feel</l>
               <l>Our Center fixt, that late began to reel.</l>
               <l>Religione purer Robe ſo rent and torn,</l>
               <l>Will be made new, and in a ſenſe, Re-born:</l>
               <l>The Law ſo threatned to be Ham-ſtring'd, now</l>
               <l>Will finde Protection from your awful brow;</l>
               <l>And Trading, that long time hath <hi>Bed-rid</hi> lain,</l>
               <l>Will ſprightly grow, and ſhake its Legs again:</l>
               <l>That we, e're long, ſhall be ſo innocent,</l>
               <l>As not to know what the word <hi>PLOT</hi> hath meant.</l>
               <l>Then blame Us not, if that our Joyes abound;</l>
