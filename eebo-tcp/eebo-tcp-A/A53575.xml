         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IT is now near Seven years since the
Ensuing Queries, (grounded, most
of them, on Holy Writ, or on the
Writings of Learned and Judicious men
of the Church of</hi> England) <hi>were one
Morning Cursorily written: Vpon the
sight of certain Queries that had been
delivered to, and answer'd by a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Minister; and to him only private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sent, without the least Design or Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of their ever being made publick;
but to Convince him, (with such others
of his Judgement, to whom he should
think good to communicate them) of the
unreasonableness, especially on Protestant
Principles, of exercising. Force and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion
in Religion, with the danger of
Persecuting any on the account thereof.
But no answer by him was ever return'd
unto their Author, who so little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
himself in them; that they were as
<pb facs="tcp:40679:3"/>
much out of his thoughts, as if they
had never been written by him: When
about</hi> Michaelmas 1676. <hi>he was surprised
with the news of a weak and unadvised
Parson's having taken them up into the
Pulpit with him, and there made them
the Subject of his Mornings Exercise, to
the Amazement of some, and Derision
of other of his Parishoners; who had
never before heard of them, and then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
not his Descant on them. But
the noise hereof, soon made them, which
for some years had been buryed in silence,
now the Discourse of the Country; and
they were not only oppugn'd from the
Press, the Pulpit, and the Pens of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Adversaries, but their Author Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
at the Assizes as Criminal;
though 'twill, perhaps, be difficult, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as they were written, and disposed
of by him, what Law of God or Man,
he therein Transgress'd; or what Civil
or Religious Interest was thereby injur'd;
since upon the severest Examination
and Scrutiny, they will be found to have
no worse aim or design, than to manifest
how Irrational it was, and how Inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
it must needs be, to all good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
(as well as inconsistent with the
<pb facs="tcp:40679:3"/>
Precepts of the Gospel, and Principles
of Christianity) to Force Religion; and
how dangerous to Persecute any on the
account thereof: And herein he is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to have the Concurrent opinion of
the most Learned and Judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of all Parties; though the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of too many of them, have not been
answerable thereunto; who, indeed, say
and do not: Nay may be said, some of
them to</hi> make themselves Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 18.</note>
in building again the things
which they destroyed. <hi>And though
'twould not be difficult to Compose a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
in but Transcribing what they have
Written to this purpose: I shall here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my self with a single Citation; yet it
being from one, who having had the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
and Applause of the Famousest
Vniversity of Christendom, as well as of
the Generality of Learned and Judicious
Men of the Reformation, may pass for
more then a single Testimony; and this
is the Eminently Learned and Acute
Mr.</hi> Chillingworth, <hi>who in his Treatise,
Entituled, the Religion of Protestants,
a safe way to Salvation; thus speakes:</hi>
I have learnt,<note place="margin">Chap. 5 §. 96. p. 265. Imp. 3.</note> 
               <hi>saith he,</hi> from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers of the Church; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:40679:4"/>
is more against Religion, then
to Force Religion: And of St. <hi>Paul,
The Weapons of the Christian Warfare
are not Carnal:</hi> And great Reason,
for humane Violence may make men
Counterfeit, but cannot make them
Believe; and is therefore fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but to breed From without,
and Atheisme within. Besides, <hi>saith he,</hi>
if this means of bringing men to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
any Religion were generally
used, (as if it may be justly used in any
place, by those that have Power, and
think they have Ttuth: Certainly they
cannot with Reason deny, but that it
may be used in every place, by those
that have Power as well as they, and
think they have Truth as well as they,)
what could follow but the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
perhaps of Truth; but perhaps,
only of the Profession of it in one
place, and the Oppression of it in an
hundred? What will follow from it, but
the preservation, peradventure of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but peradventure only of Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in particular States and Churches,
but the Immortalizing the greater and
more lamentable Divisions of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and the World? And therefore
<pb facs="tcp:40679:4"/>
what can follow from it, but perhaps,
in the Judgment of Carnal Policy, the
Temporal benefit and Tranquillity of
Temporal States and Kingdoms; but
the Infinite Prejudice, if not the Deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Kingdom of Christ? And
therefore it well becomes them who
have their Portions in this life, who
serve no higher State, then this of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
or <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>France;</hi> nor this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
any further than they serve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by it: Who think of no other
Happiness, but the Preservation of
their own Fortunes, and Tranquillity
in this world; who think of no other
means to preserve Estates but Humane
Power, and <hi>Machivèllian</hi> Policy; and
believe no other Creed but this, <hi>Regi
aut Civitati imperium habenti nihil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justum
quod utile.</hi> Such men as these,
it may well become to maintain by
worldly Power and Violence, their
State-Instrument, Religion: For if all be
vain and false, (as in their Judgment
it is) the present whatsoever, is better
then any, because it is already Settled;
an alteration of it, may draw with it
change of States; and the change of
State the Subversion of their Fortune.
<pb facs="tcp:40679:5"/>
But they that are indeed Servants
and Lovers of Christ, of Truth, of the
Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of Mankind; ought
with all courage to oppose themselves
against it, as a Common enemy of all
these. They that know there is a King
of Kings, and Lord of Lords, by whose
will and pleasure King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and Kingdoms
stand and fall; they know that to no
King or State, any thing can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
which is unjust; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more evidently unjust,
then to force weak men, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of a Religion which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not; to loose their own Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Happiness, out of a vain and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
fear, least they may possibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
their Temporal quietness: There
being no danger to any State from
any mans Opinion, unless it be such
an Opinion of which Disobedience to
Authority, or Impiety is taught or
Licenc'd; which sort, I confess, may
justly be punisht as well as other
Faults; or, unless this Sanguinary
Doctrine be joyned with it; that it is
lawful for him by humane violence to
enforce others to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40679:5"/>
This was the Judgment of this Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and Judicious Divine of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> concerning Force in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and of those Doubtless, who Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd
and Approv'd of this his Learned
and Judicious Treatise; in which they
unanimously declare, <hi>to find nothing
contrary to the Doctrine and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Church of</hi> England: So
that it is not the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
that approves or allows of Force in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or that Carnal weapons are to be
used in the Christian warfare; but such
of her Degenerate and Base Sons only,
as forsake the Law of their Mother. For,
as he hath well observ'd <hi>Humane Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
may make men Counterfeit, but
cannot make them Believe; and is
therefore fit for nothing, but to breed
Form without, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thism within;</hi> which
should make it to be abhorr'd and detested
by all sincere and good Christians. And
surely the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who decryes,
and so highly condemnes blind Obedience
in the Duties of Religion, can never Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
or Allow of Forceing any therein
against their Light and Judgments:
which is, certainly, the worst of blind
Obediences: For, since <hi>Whatever is
<pb facs="tcp:40679:6"/>
not of Faith, is sin;</hi> Whatever a man
does against his Faith, or Conscience,
must needs be much more so.</p>
            <p>And as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Approves, nor Allows of Secular
Force and Compulsion in Religion; and
much less that any should be therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to do ought against their Light
or Judgments, which were to sin against
their Consciences: So she as little Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
or Approves of Persecuting, or any
wayes Molesting or Troubling any for the
real performance of any truly Christian
Exercise of Religien. Nor, I dare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to say, does any Law of <hi>England</hi>
Allow or Countenance, much less Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
or Require any such thing; though
too many have Misconstru'd and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply'd
the late <hi>Act for Preventing and
Supressing Seditious Conventicles,</hi> to the
Disturbing and Punishing, I may say
Ruining of many Peaceable and Pious
people, for Meeting only, really and truly
to Worship and serve God: For the Act
does not say, if any person or persons above
such a number, shall meet to Worship God
truly and sincerely, in other manner than
according to the Liturgy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They shall
incurre the Penalty mention'd: <hi>But
<pb facs="tcp:40679:6"/>
where any Person,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at any Meeting, under Colour or
Pretence of any Exercise of Religion,
in other manner than according to the
Liturgy and Practice of the Church of</hi>
England, <hi>&amp;c. It shall and may be
Lawful,</hi> &amp;c. The Act certainly, does
not prohibit or punish any real and truly
Christian Exercise of Religion; for if it
did, it were, <hi>Ipso Facto,</hi> null and void,
as being against the Law of God. But if
it be objected, it appears not whether
their Worship be Sincere or Pretended
only; and the Law prohibites such a
number to meet, <hi>under any colour or
pretence of any Exercise of Religion,
in other manner then according to the
Liturgy and Practice of the Church of</hi>
England; and punishes those that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
the same: 'Tis answer'd, that all
Pretences ought in Charity to be believ'd,
where no Over-act discovers the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
or falsehood of the mind: But since
there is so little Charity amongst men;
let it be shown wherein the Exercises of
Religion, which some have been pleased
to punish by vertue, or colour rather, of
that Law; were in other manner than,
according to the Liturgy and Practice of
<pb facs="tcp:40679:7"/>
the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If it be said
they ought to be perform'd in the very
words of the Liturgy; it is more than
the Act sayes: And the Practice of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> has ever allowed
men to pray, even in Publick, in other
words than are prescribed in the Liturgy.
Our Blessed Saviour teaching his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to pray, said unto them; <hi>After
this manner,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 9.</note> therefore pray ye; <hi>Our
Father which art in Heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 1 14. 4. 24, &amp;c.</note> &amp;c. And
yet we do not find in Scripture,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 9. 10. 1.</note> (where
their Prayers are often Recorded) that
they ever prayed by that Form,<note place="margin">Eph 1. 16, &amp;c.</note> but in
other words,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 1, 2, 3, 10.</note> agreeing for matter, and
yet they were accepted.<note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> There are none
therefore, I hope, will say, they disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Lord and Master, by praying in
other manner than he taught and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them, because they prayed not
by that Form: No more do they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
the Law against praying in other
manner than according to the Liturgy
and Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
who pray not by the words of the Liturgy
while they pray in other words agreeing
with it for matter. What pretence then,
can any have to Charge the Author of
these Queries with Libelling the Church
<pb facs="tcp:40679:7"/>
and State; since they reflect on neither,
nor Cinsure, or by any undue surmises,
condemn ought that they approve or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of? Nay, is it not unreasonable to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that a Crime in any one, which is
the duty of every one, <hi>viz.</hi> To endeavour,
by all lawfull wayes and means, that all
that would, might <hi>lead peaceable and
quiet lives in all godliness and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty;</hi>
which they can never do, who
are forced to Profess, what they believe
not; and in the duties of Religion, to
practice what they approve not, which is
to live in a perpetual lye. The question
here is not, whether what is required of
any, be in it self sinful or unlawful; but
whether they who judge it so, be it through
Ignorance, or otherwise, can without sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
conform to it? There is no doubt
and question, but that many may, and
do, live Godly, Holily and Righteously,
in the Exercise of that Religion, which
to others, would be Damnable; for to
him who esteemeth a thing unclean, to
him it is so; though in it self, it may be
pure: So <hi>he that doubteth is damned
if he eat;</hi> while others perswaded of the
lawfulness thereof may safely use their
Liberty. Pleading therefore against Force
<pb facs="tcp:40679:8"/>
in Religion; we neither condemn nor
censure this or that Religion, which
teaches not that Sanguinary Doctrine;
but would that every one should be fully
perswaded in his own mind, the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he Embraceth and Professeth, is what
God wills and requires of him; since
<hi>whatever is not of Faith is sin,</hi> and
Faithin all things respects the Commands
and Authority of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It were, indeed, heartily to be wisht,
that all were of a mind, as to the due
performance of this great and indispens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
duty, the Worship of God: But this
is rather to be wished, then hoped for,
while there are men truly fearing God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 29. 13. Safe way to Salv. p. 187.</note>
               <hi>and those</hi> whose fear of him, is taught
by the Precept of men. There are,
<hi>(saith our Lerrned and Judicious Mr.</hi>
Chillingworth,) But two wayes that
may be conceived probable to reduce
Christians to unity of Communion:
The one, by taking away diversity of
Opinions touching matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
the other, by shewing that the
diversity of Opinions which is among
the several Sects of Christians, ought
to be no hindrance to their unity in
Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40679:8"/>
Now the former of these, <hi>saith he,</hi>
is not to be hoped for without a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle;
unless it could be made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to all men, that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
some visible Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
to whose Judgment all men
are to submit themselves. What then
remains, but that the other way must
be taken; and Christians must be
taught to set a higher value upon these
high points of Faith and Obedience
wherein they agree, than upon those
matters of less moment wherein they
differ; and understand that agreement
in those ought to be more effectual to
joyn them in one Communion; I mean,
<hi>saith he,</hi> In a common profession of
those Articles of Faith, wherein all
Consent: A joynt Worship of God
after such a way, as all esteem lawful:
And a Mutual performance of all those
works of Charity, which Christians
owe one to another. <hi>But whilst every
one hath a Confession, a Form of Worship,
a Church and its Authority, which must
be imposed on all others, we may look
and with for Peace, Moderation and
Vnity, but are never like to meet with
them on these Terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40679:9"/>
Those whom Experience will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of the vanity, of endeavouring to
bring Christians to Vnity of Communion,
by Secular Force or Compulsion; and of the
great Miseries, Persecutions and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
such Methods have in all Ages
brought upon the Churches and People of
God; with the little, or no, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that at any time hath thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued
to Religion; will never be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
thereof by the clearest Evidences,
or Demonstrations, of Reason. And
though it cannot be denyed, but that there
have been, and still are, many good and
holy men, who contend earnestly for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Force and Compulsion in Religion;
yet it must withall be said, 'tis a preposter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and blind zeal in them, to endeavour
to promote the Truth of Gospel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Laws of the Gospel. But for
the generality of its Advocats, nothing
is more evident, then that it is not for
the Interest of Religion; but for some Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Interest or Secular advantage, they
receive by it.</p>
            <p>'Tis strange that any not wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the State of Christendom, or most
Christian States; not to speak of the
Civil Powers, in other parts of the World;
<pb facs="tcp:40679:9"/>
should think that the Exercise of Secular
Force or Compulsion in Religion, can be
for the Interest of the Truth, when the
Generality of them are Ignorant of it,
if not enemies to it. But we are told,
where the Truth is once own'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
every Error and Heresy that riseth up
against it, ought to be Supprest and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated
by the Civil Sword. Will these
men then tell us, what Sect or Society,
not of Christians only, but of Jews, Turks
or Heathens, believe not themselves
alone possest of the Truth? So that this
Method of preserving and propagating
Religion, prevailing (as it doth too much
through the Power and Influence of the
God of this World, whose Kingdom of
darkness could not otherwise long stand
against the light and power of Truth.)
What, I say, doth or can follow upon it;
but perhaps the Profession of Truth in
one place, and the Oppression of it in an
hundred. Do not they who deny unto
such as Dissent from the Religion Estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht
here, the Exercise of their Religion;
upon the same ground, deny it also to all
the Reformed Churches, in all Popish
Countrys of <hi>Europe?</hi> To talk of Truth
and Error here is Ridiculous: For, as
<pb facs="tcp:40679:10"/>
we were but now told, <hi>If Force in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
may be justly used in any place
by those that have Power, and think
they have Truth; it cannot with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be denyed, but that it may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in every place, by those who have
Power as well as they, and think they
have Truth too, as well as they.</hi> But
were the same mind in us, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> was in
our Lord and Master Christ Jesus; the
same frame of Spirit, that was in his
Blessed Apostles; we would do to others,
as we would be done unto; and not mete
unto any, what we would not should be
meted unto us again. But whilst some
men make their Judgments or Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Rule or Standard of Truth and
Error; forcing others to embrace, or
renounce that as such, which they shall so
call or judge; whatever it appears to
them by the Rule, whereby they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to try and prove it; what Truth
or Peace can from thence be expected,
or hoped for? Well therefore might the

them, under pretence of Religion; nor
yet a Liberty for any to Preach or
Teach Doctrines Destructive or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to the Peace and Quiet of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Societies; but a <hi>Liberty of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
only, under the Magistrates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection:</hi>
And that such a Liberty
is the Natural and Common Right of
all Nations and Persons, hath been
so fully prov'd by many Eminent and
Learned men, even of the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> and particularly by the
Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Jeremy
Taylor,</hi> (late Bishop of <hi>Downe</hi> and
<hi>Conough)</hi> in his <hi>Discourse of the
Liberty of Prophesying,</hi> it would be
but, <hi>Actum agere,</hi> to say more. And
it argues great Ignorance or Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in those who persist Declaiming
against Liberty of Religion, without
offering at the least answer to what
hath been said for it, by this and other
Learned and Judicious Divines of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well as by most
of the Ancient and Orthodox Fathers
of the Church.</p>
            <p>As for that other Objection against
Liberty of Religion, that it will cause
Disturbance in the State: It is not
<pb facs="tcp:40679:11"/>
only against Reason, but the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of all Ages and Places; no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
being to be given that ever Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Religion gave Disturbance
to any Civil State: But the contrary,
the denying Christians their just Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
therein, hath been the unhappy oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the greatest Troubles, Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and Desolations, that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
most of the States and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
of Christendom.</p>
            <p>But to conclude this Point; The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
pleaded for, is no more, in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
then what by His Majesties late
Declaration of Indulgence to Dissenters,
was Allowed and Approved of by him,
a much better and Competenter Judge of
what is for the Nations Peace and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
then they who object this: Nor
was the Parliaments Exception to the
Indulgence granted, but the manner of
granting it; which they judg'd might be
of ill and dangerous Consequence: It is
therefore to be hoped, they will, in due
time take it into Consideration, and make
such provision for the preventing and
punishing Seditious Conventicles, as
wicked and ungodly men may not take
occasion from, to Molest and Disturb the
<pb facs="tcp:40679:11"/>
Assemblies of Peaceable and Pious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

difficult for this Answerer to
shew, what Truth he hath Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,
as what Truth these <hi>Queries</hi>

with his performances, is best
known unto themselves: But how
little he hath Complyed with the

Candid and Christian Resolution to

them, is left to the Judgment of every
Judicious and Intelligent Reader.</p>
            <p>Had he not himself told us, he had
Review'd what he had written; the
gross oversights he hath been guilty
of, might have been imputed to his
too hasty Pen; which he now gives
us to understand, are the effects of
something else.</p>
            <p>Had he convinc'd us of any mistakes
or Aberrations, we might have been
guilty of; we should have thank'd
him for the Discovery: But, as yet,
we cannot own the least Obligation
to him on that account.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Queries,</hi> he acknowledgeth here,
afford variety of matter for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of any Learned Pen, (they had
not else, been worthy his Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
and yet in his Title Page, they
were to be avoided, as Foolish and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
Questions. But more of this
anon.</p>
            <p>His Reader, I am perswaded, is no
less to seek for those old Truths, Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
with old Arguments, which
he promises him: Than for those new
Notions and Discoveries, he bids him
not to expect from him.</p>

It were, <hi>indeed, as he says,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

ought to have of the Church and their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours;

               <p>AS in all Disputations, 'tis necessary the

meant by Church, which in Scripture hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
acceptations;<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 22. 5. 23. 27.</note> for by Church there, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

of Christ; by some called the Holy Catholick
Church.<note place="margin">Acts 8. 3.</note> Sometimes again the universality of
the Professors of Christianity,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 6.</note> commonly called
the Church Catholick visible. And sometimes
by Church, is meant only a particular Church,
or Society of Christians united for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the worship of God in the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Ordinances, according to the Order
by Christ prescrib'd. Such was the Church at
<hi>Corinth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> the Church at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> the Church
at <hi>Antioch;</hi>

divers others mentioned in the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;<note place="margin">Rev. 2.</note>
and is the Church here inquired after:
To which this Answer, in saying, <hi>The Church,
or the Christian Church, is God's Family, or Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
&amp;c.</hi> answers not, the Question not being
concerning the Church in the <hi>1st.</hi> or <hi>2d.</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the word. But had he said, An Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Church of the Gospel; or as he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it, <hi>A Church Constituted and Govern'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40679:17"/>
to the Rules of the Gospel, is a Society of men
joyning together in the Profession of the Christian
Faith, having right Pastors or Officers, invested
with Power to Guide and Govern them in the
ways of God; and to dispence unto them the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of the Gospel,</hi> (which none but a Church
in the third acceptation of the word hath,) it
might have past for an answer to the Query,
though not so full and clear a one, as might have
been given.</p>
               <p>But whereas he says, <hi>He hopes, there may be
as well such a National Church in</hi> England, <hi>as
there was for above fifteen hundred years in</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine
<hi>among the Jews.</hi> If by such a National
Church, he means only, a Church having Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church-Officers over it, (as had the
Church of the Jews) no man sure doubts it;
But if by such a National Church, he means
a National Church of Divine Institution; we
see not whereon he grounds his hopes, since it
hath not pleased God to Institute, or appoint
any such National Church under the Gospel:
Nor does the Church of <hi>England</hi> pretend to
any such original, as is evident by the Statute
of the 25th of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Statute of Provisors of Benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> 
                  <hi>Where it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be founded in Prelacy, by the Kings and
Nobles of</hi> England; without the least pretence
to a Divine Institution, as had the National
Church of the Jews.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but that Christ, as he says,
would have his <hi>Church Catholick, as well as
Holy;</hi> yet not always <hi>so Illustrious or visible,</hi> as
to be seen and owned by the world. And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40679:18"/>
though <hi>whole Nations were to embrace the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, and upon that account to Constitute
the Christian Church,</hi> or Catholick Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
yet that doth not Constitute them Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Churches, such as was the Church of the
Jews; nor can they be so called, upon the same
account that a particular Church is called a
Church. And <hi>when Christ threatned the Jews
to take the Kingdom of God from them, and give
it unto a Nation that should bring forth the Fruits
of it; he meant, no doubt,</hi> as he says, <hi>more by a
Nation, then one particular Church;</hi> for he meant
a Nation (or People) that might have many
particular Churches, or Congregations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in it, but did not thereby Constitute,
or intend a National Church in his notion. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet did he confine the Christian Church to
a Nation; and consequently not <hi>within smaller
bounds then the Jewish was, when empal'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Land of</hi> Canaan. But how will this
Answerer prove it <hi>to have been</hi> as he says, <hi>far
from the mind of our Redeemer to crumble his
Church,</hi> (as he words it) <hi>into such minute and
little Principles of being,</hi> (as Congregational
Churches,) when the Scriptures give so great
evidence to the contrary, there being indeed
no other Instituted Church, under the Gospel,
then what is Congregational. And when our
Blessed Saviour Instituted those, he commanded
certainly, <hi>the Demolishing an Established National
Church,</hi> even the National Church of the
Jews; the only National Church in the world
of Gods Institution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40679:18"/>
The second part of this Query, does evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough intend a particular Church, as before
exprest, which 'tis not impossible but five or
six Persons may Constitute, notwithstanding
his peremptory denyal thereof; Christ himself
having told us; <hi>Where two or three are gathered
together in his name, he is in the midst of them;</hi>
which is the ground or principle of all Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Churches: and we read of the <hi>Church in
the House of</hi> Aquila <hi>and</hi> Priscilla;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 19.</note> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reasonably be supposed to consist of any
great number.</p>
               <p>By what means Persons become a Church
of Christ; <hi>And how particular Persons become
Members of the Church of Christ;</hi> are two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Questions; and even this, which is his
own, he answers not distinctly; for by his first
way, They become Members only of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church visible; By his second, They
become Members also of the Holy Catholick
Church, the mystical Body of Christ: so that
without distinguishing what is here and there
meant by Church; we are not like to be much
edified by this Answerer.</p>
               <p>That a <hi>visible Profession of Christianity, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
men to the Priviledges of the Church,</hi> in the
second acceptation of the word, may be true;
which yet, with his good leave, their Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries
and Immoralitys may again deprive
them of, notwithstanding the Church at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths</hi>
delay in casting out the incestuous person.
But 'tis not every vice or error in a Member
of a particular Church, that Unchurches them.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40679:19"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore might very well own the
Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> for a Church; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Debaucheries and Immoralities that
were in some of its Members. But the tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, was certainly a Crime, which the
Parable of the Tares and Wheat will never
justifie: for though they were <hi>to grow together
till Harvest,</hi> it was not in the Church, but in
the world; for so our Saviour declares the
field to be.<note place="margin">Matt; 13. 38.</note> Nor will the parable of the Net,
and good and bad Fishes contained therein, give
any more countenance to this fond Assertion;
that Debaucheries and Immoralities are, or
may be tolerated in a Christian Church: or
that Debaucht and Immoral persons, are not
to be debarr'd the Priviledges thereof; If that
be, as it seems to be, this Answerers meaning;
the Apostle commanding that the Incestuous
person be delivered unto Satan: <hi>i. e.</hi> cast out
of the Church, the Kingdom of God, into the
world, the Kingdom of the Devil.</p>

it seems, <hi>we are only to withdraw from such as

the matter in Question; though in a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
and froward manner, he tells us, <hi>If there
be a purer Church they may betake themselves to it:</hi>
Whereby he seems to acknowledge, That it is
every mans duty to chuse the Communion of
the purest Church: Nor does he say, that in
the choice thereof, a man is bound to follow
anothers Judgement against his own; and if he
be not, why are any molested for but doing
their duty? and though possibly they may be
mistaken in their choice; yet while they are so
by misfortune, and not their fault; God will
pardon it, and men ought not to punish it; at

Yea, but says this Answerer, <hi>They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce

Does he believe, the <hi>French</hi> Protestants cast

that the Parliament went expressly against a

worship God in Assemblies, Separate from
the Parochial Congregations, more then all the
Reformed Churches, in all Popish Conntries in
<hi>Europe,</hi> both do, and have done, ever since
they had a Being; and yet, I hope, they set
not Altar against Altar: or if they do, let him

                  <hi>His objection against</hi> Dissenters being let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
or snffer'd to go on in their way; in that it
will, as he says, administer occasion to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

amongst the Professors of Christianity?</hi> which is
a Notion, I am sure, he never met with in the

I dare say, in any judicious or intelligent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor:
Nor is it easie to conceive what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
by it, or in what sense a National Church
can be said to be the ground of Unity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
amongst the Professors of Christianity;
who are dispersed over all Nations; if by it,
he means only amongst the Professors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
in a Nation; it is very impertinent;
for a Diocesan Church, or a Parochial Church,
is as much the ground of Unity and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
amongst the Professors of Christianity in

amongst the Professors of Christianity in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But 'tis impossible, <hi>says this Answerer,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

of Christianity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what Church, and what Unity, is
here intended? If a National Church? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
consists its Unity? It cannot consist in a
joynt Assembly for the celebration of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of the Gospel; or any one of them,
as was the Case of the Church of the Jews
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40679:22"/>
which met at set times, in one place for the
performance of that worship which was then
required. If it shall be said, its visible Unity
consists in a subordination of Officers in this
Church, centring in one: It will be said like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and with as good reason, That if such
an Unity of a National Church be necessary,
for the great ends of Christianity, the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and promoting of Peace and Unity; the
same Unity of the Catholick Church visible, is
no less necessary for the same ends, and so much
more desirable, as the Unity of the whole,
with the Peace and Piety thereof, is more to
be desired, then the Unity, Peace and Piety of
a part: and where then shall we end, but in a
Pope? This is so obvious to every understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that none who plead for the one, can with
any colour or shadow of reason reject the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
And if <hi>this Profession,</hi> as this Answerer
says, <hi>Obliges all persons to acquiess in those deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
by which the Church is visibly upheld
and maintained;</hi> It does so no less in respect of
the Catholick Church visible, then of a Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

of the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> in taking

with others exercising the like

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40679:23"/>
from the Members, or Subjects of that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
But whether Christians have not a Right
and Liberty to chuse their Communion; or
whether it be not their duty to joyn themselves
unto such Congregations, in the participation
of the Ordinances of the Gospel, as they judge
to walk according to the rule of the Gospel;
and wherein they may be best edified in the
knowledge of Jesus Christ; and of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in and by him; which this Answerer
does not deny; neither can it reasonably be
denyed: For, I presume, none will say, It is
every mans duty to be of the Communion of
that Church, where providence hath cast his
Nativity, or confin'd his abode; Because there
born, or abiding: Nor yet, that it is any mans
duty to continue in that Church, wherein he
hath been educated, if after serious and sober
enquiry and Examination, any thing therein
injoyn'd or requir'd to be profest or done, be
judg'd unlawful or unwarrantable by a mans
own Conscience. But that every one, who is
actually a Member of any Church or Christian
Society; ought, while he so continues, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to its Laws and Constitutions; none sure
will deny: Nor can any hinder or forbid
Churches of whatever denomination, <hi>to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Bounds of their own Communion; and
that by such Constitutions and Rights, as they in
their wisdoms, shall judge necessary to preserve Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Vnity; and advance the edification of
those under their charge and Government. This,</hi> as
he very well says, <hi>is essential to the Church, as it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40679:23"/>
is a Society; and there can be no Society without
Government; and no Government if every one be
allowed the Priviledge to question and disobey its
Laws and constitutions; nothing being more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
then that they who are intrusted with the
reins of Government, should be invested with a
Power to decide and determine all Differences and
Controversies arising in that Government;</hi> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
will not acquiess therein, ought to be
banisht the Society: But the Paralogisme is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gross and foul, to argue, That because they
who submit not to the Laws and Constitutions
of a Society, ought to be banisht that Society;
therefore they who submit not to the Laws and
constitutions of the Church, ought to be banisht
the Commonwealth. 'Tis sufficient to the ends
of Government, they be banisht that Society
only, whose Laws and Constitutions they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

<hi>Non opus est habere civem qui parere nescit;</hi> neither
Church nor Commonwealth have need of those
persons who know not how to obey. But till
there be a due distinction made between the
Church and State; between civil and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

            <p>Whether is there any visible living Judge in
Doubts and Controversies of Religion, to whose
determinations any man is bound to yield his
assent and obedience, against the Dictates of
his own Conscience, guided (according to the

Gods word?</p>
            <div type="reply">
               <head>Reply to the Answer to this Query.</head>
               <p>A Clear and positive Answer to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
would go far towards the ending our
greatest differences and Disputes in Religion:
For either, there is, or there is not such a
Judge as is here inquired after: if such an one
there be; let him be produc'd, and his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
in all Controversial points, be made
known, that they may be submitted to: or if
there be no such Judge, why are any molested
and troubled for going according to their own
Judgements and Consciences, when it is their
duty so to do?</p>
               <p>what is said of <hi>a Churches being a Society,
and that every Society may agree upon the means
by which all differences arising in it, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd,
that may probably violatate the Peace
and Vnity thereof;</hi> is not to the present Question,
which is only concerning such a Judge in Doubts
and Controversies of Religion; to whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations,
every one is bound to yield his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40679:24"/>
Assent and obedience against his own Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
We have already acknowledg'd, That
they who submit not to the Laws and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of a Church, ought to be cast out of
that Church; which is a sufficient means, and
the only means of preserving the Peace and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
thereof: And if the Church of <hi>England</hi>
assumes no other Power or Priviledge; there is
no ground of quarrel or exceptions against her
for that: But whereas, he says, <hi>She does not
like the Papists, own any Judge of Controversies in
Religion;</hi> If he means Infallible Judge, like the
Papists; none says She does: Or if his meaning
be, That She owns no such Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
as to oblige any to acquiess in her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations,
against their own Judgements,
as it seems to be, by his saying, <hi>She requires none
of her Members to yield obedience to her Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
against the Dictates of their Consciences:</hi>
why does he, molest and trouble any for not
yielding such obedience. And if <hi>all she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi>
as he says, <hi>be but, That obedience be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to those Laws which are undoubtedly Divine;
An acquiescence yielded to some disputable points,</hi>
&amp;c. (which are not against a mans Conscience)
<hi>and a conformity to some indifferent Rites,</hi> &amp;c.
(which all judge to be indifferent) no rational
man can sure except against any of this: nor
deny the Governours of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
to be as much Umpires, and Judges in these
matters, as the Pastors and Elders in any of
the Separated Congregations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:40679:25"/>
                  <hi>It is,</hi> as he very well says, <hi>A vain thing for
men to plead, that they make Conscience their
guide, unless they take Scripture for their rule.</hi>
Nor can any <hi>plead Conscience for disobeying Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Authority in things innocent and indifferent,</hi>
where they judge the things commanded to be
so; but what some may count indifferent, others
may judge sinful. The Scripture commanding
obedience, and to be Subject for Conscience-sake;
does sufficiently manifest that none ought
to obey, or comply, in any thing against Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
since none against Conscience can be
Subject for Conscience-sake.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denyed, but that <hi>horrid Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Immoralities have been acted under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Conscience;</hi> though they can never be
justified upon the account of Conscience: and
where any plead Conscience against all sense of
duty, it is but just with God to leave them to
a reprobate state of mind: but some mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning,
or abusing Conscience, will never
justifie others dispising and deriding of it.</p>
               <p>Whether Dissenters endeavour after the best
Information they are able to attain unto, and
in other things do their duties, is no part of
this Query. But if they do not, they are too
blame, and will have the more to answer for
another day; and cannot with that satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
bear their present sufferings, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they might do. As for the grounds of their
Seperation, <hi>Whether sufficient to justifie it, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
them of Schism;</hi> will be more seasonably
argued, when this Answerer, or his Adherents,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40679:25"/>
shall tell us of such a Judge as in the Query is
inquired after, to determine who is in the right,
and who in the wrong; who keeps to, and
who swerves from the rule of the Gospel.</p>

an Ingenious and Pleasant person, who having

folly rather, to tell us, <hi>He hopes, now it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be no violation of the Law or light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to inflict punishments in matters of Religion:</hi>
when every Child that could but read <hi>English</hi>
would have told him; That not to inflict
punishments in matters of Religion, but to
Execute before Judgement, was the violation
of the Law and light of Nature mention'd in
the Querie: And though this might serve for
a sufficient Reply, to so pertinent and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
an Answer; yet least he should conceit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to have said something material, though
not to the present Question, we will examine
all he here says, as we have done his preceding
answers, though little or nothing to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
before him, as every intelligent and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Reader sees.</p>
               <p>None sure ever denyed judicious Heathens to
have been guilty of inflicting Coporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon Christians; yet did none of them
ever do it, before they judg'd Christianity it
self Criminal; and so did not Execute before
Judgement, though it were an erronious and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40679:26"/>
an unrighteous Judgement. And if, as he says,
<hi>it were heretofore the Devils policy to serve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of those who were most Eminent for intellectual
and moral accomplishments in persecuting Christs
Disciples, to beget in undiscerning minds the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prejudice against them;</hi> he seems now to have
lost much of his ancient subtilty, rarely imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that base work, but the most vicious and
flagitious livers.</p>
               <p>It will, I doubt not, puzzle this Answerer
to prove what he affirms, <hi>viz. That they who
are serious and reserv'd, and stictest in their lives
and Conversations, are the greatest opposers of Gods
Truths, and the Churches Peace;</hi> the contrary
being evident, and the very assertion, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of it self.</p>
               <p>Liberty of Conscience, and the Magistates
Power in Religion, have of late, indeed been
the Subject of many mens thoughts and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.
But none, sure, do affirm that the
Magistrate is not to use all due and proper
means to bring men to the knowledge of God,
and of the service he requries of them: But
that secular force is a means conducive thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
many, indeed, do deny: the liberty of
Conscience therefore pleaded for, by those who
are concern'd for the Honour of Religion, and
Power of Godliness; is not, as he says, <hi>That
men may serve, or not serve God, at their pleasure,</hi>
But that all men may be allowed the liberty of
serving God, as by the rule of his word, they
judge he would be served, while under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
thereof, they become not guilty of any
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40679:27"/>
ral evil or impiety: And that none be forc'd
to conform to such ways and modes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as they judge sinful, or may not be fully
perswaded of the lawfulness of; since what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is not of Faith, is Sin. But as the best
of things, are not exempt from the worst of
abuses, so 'tis not impossible, but as some plead
for Liberty of Conscience, that they may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unto God an acceptable service; others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
may plead for liberty also, to be excused,
the preformance of those duties God requires
of them: To distinguish therefore between
these, ought to be the Magistrates great care
and concern. But for this Answerer to say, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause'
its the Magistrates duty to let men alone in the
duty they ow to God their Creator and Redeemer,
(i.e.</hi> in the preformance of those religious duties
God requires of them, and none can deny to
be truly such;) therefore <hi>God may be either serv'd
or Blasphem'd, own'd or disown'd, by them;</hi> is
such a conclusion, as none I think but himself,
would have made: for no sober man, sure, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
doubted it the Magistrates duty to see, as
much as in him lyes, that God be own'd, and
duly serv'd, by all under him: and all moral
evils and impieties, restrain'd and punisht. Nor
can any <hi>pretence of Conscience excuse,</hi> much less
<hi>justifie,</hi> as he says, <hi>Blasphemy;</hi> or exempt any
guilty thereof, or of the like moral evils, from
the Magistrates revenging Power, which were,
indeed, for him to bear the Sword in vain.</p>
               <p>And now our Answerer, <hi>craves his Reader</hi>'s
<hi>patience, by speaking,</hi> as he says, <hi>something largely
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40679:27"/>
to this Query;</hi> when he should have crav'd his
pardon rather for mistaking the Question, and
entertaining him with so impertinent and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
a Combate with his own shadow: But
so bewitching is the pleasure of Conquest, that
sensible of his advantage on his man of Straw,
he never thinks he has sufficiently beaten him.
To begin therefore, <hi>He craves leave to tell the
Gentleman,</hi> the Clergyman is none of the wisest,
to think that <hi>Doomsday's Judgement is the
Judgement here spoken of.</hi> But to do him right
on all occasions, he is very much in the right,
in saying, <hi>'Tis no anticipation of Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at Doomsday, to inflict Corporal or pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Penalties upon those that offend against the
known and plain rules of duty in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and therefore he need not have askt to have
it shown, why it should be so, more in Religion,
then in civil concerns. A Magistrate,</hi> saith he,
<hi>for pronouncing a Sentence of Condemnation upon a
Felon or a Murtherer, may be said to Execute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Judgement, as well as a Justice of Peace for
granting a Warrant to leavy 12d. upon an</hi> Atheist
<hi>or</hi> Papist, <hi>for not repairing upon the Lords day
to his Parish Church: And why then will this
Gentleman</hi> (this ignorant Gentleman) <hi>say, that
the Execution of such a mild, or perhaps a severer
Law, is a violation of the very Law and light
of Nature?</hi> It is indeed a Question fit to be askt,
and had been a folly never to have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
had he said any such thing. But with
this learned and judicious Answerers good
leave, the Gentleman will take leave to say,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40679:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That should a Magistrate pronounce Sentence
of Condemnation, and Execute a Felon, or a
Murtherer, before he were Convict and Judg'd
a Felon, or a Murtherer; it would be such a
violation of the Law and light of Nature, as
no sober or Judicious Heathen was ever yet guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of. The like may be said of levying <hi>12d.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any for not coming to Church, before he
be Convict of not coming, and his not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Judg'd a Crime.</p>
               <p>That all Nations, whether Jewish, Heathen or
Christian, have <hi>as he says,</hi> assum'd to themselves
the power of protecting the Honour of those Dieties
they have made the object of their worship, and
punisht those offenders that have either neglected
their duty, or affronted the Majesty of those Gods
which they have pretended to serve; <hi>is so evident
and notorious, and agreeable to the Law and
light of Nature, that 'tis time lost to prove it;
our Answerer therefore, might have spar'd his
pains in this particular, and not have given
himself the trouble of proving, what none sure
ever deny'd or doubted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he tells us of <hi>Grotius his</hi> observation out
of <hi>Sneca,</hi> viz. <hi>That those who violate Religion,
have various kinds of punishments inflicted on
them, but there is no Nation but inflicts some.</hi>
No certainly, it being so far from a violation
of the Law and light of Nature, that nothing
is more consonant thereunto. And who, I
pray, are greater violators of Religion, then
they who subvert, or alter its Divine or Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Institutions? When <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40679:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he observes, <hi>Instituted a</hi> Pontifex Maximus, <hi>or
Chief Priest, and committed to him all the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
writings and mysteries, gave him order with
what Sacrifices, and upon what days, and in
what places the Rites of Religion were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwed;</hi>
had it not been a violation of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to have us'd other Sacrifices, upon other
days, in other places, and with other Rites then
he appointed? <hi>And if among Heathens, as he far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
observes, both publick and private Mysteries
were all determined by the Chief Priest, that it
might be known where the Common People might
repair to worship their Gods, lest there should be
any disorder or confusion in Religion, either by
neglecting the sacred Rites of their Country, or
introducing any that were Foreign and Strange:</hi>
Shall not we allow the Lord Jesus our High
Priest to determine the sacred mysteries of his
Religion, with all Rites and Ceremonies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that under pretence of Order and Decency,
there may not be introduced, that disorder and
confusion in the Christian Religion, we see at
this day, through the neglect of those sacred
Rites of his Institution, and the introducing
such as are Forraign and strange into his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
Let not, therefore, those that abhor I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,
commit Sacrildge: And if <hi>Heathen Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
as he observes, <hi>were so careful, that none
but the Roman Dieties might be worship'd; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd
that after no other manner but that of their own
Institution;</hi> How much more careful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
ought Christians to be, that none but the
Almighty, the Holy one of <hi>Israel</hi> be worship'd,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40679:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that after no other manner, then that of
his own Institution and appointment.</p>
               <p>And since, as this Answerer observes, <hi>That
wise people were so jealous and careful, least any
Innovation should be made in their Religion; and
least its Vniformity and Integrity should be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Customs and mixtures of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;</hi>
How much more ought Christs Disciples
to be jealous and careful that no innoventions be
made, or humane Inventions added to Christs
Institutions, either as to matter, or to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
(beyond the orderly observance of such
circumstances as necessarily attend such Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
as Christ himself hath Instituted) least
the uniformity and integrity of his worship,
should be dissolv'd by the Customs and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of other Countries; in the establishing
of different ways and modes of worship, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the variety of mens Inventions and
Fancies. And since, not only <hi>Grotius</hi> from St.

in their Arms, because they had a hearty

tell us,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>That Godliness hath the promise of
this life, as well as of that which is to come;</hi> surely
it can be against no rule or form of Justice, or
Prudence, nor any violation of the Law or
light of Nature; for Christian Princes to be as
zealous for a true Religion, as the Heathens
were for a false one. But, as the wise man
says, <hi>He that Answereth a matter before he hear it;</hi>
so he that Answereth a Question before he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands

               </p>
               <p>Nor is there ought in the Instances before
mentioned, That needs any such constructions
or evasions as this Answerer speaks of to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
them to the liberty in Religion pleaded for:
For who did ever deny unto Magistrates Power
<hi>to command, and require their People to serve God,</hi>
as God hath exprest and declar'd he will be
serv'd? or to remove such outward appearances
and Monuments of worship, as are evidently
and apparently false and Idolatrous? which in
both instances, was but the Case of the before-mentioned
Kings of <hi>Judah:</hi> But that which is
excepted against, Is the prohibiting any to
worship God, in such a way as none can say to
be against the mind and will of God, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
unto him: or the compelling any to
worship God in such a way, as they Judge sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
or are not satisfied in the lawfulness of.
And though the State of Religion under the
Gospel, be far differing from what it was under
the Law; yet, surely, <hi>Princes are not,</hi> as he
says, <hi>in a worse condition by the coming of Christ,
then they were in the Jewish Commonwealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
where they had no power to command ought
in Religion, but what God willed or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and so they may do still, by all the ways
and means appointed by God, and useful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>But what is it this Answerer hath found in
the 49 chap of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> to prove the Magistrates
Coercive Power in Religion? Gods affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40679:31"/>
answer to his peoples complaint, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
never to forget them, will not do it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his promise of <hi>delivering them from their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
and adding to their numbers:</hi> nor yet,
<hi>that Kings should be nursing Fathers, and Queens
nursing Mothers to his Church;</hi> For Nurses do
not use to force and coerce their Children; but
nourish and cherish them. But this place does
indeed imply or promise, that there should be
Soveraign Princes, who should nourish and
cherish the People of God; and take care that
no hurt or violence be offer'd unto them, or to
his Church; which is as much as the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor
will bear, since true Religion cannot be
forc't, or upheld, by Secular power: 'Tis An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianism
that is so supported and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,<note place="margin">Rev. 17. 12. 13.</note>
by those <hi>who give their power and strength
unto the Beast:</hi> And they carry the Metaphor
too farr, who would have Princes, like Nurses
to feed their Children; Christ having appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
other Overseers of his flock for that works;
whom the Magistrate ought indeed to protect
and defend, in the performance thereof; but
not to dictate, nor prescribe to them therein.</p>
               <p>There may not be wanting expositors, who
as he says, <hi>may conceive this Prophesie to have
been fulfilled, when Emperours and Kings became
Christians, and enacted Laws to secure the Faith
of Christ from all Enemies, &amp;c.</hi> though they
have no great Reason for it; it being but too
well known, that Christian Religion hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
more then ever it gain'd by pretended
Christian Magistrates: For if <hi>Constantine</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40679:32"/>
the Truth; his Successor <hi>Constantius,</hi>
with divers others after him, persecuted it:
Yea, the generality of Christian Magistrates
for above a thousand years together, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigations
of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> were its great
opposers and oppressors: and though for several
years past, God hath blessed this Nation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
most of the Nations of the Earth, with
Kings and Queens, who have protected and
defended the Truths of the Gospel, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, from the Tyranny and opprssieon
of that great Enemy to both; yet in respect of
Christendom, there is little cause to say that
this Prophesie was fulfilled, when Kings and
Emperours became Christians.</p>
               <p>As there have been Laws enacted by Kings
and States in behalf of the Truth; so there
have been infinitely more enacted against it:
error too soon and generally prevailing over
the Christian world; which for a Protestant to
Question, were to deny his Faith. He cannot
be thought a Friend to Truth, who shall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
any means conducive unto its promotion;
But whoever shall consider, how few of the
Mighty and Noble of the Earth, to whom
wordly Power and Authority is committed,
are called unto the knowledge thereof; must
acknowledge likewise, that where one Law
bath been enacted in behalf of the Truth, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
have been enacted to its prejudice: It is
not therefore in opposition to Truth, but for
the Truths sake, that we plead for its standing
upon its own Bottom; and prevailing by its
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40679:32"/>
own strength and efficacy: For as the Truths
of the Gospel were at first planted, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
throughout the world, by the Ministry
of the Gospel, and influence of the Divine
Spirit, without the aid and assistance of the
secular Power; so by the same means and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
they are best secured and preserved: nor
is secular force and power a means by God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
or in its nature conducive to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of Truth, since 'tis conviction and
not force, must induce assent: And though
some Hereticks may have seem'd to retract
their opinions, upon the severity of penal Laws
against them; there is little reason to believe
that any of them thereby became real converts;
for, though force may make an Hypocrite, it
can never make a true Believer.</p>
               <p>If we believe not the Donatists and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants
so nearly related as this Answerer tells
us, having but his say so, without other proof;
and if we are not Convinc't, That <hi>Austins</hi> chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his mind, proves second thoughts to be
always best; it will not, we hope, be thought
any violation of the Law or light of Nature;
'tis not unknown how that Pious Father was
molested by that petulant Faction, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
therefore he should approve of what ever
delivered him from them. But would it not be
very pleasant for Magistrates to change their
Laws, as oft as Doctors change their minds;
and that every new opinion should be the
ground of a new Statute: And yet I fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of what this Learned and Pious Father

                  <hi>That Kings (as is commanded them from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)
serve God in that Office, when in their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
they Command what is good; and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
what is evil; and that not only in things
that belong unto humane Society, but also unto
Divine Religion:</hi> So they command but what is
known and allowed to be good, and in mens
power to do: and Prohibit no more then
what is by the light of Nature, or some posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Law of God, apparently evil; And if
<hi>there be more passages to the same purpose,</hi> as this
Answerer tells us, he may spare his pains in
transcribing them; for that they make as little
to his purpose, as against ours. And whereas
he tells us, <hi>The same Arguments the</hi> Socinians

The substance of which was, That no man was
to be compelled to the Faith; and that Religion
was not to be chosen, but out of freedom of will:</hi>
Let him prove the contrary, and I will own

many of the Ancients own and have proved the
Magistrates Coercive Power in the concerns of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
without giving us farther evidence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
since the Nature and being of Religion, is
inconsistent with compulsion: Though 'tis
not denied, but that the Magistrate may
require the performance of those Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
duties, which none can deny to be such;
which is as much as any of the good Kings of
<hi>Israel</hi> or <hi>Judah</hi> ever did; which none sure,
ever thought to be any violation of the Law or
light of Nature. Nor does the Statute <hi>Primo
Elizabethae,</hi> prove as he says, <hi>that our Ancestors
had other thoughts concerning this matter: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they levyed the penalty of 12d. upon such
persons as had no lawfull or reasonable excuse for
not coming to Church;</hi> since they who have not
that, and yet come not, may reasonably enough
be punisht. If Independants, who say a man
should not steal, do themselves steal, they are
the more inexcusable: But 'tis not impossible
but this Answerer may be mistaken in matter
of Fact: For, though he would have it thought,

                  <hi>the Quakers who were put to death in</hi> New-England,

disturbances they gave to the publick worship

till after other ways and means were used to
have reclaimed them, or prevented those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders;
they returning after Banishment upon

then but have promised to depart the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or to forbear disturbing the publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies

in the Printed Narrative of that matter: and
though it cannot be denyed, but some milder

they suffer'd not for Religion, but for disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>As for his conclusive citation out of <hi>Calvin.
That there are none plead against the Magistrates
Coercive Power and Sword of Justice, but those
who out of Consciousness of their own Heresies,
Schisms, and Misdeeds, are in danger and affraid
of suffering by it; and therefore would wrest the
Sword out of the Magistrates hand, that they might
persevere in their Heresies, Schisms, Blasphemies,

on no other account then the Interest of the

neither the Magistrate may incur the guilt of

in the place of the nocent, through that
darkness and ignorance, which is upon the
minds of the most of men, in the things of

mens Thoughts or Consciences; nor when wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the heart is manifested by external acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whether liable to the Magistrates Power and
Inspection; <hi>none, I think, ever questioning ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them. But whether men erring Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
ought Corporally to be punisht.</hi> Paul<hi>'s</hi>
reckoning Heresies among the works of the flesh;
and telling the <hi>Gorinthians</hi> they were Carnal,
from the Schisms and disorders that were amongst
them, does not prove it. <hi>But says this Answerer,</hi>
Certainly any sensual sin may be punisht by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Sword: <hi>What thinks he then of Hatred,
Wrath, Covetousness, Emulations, Envyings,
and the like; which are sensual Sins, or works
of the flesh, yet not therefore to be punisht by
the Civil Sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why are they as he tells us, <hi>Who gather
Churches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>more then Spiritually Erronious?</hi>
How comes that which was the great Errand
and Duty of the Apostles, and their immediate
Successors; now to become so great a Crime?
Is it that Men, or Children rather, are now
born Christians? or being born in a Christian
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40679:36"/>
Commonwealth (as it is usually, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
exprest) or in such, or such a Parish,
they do thereby become a Church of Christ?
No one, certainly, who understands what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Christian, or a Church of Christ is, can
think so. And wherein do they, as he says, <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise
Government, and Trample upon all Laws?</hi>
Did he not but now tell us, <hi>The Church was a
Society, and that there can be no Society without
Government;</hi> How then comes the gathering of
Churches to be a despising of Government, and
trampling upon all Laws? undoubtedly there is
a Law, and a Divine Law to, for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Churches, if the Gospel be the Law of
God; as I hope, neither this Answerer, nor
any who own themselves Christians, doubt it
to be.</p>
               <p>There is little reason, sure to say as he does,
<hi>The inticers to Idolatry, mention'd in</hi> Deutromo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<hi>might as well have pleaded, it was only an
error of their minds, as any of our Dissenting
Ministers;</hi> for that none, certainly, can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that it could be a sin of Ignorance in them,
to draw any from the true God, to worship I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols;
it being against the very light of Nature,
in that, as the Apostle tell us, <hi>That which may
be known of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>was manifest in them.</hi> It may
therefore, for any thing this Answerer hath
here said, <hi>Be both Incongruous and Heterogenial,
to punish Corporally, men erring Spiritually.</hi>

in Religion towards some, is,</hi> as he says,
<hi>Anti-Christian,</hi> and not towards other; the
difference not being evident, at least to all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities.</p>
               <p>We are not here enquiring after, what is so
much a violation of the Law of Nations, as
of the Law of Nature: and though our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer

dealings with the <hi>Indians;</hi> graciously acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<hi>that propriety is not forfeited by unbelief;</hi>
Yet but now speaking of Dissenters here, he
said,<note place="margin">Ans. to the 5th Q.</note> 
                  <hi>If they disapprove of the Decisions of their
Superiours, the world is wide enough, they may
leave the Government, and betake themselves to
the Communion of purer Churches;</hi> which is but
in other words to say, Be of the Religion of
your Country, or abanden your Properties,
with the Land of your Nativity. But should
providence permit the Establishment of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in this Nation he approves not of, (if
he be not resolv'd to approve of whatever shall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40679:37"/>
be the National Religion) would he not think
himself hardly dealt with, to be requir'd to
Conform, or to abandon his Native Country?
He may do well therefore, to meditate a little
on that no less Divine, then Moral precept;
<hi>Of doing to others, as he would they should do to
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cannon he mentions, is indeeed, very
pertinent to our purpose: So likewise is what
he Cites from <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Lactantius:</hi> But
then, without the least colour or shadow of
Reason; (and perhaps only because <hi>Grotius</hi>
says,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. C. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>It is not just or lawful to make War upon

only of <hi>Princes raising Wars, against Pagan Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

'tis very well and judiciously observ'd of him,
<hi>That these things nothing concern a Kingdom, in
which there is a visible and universal profession of

need of compelling or forcing any to profess,
what all already do profess. But yet, even in
such a Kingdom, <hi>Magistrates,</hi> he says, <hi>may use

of the Truth, Magistrates did not too

none sure will say, but that Magistrates may,

forcing men to moral actions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
duties: since in things moral, the action,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40679:38"/>
however circumstantiated, is in it self posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
good or evil: But in things of Divine
Institution, the manner only of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
makes the action good or evil; and
therefore it is said,<note place="margin">Isa. 66. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>He that Sacrificeth an Ox, is
as if he kild a Man; and he that killeth a Lamb
as if he cut off a Dogs neck;</hi> where the manner of
performing the Command, is not observ'd as
well as the matter. The like may be said of
all such Gospel Duties, the goodness whereof
depends wholly upon the Institution; and
therein the manner as well as the matter, must
be punctually observ'd; nay the manner of
performing these duties, determines the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them; for if they be performed in their
due manner, the action is good; if not, the
action it self is sinfull. This Answerer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
runs himself into this error, by not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
between things in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
good or evil, and those things whose
goodness depends wholly upon Institution;
and consequently on their due performance.
<hi>Authority,</hi> therefore, <hi>may oblige men to be Loyal
and Peaceable, Honest and Just,</hi> which are moral
vertues; and punish them, if they be <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
and Seditious, Injurious and Theives,</hi> which
are moral evils. Yet, cannot force any in the
sight of God to an acceptable performance of
the one, nor abstinence from the other; because
God accepts only of the Heart; or an hearty
obedience, which cannot be so forc't.</p>
               <p>It hath been already acknowledg'd, in the
case of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah, That
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40679:38"/>
Magistrates may command their People to serve
God, as God hath commanded; and they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't
and satisfied, he will be served;</hi> but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
since whatever, is not of Faith, is
sin; which the Magistrate may not compel to:
yet may he prohibit the doing of any thing,
which may either dishonour or destroy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every King is,</hi> as he says, <hi>both the Minister
of God, and the Ruler of his People;</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to the duties he mentions, as hath been
already acknowledg'd. Nor are as he says, <hi>our
Governours so much to consider our willingness to
serve God, as our benefit, and their duty:</hi> But
it is neither their duty to force any to worship
God, after any other way or manner, then they
are perswaded God will be worship't; or that
will be acceptable unto him; since, as hath been
said, what is not Faith, is sin, which the
Magistrate by forcing to, becomes guilty of.
Nor is it for their Peoples benefit to be forc't to
any thing in Religion, beyond their Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
all such performances being in themselves
sinfull. And for this Answerer to say, <hi>It will
perhaps, be found as great an Act of Justice and
Charity, to force some to go to Church, as 'tis to
force some Boys to go to School;</hi> speaks him very
unfit to be an Instructer and Teacher of others,
who is himself so unacquainted with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and essence of Religion.</p>
               <p>And whereas he says, <hi>The Magistrate will find
the benefit by exercising his Coercive Power,</hi> (in
matters of Religion, for 'tis of that alone we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40679:39"/>
are here speaking) <hi>in securing the honour of his
own Laws and Authority;</hi> the contrary is most
evident: for wherever his Authority inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
it self where the Authority of God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
concern'd, (as it is in all the Actions
and duties of Religion) and shall by Religious
and Pious Persons be Judg'd to interfer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with;
it will certainly be contemn'd and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed,
as were the Decrees of <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
and <hi>Darius,</hi> Recorded in the third and sixth
chapters of <hi>Daniel;</hi> and as was the Authority
of the Chief Priests and of the Rulers of the
<hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 4.</note> when they forbad <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John to
speak or teach in the name of Jesus.</hi> Nor is it
likely to be more beneficial to the persons on
whom such methods are used; for being no
means of Gods appointment unto any such
ends, as well as in its own nature thereunto
improper, his blessing cannot be expected to
go along with it. And to say, <hi>'Tis better for
men to come within the possibility of being perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to Religion, and reduced to sober apprehensions
of it; then to continue in their Schisms, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
neglect of all Piety;</hi> is very wide from
this Question, which neither countenances
Schism, nor discountenances Piety; but would
not that any should be forced to serve God, in
any other way or manner, then God will be
served, or they Judge acceptable unto him; nor
are all to be charged with Schism, and a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
neglect of Piety, who frequent not the
Publick worship wherever, they live: much less
to be out of a possibility of being perswaded to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40679:39"/>
Religion, and void of all sober apprehensions
of it: which yet compulsion is so far from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
or reducing any unto, that its efficacy
lyes the other way; it breeds rather an aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and abhorrency towards it, and towards
those that use it. But says our Answerer, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the worst, <hi>(viz.) That compelling men to
Church, do not produce any inward change in their
minds; yet certainly 'tis a means conducive to so
blessed an end:</hi> But who, I would know, tells
him so? 'Tis no means, I am sure, of Christs
appointment; nor did he himself ever use it;
salvation indeed, he offer'd, which who so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
at his Peril; those that had ears to hear,
let them hear, being the usual conclusion of his
Sermons: He sent likewise his Disciples to
Preach the Kingdom of God, but not to force
or compel any to hear them:<note place="margin">Deter. Q. Quest. 15.</note>

the Re-establishment of Popery in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether the compelling him to Church,
would be a means conducive to his Conversion;
if it will, can he doubt but they who would
esteem it a blessed work, should not be as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

Power wherewith Christ rules his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
under the Gospel: which this Answerer
seems altogether unacquainted with; having,
possibly, never felt the power and efficacy
thereof in his own Soul; and to talk to such
of a Spiritual Power, is like talking to blind
men of colours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Magistrate,</hi> says he, <hi>is Gods Minister,

as well as their worldly and outward Estates:</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:40679:42"/>
But how, or in what manner to the benefit and
welfare of their Souls, he is not at present
dispos'd to tell us; But would have us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<hi>the reason why Christ never made use of the
Civil Magistrates Power, to recommend, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude,</hi>
as he phrases it, <hi>his Doctrine on the world;
was because the secular Powers were in the days of
his flesh, in open Enmity and Hostility against him.</hi>
But does he think Christ could not as easily have
converted Magistrates, as others; had he so
pleased?<note place="margin">Matt. 28. 18.</note> or does he not know that <hi>To him was
given all Power both in Heaven and on Earth;</hi>
and that had he thought it necessary or expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for the Interest of Religion, he could as
well have commanded the Magistrates Power,
as any other? But he declin'd it, as we may
reasonably enough suppose, to manifest to the
world, that the Gospel, or true Religion, was
wholly founded upon Spiritual Power, was
compleat therein, and needed not the aid and
assistance of secular Force: But the Argument
against the Magistrates Power in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is not so much from Christs not using
it, as from the nature of Religion, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be so forc't, it being seated in those facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to which outward violence can have no

his Arm shortned? or that he now stands in

We argue not against the Churches making use

<hi>That our Blessed Saviour, in erecting his
Church, never intended to diminish the Power of
Magistracy;</hi> neither hath he, it being the same
now it ever was; Magistrates having the same
Power now that ordinarily they ever had: nor
is there any thing in Christian Religion, but
what is, not only consistent, but highly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious

who is it that would make the profession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

in the free exercise of all Religious duties;

But 'twere worth knowing from this
Learned and Judicious Answerer, how far any
are obliged <hi>to ad here to the Church in which they
were Baptized,</hi> that we may not have too hard
thoughts of our first Reformers, for forsaking
the Church, in which they partook of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>

                  <hi>It is,</hi> as he says, <hi>One thing to Convert Pagans
and Infidels to Christianity, and another thing to
keep them within the bounds of their duty, who
already profess it:</hi> and yet are both effected by
the same means; and the Magistrate can no
more compel unto the one, then to the other:
But when men give up their names to Christ,
'tis certainly as he says, <hi>the duty of Church-men,
to use all lawfull</hi> (and proper) <hi>means, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their Apostacy from him.</hi> But who are <hi>the

occasion doth this Query administer, <hi>To ask
why the Magistrate may not be requested to save a

be requested to punish sin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it being the great end for which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Power of the Sword to him; But
he can no more save a Soul from death, and
Rescue him out of the snare of the Devil; then
he can give grace or faith, which are the gifts
of God alone; yet this hinders not, but that
Magistrates and Ministers, ought to use all due
and lawful means, <hi>To reduce men to Christianity,
and prevent their Apostacy from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no more need now, then in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Ages of the Church, that <hi>its Acts and
Censures, should be seconded by the Sword of the
Secular Power:</hi> our Blessed Saviour who is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

                  <hi>to the worlds
end.</hi> And that there is so little of Power and
efficacy in in the Acts and Censures of some who
would be accounted his Disciples; is not that
Christ hath withdrawn any of that ordinary
Power he gave unto his Ministers, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of the Saints, and the edifying of his
body; but their failure in the condition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to his promise in not teaching what he
commanded; but setting up their own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and devices, in the place of his Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
were the Censures of the Church as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
and regularly pronounc't now as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
they would have the same effects now as
then, upon the Souls and Consciences of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40679:45"/>
what effect they had upon their Bodies,
we are rather told, then Convinc't of; for <hi>the

               <p>THis Answerer might with as good reason
have said, There is no more Spirituality
in the Ordinances of the Gospel, then there
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40679:46"/>
was in the Ordinances under the Law; <hi>As that
there is no more Carnality in the present Vnion of
the civil Power with the Ecclesiasticall; then there
was in the Jewish Church or Commonwealth:</hi> For
who, besides himself, is ignorant how God
himself United those, making that Church and
State but one Commonwealth, over which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
presided; whereby they became rather a
Spiritual, then a Civil Society; a Theocracy,
or a People whom God Govern'd by Princes
and Rulers extraordinarily assisted and inspired
by him; or guided and directed by Prophets
occasionally sent to declare his mind and will
unto them. So that it was God himself that
made that Church and State one; He that was
a Member of the State, thereby becoming a
Member of the Church likewise. But it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
under the Gospel, the Church and
State being now distinct Societies; and a man
may be a Member of the one, without being so
of the other: Nor are their concerns otherwise
intermixt, then in the Churches enjoying Peace

Government of the State; and the State pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
from the Prayers and Blessings of the

But says this Ingenious and candid Answerer,
<hi>The main Argument with which the Libertines of
all Ages have shelter'd themselves against the reach
of wholsome and good Laws, has been Conscience,
and the Internal Liberty of that faculty; which
say they, is only and immediatly Subject unto God:</hi>
It is so; and yet it neither doth, nor ought to,
shelter any guilty of sin and wickedness <hi>against
the reach</hi> as he pretends <hi>of wholsom and good Laws;</hi>
for he who sins, ought to suffer for it, whether
it be with, or against his Conscience. But says
he, <hi>A Spirit may be as soon pierced with a Sword,
as violence offer'd to the Conscience; or the mind
constrain'd to understand, to Fear, Love, Hate,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>which are Elicite Acts of the soul, and cannot
be forc't or violated, by all the compulsive Powers
in the world.</hi> Does he then conceive Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to be concern'd only in thinking? Or in
the Acts of the mind? Conscience, certainly,
is concern'd in all a mans actions; which none
sure who knows what Conscience is, ever yet
doubted: He has therefore cause to say, as he
doth, <hi>All this signifies very little in the present
debate;</hi> not because as he says,, <hi>no Authority
ever offer'd violence to the Internal Acts of mens
minds;</hi> but for that Conscience is concern'd in
the External actions of a mans life. Conscience is
concern'd in the performance, or non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of every duty God commands; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is violated, when any through dread and
fear, are awed or deterr'd from the performance
of those duties they judge God requires of
them; or provok't or urg'd to do, what they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40679:49"/>
are no less perswaded he dislikes, or prohibits
them. But how impertinently are we here
told, <hi>When mens opinions are recluded and lock't
within their own Breasts, the Magistrate never
concerns himself about them;</hi> for how should the
Magistrate concern himself about that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knows, nor can have any cognizance of?
And how ignorantly, if not deceitfully, does he
here urge that saying of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Hast thou
Faith, have it to thy self;</hi> as if the Apostle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
intended that men should keep their Faith
and Opinions to themselves; when he spoke to
quite another purpose: For, speaking of meates
which some forbore as judging them unlawfull;
he advises those who were otherwise perswaded,
to forbear their Christian Liberty, when it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
those were not yet convinc'd of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of eating thereof: that is, having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a sure knowledge of the lawfulness of
those things, whereof others doubted, they
might use their liberty therein, when it gave
no offence to their Brethren; so keeping their
Faith to themselves, and not using it to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
or scandal of others, as is evident to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
reads and considers the context. But none
sure, ever affirm'd, the Magistrate was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
mens private Consciences, and not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, the safety of his own person and
Government, and his peoples benefit and good.
<hi>That it may be a greater sin for a man to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Dictates of his Conscience, then to
act against them,</hi> as he says, is an assertion I have
not before met with: For whatever sin a man
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40679:49"/>
commits acting according, to the Dictates of
his Conscience, is at most but a sin of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
which excuses <hi>à tanto,</hi> though not <hi>à toto,</hi>
whereas he that acts against the Dictates of his
Conscience, is guilty of willful and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sinning, which admits of no excuse; yea, is
the highest aggravation of sin that can be, and
yet has he the confidence to say, This so notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
false assertion, <hi>is evident, not only from the
experience of all Ages; but from the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi>
which says he, <hi>speak of a seared Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
of men whose Consciences are defiled, of a
Reprobate mind, &amp;c.</hi> But there being men of
Reprobate minds, and of seared and defiled
Consciences; does not prove, that it may be a
greater sin for a man to act according to the
Dictates of Conscience, then to act against
them. Men of seared Consciences, may be said
rather to make no Conscience of what they
do; then to act either with, or against their
Consciences: For a seared Conscience, is a
dead or stupid Conscience; a Conscience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sense or feeling: the like may be said of such
as are of a Reprobate mind; and whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
are defiled; nor can there be any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
defilement of Conscience then to act against
it.</p>
               <p>But what is our Blessed Saviours Prediction
<hi>of the times comming, wherein some should think
they did God service in killing Christians.</hi> To this
Query: Is it that men of such preverted appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
were to be compelled to worship
God otherwise then they are perswaded God
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40679:50"/>
will be worshipped, or how does he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it?</p>
               <p>There are none sure who doubt, but that
<hi>the Jewish Sanhedrim would gladly have slain</hi>
Peter <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>for Preaching Christ;</hi> as, no
doubt, would others, who at this day are no
less grieved at the Preaching of the Gospel, slay
their Successors in the Ministry of the word,
did not the good hand and providence of God
restrain them, But what is all this to the present
Question. <hi>Or what is</hi> Paul's <hi>pleading Conscience
for persecuting Christs Disciples, and making ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
of the Church?</hi> These, indeed, prove that
there have been, and will be, men of Erronious
Consciences: and none sure, ever doubted or
questioned, but that the Magistrate may punish
men acting according to their Consciences, if
what they so do be evil; pretence of Conscience
no ways justifying an evil action before men,
how far soever an Erronious Conscience may
excuse it before God. But what is all this to
forcing any to act against their Consciences?
And how impertinently is it here askt, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it had been to commit a Rape upon St.</hi> Paul'<hi>s
Conscience to have punisht him for persecuting
Christs Disciples?</hi> As if to punish an evil
action voluntarily committed; and to force
and compel any to what is evil, were the same
thing. Yet, he says, <hi>He knows very well, that
it will be here said,</hi> (though he knows not well
what himself says) <hi>That a Magistrate may punish
for Murther and violating the Laws of the second
Table: but the answer to this,</hi> he says, <hi>is easie;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40679:50"/>
if he should say, that just so our Magistrates do
when they Execute any of the penal Laws Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
upon Dissenters:</hi> this, indeed; is easier
said, then understood; for what means he by
his, just so? What Laws of the <hi>2d.</hi> Table are
Dissenters, as such guilty of the violation off?
or what Law of God, or Nature, do they
therein transgress? I will not say, I know it will
be here said, but suppose it may be said, they
disobey the commands of lawfull Authority,
and therefore ought to be punisht: ought then
all commands of lawfull Authority to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
obeyed? I know not what this Answerer
may say; but am very confident none who
understand themselves will say so: But they
may perhaps say, All the lawfull commands of
lawfull Authority, ought to be obeyed: They
ought so, yet this exception lies against the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rule, That if the person whose obedience
is required, judgeth them unlawfull, though in
themselves they may be lawfull, he may not
actively obey them. But he proceeds, and
tells us, <hi>It is a very strange thing for any to believe,
that the Magistrate is invested with a Power to
punish men for words and actions tending to the
damage of private persons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But let them speak
never so many lyes in the name of God; and
Preach and Teach them in Hypocrasie; let them
blaspheme God, and Christ, and Religion; then
Authority has its hands tyed up; no Coercive
Power must be used against any such Criminals; for
all those Acts flow from Conscience:</hi> It were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
a very strange thing if it should be so:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40679:51"/>
But who tells him that no Coercieve Power
must be used against those Criminals whose acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
flow from Conscience? or who Questions
the Magistrates Authority to punish such as
blaspheme God, or Christ, or Religion; or that
they who speak lyes in the name of God; and
Preach and Teach them in Hypocrasie, may
not be punisht for it; when prov'd against them?
But we still say, That to Execute before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
and Judgement, is against all Rules and
Forms of Justice, both Divine and Humane;
and such a violation of the Law and light of
Nature, as no Sober or Judicious Heathen was
ever yet guilty off. But the whole of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is grounded on this absurdity, which
the Query gives not the least countenance unto;
<hi>(viz.)</hi> That none ought to be punisht for what
they do according to their Consciences; which
no man, sure, in his senses ever affirm'd; every
man being to be proceeded against by the Civil
Magistrate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, according to the Nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his offence; be it never so much accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Conscience, if it be that which ought
not to be. But he tells us, <hi>every Christian is
to act out of a Principle of Conscience in the duties
of the second Table, as well as in those of the first;
which no man sure, ever doubted off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor did any rational man, ever say, <hi>That
Conscience was a sufficient plea against the Coercive
Power of Kings.</hi> The Magistrate may certainly,
Enact Penal Laws against Murther, Felony,
and the like moral evils; whatever he may do
against Infidelity, Schism, Heresie, or errors
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40679:51"/>
in Religion; and yet may not force or compel
any in the Worship and Service of God to act
against their Light and Consciences. The
Question here is not, whether the Magistrate
may use his Coercive Power to punish for sin;
but whether he may compel men to sin; as most
certainly they do, who compel them to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God in any other way or manner, then
they are perswaded God will be worship't, and
requires of them.</p>

a man to act against light and Conscience,

               <head>Reply to the Answer to this Query.</head>
               <p>TO the Question he proposes, I answer;
The Superiour not only may, but ought
to take care to act according to the Dictates of
his Conscience, as well as the Inferiour to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
according to his: which is yet no answer
to this Query; For as it is the Magistrates du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to cause, as much as in him lyes, those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his charge to serve God acceptably; so it is
not his duty to command them to serve God in
such a way or manner as they judge sinfull, or
not according to Gods Institution and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.
He ought, indeed, to endeavour
their Conviction, by all due and just means,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40679:52"/>
whom he Judgeth in any kind to err; but not
to force them to any thing, in the Worship and
Service of God, against their Judgements;
since, as hath been often inculcated, whatever
is not of faith, is sin. But if there be any, who,
as he says, <hi>conceive it their duty to serve God in
such ways and methods, as are Diametrically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Gods will; and subversive to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
Government;</hi> let them be Impleaded, and
punisht, after due Conviction and Judgement,
but not before.</p>
               <p>'Tis not impossible but a Governour may
think himself bound in Conscience to command,
what an Inferiour may be perswaded he ought
not to obey. <hi>The Superiours Conscience being
as certain a Rule in commanding, as the Inferiours
can be to him in disobeying;</hi> but, with our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerers
good leave, this is not, as he says, <hi>the
case between the King of</hi> England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Dissenters from the Church:</hi> His Majesty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sufficiently declared in his late gracious
Declaration of Indulgence, that it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Conscience to give liberty to Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
But how flily would he insinuate here,
<hi>That it is against his Coronation Oath so to do; in
that,</hi> he says, <hi>His Majesty swears, That he will
defend and preserve to the Clergy, all Canonicall
Priviledges, &amp;c.</hi> And how this Oath can be
performed unless the Clergy have now, the like
Priviledge as heretofore, to Burn, Masacre,
and Destroy, the faithfull Servants and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Jesus Christ, and true worshippers of
God, under pretence of their being Hereticks
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40679:52"/>
and Schismaticks, may possibly, as he says, <hi>be
past his Power to conceive and determine.</hi> For
nothing less, it seems, will satisfie him, <hi>Then all
the Canonicall Priviledges and Free-Franchises
granted to the Clergy, by the glorious St.</hi> Edward,
<hi>and other Kings:</hi> and what they were, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
consideration. But, as he very well says,
<hi>every Prince owes a strict account to God of his
Crown and Government; and the Dignity of his
place obliges him to promote the happiness of his
people;</hi> which, certainly, he does not, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
a Generation of men under the pretext
of the Power of the Gospel, to trample by the
Power of the world, mankind under their feet;
even Princes themselves, where they are able;
which if seemly in their eyes, is not so, I hope,
in others.</p>

                  <hi>Whether differnce in Judgement, will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
any man from Inconformity in Practice?</hi> He
advises his Reader to consider the strict account
Christ called the Angel of the Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi>
to,<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 20.</note> for suffering that woman <hi>Jezabel,</hi> to teach and
seduce his Servants; <hi>and would be resolved,</hi>
whether the Bishop or Angel might not have excused
his own neglects, by pleading for <hi>Jezabel;</hi> That
her Judgement differ'd from his; and to make her
practice things quite contrary to her Judgement;
was that Christ never did in the days of his flesh:
It was an Invasion of the freedom of mens wills,
and the Liberty of their Consciences; It was a
constraining of them to act against their own Light,
and consequently to sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:40679:53"/>
                  <hi>Risum tenaatis Amici?</hi> can any forbear
laughter at such ridiculous reasonings? is not
this Answerer able to distinguish, between com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
to sin; and restraining from sin? Had
the Angel of the Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> been call'd
to an account for <hi>Jezabels</hi> non-conformity,
such a Plea might have been pertinent; but his
Crime was not the making her practice things
contrary to her Judgement; which yet to have
done might have been a Crime; but the suffering
her to Teach and Seduce without controle;
without contending for the Truth, and opposing
it to her Errors; which would not have been a
constraining her to act against her light, but the
enlighting her; sound Doctrine diligently and
duly taught, being sufficient against Seducers.
We had not else heard of many Truths of the
Gospel at this day; there being neither in the
days of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> nor long after, any Christian
Magistrate in the World, to protect or defend
them.</p>
               <p>What the Reverend Mr. <hi>Perkings</hi> says of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
error, is nothing to this Query, which
opposes only the compelling to sin; yet we
would, as much as any that error were restrain'd
by such ways and means as Truth might not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in the stead of it. And if this Reverend
Person judg'd the Commonwealth in his days,
did well in making Laws to restrain those who
depart from our Church; he did not, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
think it did so some years before, when it
made Laws to restrain those who departed from
the then Church; so preferring the Relation
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40679:53"/>
before the Rule; making the right and Equity
of the Law, to depend on his Judgement or
Opinion of Truth and Error in Religion. And
if it were his Judgement, as we are told, <hi>That
People ought to be compell'd to the Publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi>
(though unsatisfied of the lawfulness of
the Service there used) it was an Erronious
Judgement, and of very evil consequence; for
by the same Rule ought all to be so compelled by
those who have Power on their side, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they have Truth also: and what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
(not to speak of the unreasonableness and
unjustifiablenes of the thing it self) can any
Protestant think Truth and true Religion will
get thereby? It were therefore rather to be
wished, that all men would observe that no less
Divine then Moral precept; <hi>Of doing unto others,
as they would be done unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Query here is not concerning Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
requiring conformity to those things,
which the Judgements of Inferiours <hi>dislike or
disapprove of, as unmeet or inconvenient;</hi> but to
those things (and in the worship of God only)
as Inferiours Judge sinfull. The constraining
therefore any against their <hi>Wills and Interests,
to do what they deny not to be honest and just,</hi>
reacheth not the present Question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though nothing can,</hi> as he says, <hi>excuse Subjects
from yielding obedience to lawful Authority; but
the unlawfulness of what that Authority doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn;</hi>
yet when any one is perswaded the thing
commanded is unlawful, though in it self lawful,
He may not yield obedience to it; <hi>An innocent
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40679:54"/>
or invincibly erring Conscience,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dullor. Dubit. l. 1. cap. 3. rule 6.</note> as the Reverend
and Learned Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> truly tells us, <hi>being
to be obeyed against the known commandment of
our Superiours.</hi> But a man may lawfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
upon that action, which he Judges to be
unmeet and inconvenient only, not unlawful;
though he have some inward averseness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy
in his mind against it, and wishes
that no such obligation were laid on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But our Answerer does very seasonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
himself, in telling us, it will be here
said,</hi> That the resolution of this case, does not
come home to our present Dissenters; for that they
Judge, the commands of Authority about those
things which we call indifferent, to be not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient,
but sinfull; and for that reason
they deny Conformity in practice. But where this
hath been in part answered, <hi>as he says, we have
not yet observ'd: and wish it may be, (as

            <p>Whether to punish any for not conforming to

               <head>Reply to the Answer to this Query.</head>
               <p>THat <hi>'tis all mens duty,</hi> as he says, <hi>to Obey
lawfull Authority, either actively or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,</hi>
none sure doubts; but what is that to
this Query? To say that <hi>active obedience is not
required</hi> by Authority to all its commands, is to
say Authority commands things to be done,
which it self judges sinfull and unlawfull,
which ought not to be supposed: So that active
obedience is by Authority requir'd to all its
commands, and nothing can excuse any from
such obedience; but the unlawfulness, or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unlawfulness, of what is so commanded.
But it is neither the duty of a <hi>Loyal Subject, nor
humble Christian,</hi> as he would have it, <hi>so to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
his own Judgement,</hi> as to neglect the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
thereof, in a due Examination of the
lawfullness, or unlawfullness of whatever is
commanded him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> says this Answerer, <hi>To make some nearer
approaches to the Query</hi> (which is but need) <hi>'tis
not Conscience (if that thing be condemned as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
which is not some way or other forbid by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40679:55"/>
God in the Sacred Scriptures:</hi> 'Tis not indeed
a right Conscience; but where a man is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that any thing is forbid by God in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures, though it may not be so, 'tis
Conscience in him not to do it, though it be
an Erronious Conscience; yet such an one, as
till Convinc'd of its. Error, he ought not to
go against. And his saying, <hi>It may be Humour,
or Fancy, or Passion, or Diabolical suggestions, or
Forestalements and prejudices imbibed by ill edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and instruction, &amp;c.</hi> will never prevail
with Prudent and Pious men, to abandon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or in ought to act against it: nor yet
to renounce the exercise of their Judgements in
yielding blind Obedience unto any; which
were, indeed, not to chuse their Religion, or
Act as men; but like Bruits rather, bear what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall be imposed on them: So changing
their Religion, as oft as chance or providence,
shall change their Masters; which, indeed, is very
far from a Rational or manly choice.</p>
               <p>Whether any can plead Conscience for not
conforming to the Establisht worship of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> is no part of this Query;
which meddles not with particulars: And yet
<hi>if no more,</hi> as he says, <hi>can be said in the case,
Then that he doubts whether he ought to worship
God after such a manner, or no;</hi> it may be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to hinder his Comformity, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we are told, <hi>It ought not to be of that weight,
as to keep him from his lawfull Superiours lawfull
command.</hi> For he who doubts of the lawfulness
of the worship, may doubt likewise, whether
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40679:55"/>
his Superiours commanding him so to worship,
be a lawfull command; or whether his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
have Authority to command him so to
worship; for where Superiours have no right
to command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there lyes no obligation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
on Inferiours to obey; and then such a
command can be no sufficient ground to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sede
his doubting; especially when he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
he hath a plain Prohibition of Scripture
against what he is commanded. Neither, as
is said, <hi>is it duty, or any part of Christian meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
where the doubt is concerning the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
Authority, <hi>for any therein to take his
resolution, from those claiming that Authority.</hi> And
though it be the sin of Dogmatizing, to affirm
any thing unlawfull for any to do, which some
Law of God, still in force, doth not Prohibit;
yet while the Question is, whether there be not
a Law of God, now in force, prohibiting the
matters in doubt, and which is that which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
the doubt? it can be no such sin: So that
'tis not impossible, but both that and the diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
here talkt of, may still <hi>commence Vertue,</hi>
notwithstanding all that hath been here said to
the contrary. And yet we deny it not to be
every mans duty, in doubtfull matters, to seek
satisfaction from those whom God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to instruct and teach them; but not to
yield blind obedience unto any; or obey them
against the Dictates of their Consciences. And

               <p>What this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Answerer finds in this Query in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
a necessity of Infallibility in all Guides
and Governours, whether Sacred or Civil, we
are yet to seek; there being, as we conceive,
some difference between being guided in duties
of Religion, by those that are fallible, which
we never thought unreasonable; and being
forced to follow them therein, against a mans
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40679:59"/>
own light and knowledge, which is the thing
here question'd. It being an implicit Faith and
blind obedience only, (and even the worst of
these, a mans acting against his own light and
Conscience) and only in the concerns of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that this Query opposeth. And where hath
this been, as he tells us, <hi>before answer'd?</hi> Or
to what purpose doth he here tell us, <hi>It is no
higher absurdity in these days of the Gospel, for
men (in matters of Religion) to be guided by a
Learned and Pious Minister; and much more by
all the Governours of a National Church; then it
was under the Mosaick Oeconomy, to seek the Law
at the Priests mouth, who was the Messenger of the
Lord of Hosts;</hi> since we never denyed either:
but say, that blind obedience was never to be
yielded unto any; much less that any ought to
be forc't in any Religious duties, against their
own light. The Priests lips, indeed, should
keep knowledge; and they should seek the Law
at his mouth; but, as hath been before said,
<hi>they departed out of the way; they caused many
to stumble at the Law, and corrupted the Covenant
of</hi> Levi: So that a Judgement of discretion was
then, as well as now, to be exercised by the
people, <hi>and they were not always to hearken unto
the words of the Prophets that Prophesied unto
them;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 16.</note> their directions and instructions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
with this Answerers good leave, might
sometimes be rejected. And since our Blessed
Saviour hath himself commanded us to <hi>Beware
of false Prophets;</hi> and the Apostle, <hi>not to believe
every Spirit, but to try the Spirits whether they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40679:60"/>
are of God,</hi> it is undoubtedly the duty of all
Christians to examine the Authority and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their Teachers; and to Query who are
the true, and who the false; who the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
of Christ, who of Antichrist; that so
they may receive the one, and reject the other,
with all their Doctrines and Instructions; if,
upon trial, they square not with the Rule by
which they are commanded to prove them. Yet
does not this render, as he says, <hi>the Ministry of
the Christian Church, (much less all Offices and
Dignities of the Commonwealth) void and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less:</hi>
It only cautions Christians not to esteem
of them above what is meet; in yielding that
blind obedience the Gospel Prohibits, and which
is unbecoming the nature and being of a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Creature to give: when therefore God
commands the people to <hi>obey those that have the
Rule over them;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17</note> and to <hi>submit to them; as they
that watch for their Souls;</hi> It is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
so far forth only, as they Teach according
to the Rule of his word; their Authority, as
we have before told you, from the Reverend
Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet, Being only directive and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
and in matters of duty can bind no farther
then Reason and Evidence brought from Scripture
by them doth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he goes on with his Infallibility, and
says, <hi>the Argument holds as much against any
Judge or Magistrate in the civil concerns of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
life, as against the Ministry of the Church:</hi>
But he may be therein mistaken; for 'tis all
mens Interest to acquiesce in the Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40679:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of civil Judicatories, in the concerns of
Humane life, how Erronious or unjust soever
they may apprehend them to be, for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of a greater good; publick peace and
quiet: but that will never make it reasonable,
in the concerns of Eternity, which admit of no
compensation, for a man to put out his own
eyes, to be guided by others; who perhaps, see
no better, it may be not so well as himself. For
we do not say, it is absurd for a man to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by such as are fallible; but to be guided by
such <hi>against their own Light and Reason:</hi> As for
a man to follow one who tells him, He will
guide him the next way from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>London;</hi>
though he leads him still Northward, when he
knows the way thither to lye Southward: But
could I believe my guide Infallible, I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
my own Reason, and disbelieve my very
senses, to follow him which way soever he lead
me; but till then shall think it absurd in any
to force me so to do; which is but the genuine
import of this Query.</p>
               <p>But our Answerer tells us, <hi>A man may act
infallibly in his station, though he be not himself
infallible; For he,</hi> he says, <hi>does so, who acts and
proceeds by infallible unerring Rule.</hi> Yet with
his good leave, he may herein be again mistaken;
For, though the Rule he acts and proceeds by,
be streight; yet if the Agent be not infallible,
he may through error or inability draw crooked
lines by it; and so cannot be said to act infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:
And indeed, if what he here says were
true; instead of our infallible Pope, he hath
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40679:61"/>
set up Thousands of Infallible Priests, who
pretend to Act and precede by an Infallible
unerring Rule; the Infallible and unerring
word of God. But to proceed, by what Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
doth he frame an Argument from this
Query, against <hi>punishing an Atheist?</hi> Does it
say, as he would have it, that none ought to
be punisht, <hi>who are not Infallibly convic't?</hi> or
any thing to that purpose? why then doth
he entertain his Readers with these imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences?
Yet hath Truth so far prevailed on him,
that he here acknowledges, <hi>All Doctrines ought
to be tryed and examined by their proper measures
and standards, &amp;c.</hi> But what he means by his <hi>mean
between this; and for men to be allowed a Liberty
to deal with their Religion, and the Truths of
God, as they do with their Cloathes, which they
put on and off, and change as their fancies prompt
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or as the weather or fashion alters,</hi> we are
yet to learn. For, whether are the more likely
to change their Religion, they who use their
Reason in the choice and continuance thereof;
or they who therein blindly follow the guidance
of their Teachers; since the first are as fixt and
stedfast therein; as the nature of man, upon
the best and surest foundation, is capable off;
while the latter, whose Religion depends on
the guidance of his Teacher or Leader, is liable
to change the one, as oft as he happens to
change the other. Yet we do not say, as this
Answerer would have us, <hi>That a man ought only
to be guided by his own light;</hi> But we do say and
affirm, that in the concerns of Eternity, a man
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40679:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ought not to be forc't, against his own light,
to be guided by others, who are not Infallible;

those concern'd determine. <hi>But this;</hi> he says,
<hi>He will not prove from their Practices; the thing
being apparent from the very Principles of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
which aim at little else but Tvranny and
Pre eminence: as appears by the Independant

as if there were no Salvation out of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40679:63"/>
their Communion; and yet I know not what
else he means by it; and if that be his meaning,
they do not yet exclude any from the means of
Salvation, in making that a condition of their
Communion which is impossible; for if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
were impossible, the Communion which
depended on it, would be so too; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is very well known; and so, in good
time, will the credit of this Reporter likewise
be.</p>
               <p>But as a farther instance of their Tyranny
and Prae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

do, it is not by the Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we have heard
much talk of. <hi>But they will not,</hi> he says, <hi>admit

That is, they will perhaps, <hi>have no Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and worthy this Answerer's rebuke. But, <hi>is it
more then probable,</hi> as he politickly observes,
<hi>That this, and not meanness of Trade, impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes

against Hereticks; and of Hereticks against

&amp;c.</hi> That's the Query, and wherein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Persecutions and Divisions that

upon the imposition of differing, if not

(as a Learned Prelate hath well observ'd) had

                  </gap> they had

thereon.</p>
               <p>But is it possible this Answerer should be
Ignorant of the sad Persecutions and Divisions,
which have been amongst Christians, upon the
account of Rites and Ceremonies, imposed as
conditions of Church-Fellowship and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which neither Christ, nor his Apostles
ever required. For; not to instance in those
between <hi>Austin</hi> and the Monks of <hi>Bangor,</hi> with
others we read of in ancient story; what thinks
he of the unhappy Breaches and Divisions which
have been thereby occasion'd, even in this
Church ever since the Reformation: he that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40679:66"/>
is Ignorant thereof, must be something more
then I am here willing to express.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he tells us</hi> the difference between the
Eastern and Western Churches, about the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of <hi>Easter,</hi> can by no means be applyed to
the present case of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
those that separate from its Communion. <hi>Nor
have I heard of any that ever so apply'd it; and
yet for any thing he says to the contrary, it may
be applicable enough: For his presuming does
not prove,</hi> That every National Church, hath a
more indispencible Power over its own Members,
<hi>(if, as we have Reason to believe, he takes
every one for such, who is born or Inhabits
within that Nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Church had over the Eastern, or the Eastern over

difference <hi>as he alledgeth</hi> between the conditions
of Communion required in the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
and those that were between the Eastern and
Western Churches about the Celebration of <hi>Easter:</hi>
For if, <hi>as he tells us,</hi> the one was about a trivial
inconsiderable business; <hi>the other being about
indifferent things only, cannot certainly be
thought very considerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, says he, <hi>every Church hath a Power to
Guide and Govern its own Members in all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
things pertaining to its Communion;</hi> which
if true,<note place="margin">Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one or both kinds by some, Said to be indifferent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Catholicks no Idolators, by <hi>T. G.</hi> p. 33.</note> yet is not every Member bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all things to be indifferent, which their
Ecclesiastical Guides or Governours shall call
so; and if they require other conditions of

of, or Judge lawfull; 'twill, undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

them.</p>
               <p>What Rites the Church of <hi>England</hi> tenders
as conditions of Church-Fellowship to those
within her Pale, we meddle not with; our
Query being only, <hi>Whether the requiring other
conditions of Church-Fellowship and Communion
then Christ or his Apostles did, have not been the
main inlet of all the Distractions, Persecutions
and Divisions in the Christian world;</hi> which but
for asking we are judg'd Criminal; though the

not to affirm,<note place="margin">Pref. to his Irenicon.</note> 
                  <hi>That the main Inlet of all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions,
Confusions and Divisions of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

of Church Communion, then Christ hath done.</hi>
And hath this Answerer the confidence, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
rather, to suppose this Reverend Dr.
herein <hi>chargeth the Church of</hi> England, <hi>with all
the Distractions and Divisions that now abound in
this Nation? or that he causelessly and falsely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth
a whole Church and Kingdom, as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of all the Distractions and Divisions that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in it?</hi> or will he not himself be found to
be the <hi>false accuser</hi> he speaks of? The Church of
<hi>England</hi> being no more concern'd in this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
or Query, then the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
or the Church at <hi>Geneva,</hi> or any other Church
whatever; unless this Answerer will say, she
requires other conditions of Church-Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Communion, than Christ or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40679:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did; which neither the Doctor, nor

               <p>But to conclude, he tells us, <hi>St.</hi> James <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us with another cause of Wars and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
then the Imposition of a few Rites and
Ceremonies in matters of Religion; which are from

may not the Imposition of those Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
proceed from those Lusts, they first
<hi>rebelling against the Law of their minds, and
then against the Law of their Maker?</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
argues the greater Pride, the imposing
upon mens Judgements, or the leaving unto
every man that Judgement of discretion God
hath given him, and requires the exercise of in
all the duties of Religion; and <hi>will not,</hi> as the

unto any, to Institute in the Worship and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

tells us, <hi>The words cited by him from Mr.</hi> Hooker,
<hi>would be a sufficient Answer;</hi> which we deny
not, according to his way and method of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
Queries; otherwise they are far enough

only, or by Jesus Christ, whom he hath

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40679:68"/>

any thing in the words of the Ingenious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
he commends to his Reader. To all which

in Question, the words of the but now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi>
who,<note place="margin">Preface to his Iren.</note> speaking of the <hi>Meekness, Sweetness, and
Gentleness of our Blessed Saviour,</hi> tells us, <q>His
design was to ease men of their former bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
and not to lay on more. That the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he required, were no other, but such as
were necessary, and withall, Just and Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
That he that came to take away the
insupportable Yoke of Jewish Ceremonies,
certainly did never intend to gall the necks
of his Disciples with another instead of it;</q>
                  <hi>(and if so, did not certainly, give Power or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
unto any to Institute in their room such
others as they should think good)</hi> 
                  <q>it would be
strange, <hi>says he,</hi> the Church should require
more then Christ himself did; and make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conditions of her Communion, then
our Saviour did of Discipleship. <hi>Then asks,</hi>
What ground there can be, why Christians
should not stand upon the same terms now,
which they did in the times of Christ and his
Apostles? Whether Religion were not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
guarded and fenced in them? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there was ever more true and cordial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
in the worship of God? What Charter
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40679:68"/>
Christ hath given his Church to bind men up
to more then himself hath done? <hi>And then
tells us,</hi> The grand Commission the Apostles
were sent out with, was only to Teach what
Christ had commanded them; not the least
intimation of any Power given them to impose
or require any thing beyond what himself had
spoken to them; or they were directed to,
by the immediate guidance of the spirit of
God.</q> What Power or Commission, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
any have since received to Institute such
Ceremonies in the Worship and Service of
God, as they shall think good, this Answerer,
or his Adherents, may do well to inform us.
But instead thereof, he tells us, <hi>Nothing is more
evident in the New-Testament, than that Christ
did intrust those whom he appointed in his absence
to be the Ministers of his Church, with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it.</hi> He did so; and yet he did not
Empower or Authorise them to Institute in
the Worship and Service of God such Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
as they should think good. But says,
our Politick Answerer, <hi>This Government could
not subsist without the Enacting of Laws for its
own, and the Churches preservation, for that
Christ intended, &amp;c.</hi> How does that appear?
we find nothing in his Gospel of any such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
nor have we reason to believe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
any should Enact other Laws for the
Government of his Church, than what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Enacted; since 'twere to deny the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
sufficiency unto that end; and its being a
perfect Rule of our Faith and Obedience, in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40679:69"/>
all Gospel Duties and Administrations; and, in
plain term's to tell us, that Christ was not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to him that appointed him, as was <hi>Moses,</hi>
in all his House, in <hi>that he left not, as did</hi> Moses,
<hi>a compleat Volume of Laws for its Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
We wish therefore, this Answerer
would acquaint us with the Instrument, by
which the Apostles made over their Authority
of Enacting Laws, for the Government of the
Church, to their Successors; in that it would
tend greatly to their conviction who have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been in an error, and very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
if the Lord Christ be not the sole Lord
over, and Law-giver to his Church; and that
the Apostles neither did, nor could Delegate a
Legislative Power to their Successors; being
themselves Ministers only of the Gospel of Jesus
Christ; the Power of the Keys committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, not being a Power of giving Laws
to the Church, but a Power of Teaching and
Ruling the Church according to the Laws
which Christ himself had given; and those, as he

so far this Answerer is in the right, <hi>That there
could have been no such Society, if there had been
no Law for its Vnity;</hi> But he should withall
have consider'd, that there neither could, nor
can, be any Law for its Unity, but from an

                  </gap>tion or
Authority of the Legislator: So that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
impossible for any but the Lord Christ,
to Enact Laws for the visible Unity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Communion, in the external Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods sacred Worship; since the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
or Authority of none other can reach
or oblige all Christians.</p>
               <p>That our Blessed Saviour was greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
for the Unity of his Church, none sure,
ever doubted. But the words quoted by this
Answerer from St. <hi>Johns</hi> Gospel, relate not
so much to the external visible Unity of the
Church, as to the internal mystical Union that
is between Christ and his Members. Yet he
tells us, <hi>That which he would principally have
the Reader observe in them, is, The care that our
Blessed Lord and Master took for that great Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
of Christianity, the Vnity of the Church;</hi>
No doubt he did, both for the internal and
external Unity thereof, and that not only in
his frequent calling on his Disciples to Unity,
and to love one another; making it a Caracte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical
note of their relation unto him; <hi>By this
shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if
ye love one another;</hi> But also in commanding
them to <hi>teach the observation of all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he commanded them;</hi> which would all,
who would be accounted his Disciples, likewise,
observe and do, without <hi>setting up their Posts</hi>
(as the Prophet speaks) <hi>by his Posts;</hi> Unity
would not be wanting among Christians; nor
yet throughout the Christian world, a due uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40679:70"/>
in the external Administration of Gods
Sacred worship; which, variety of Rites and
Ceremonies in particular Churches, destroys.
And it may be truly enough said by him, <hi>That
it is impossible for the Gospel to be propagated and
upheld by Faith and Charity only; as they are
lodg'd in mens Hearts, unless the Fruits of these
Graces were exerted in some things that were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and obvious to sense;</hi> and therefore outward
worship is required, that the inward may be
exercised and expressed; for to talk of inward
worship without any outward expressions
thereof, is but a Cloak for Atheism.</p>
               <p>But for this Answerer to tell us, <hi>That the
Churches Vnity was the main thing that Christ
took care of, before his Crucifixion; That it is the
great Essential of Christianity, the very being of
Christian Religion depending on it; And that the
main principle of all Christian Amity and affection,
is the visible Vnity of Christian Communion, in
the external Administration of Gods Sacred Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which ought to be Vniform and undevided;</hi>
and then conclude, <hi>That variety of Rites in one
National Church, would cause Division of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and of affection;</hi> Is such an explanation
of the Unity of the Church, and visible Unity
of Christian Communion, in the External Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Gods Sacred Worship, as, I
think, the world was never before blest with;
For, was it the Unity of a National Church only
that Christ took such care of, and which is the
great essential of Christianity? or is it the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Unity of Christian Communion, in the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40679:70"/>
external Administration of Gods Sacred Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in a National Church only, that is the
main Principle of all Christian Amity and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?
certainly, if variety of Rites in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church cause divisions of Judgement,
and of affection; variety of Rites in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
or Catholick Church, will cause the
same also: so that it is a visible Unity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Communion, in the external Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods Sacred Worship, throughout the
Universal or Catholick Church, that is the main
principle of all Christian Amity and affection;
experience telling us, what sad Divisions, Feuds
and Animosities, have, and do daily arise among
Christians, from the variety of Rites, in the
external Administration of Gods worship, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
by particular Churches of several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations;
even to the destruction of that
external, as well as internal Unity, which is
the great Essential of Christianity; and which
Christ so earnestly recommended to his Church.
So that if the Internal Unity of the Church,
as well as External Unity of Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
in the publick Administration of Gods
Sacred Worship, be desirable, as most certainly
they are, and ought to be: They are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to be attained, then by all Christian
Churches Universally adhering to the Rule of
the Gospel; and enjoyning no other Rites or
Ceremonies, in the external Administration of
the worship of God; and requiring no other
conditions of Church-Fellowship, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
then that enjoyns and requires.</p>

<hi>That many Assemblies of Christians, Independent

Christianity in the world, than an Army divided

know, if he pleases, That though the Church

Major-Generals, Colonels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or

               <p>But our Answerer, <hi>having explain'd;</hi> as he
tells us, <hi>One of the main vitals of Christianity;</hi>
(viz.) <hi>The Vnity of the Church;</hi> advises his
Reader farther to consider, <hi>That in the days of
Christs abiding upon Earth, there could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be any Law for the preservation of its Vnity,</hi>
for the reason he mentions; <hi>and therefore Jesus
Christ gave Power and Authority to his Apostles
and their Successors, to Institute such Ceremonies
and Rituals in Religion, as they in their own Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
should judge most agreable to the manners
and Customs of the Nations they should convert;
and which tended to promote true Piety and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in their hearts and lives.</hi> But for this the
Reader is desired likewise to consider, we have
but his bare word; he not offering the least
proof of any such Power committed by Jesus
Christ, to his Apostles, and their Successors;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40679:72"/>
the Commission he gave unto his Apostles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but <hi>to teach the observation of such things as
he had commanded them;</hi> so far was he from leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to them (and much less to the prudence
of their Successors) to Institute and appoint
such Rituals in Religion, as they should think
good. These things therefore, are fondly and
groundlessly asserted; and no less inconsistent
with what himself but now said, than repugnant
to the Gospel. For, <hi>if those Rites which were
agreeable to one sort of People, would not be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
others;</hi> and the Governours of the Church
were to appoint, as he says, <hi>such Rituals in
Religion, as in their prudence they should judge
most agreeable to the manners and Customs of those
Nations they should convert;</hi> what becomes of
his main principle of all Christian Amity and
Affection, <hi>The visible Vnity of Communion in
the external Administration of Gods Sacred Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi>
which he but now told us, <hi>ought to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it is so far from being
<hi>impossible that in the days of Christs abode upon
Earth, there should be,</hi> as he says; <hi>any Law made
for the preservation of the Churches Vnity;</hi> that
it is altogether impossible, as hath been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
that any but Jesus Christ, or less then
an omnipotent Power, should be able to Enact
any such Law. Neither hath our Lord Christ,
Instituted any Rite or Ceremony in Religion,
but what will very well suit with the <hi>Manners
and Customs</hi> of all Nations. He would never
else have commanded his Disciples, to <hi>teach all
Nations to observe all things whatsoever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40679:72"/>
them.</hi> Yet so fond is our Answerer of
his fancies, as to repeat them, in telling us, <hi>That
when Christ made void the Law of Ceremonies in
the Jewish Church, he intended</hi> (though he gives
us no evidence of such his intention) <hi>to inspire
the minds of his Apostles and their Successors,
with so much soundness, and integrity of wisdom
and understanding; that they should be able by
their own Reasons, to Enact such Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
as should preserve the external Vnity of the
Church, and render Religion so amiable, as that
it should not be quite naked and destitute of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Ornament and Beauty.</hi> In which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
but his own vain and carnal thoughts of
Religion; Christian Religion being certainly,
most amiable, when most suitable to the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of the Gospel; the beauty of whose wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
consists not in external Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
in which, even where they most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
it comes far short of the Ceremonies and
Ordinances under the Law; and yet the Apostle
prefers the Gospel worship, far above that for
Glory, Beauty, and Comliness; which shews
that these things have no respect unto outward
Rites and Ceremonies. And though he tells
us, <hi>It is not in the least repugnant to the wisdom
of Christ towards his Church, to invest the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
of it, with Authority to Institute new Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
in his worship, &amp;c.</hi> Yet the contrary is
evident, in that it speaks him either wanting
towards it, in not appointing things necessary;
or not so wise as others, to find out such things
as conduce to its Edification and Beauty. And
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40679:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in Commissioning his Disciples to teach only
the observation of such things as he commanded
them; rejecting the honour given unto him,
by those whose worship of him, is taught them
by the precepts of men; he sufficiently declares,
That no other Rites or Ceremonies but what
are Divine of Institution, are to be enjoyn'd, or
made necessary to be observ'd by any, in the
Worship and Service of God.</p>
               <p>If by positive Laws made for the external
Regiment of the Church, the Bishop cited by
him, means Laws only for the ordering and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of things without the Church, though
about it; we have nothing more to say against
it, than that it is not the present Question.
Nor do we argue from Christ's abrogating those
Ceremonies that God himself had appointed;
that no others ought to be introduced into the
Church. We only ask, <hi>Whether Jesus Christ,
who came to take away the Yoke of Jewish Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
appointed by God himself, hath given
Power and Authority unto any, to Institute in their
room such others as they shall think good.</hi> And are
perswaded he hath not; not because he abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
those, which were appointed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
but because no worship is acccptable unto
God, but what is of Faith; <hi>for without Faith,
it is impossible to please God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> and Faith in all
things respects the commands and Authority of
God: So that the Governours of the Church
can have no Authority to Institute or Appoint
any thing in the Worship and Service of God,
either as to matter, or manner, (beyond the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40679:73"/>
orderly observance of such circumstances, as
necessarily attend such Ordinances, as Christ
himself hath Instituted) but by express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or Commission from God. Let this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer
therefore shew their Authority to Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
new Ceremonies in his Worship; and he
may be better thought of then otherwise, I
presume, he will be; by those who fear God,
and desire to keep his commandments.</p>
               <p>Nor does it in the least <hi>reflect upon the wisdom
and goodness of God,</hi> as he says, <hi>to give unto Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Powers, Commissions to make such Laws as they
please, for securing the Peace and civil Rights of
their People; and none unto the Guides of the
Church, to make Laws for the preservation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
&amp;c.</hi> But is rather an Argument of his
great love and care of his Church, not to leave
her to the ordering and disposing of men, which
unavoidably (as wofull experience manifests)
must fill her with Schisms and Divisions; but
to have himself given her a standing Rule or
Law, whereby she ought to be Universally Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and which is every way sufficient,
would her Guides and Governours faithfully
and diligently attend unto it, <hi>for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion against the Deluges of Heresies
and Schisms; and to secure Christians in the Paths,
of Piety and Order; of Vnity and Peace;</hi> which
as hath been shewn, it is altogether impossible
for any other Law, or Lawgivers ever to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>Nor <hi>was it from the dulness and Indocibleness

<hi>amiable</hi> and <hi>beautifull.</hi> But certainly, nothing
is more evident in Scripture, than that the due
observance of the outward Institutions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
come under the notion of the worship of
God: So did the Sacrifices of old, and so do
the present Sacraments of the Church; which
were, and are, parts of outward worship; and
I suppose of Religion too: and whatever is
made so necessary to be observ'd in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, that without it, the worship is
not to be perform'd, is thereby made an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
of worship; for that which is so the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a thing, that without it the thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, is of the essence of that thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he tells, us,</hi> All<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is pleaded, is but
that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> may be allowed the
same priviledge, which all Sects and Parties as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to themselves, <hi>(viz.)</hi> To determine the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Religion; <hi>which is so reasonable, that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40679:76"/>
it cannot either in Reason or Justice be denyed.
Then he tells us,</hi> There is no Sect, but the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Teachers prevails in those Instances and
Rites, where there is no word of God to warrant
the things that are practis'd by them; <hi>Instancing
in the</hi> worship perform'd, <hi>as he says<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> by Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;
<hi>asking</hi> what Scripture they have to prove
their Covenant which the Members of their
Churches swear to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before they are admitted by
their Pastors and Elders. <hi>Though he finds no
mention of any such Covenant sworn to, in
the declaration of the Faith and Order owned
and Practis'd in their Churches; wherein as
well their Order as common Faith is declar'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Neither of which do they, or did they ever,
that I have heard of, impose upon any; and
yet are able,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 15</note> 
                  <hi>I presume,</hi> to give an Answer unto
every man that asketh them a reason of the hope
that is in them: <hi>To them therefore I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him for farther satisfaction, in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
he mentions, if he desires it. And for the
present shall only tell him, There is some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between a confession of Faith, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Articles of Faith; Yea, or Rites and
Ceremonies. And will he now say,</hi> In verbo
Sacerdotis, <hi>or upon his Reputation,</hi> That the
Church of <hi>England</hi> in appointing of her Rites
and Ceremonies, does no more, then appoint cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
concerning the worship of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to humane Actions; which are to be order'd
by the light of nature and Christian Prudence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the general Rules of the word? <hi>Or why
does he thus impose upon his credulous and
unwary Reader?</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:40679:76"/>
But he tells us, <hi>If the Governours of the
Church of</hi> England <hi>did command such and such
things, then Dissenters had some reason to separate
from its Communion;</hi> which is but a copy of his
countenance; he elsewhere telling us, <hi>That
the Governours of the Church have Power to Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
such Ceremonies as they shall think good; and
that it is the peoples duty to obey;</hi> Yea, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises
them to <hi>resign up themselves to the Fathers
of the Church, rather than attend to</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the Dictates
of their own dark minds:</hi> which takes away,
not only the liberty of separating; but even of
examining the commands of their Spiritual
guides. And having thus reduced them to an
implicit Faith, he may be bold to tell them,
<hi>There were as many, or more Ceremonies made
use of in the very Age of the Apostles, and then
Instituted by them, than are now in the Church of
England:</hi> and instance in half a score, not one
of which were ever Instituted by the Apostles.
Yet after all his boldness, he speaks but faintly,
in saying, <hi>If he be mistaken in his conjecture about
this matter; yet 'tis no way injurious to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Power of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
symbolical or significative Ceremonies in Gods
worship: for that the Primitive Christians under
the Heathen Emperours, were much like the</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
<hi>in their</hi> Egyptian <hi>Bondage; rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to maintain the life and being of Religion,
then to be curious about the Apparel and Ornament
thereof.</hi> And would to God there were no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Christians in these days, more concern'd
about the Apparel and Ornament (as they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40679:77"/>
term them) of Religion; then to maintain the
life and being thereof. And how unhandsomly
does he reflect here on the Primitive Christians,
in saying, <hi>When Kings and Emperours became
Christian, then they began to glorifie God with
their bodies, and to honour him with their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and Estates, &amp;c.</hi> As if till then, they had
been unmindful of the Apostles precept, <hi>of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
God in their bodies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 10</note> 
                  <hi>and in their spirits:</hi>
or what thinks he of those who before that,
<hi>sold their Possessions and goods,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 24. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and parted them
to all men, as every man had need;</hi> Did not they
as much honour God with their substances and
Estates, as those who adorn Temples? But
such gross and carnal thoughts have some, of
the most High, <hi>Who dwelleth not in Temples
made with Hands;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 7. 48.</note> as to think him still delighted
and pleased, with mens Erecting, Dedicating,
and Adorning of Temples; in which they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
place more of their Religion, than in
the performance of the most spiritual and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

any man, teach otherwise,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He is proud,
&amp;c.</hi> Where observe, how instead of <hi>Master,</hi> he
foists in <hi>Superiour,</hi> a word of a more extensive
signification; for, though every Master be a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,
every Superiour is not a Master: and
yet we do not say, that obedience may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
from Superiours of any kind; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
laying the greatest obligation immagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40679:78"/>
upon its Professors, to be obedient to
their Superiours. But as the Authority of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
is not despotical or absolute, so neither
ought the obedience of Inferiours, to be blind
or Brutish; both the one and the other being
regulated by a Supream Power. For where
Superiours have no Right to command, there
lyes no obligation on Inferiours to obey: So
that whether Conformists, in commanding, or
Non-conformists, in not obeying, are the Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks;
depends on the formers having right
and Authority to require; what the latter
judges sinful or unlawful to observe; which
being beyond the present Question, we shall
not meddle with.</p>
               <p>But he tells us, <hi>If the Church of</hi> England <hi>had
forsaken the common Faith, it had been no Schism
to forsake the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and if she did
so and so; then that command in the</hi> Revelation,
<hi>Come out of her my people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>had been appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to our Dissenters.</hi> B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t this is still but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
being against his principle of <hi>blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and mens resigning up themselves to the
Fathers of the Church;</hi> without leaving them
so much as a Power to Examine what is
commanded; for where that is, there must
likewise be allowed a dissent in all things they
judge evil or unlawful. And though he tells
us, <hi>A good Christian ought as much to dread the
imposing upon his Judgement an Assent to known
errors; and upon his Practice the acting of known
Sins, as the suffering the very pains of Hell it
self;</hi> he does, we doubt, but equivocate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40679:78"/>
none to be known errors, or known
sins; but such as Superiours shall judge so: for
if he allow Inferiours to judge thereof, and act
accordingly; there is no difference between
us.</p>
               <p>But having told us, what the Church of
<hi>England</hi> does not; he now tells us what many
of our Dissenters do: And first, he says, <hi>They
Question not only the Power of Bishop to Govern
the Church; but that of Kings, to make Laws
for the Security of their own Crown and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well as the common Christianity.</hi> If such
there are, I am sure no sober or Rational man
will justifie, or excuse them in it. <hi>That they
make the people Judges of their own Pastors, &amp;c.</hi>
That they may have reason for; how else can
they <hi>beware of false Prophets, and try the spirits;</hi>
as they are commanded; or distinguish between
the Ministers of Christ, and the Ministers of
Antichrist: But no sober man sure will allow
any to withdraw their obedience from those
who are lawfully Ordain'd, and ought to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intend
over them. <hi>That they forsake their old
guides, &amp;c.</hi> This is but the old Popish objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
new vampt; nor is such forsaking Criminal,
but where causeless: And who are they that
<hi>renounce in their Assemblies,</hi> as he says, <hi>the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Creeds which were in all Ages esteemed the
Badges of Christianity?</hi> And wherein lyes the
<hi>Crime of not reading the Scriptures to the people,
without expounding them?</hi> But sure they make
it not <hi>indifferent to be of any Communion,</hi> who
are so great sufferers because they cannot be so.

happy for the Church of God, if none who are
not gifted and qualified for the work of the
Ministry; were empower'd to read Sermons
in the Pulpit; Prophane the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But who are they that as he says, <hi>Evacuate one

Papists? All others, believe <hi>their is one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church;</hi> but do not believe <hi>in one Catholick
Church;</hi> we are taught to believe only in God,
not in the Church; but he, it seems, hath
resign'd up his Faith to the Fathers of the
Church; believing only as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves.
No wonder therefore he should talk of a
<hi>Yearly, Monthly, and Daily Faith;</hi> which his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
lead him to, if he chance so oft to change

                  <q>So long, said
he, as they taught the same Doctrine which

them to keep their competent Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

The Son of God first founded, and still ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
his Church by the mouths of
Preachers, not by the Summons of consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and he that is sent to Preach, may

Lord the Pope, and his Miter'd Fathers can
intend to meet, and list to consent, to the
ruine, as they think, of their Dignities and
Liberties.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to our Answerer, How do
they as he says, <hi>break the bonds of Vnity, and
Line of Apostolical Succession,</hi> who adhere to
the Universal and Uniform Law of the Gospel?
or do not they rather break both, who make
their own, or other mens wills, the Rule of the
Churches; and found their Ordination, on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
tradition.</p>
               <p>I know of no Dissenters, <hi>that obtrude Oaths
and Covenants,</hi> as he says, <hi>on their Proselites;</hi>
though it be no Crime for Christians to Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to serve God, as God wil be serv'd.</p>
               <p>Every man hath a Judgement of discretion,
Which is the Rule of Practice, as to himself;
and must direct him with whom to joyn, and
not to joyn, in the performance of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
duties; nor may he therein do ought against
his Light. But what means he, in saying here,
<hi>They will submit to no Law, nor admit of any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
but what is erected and Executed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
(a thing never known for Criminals to

they not submit to the Laws of the Land, in
all civil things and concerns? and what Law
of the Gospel submit they not to in the duties
of Religion? but to talk here of Criminals ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
choice of their own Punishment is very
extravagant.</p>
               <p>And lastly <hi>they will,</hi> he says, <hi>have no publick

                  <hi>as satisfied in Conscience, that what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,

so boldly avers, <hi>There is no Congregated
Independent Communion in</hi> England, <hi>but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Pastor of it, assumes to himself more
Power and Authority to Govern and Conduct the
sworn Members of it, in the ways and duties of
Religion, then the greatest Prelate in our Church
does in his Province or Diocess?</hi> or is this <hi>one of the
principles of Independent Tyranny?</hi> But some, are
said to have need of good memories, and our
Answerer seems to be of them. Yet he would
be thought to have reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for what he here
says, telling us, <hi>The thing is impossible in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for, if all are satisfied, they are not men,
there being among all men difference in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
How unreasonable then is it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of any such an Assent or Consent, as
must render them either Beasts, or not men?
But so it seems, it is and must be; for he
tells us, <hi>In the enacting of all Laws, the lesser
part is determin'd by the greater:</hi> which is true
in all civil things and concerns which are in
a man's choice, and at his own disposal; and

it is for the publick good and benefit, it should
be so. But 'tis otherwise in matters of duty

all due and proper means, to accomplish and bring
about lawfull and charitable ends: nor that any
end can be more generous and Christian, than to
secure People in the performance of their duty to
God, to man, and to themselves,</hi> But we do
say, that Secular Force and Compulsion, are not
the proper and due means to effect all these.
And whatever sense some may have of Moral
Honesty and Justice, or of Piety and Religion;
the Civil Magistrate ought not, certainly, to
permit them to express or declare, their scorn
or contempt of either. I will not say, with
this Answerer, <hi>That 'tis since men have assumed
so great a liberty in Religion</hi> (as not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
what he thereby means,) but agree
with him, <hi>There is less regard had to those exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Rules of right and wrong; Vertue and Vice;
by some persons who make high pretences to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
than hath been observ'd in many Pagan
Nations;</hi> but who those Persons are, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
and Practices will best declare.</p>
               <p>But he tells us, <hi>'Tis Presumption and not Faith,
for the Clergy of</hi> England <hi>(as things are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us) to expect Gods miraculous concurrence
with them, in the management and exercise of
their Ministerial Office, when there are ordinary
means at hand, &amp;c.</hi> What may this Answerer
mean here, <hi>by Gods miraculous concurrence with
them?</hi> His continual presence, with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of his holy Spirit, he hath promised
unto them who observe his commands, unto the
worlds end; as the ordinary means to render
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40679:82"/>
their Ministry effectual, for the Conversion of
sinners, and the calling of those who are yet
Aliens and Strangers to the Covenant of Grace;
And our Blessed Saviour,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>when he ascended up
on High, gave Gifts unto men, for the perfecting
of the Saints; for the work of the Ministry, and
for the edifying of the Body of Christ.</hi> But if
this Answerer, who is of the Clergy, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
that things are now so amongst them;
that the presence of God, and assistance of his
holy Spirit, are to be lookt upon, as miraculous
concurrences with them, in the management
and exercise of their Ministeririal Office; he is
to be excused for having recourse unto other
means, <hi>to render his labours so considerable, as to
make him see some fruits of the Travel of his Soul;</hi>
though, possibly, it may prove but bitter fruit
in the end.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman, I can assure him, never
thought, as he intimates, <hi>That the Peoples for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
of any Assemblies, was a certain Prognostick
that the Ministerial Power was quite extinguisht
in all that were so forsaken;</hi> as knowing there
are, and may be defects and faults on all sides.
But this the Gentleman thinks, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
any People manifest a desire, and thirst
after knowledge in the things, and ways of God,
(as God be thanked, very many within these
Nations, at this d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y do,) and after trial and
experience of the Ministerial Power of any, do
yet leave and forsake them, 'tis no very good
sign or token of their Ministerial Gifts and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
But it is a presumptuous and too bold
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40679:82"/>
comparison he here makes, between <hi>the Success
of Christs Ministry, while he exercised it in his
own Person upon Earth,</hi> and that of the Clergy
of <hi>England:</hi> For, though <hi>taking on him the
form of a Servant, he was made in the likeness of
men;</hi> yet cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d he have Converted Millions of
sinners, as well as have commanded Legions of
Angels, if it had so pleased him.</p>
               <p>The Cases of <hi>Elijah,</hi> and of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> he
instances in, are not at all to the present purpose;
for we do not say, that Peoples leaving or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
their Pastors, is an Argument of their
having lost all spiritual Power and Authority.
But Pastors leaving or forsaking the Spiritual
means by Christ appointed for the Rule and
Government of his Church; and applying to,
and using of other means, than he appointed
and commanded them; to the subversion and
ruine of his Discipline, is an Argument of it.
And here I cannot but take notice of the
great Pique our Answerer hath against li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in Religion, in that he would have
the Prophets apprehension, <hi>That the whole</hi>
Israel <hi>of God had forsaken his Covenant, to
proceed from the general indulgence granted by</hi>
Ahab, <hi>to all kinds of Religion, as well as Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties;</hi>
when,<note place="margin">1 Kings 16 33.</note> though there may be reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

enough to believe he <hi>indulg'd all kind of Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
in that it is said, <hi>He did more to provoke the
Lord God of</hi> Israel <hi>to anger, then all the Kings
of</hi> Israel <hi>that were before him;</hi> there is not the
least evidence of <hi>his indulging all Kinds of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions;</hi>
in that, though there were 7000 who
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40679:83"/>

which is no great Argument of <hi>their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

talks of.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, <hi>whoever,</hi> as he says, <hi>shall
seriously consider the depraved Nature of Man; how
much more prone it is to embrace Vice, than Vertue;
Error than Truth; and the Novel, rather than
the good old way of Religion;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh 16. 33</note> will not be much
startled or wonder that the greatest part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 12</note>
should forsake the Truth and true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which have Persecution and outward suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings

               <head>Reply to the Answer to this Query.</head>
               <p>WE do not say, nor did we ever think, the
<hi>first Reformers of Religion in this, or any
other Nation, were Strangers to the Power and
Efficacy of the Divine Spirit, or distrustful of
Gods Promise to be always with his Church;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the whole Reformation <hi>was not without
the Aid and Assistance of civil Magistrates:</hi> But
bless God rather for their Cooperating in so
good a work. And yet we shall not scruple to
say; They had been strangers to the Power and
Efficacy of the Divine Spirit, and its operations
on the Souls of men; had they believed the
Reformation could not have been effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them. And to ask what <hi>Archbishop Cranmer,
Hooper, Ridly.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>could have done to restore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to its Purity and Truth; had they not been
seconded and Assisted by the civil Magistrate</hi> would
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40679:84"/>
have better become a <hi>Turkish</hi> Mufti, then a
Gospel Minister. Does he think the Power and
Efficacy of Gods Spirit, in the mouths of his
Preachers, not sufficient to convert the most
obstinate; <hi>and to bring into Captivity every
thought to the obedience of Christ?</hi> How then
did, not only <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> with the rest of
the Apostles; but the Primitive Christians for
several Ages after them, propagate Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Truths of the Gospel; not only
without the assistance, but even against the
greatest opposition of civil Magistrates? And
what can be more to the disparagement of the
then <hi>English<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> Clergy; and derogatory to the
Spirit of God, then to say as he does, <hi>they might
as well have attempted to have pull'd the Sun out
of its Orb, as ever to have Reformed Religion,</hi> (by
the Aid and Assistance of the Holy Spirit)
<hi>without the Aid and Assistance of the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</hi>
Does he think things were then amongst
them, as he would have them thought to be
amongst us, That the Presence of God, and
Assistance of his Holy Spirit, were to be look't
upon as <hi>miraculous concurrences</hi> with the Clergy
in the management and Exercise of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial
Office? I trust they are not; and that
he judges both of the one, and of the other;
but by himself. But so far I agree with him,
<hi>That as Kingdoms, and States, so Religion and
the Church are to be secured and npheld, by the
very same means and methods, by which they were
established:</hi> And so the Church of <hi>England, as
founded in Prelacy by the Kings and Nobles of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40679:84"/>
England,</hi> as hath been shown, must be secured
and upheld by the same means and methods;
or it will not long so continue, but as Christian,
wherein it was founded by the mouths of
Preachers with the Aid and Assistance of the
Holy Spirit, it will, I trust, be so secured and
upheld to the worlds end: Yet that God will
withal vouchsafe her, so great a blessing. <hi>That
Kings and Queens may ever be her Nursing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Nursing Mothers,</hi> to protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
her from the rage and violence of wicked
and unreasonable men, since all men have not
Faith, is my hearty desire.</p>
               <p>But our Clergy man (sensible, it seems, <hi>how
things are now amongst them)</hi> is distrustful of
Gods continuing his Church with us; and
therefore would have <hi>the Gentleman consider, in
what Scripture he hath promis'd, that either Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
in general, or Protestantism in particular,
should for ever continue the Establisht Religion of
this Kingdom.</hi> We know, indeed, of no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
promise concerning the Establisht Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of this Kingdom; but this we know,
<hi>That where two or three are gathered together in
Christs name, he hath promised to be in the midst
of them;</hi> and that he told his Disciples, while
they taught the <hi>observation of all things which he
commanded them, he would be with them to the
worlds end;</hi> So that if Christianity continue
not with us, it is by o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r own default, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
Christ, and disobeying his commands.</p>
               <p>He is pleased to acknowledge here, what
could not well be denied, <hi>That Christianity</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:40679:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>spread it self over the world, under Heathen and
Persecuting Emperours, only by the Power of the
Divine Presence and Protection, without the Aid
of the civil Magistrate:</hi> But looks upon it as
miraculous, and not to be depended on; and
would not, <hi>because some have been fed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
without the help of ordinary and common
sustenance, that others, therefore, should refuse
their daily bread.</hi> No certainly, no wise or
sober man will ever do that, but rather thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
accept of the Magistrates favour and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
if he will have that to be the <hi>Churches
daily bread;</hi> though I should have thought, <hi>the
Divine presence and Influences of the Holy Spirit,</hi>
might rather have been so esteemed; and to
substitute in the place thereof, the Magistrates
Coercive and Compulsive Power, savours more
of Mahumetism, than of Christianity. So
little reverence hath he for our Blessed Saviour,
as to tell us, with a seeming contempt of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>That true Religion flourisht before ever he came
in the flesh;</hi> though he acknowledges, <hi>it was
by the Divine Protection without the Aid of the
civil Magistrate: But so soon as the</hi> Israelites <hi>were
settl'd in the Land of Promise, The true Religion</hi>
he says, <hi>no longer thriv'd and prosper'd, among
them; then it was encouraged and protected against
all false and Forraign Religions, by the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate:</hi>
God having then, as he would have
us to believe, withdrawn his Divine and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Assistances from it; committing the sole
care and concerns thereof to the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
What then became of Religion when
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40679:85"/>
those Magistrates neglected their duty both
towards it, and towards God? was there then
no true Religion in <hi>Israel?</hi> or does he think it
did not then thrive or prosper in the hearts of
any, which is the proper Seat of Religion? The
Apostle tells us, <hi>Godliness is great gain;</hi> but
gain with some is the only godliness; and they
think Religion never thrives or prospers, but
in the outward Prosperity of its Professors;
though the contrary be evident, and so <hi>David</hi>
tells us; <hi>Before I was afflicted,</hi> saith he, <hi>I went
astray, but now have I kept thy word:</hi> and again;
<hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 67, 71.</note> 
                  <hi>that I
might learn thy Statutes.</hi> Yet will it not be
denyed, but that the example and countenance
of Superiours, hath a great influence on the
behaviour and conversation of Inferiours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the old saying, <hi>Regis ad exemplum,
totus componitur orbis:</hi> yet Religion does not
stand and fall with them, for even in <hi>Ahab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nor to be censur'd as disobedient to
Superiours, because they were not of the then
establisht national Religion.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, our Answerer tells us in

by miracles, (i.e.</hi> By the Power of the

the Church, are to be secured and upheld, by the

it seems, alter'd his mind, and now he judges
the Sword of the Spirit, unable to preserve
Christianity, without the aid of the Civil
Sword; and that Christs promised Presence
with his Church to the worlds end; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Gifts he gave unto men, <hi>for the
perfecting of the Saints; for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,

Christianity. Yea, he sticks not to tell us, <hi>That

(judging it seems, others, <hi>as things are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

that Christ continu'd not his Gifts unto men
for the ends before-mention'd, nor yet his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

tells us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Myst. of Iniq. l. 2. c. 15. pag. 166.</note> That the cruel and bloody Persecution
of the true and living Members of the Kingdom of
Christ; for their faithful adhering to the plain
and undoubted commands of their Heavenly So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
who is stiled King of Kings, and Lord
of Lords, is certainly the most signal and capital
Antichristianism that any Policy can be corrupted
with; and the most grossly and visibly opposite,
both to the nature of Christianity, which beareth all
things, and endureth all things; which will not
be over severe to the wicked, much less cruel to the
good.<note place="margin">Psal. 72.</note> And also to the description of Christs Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
who is said,<note place="margin">Isa. 40.</note> to redeem the Souls of
the needy from deceit and violence; and that their
blood is precious in his sight: he shall feed his
Flock like a Shepherd; he shall gather his Lambs
with his Arms, and carry them in his bosom. This
is the genuine Spirit of the true Christian Pastors,
whether of higher or lower degree, to be thus ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
affected towards their Sheep. But such as
thwack and beat them, and violently drive them;
instead of going before them in a way of Christian
example, these are not Shepherds, but Butchers;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40679:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and will easily drive them to the Shambles, and see
their throats cut without remorse.</p>
               <p>This being the genuine Spirit, as he truly
says, of the true Christian Pastors; to be thus
tenderly affected towards their Sheep; what
shall we judge of those, who not only thwack
and beat; and violently drive them: but are
so tenderly affected towards their Persecutors,
they cannot bear their being hardly spoken of?
And how impertinent are we here told (while
inquiring only after the nature of those, who
persecute upon the accouut of Religion) <hi>of the
enacting Laws to punish those that violate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowr
Religion;</hi> as if to persecute for Religion,
and punish the Violaters of Religion, were the
same thing. <hi>We diswade not,</hi> as he insinuates,
<hi>inflicting punishments upon sensual and unrighteous
Persons, such as violate the Laws of either Table;</hi>
and are far from thinking Christian Justice and
Righteousness, inconsistent with Clemency and
Lenity, of Spirit. Yet is it neither just nor
righteous to Execute before Judgement. And
as our Blessed Saviour is stiled the Shepherd of
Souls; and as he says, That Title imports, that
he would have not only his Lambs and Sheep
fed, but <hi>grievous Wolves watch, and their mouths
stopt too, when they devour the flock, and teach
things which they ought not for filthy</hi> Lucre'<hi>s sake;</hi>
It becomes a duty to stop his mouth, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
what he can, that Christs flock should
be devoured; teaching notorious untruths, and
things which he ought not for filthy. <hi>Lucer</hi>'s
sake. Nor will it, I doubt, advantage him, <hi>That
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40679:88"/>
as Christ is a meek Saviour to returning sinners; so
he is a terrible Judge to Apostates and evil doers,</hi>
while he continues a Persecutor, since <hi>against
such,</hi> as himself hath told us, <hi>His Arrows are
ordain'd.</hi> And though, as he says, <hi>he begins to
Execute vengeance in this world, by raising up
men of undaunted Spirits, who make Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the girdle of their Loins, and Judgement their
Robe and Diadem; to succour his Church, support
his Worship and punish his Enemies,</hi> yet such will
never persecute for Religion, nor think those to
give ill example unto others, or to become Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
and disorderly in their Stations, who
serve God according to the rule and order of the
Gospel; nor judge any evil Doers, for rendring
unto him the Homage due from the Creature
to the Creator; seeing by this no <hi>occasion is given
to the Enemy to reproach and blaspheme the good
ways of God;</hi> whatever occasion some <hi>Cainish</hi> or
<hi>Ishmalitish</hi> spirits may thence take so to do. But
for such as have <hi>erred and strayed from the flock of
Christ;</hi> or neglect the Christian duties he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of them; let the Magistrate, in Gods
name, and by the ways and means of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
reduce or otherwise punish them;
no good Christian will certainly ever be displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thereat.</p>
               <p>But, says our Answerer, <hi>'Tis no indication of
any such nature as the Query mentions to punish
evil Doers;</hi> It is not indeed, nor does the Query
say it is: but to persecute on the account of
Religion, as <hi>Cain</hi> persecuted <hi>Abel, Ishmael, Isaac,
&amp;c.</hi> and as their followers at this day persecute
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40679:89"/>
such as are more righteous than themselves, is
an Indication of such a nature as the Query
mentions. And now if Magistrates will not
do as he would have them, <hi>He declares them
wickedly unjust, and all those terrible Epithetes
mentioned in the Query to be ascribed to them</hi>
what then is it he would have them to do? <hi>To
break the Jaw-bone of the wicked, and pluck the
spoil out of their teeth.</hi> So would every honest and
good man. <hi>To repay men according to their deeds,
fury to his Adversaries, and recompence to his
Enemies;</hi> and who desires not the same? <hi>to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their Powr for his honour from whom it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends;</hi>
nothing sure is more just. <hi>Not to permit
the Christian Faith to be torn in pieces, by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Sects and Factions, and Wolves to prey upon
Christs flock:</hi> This above all, is, indeed, their
duty; and 'twere to be wished they would care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
observe it, and not suffer, much less assist,
any to impose their thoughts or fancies in the
<hi>Agenda and Credenda</hi> of the Gospel upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
but permit the Scriptures to be the Sole
Rule of all mens Faith and Obedience, in all
Gospel Duties and Administrations: Nothing
being more evident than that particular
Churches or Persons, assuming to themselves
a Power to Decree Articles of Faith, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them upon others; is that which hath
<hi>torn the Christian Faith in pieces; and divided the
Church into Sects and Factions; and which gives
opportunity unto Wolves to prey upon Christ's flock;
and to the great Enemy of mankind and his wicked
Instruments to sport themselves in her ruine,</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40679:89"/>

For he that believes the Scripture sincerely, and
endeavours to believe it in the true sense, cannot
possibly be an Heretick. And if no more than this

               <p>
                  <hi>INstead of Answering this Query, 'Tis very
judiciously objected,</hi> It hath many things
questionable in it. <hi>And with as great Judgement,
and to as little purpose; he likewise tell us,</hi>
That none are true Members of Christ, besides those
that are Vnited to his Church; for that Christ is
the Head, and his Church his Body; <hi>and (as he

belonging to the Head, unless he be some way
or other Vnited to the Body. <hi>But sure, our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer
is the first pretended Christian, that ever
questioned the</hi> soundness of Christs Body, <hi>the
Holy Catholick Church;</hi> or that a Christians

here tell us, what the Query neither denies,
nor questions;</hi> That the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40679:90"/>
a sound part of the Catholick Church; <hi>unless to
manifest his Dialectick Art, in proving,</hi> That
whoever, <hi>(in any thing)</hi> withdraw themselves
from any part of Christs Body, cut themselves off
from Christ the Head: <hi>and therefore they who
withdraw Communion from the Church of</hi>
England, <hi>(though but in the least minute Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
or Ceremonies)</hi> belong not unto
Christ. <hi>So that, it seems, with this Learned
and Judicious Answerer, out of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Pale of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>there is no
Salvation:</hi> and if any are punisht for so cuting

               </p>
               <p>Great wits according to the Proverb, have

Catholick Church:</hi> For that, as he said, <hi>They
restrained it to themselves,</hi> whereas he so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains
it to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as that he
allows of none <hi>withdrawing themselves from her
Communion, to belong unto Christ,</hi> the one main
Article therefore of his Christian Creed, <hi>Faith
in one Catholick Church;</hi> is, it seems, Faith in
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (or rather Faith in
whatever Church is uppermost.) And though
out of her there is no Salvation; yet, for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
sake, he will suppose, <hi>That those who
separate from her Communion</hi> (even in her very
Ceremonies) <hi>are notwithstanding</hi> (such) <hi>their
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40679:91"/>
separation, real Members of Christs mystical body;
yet none of them,</hi> he says, <hi>are persecuted for their
faithful adhering unto Christ, or the undoubted
and plain commands of their Heavenly Soveraign:</hi>
nor does the Query say they are. But suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
as he <hi>supposeth,</hi> That any should be punisht
for assembling together to Pray, or partake of
the Ordinances of the Gospel, which Christ
hath Instituted, and requires the observation
of; would not such be persecuted, for their
faithful adhering unto Christ; and to the plain
and undoubted commands of their Heavenly
Soveraign?</p>
               <p>But says our Answerer, <hi>Let the Gentleman
produce one Person that ever suffer'd for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any essential duty of Christian Religion.</hi> We
know not what he may esteem an essential duty
of Christian Religion; who is one with him,
who <hi>declares the outward worship of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. Pol. p. 99.</note> 
                  <hi>to be

Preaching, and Administring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to be essential duties of the Christian
Religion; as by all good Christians they have
hitherto been esteemed. He need not go
beyond his own Parish to meet with those,
who have suffer'd, and deeply suffer'd, even
by his Instigation, for the performance of those
duties.</p>
               <p>But he tells us, <hi>'Tis not for the performance of
those duties, but for the disorderly and Irregular
way of performing them, that they are punisht.</hi>
Very good: By what Rule then does he judge
the way of their performance Disorderly and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40679:91"/>
Irregular; all order consisting in the due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of some Rule: Now if he will tell us
of any Rule they therein transgress, which he
will abide by; he hath said something to the
purpose. He tells us, indeed, <hi>They are punisht
for not doing them in that due manner, as is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
them by their Superiours;</hi> yet does not say,
The injunction of Superiours, is the Rule
whereby they are to be perform'd.<note place="margin">Ans. to the 21. and 22 Query.</note> Nay, he
says, <hi>If the Governours of the Church did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a worship that were Idolatrous or supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious;
or did appoint vain, foolish, and ridiculous
Ceremonies; they were not therein to be complyed
with.</hi> So that the Injunctions or Commands
of Superiours, are not, by his own confession,
this Rule. But he tells us, <hi>They are punisht
for being disorderly in their Stations and Callings,
and for being disobedient to Government and
Laws.</hi> If by being disorderly in their Stations
and Callings, he means, as he elsewhere says,
<hi>Their Vsurping the Office of Bishops, as well as of
the Inferiour Clergy:</hi> He hath thereon, already
had the Judgement of as Learned and Judicious
a Divine, as most the Church of <hi>England</hi>
can boast of. And for their being disobedient;
<hi>though he hath advised us to resign up our selves
unto the Fathers of the Church;</hi> He hath not yet
told us, they are to be obeyed in whatever they
shall, or may, command us, So that neither
can the commands of Governours, nor Laws of
Superiours, be this Rule; nor indeed, ought
else but the will of God, revealed in his word:
<hi>To the Law, and to the Testimony,</hi> was the old
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40679:92"/>

                  </gap> by
and if the manner of their performance be not
according unto this Rule; it is, indeed, Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
and Irregular; and suffering upon that
account, may be esteemed a punishment, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then a persecution; as may likewise their
sufferings, who are <hi>disobedient to the Laws and
Governments</hi> of men, in all civil and secular
matters and concerns; and theirs also, who
<hi>censure the Actions of Authority; Vsurp the Office
of the Ministry; endanger the peace of the State,
and violate the Vnity of the Church.</hi> Nor are
there greater violaters of the Churches Unity;
than they who impose on Christs Disciples, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conditions of Church-fellowship and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
than Christ or his Apostles, ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
or required. And so far I agree with this

both to Church and State; the one being

and the other,</hi> (as wofull experience tells us,)
<hi>with Schisms, Heresies and Contentions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our Answerer grows pleasant, and plays

There hath been, and may be, great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> as quoted by him, says very

which is the utmost import of these
Queries; for then the charge will reach all those
Reverend and Learned Divines of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> before mention'd; with most others
of Name and Fame in the Christian World,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40679:94"/>
who have decry'd the same as Unscriptural, and
Inconsistent with the Precepts of the Gospel,
and Principles of Christianity; and will, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
argue him to be <hi>the Person of that evil and

agree with him, <hi>That men Eminent in their

and Wisdom, might do more good by their

with its censures, or Church-men with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.</hi>
But let him be assured, none shall
ever have a Reputation for Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
who give not unto God, the things that
are Gods; as unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> things that are <hi>Caesars;

from the Church,</hi> because they separate from
some Churchmen of vicious and depraved spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
<hi>or to have Enmity against that,</hi> because they
will have no Fellowship or Communion with
these: it not being their duty to follow any,
farther then they are followers of Christ; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
being obliged to walk together, so far
only as they have attain'd. To require more of
any; is, indeed, (as the Apostle at large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
in his 14 chapter to the <hi>Romans) to lay
a stumbling-block in the way of their Christian
Brethren;</hi> and infallibly to involve those that
so do, in that <hi>dreadfull wo</hi> pronounc't by our
Blessed Saviour in the Text cited.</p>
               <p>But has this Answerer the vanity to think,
his Illogical and undue Inferences; false sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40679:95"/>
Impertinent and Ridiculous Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;

Law and Justice can inflict, upon them.</p>
               <p>'Tis very much, That notwithstanding all,
so Learned and Judicious a <hi>Person hath written
in the Churches vindication; any should yet reply,
the Ecclesiastical Laws and Constitutions do little

<hi>That it is far better to live where nothing is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

such a reflection on the Government, as those
Queries, with all their Sedition, shall, I hope,
never be found guilty of. But what may be the
instance of ill Government which is here so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
reflected on? it will, upon inquiry, be
found to be no other; Than His Majesties late
gracious Declaration of Indulgence to Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in Religion; the which, though it secur'd
to the Church all its Rights Priviledges, and
Emoluments, was yet so intolerable to some
Church-men; in restraining them only from,
falling upon and ruining their poor, peaceable
and pious Neighbours, that none have more,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40679:95"/>
and few, I think<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> so much reflected on Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as some of them have thereon done; an
evident demonstration what Loyal and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Subjects they would quickly be, should
Authority deal with them, as it hath done
with some others: for who would not be
Loyal, to kind and bountiful Masters? Wolves
and Tygers are so to those who feed and favour
them: But they only are to be accounted Loyal
Subjects, who are so for Conscience-sake, to
severe and froward Governours; as well as to
the kind and courteous; and not as their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
but as Gods Ministers; which is a
Loyalty, few of these Loyalists can boast of.</p>
               <p>But he again tells us, <hi>The Scripture compares
the Church to an Army,</hi> which it does, for terror;
but not for being alike Officer'd: <hi>And for an
Army,</hi> says he, <hi>to be left to its own Liberty; and
every common Souldier to observe no Order, nor
live under any Discipline, is the ready way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it as a prey to the first Invader;</hi> It is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
who is it, therefore that <hi>would have no
common Souldier, observe any Order, nor live
under any Discipline?</hi> Not they certainly, who
would have both the Officers and Souldiers of
this Army, to observe all the Orders of the
Chief Commander; the Officers in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as well as Souldiers in obeying, which
will be found to be the Order and Discipline,
that ought to be observ'd.</p>
               <p>But this Answerer tells us, <hi>The little good
that is done by the Laws of this Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
proceeds either from the want of their due
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40679:96"/>
Execution</hi> (which is still a reflection on the
Government; as is, his elsewhere saying, <hi>The
vigorous Execution of one Law, would do more
good than a Million of Proclamations,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>or from
the indisposition of those Persons, who expect Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
from Laws, without paying any Reverence
or Obedience to them, &amp;c.</hi> 'Twas never denyed,
but that in Civil and Secular Affairs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
Force and Compulsion, is and must be
us'd; or there can be no Rule or Government
amongst men: But in the Concerns of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
abstracted from secular Interests and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
it is otherwise; men are therein to
be gain'd and Govern'd, by perswasion and
conviction only; Religion cannot be impos'd;
nor is any thing more absur'd, than to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to promote the Truths of the Gospel,
contrary to the Laws of the Gospel; <hi>Virga

tells us, <hi>There is a way of bringing every thought

weapons whereby that Victory is atcheived are
not Carnal; which is, indeed, the cause of the
little good that is therein done by Civil and
Ecclesiastical Laws. This Answerer may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
very well ask, <hi>What effect Ecclesiastical Laws
can have upon Atheists and Infidels;</hi> all the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Laws in the world, Seconded and

Hypocrities, or dissembling Professors, they
may, indeed make, but can never make one

concerning Religion, have ever respected
more the Civil Peace and Interests of Kingdoms
and Commonwealths, (That under pretence of
Religion, the Rights of Princes, and Liberty
of the People, be not invaded or injur'd) then
the Truths of the Gospel, which are not by
those means or Methods, to be preserved or

speaking of penal Laws against Papists, tells
them;<note place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>'Tis not against their Opinions of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
or Transubstantiation, though errors; but
against their owning the personal Authority of the
Pope, within His Majesties Dominions, as danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the State, that those Laws are provided,
disclaming therefore of that, they should find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at great ease.</hi> And it was the great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Chief Ministers of State</hi> in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi>
Reign,<note place="margin">As appears by the jeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses written to that purpose by their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> to satisfie the world, that none
ever suffer'd in <hi>England</hi> for Religion, but for
Treason or Treasonable practices, under colour
or pretence of Religion. Nor can we believe
some late Laws concerning Religion were ever
intended to molest or punish any for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of any truly Religious duty; but of such
only as under pretence thereof, met to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
Insurrections and Rebellions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
became dangerous to the State; and such cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
of all men, ought to be the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
dealt with, as well for their Hypocrisie,
and abuse of Religion, as for such their disloyal
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40679:97"/>
practices: For none, sure, can imagine His
Majesty would ever have indulg'd Dissenters
the Exercise of their Religion, had it been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that the Laws had provided, and not
rather against the danger that might from some
meetings have accrued to the publick; the
preservation of the publick peace, being the
ground both of those Laws, and likewise of His
Majesties Declaration of indulgence, upon the
difference of times, and circumstances of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
as is evident from the praeamb'es of those
Statutes; and His Majesties gracious Answer of
the 24th of <hi>February</hi> 1672, to the Petition and
Address of the House of Commons, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,</p>
               <p>C. R.</p>
               <p>His Majesty hath received an Address from
you, which he hath seriously consider'd of, and
returneth you this Answer, That he is much
troubled, That that Declaration, which he put
out for ends so necessary to the <hi>Quiet</hi> of the
Kingdom; and especially in that conjuncture;
should have proved the cause of disquiet to
the House of Commons; and have given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to question his Power in Ecclesiasticks;
which he finds not done in the Reign of any of
his Ancestors. And he is sure he never had
thoughts of using it otherwise, than as it has
been intrusted in him to the <hi>Peace</hi> and estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishment
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to
the ease of all his Subjects in general. Neither
doth he pretend to the right of suspending Laws
wherein the Properties, Rights, or Liberties
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40679:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his Subjects are concerned; nor to alter any
thing in the Established Doctrine or Discipline
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The only design of this was, to take off the
penalties the Statutes inflicted upon Dissenters;
and which he believes, when well consider'd of
you, <hi>Your selves would not wish Executed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Rigour and Leter of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither hath he done this with thought of
avoiding or precluding the advice of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
And if any Bill shall be offer'd him
which shall appear more proper to attain the
aforesaid ends, and secure the <hi>Peace</hi> of the
Church and Kingdom, when tender'd in due
manner to him, he will shew how ready he
will be to concur in all wayes, that shall appear
good for the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>How expressive of Royal goodness, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Benignity and Compassion towards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
is this gracious Answer; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but endare His Majesty unto all sober and
Pious Persons, of what Judgement or perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
soever in Religion. Nor were the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
against the Indulgenee, but the way and
manner of it; in that they immediately upon
this pes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a Bill of ease for Protestant Dissenters,
which was sent up to the Lords; But the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
that after happen'd between the two
Houses about Jurisdiction and Priviledge, with
other greater Affairs of State, hath hitherto
obstructed its farther progress.</p>
               <p>But to return to our Answerer, who tells
us, <hi>That to repeal the Churches Laws, would
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40679:98"/>
administer too just an occasion to the Papists, to
triumph in the ruine of it: for what Truth or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
saith he, <hi>could that Church pretend to, That
had neither Ephod nor Traphim; no Order, no
Law, no Liturgy, no Bishop, no Discipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It seems then, in his Judgement, all these in
the Chnrch of <hi>England</hi> depend wholly upon
the Ecclesiastical Laws; although the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church, in, and after, the Apostles time,
had both <hi>Order, Law, Discipline, Bishops or
Overseers,</hi> without other Laws, than what
were Divine, or of Apostolical Institution: <hi>Though
I am absent in the flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>yet am I with you in the
Spirit, joying and beholding your Order, &amp;c.</hi>
saith the Apostle to the <hi>Colossians.</hi> And is not
the good word of God, a Law to all Believers?
But this <hi>Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 7. 26.</note> it seems, <hi>is perished from our Priest:</hi>
who yet, we hope, will not deny the Holy
Ghost a Power, without the aid of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Laws, of making Bishops or Overseers,
over the Churches of Christs Institution; and
such, certainly, are not without Discipline;
nor deprived of <hi>Law, Order, or Overseers;</hi> nor
consequently of <hi>Truth or Being;</hi> upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
of Ecclesiastical, or the Churches Laws.
Yea, God forbid, the Christian Church should
depend upon the continuance or alteration of
these or those Civil or Ecclesiastical Laws;
which we see chang'd and alter'd, as oft almost,
as we change our Governours, which is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<hi>a consideration that ought seriously to be
thought on, by all the lovers of Religion;</hi> and who
have any regard or concern, for the Truths

               <p>
                  <hi>But says this Answerer,</hi> we have now unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
Arguments to justifie our departure from
<hi>Rome,</hi> but if all our Laws and constitutions be
laid aside and abrogated; we should be just like

               <p>If then our Laws and Constitutions, be our
only unanswerable Arguments to justifie our
departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> and our only Swords
and Spears, to fight against those Adversaries
an abrogation or change of those Laws, and
Constitutions would, indeed, disarm, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
us; and might as well justifie our return
to <hi>Rome,</hi> as now our departure from it: But I
trust, though this be <hi>Rati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

less to direct his Governours, &amp;c. <hi>Yet he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
them</hi> to stand up in a zealous vindication of

Power and Authority, with which be entrusts them,
and which they have betrayed and exposed to scorn
and insolence of his and their greatest Enemies.
<hi>Yea, tells them,</hi> Histories are not barren of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
how God hath revealed his wrath from
Heaven against those Governours, and deprived
them of the Honour of being his Deputies, when
their Spirits have been softned with sensuality and
ease, and they have lived in fear of their Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
who ought to live in fear of them. <hi>Which
is such a menace of, and reflection on Authority,
and our Governours; as none but this Bold and
Insolent Answerer, would ever have dar'd to
publish. He does well, therefore, to recollect
himself, and tell us,</hi> He has proceeded too far on
this Argument; <hi>which indeed, speaks him</hi> a
Person so highly impudent and immeasurably ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions,
that <hi>(as himself hath elsewhere said)</hi> he
is fitter to receive a confutation from the penalties
of Laws, and the Seutence of a Judge, than from
the Strength of Reason or Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he concludes in the words of, indeed, a
