            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

nobleman) I imagined many deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly
bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to offer to his name, signes of loue
and duty in a high measure, which I now find
contrary: Schollers I see (in these euill dayes)
giue no luster to Nobillity, but neclegently
suffer their renownes to consume with
their bodies, the pens of long lasting poesie,
writes not in times fore-head, vertues records
to posterity, but carelesly giues way to enuy

a taske more befitting a most excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,
but the reason of this my bold aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is, because I see the Muses lippes lockt
vp, and all loath to enter into the discription
of his honorable liues pilgrimage: be as it bee
will, I stand patiently armed against the biting

care added to industrious trauells is able to

the deceased begot this boldnesse, therefore
for his sake (whom you honored in life time)
daine to affoord one cheerefull countenance
to my humble affection, for I stand like poore
blind <hi>Irus</hi> before the worlds lottery, casting in
my lots either of good or euill fortune, where
if I chance to light but vpon any reasonable
prize of good liking, I haue my desire, but if
<pb facs="tcp:19966:3"/>
all happen blankes, I depart ouer-loaden with
burthens of discontent to my rustick cell, and
their pining lye consum'd away in penance
for this my presumption: so in duty I kisse
my hand, and humbly take my leaue.</p>

            <p>IF in the depth of my intyre affection, long borne
to the honored house of the <hi>Cecils,</hi> I take vpon me
plainely to set downe, according to my simple vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
the honorable augmented dignities of
the late deceased Earle of Salisbury, and therin offend
some peremtory censurers, I lay the fault vpon my
presuming loue, and make it my priuiledge of excuse.
The temporizing world (I know) full of enuy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
&amp; vnkindnesse, hath nursed vp fame-killing
falshood (the greatest enemy to naked truth) (not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lewing
true worth) clamerously to wrong this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertfull
statist, by detracting from his honor, times
applauding graces, a cankering deisease (after death)
subiect to greatnesse: but let blacke mouthed enuy be
of a more fauorable carriage, for inocent truth before
the worlds broad eye stands combatant, and will asu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
defend, his honorable deseruings from his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
disparrages, Fame I see stands ready prest to giue
the world notice of his worlds late aduancements,
first, he had a time, a happy time, I may say, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
in his prime of youth, won him a multitude of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
friends, to continew to his age: for beeing
(euen but in the bloome) of a vertuous inclination,
he so tyed his Princes affection to his succeeding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
that hee obtayned by instruction of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Lord <hi>William Burleigh</hi> the perfect rules of a
well gouerned Statist. Now heare to make a short
florish how by degrees hee climbed to the top of all
these his high dignified titles and places of honour,
he thus fortunatly proceeded: first vnto the age of six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeares, he was onely tutord vnder his father and
in his fathers house, without any other education: at
<pb facs="tcp:19966:4"/>
which time of his age, by his virtuous mothers will
and free guift, of thirty pounds yearely giuen to a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in Cambridge, he was sent in person to carry it,
and be the presentor of the same him-selfe, where at
that young age he commenced, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of schooles, and was made maister of Art, after
this, in short time, by the fauour of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
hee was in the presence of the state royall, created
Knight at Theobalds, and immediatly to his greater
aduancements, in the yeare of our Lord. 1588.
hee was sent ouer into France to accompany our
then English Ambassador, <hi>Henry</hi> the great Earle of
Darby, a grace fitting so noble a spirit as he was like
to be, Englands buisinesse there ended, hee returned
and in short time after, merited by his wel deseruing
indeuours, many court honours, as vnder Secretary to
Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> then principal Secretary of Estate,
then one of the Queenes Maiesties most honorable
priuy Councell, these dignified places, in the eye of
his honored father, were put vnto his charge, which
hee so wisely caried, that hee obtained euen the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
grace of the multitude, in which authorities he
bore himselfe in the worlds equall balance, till the
death of his father, and then it pleased his gratious
Mistresse Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to bestow vpon him the
office of the Maister of Wards and liueries, which hee
inioyed with the rest, till the death of his said Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne:
but our now royall King, comming to this
his Imperiall kingdome, and looking into the worth
of this man, weakned not any of these his aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but added more strength to the same, by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him, first, a Barron, next a Vicecount, then an
<pb facs="tcp:19966:5"/>
Earle, then Knight of the honorable order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
one of the Councell of Estate, and lastly Lord
High treasurer of England, the greatnesse of which
places, planted His renowne in the feelds of succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
times. I must not ouerpasse his Chancellorship
of the Vniuersity of Cambridge, that nurse of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decking
schollors, whose learned pens might let the
world know all his fame worthy actions, but time I
see proues vngratefull, and would haue his memory
buryed in forgetfulnesse. Awake sluggish muses, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake!
In his life might thousands of noble obiects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
wherein your noble spirits might towre high:
It is a task onely fitting rare pens, and not for me, the
worst of many thousands, to giue him that immortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which the basenesse of this worthlesse time will
hardly afford, honour him, kind schollers, with some
sonnets that liuing honored you, and cause him to
liue, in dispight of repining fate, This is the richest
Epithite my loue can bestow vpon him, he was borne
honorable, experience made him wise, educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and these were his honors, yet his cares were
great to maintaine them. He alwaies tooke nerest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his fauours such as were best aquainted with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
secrets, I am loath to be long in my induction,
least you grow weary, therefore I heare make my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
Wishing you to be contented, with my willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to please.</p>

tempered with wisdome, promised succesfull honor, for
hauing attained scarce to the yeares of man, and newly
<pb facs="tcp:19966:6"/>
entred into the world but his quality drew him into the
knowledge of the world, his noble towardnesse begot him
estimation and that estimation extended into the assured
hope of succéeding greatnesse: for by a secret instinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
helpt by continuall practise, taken from the councell of
his Father, became so ready and apt in state imploiments,
that he séemed to be like fish in the sea, <hi>in propper place:</hi> by
which meanes, his wise-regarding Princesse Quéene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
in her time, and in his Fathers dayes gaue him
the first step to aduancement, made him her principall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie,
and a Counceller of estate, a burthen of high
charge, but eased with the swéet imbracements of dignity:
Béeing setled in this his first honorable place, his opinion
began to haue some scope and liberty, and by the generall
consent of the wisest States-men, obserued conuenient
for this calling and office, in the managing of publick bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses,
which was not dispatched without much care
and contemplatiue study: but héere marke the protection
of heauen ouer this man, whose forward spring had béene
mixt with times biting malice, had not an equality in carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
guided him, for in his first grace he was not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
of his fathers helpe by death, which was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducter
of his nature and fortunes, but also lost his deare
and gratious Mistresse Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in whose life
consisted all his honors and earths happinesse. Those two
great losses had béene sufficient euen to haue curbd the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse
of all these his noble preferments, by the deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

(euen then) whetted to make hauock of all his fortunes,
here was his wisdom tride vpon the tutch, the world &amp; time
grew vnconstant, began to pick quarrels, misdeemd honest
actions, and inuented false informations, yet was his
cares so watchfull, that he saued himselfe from the subti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
snare of secret enuy.</p>
            <p>At this time the good Phisition, and saluer of all sores,
our most gracious and prudent King possessing his royall
rights, the whole state of England, and the gouernment
<pb facs="tcp:19966:7"/>
thereof, came to this his owne Kingdome with such mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence,
as all Christendome admired if, here being setled
with peace to the great ioy of vs all, with his cléere and
pure shining iudgement, he qualified all occasions of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
seuering drosse from pure gold, sollid pearles from
liquid hailestones, manacles from bracelets, businesses of
trouble, from imployments of honor, and like a perfect
Phisition applied precious salues to euery sore of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth, adding honor vppon honour according to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
and calling: Amongst many others in the ranke of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
graced by time and fortune, this late deceased Earle
of Salisbury, by his wise carriage and honorable accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments,
(which here we omit) begot such an entier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and inducing opinion of worth in the Kings regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
mind, that his honors of estate, by degrées came to the
height, first (not disparaging his former graces giuen by
Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (but adding more luster to his bright
spreading fortunes) it pleased the Kings Maiesty, whose
wise and gentle disposition is to aduance the desertfull,
first to giue him the honorable title of a Uiscount, then of an
Earle, with many other promotions and offices of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and charge, of the which he returned contentfull sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to his King and his contry, and likewise being
a councellor of estate to his highnesse, attending neere his
royall person, offered vp his hearts trust in professed and
true loyalty, as the secrets of many court businesses can
verifie: processe of time, and his highnesse fauour, lifted him
higher in his contries graces, for at last he was created
Knight of the honorable order of the Garter, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
greatnesse was made Lord high Treasurer of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
an Office of Estate answerable to his ingenious
iudgment.</p>
            <p>It was the Lord which gouernd all those his actions, &amp; stil
instructed his mind in the right way of preferment, it was
the Lord that plast him in authority, in these honored offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to do right vnto all men without respect of persons,
<pb facs="tcp:19966:7"/>
which waighty burthens thus laid vppon him, he careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discharged, and with great wisedome dispatched all
state businesses put vnto him, to the great ease of his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
soueraigne, and comfort of his contry: he still remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
what he was, wher he was, &amp; what he should come to
be, &amp; hauing a continuall care of his high establisht honors,
with the eyes of wisdome he gouerned his family, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
about him, where if hee saw sheltred vnder his
wing any deceitfull Parasite, any male-contented mute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
any murmuring whisperer, any infringer of honesty,
ambitious oppressor, or vnmercifull briber: if hee found
any such about him, he swept them away like Cob-webs,
because they were consuming cankers to his honours,
bloud-suckers of his estate, and betrayers of his prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
            <p>Thus purging his house of these pestiferous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uilr, hee
intertained men of truth, and placed about him such in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
as feared God and loued the King: Oh thou mirror
to succéeding times, thou hast left thy well gouerned qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
an example to posterity, and a neuer decaying orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all thy off-spring: But againe to our purpose: ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
was his lifes guide, and in his brest both Artes and
law reposed, all his chiefest and principall indeuors were
exercised in such actions, as aduanced the glory of Gods
truth, the peace, the quiet, and the prosperity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and surely, that Nobleman, thus affected to

good estimation, grace and fauour with all men, as well
Prince and Péeres, as the common sort of people.</p>
            <p>In like sort, this ground-worke of our subiect, I
meane, this deceased Councellor of estate, fixed his whole
resolution in the like purchase, vsing no indirect meanes,
but confined himselfe within the bounds of reason and
wisdom, from the which hee did not start nor stray, either
for the loue of his owne priuate profit or pleasure, nor for
the feare of purchasing any other subiects displeasure, hee

neuer vsed sinister meanes, to wring and wrest away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

at that dreadfull hower feared not death: the memory of
death had no bitternesse; no disquietnesse troubled his mind,
he gréeued not to leaue his beautifull buildings, his rich
and curious Architectures, his faire alurements and his
many pleasures, his courtlike traines, gallant attendants
and bare-headed petitioners. It was no sorrow to his
heart to depart, and leaue them all behind, neither feared
he the voyce of the world, mixed with scandall, which still
makes misconstrued suppositions of great mens liues,
the which commonly they are taxed with, but his pure
white innocency dreaded not this putrifiing canker that
créepes about the tombes of Nobility: reason and nature
told him he must néeds goe, and appeare before that great
King of all Kings, and receaue the reward of his liues pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages

liues-sunne, being ouer-shaddowed with the Sable clouds
of Death. When vpon this mouldy stage of the Earth, he
acted the last part of his life before the eyes of the world;
his departing-iesture moued sad compassion, his words
seasoned with deadly sighes, bathed the hearers chéekes
with distilling teares, making confession of his secret sins,
calling for helpe of prayer, and like a hungar-starued Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim,

            <head>The funeral of the said Earle of
Salisbury holden at Hatfield in June
last, is heere described in a short for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
proceeding order.</head>
            <p>BEing at Hatfield in Hartfordshire in Iune last,
my eye presented to my heart, the worlds last
farewell giuen to the right honorable the late
Earle of Salsbury, A due, that blood, consanguinity,
and affinity customably bestowes vpon the deceased,
the sight whereof settled within me many priuate
sorrowes for the losse of so great a subiect, whose late
liuing honors carried such a sway in his contry, that
in a sad passion it made me accuse deathes partiallity,
in taking of his life, but smothering griefe for a time
in silence, I stood amazedly beholding a traine of
noble personages, in sable habits trayling on the
ground, witnesses, and presenters of Englands hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse,
for so general a losse: black cloudy garments
outwardly equalized their inward sorrowes, and this
following (as neere as I can remember) was the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the mourning passengers.</p>
            <p>First, diuers Marshalls to make roome,</p>
            <p>Next certaine poore men and woemen.</p>
            <p>Then seruants of Gentlemen, Esquires &amp; Knights.</p>
            <p>Then Standerd-bearers with banners of armes.</p>
            <p>Then messengers of the Chamber.</p>
            <p>Then some of the Kings Maiesties groomes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:19966:15"/>
            <p>Then Noblemens seruants.</p>
            <p>After them diuerss officers of the Court,</p>
            <p>Then Heralds of Armes with other Ensignes of
honor.</p>
            <p>Then followed my Lords owne seruants,</p>
            <p>Then Knightes and Gentlemen his retainers,</p>
            <p>Then the Kings Solicitor, Councell, and Atturney
generall.</p>
            <p>Then Barrons of the law with some Iudges.</p>
            <p>Then the sonns of Noble men and Earles.</p>
            <p>Then Lord Barons allied to this deceased Earle,</p>
            <p>Then Earles of his affinity and Kindred.</p>
            <p>Then principall Herralds with Banners of his coat
of armes.</p>
            <p>Then his Hearse couered with black veluet, his
Helme and Crest with diuers Scutchions belonging
to his honorable house.</p>
            <p>Then after the Hearse as principall mourner the
Right honorable <hi>William</hi> now Earle of Salisbury the
only sonne to the deceased noble-man.</p>
            <p>Being thus with honor carried to his graue, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the greatnesse of his estate, how much fauored
of his prince, esteemed of his equalls, and beloued of
his followers. Time, out of my remembrance, can
neuer put away his high worth, whom I will honor
the longest day of my life, and in the closet of my
heart place his perfections to my priuate considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and now to make a conclusion of all these my
loues labours, (as duty binds me) I end.</p>
