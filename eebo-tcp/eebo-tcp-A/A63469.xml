         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigg,</hi> Col. <hi>Morley,</hi> and Col. <hi>Walton,</hi> Commiſſioners
of the Army by Act of PARLIAMENT, for the
Governing the Armys of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

            </opener>
            <p>SInce the ſad and wofull day, when your ſelf (that the Parliament ſo much
truſted and beleived) brought their own forces and beſieged the Houſe,
we have been ſilent: The Act was ſo horrid it could not but amaze, to
our beſt underſtandings, we obſerving your ſteps ever ſince, it appeares;
That your wayes are not the Nations ſettlement, but that confuſion and the
greateſt of miſeries and ſorrows will unavoydably overflow theſe Iſlands; And
we are thereby made a ſhame and reproach, not only at home but throughout
the Chriſtian World where <hi>England</hi> is named.</p>
            <p>We are told we ſhalI have our Liberties, How can that be? when the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all our Liberties is in the Parliament, that being the Repreſentative
of the people, in whom is the Originall of all juſt Power. And is not the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
the Foundation of ſucceſſive Parliaments deſtroyed, ſo farr as you can
do it; can you imagine that we and many thouſands that have hazarded our
lives, and ſpilt our blood for our Libertyes and Religion, will now yeild up the
Cauſe ſo long and ſharply contended for, and that God ſo miraculouſly owned;
And ſuffer Parliaments to be impoſed upon, and the people to be compell'd to
Governments, not made by their own Repreſentatives in Parliament; Doth
not God command that one ſhould do to another as he would be done unto?
Is not this a General Command given to all mankind? Wo therefore to Kings
and every other perſon that aſſume power over man, and walk not according
to that Scripture Rule; can you oppreſs, can you impoſe, can you reſtraine
Liberty, can you take away propriety, and above all, can you overthrow your
Governours and deſtroy <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and not break this rule; Is not the
Cauſe we contended for, the enjoyment of our Liberties and Religion; We
are ſure God would have man to be free and not oppreſſed; we only deſire the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56527:3"/>
maintenance of our <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> which our gracious God ſo ſignally owned,
when our potent Enemies at Sea, and at the ſame time thoſe in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <hi>Ireland</hi> roſe up to oppoſe; where is the humble ſelf-denying Spirit
to be found? We have moſt ſeriouſly conſidered the great truſt repoſed in us
by the Parliament, and deſire to find out what is the duty incumbent upon us,
And we cannot ſatisfie our ſelves, but that we are juſtly by Parliament, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be queſtioned, but cenſured; If we own not the <hi>Parliament</hi> in this time
of ſo great defection, and endeavour not now to our utmoſt the preſervation
of it: The great and good God by his providence brought us moſt ſeaſonably to
this Towne, where we found Captaine <hi>Browne</hi> (ſent down by you) endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to withdraw the Officers of this Garriſon from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> perſwading
them to betray and falſifie their truſt, and to Act contrary to their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
When a perſon becomes falſe, it follows he would have all others like
himſelf, we heare he brought ſeverall Commiſſions of yours, we cannot but
trouble you in this particular, do you think it a light matter to murther men?
Hath not God given man power over the lives of all other Creatures, and only
reſerved the life of man to himſelf, Sacred Writt holds it forth, <hi>That he that
ſpils mans blood, by men ſhall his blood be ſpilt;</hi> From whom comes your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to give Commiſſions to kill men? it is not to be found in Scripture, If it
came from man, we wiſh it could be made clear to the world and your own
Conſcience, that you have a lawfull Authority; could you gaine all the power
and wealth of theſe Nations, it would do you but little good if thouſands mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by your Commiſſions, riſe up at the day of Judgment againſt you: We
have no particular ends of our own that we aime at, we only deſire the reſtoring
of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the ſpeedy ſettlement of the Commonwealth; ſo that
we may enjoy our Religion, Liberties, and properties; Here lies in this Port
many Ships not paid off, which is great expence to the publick; And had not
the <hi>Parliament</hi> been lately interrupted by you, they had not been now to pay;
The Marriners are ready to goe to Forraign parts for imployment, having ſpent
their Arreares in attendance, and are not able to expect longer. Thus the
great debt of the Nation increaſeth. The Spring of the year approaches; Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Enemies from abroad threaten us, there is nothing but Confuſion and
general diſcontent at home; If you take not ſome ſpeedy courſe to give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to thoſe that have been, and we hope yet may be your Friends, it will be
too late, and deſtruction muſt needs follow; we wiſh if miſery do come, that
thoſe who ſtated this our Cauſe deſtroying quarrell, upon perſonall accompts,
may only feel it. And that our mercifull God will find out ſome extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
waies to preſerve our Liberties and Religion to poſterity: We think fit to
acquaint you that we find this Garriſon of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> very faithfull to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
and reſolved to performe their dutyes and truſts according to their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56527:3"/>
Commiſſions, we incourage them what we can, and we hope your Lordſhips
may do the like; And we ſhall be ready to aſſiſt you in any thing, wherein we
are equally intruſted by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> we hope that infinite Wiſdome and
power will yet ſo order our affairs that the <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> ſhall be preſerved;
The Declarations of Generall <hi>Monck</hi> are both ſober and Religious; We own
them, and exceedingly rejoyce in his faithfullneſs and conſtancy to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
He is a Souldier of true honour and worth, and abhorrs falſneſs to his
truſt; We and all well affected to the Nations Libertyes have cauſe to bleſs

               <salute>Honorable Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN Anſwer unto yours from <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> I ſhall exerciſe that Freedome,
which I hope the preſent ſtate of our Affairs will give me liberty to do; You
are pleaſed to charge me with a Horrible and Amazing Act, in my breach of
Truſt, and why you ſhould accuſe me who are ſo guilty your ſelves, I do not
know, unleſs by your Accuſation you think your ſelves freed from that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and truſt that was put in you, That you would make good your word,
which I muſt ſay, ſome of you have ſadly forfeited; engaging ſo ſolemnly as you
have done, and yet being in that Hoſtile manner in the place where you now are;
I will not take your courſe by excuſing my ſelf, further to aggravate your
crime; But in ſhort, Anſwer that for my breach of Truſt, you well know through
ſome of your means, That truſt the <hi>Parliament</hi> was pleaſed to deliver me from,
and quit me of that Confidence, which they had been pleaſed to favour me with,
which I muſt needs ſay, did deliver me from a great exerciſe of trouble, which
otherwiſe I ſhould have been under, had their truſt continued in me; VVho
they were, that were Inſtruments to take the Parliaments good opinion from
me? you well know, I ſerved them faithfully, and as for what you charge me
with, deſtroying Parliamentary Authority; I deſire the Lord may give you
hearts to conſider how much you have been inſtrumentall therein, and how ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
your own Actions did put the Army upon doing ſuch things, which I know
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56527:4"/>
were grievous to their thoughts to be neceſſitated unto. The memory of
that <hi>Parliament,</hi> in what God did make uſe of them as inſtruments, I hope I
ſhall alwaies own and Honour, and were all our actions weighed in a due Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
from the firſt time of their laſt Sitting, to their Riſing; I doubt not but I
ſhall appear to be a more Innocent perſon, and even more faithfull to them,
then by ſome of your actions it will appear you are. I delight not in changes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
It is neither my Principle nor Intereſt; The Government of <hi>Parliaments</hi> is
that I own and Honour; And though my ſteps you mention may be diſpleaſing
to your ſelves, yet I hope the Lord will not leave me ſo without His preſence,
but to manifeſt I deſigne nothing of ſelf Intereſt, but the good of theſe poor
Nations, and the Intereſts of the people of the Lord, and the Liberties of men
(as men might be preſerved) But how eaſily is your Rule, <hi>(To do to another, as
one would be done to,)</hi> broken by your ſelves, and yet directed to be obſerved by
others; And therefore as to that of impoſing upon <hi>Parliaments,</hi> who has more,
had a hand in things of that Nature, then ſome of your ſelves; I delight not in
words of Provocation; but for Oppreſſion, Impoſing, Reſtraining Liberty, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away Property, and Advizing and Abetting to the Overthrowing of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Authority which you urge; I beſeech you give me leave to uſe
the words of Freedom, who hath had a hand in things of that Nature, more
you or my ſelf. Indeed I can truly ſay, the thoughts of doing any thing of that
ſort, or what may lead thereunto at any time is that which I dare not give way
unto, not for fear of diſpleaſing men only, but becauſe I know ſuch actions
will be judged and condemned of the Lord; And wherein I have in anything
been guilty upon any of thoſe accounts, I deſire to take the ſhame thereof to
my ſelf; I would be loath to be found a wilfull Tranſgreſſor therein, the
thoughts thereof are with abhorrancy to my ſelf; I have no Intereſt of my own
to mind; I had rather be in a Corner, then in the Station where I am, and if
my ſilence and Retirement might but ſave this Cauſe, it would be the cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt
work that ever I did engage in, and as by your Letter, it ſeems you judge
me the great troubler of our Peace; If I be ſo, My deſires to the Lord are to
Convince me thereof, and to make a way for my ſilence, rather then continue
me in a Condition to trouble theſe poor Nations; But alas! how little is your
actions conſidered by you in order to this thing? What can it tend unto, but
only to give a further encouragement to our Common Enemy to endeavour
the deſtruction of the whole. I know you are perſons of Intereſt, and I ſpeak
it not therefore with reflections upon your own Merrits; But give me leave
to tell you that I am confident, in the way you are in, you will be Blaſted, and
only give the Advantage to thoſe who would deſtroy both the Parliament and
their Friends; ſo far will you be from reſtoring the Parliament that your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will lead (if the Lord prevent not) to the deſtruction of Parliamentary Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56527:4"/>
As to your Authority I will only ſay this: I am confident the Parliament
never intended you ſhould make uſe of any of their forces againſt the reſt; And
the truth is, I beleive it will be found you are miſtaken in your Commiſsion:
for you have only that Power which I had as Lieutenant General, and not as
Commanders in cheif. And what Authority I had to Command the Forces
was by vertue of my Authority as Commander in Chief, and not as Lieutenant
General; Beſides I had no Power to Levy Forces, but to Command thoſe
which were raiſed, and I am ſure you have no greater power given to you then I
had: When yet you extend your Authority to the Levying of new Forces,
which I dare confidently ſay you cannot juſtifie by that Commiſſion; As for
my Authority of granting of Commiſſions, I have the call of all the Forces in
<hi>England,</hi> except where you are; which I hope I ſhall not ſo mannage, but that
either the Power I have may be confirmed by a Supream Authority, or diſpoſed
of to a fitter perſon then I am, to which I ſhall readily yeild obedience. Your
words are very ſevere, calling me little better then a Murtherer. Its well
known I have as little practiſed ſeverity as any Perſon that hath borne Armes:
And to be looked upon as a perſon greedy to ſhed blood, I have a Conſcience
otherwiſe exerciſed, and wiſh that may not be laid to your charge which you
do readily apply to me. As to Marriners which you take notice of, that they
ſpend the States money as not being paid off their Arreares; They may thank
you that they are not paid, for it is well known there was money aſſigned for
them, and would have been with them before this time, had not you interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the peace of that Town where you are: And as ſoon as you return to your
former Peaceableneſs and Friendſhip the Marriners ſhall certainly be paid. If
you have nothing in deſigne but the good of this Cauſe, I hope what we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may give you ſatiſfaction, and if you are in the Capacity of Friends, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
you have been, your advice would be hearkened unto in any thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we might be ſatisfied that the good of this Cauſe might be preſerved thereby.
As for General <hi>Monck,</hi> your good Opinion of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I hope he will make good
by his ſpeedy Agreement with us; A return of which I expect to have by the
next: The Lord perſwade your hearts to reſolutions of peace, and that theſe

which is of great concernment to the City and Publick; The Governour and
this Garriſon have declared their faithfulneſs to the Parliament, there are many
Ships not paid off, and Marriners ready for want of pay to go into Forreign parts

            <p>WE ſhall not trouble you with any tedious reply to your Letter, but this
we muſt affirm That neither joyntly nor ſeperately did we or any of us,
either to your ſelf or any other perſon, paſſe our Engagements, to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

we ſhould readily have vindicated our ſelves: Neither did we endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the <hi>Parliaments</hi> good opinion from you, though we well perceived your
coldneſs in their ſervice, elſe the Paper ſent from the Northern Brigade, had
never produced the ſad conſequences that ſince have enſued; And if it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
your Conſcience, to act as one of the ſeven Commiſsionets appointed by
Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> to govern the Army, we marvel with what ſatisfaction you can
now act by the Call of private men, without any publick Authority; and yet
pretend you deſire retyrement: Whether you have not been inſtrumental to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56527:6"/>
deſtroy the <hi>Parliamentary</hi> Authority, and how farr we have been inſtrumentall to
any ſuch ends, we leave it to the Lord and all indifferent men to judge; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall we diſpute the neceſſity that induced the Officers to interrupt the

otherwiſe; It is an eaſie matter to pretend to good things for the Nation, <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>

taking away property, Governments and Authority, we ſhall only ſay, That
whoſoever takes away our <hi>Parliaments,</hi> takes the ready courſe to let them all in
like a floud upon us; neither do we think the Council of Officers competent per
ſons to Judg of Government, and to break <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and put new fancies of

no conteſt, we waited two Moneths, aud nothing was brought forth but
confuſion; We believe the Common enemy may gain great advantage by our

providences of God working contrary to your expectation, and the wonderful

bleſſe God for it. VVe hear Vice-Admiral <hi>Lawſon</hi> declares for the reſtoring
