         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For the deſcription of <hi>good courage,</hi> you may take it thus:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>Good courage</hi> is that gracious diſpoſition of heart, whereby a man being called by God unto any ſervice, doth adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon difficulties either in doing good, or enduring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and that without feare.</p>
            <p>Here are four or five things conſiderable in this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: firſt, <hi>good courage</hi> is a gracious diſpoſition. There is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a morall boldneſſe, and a naturall audacity, and this is not good courage, for the former is in Heathens, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in bruit beaſts, <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes the horſe after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>he ruſheth into the Battell, he laughs at the Trumpet, and his neck is cloathed with thunder,</hi> Job. 39.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55101:4"/>
they were in the field, he ſingles him from all the reſt, bids them go on with their game, he had ſomething to ſpeak to him alone; ſayth he, <hi>I hear you are underhand working of my death; if you put poiſon into my cup, a woman may do that; if you ſet upon me with a company of Raſcalls, Theeves may do that; if you will put me to death, do it as a Souldier, I will take my ſword, take you yours, we will fight it out:</hi> the man fell down before him, and the King par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him, and gained him ever after to be his owne. This was true courage, but a fiery cruell diſpoſition is no <hi>good courage,</hi> courage is a gracious diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a gracious diſpoſition of heart; The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> heart properly is the naturall element of courage; and therefore ſome do derive the word courage ſo, <hi>courage quaſi cor agit,</hi> it is an action or motion of the heart. The truth is, the heart of man is the Artillery-yard, where all the thoughts of courage train continually.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſay, whereby a man being called by God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> unto any ſervice. Gods call is the ground of a Chriſtians courage. This was pretended in <hi>Rabſhekahs</hi> ſpeech, <hi>hath not the Lord ſent me?</hi> and this was in truth the ground of <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> courage. <hi>Be of good courage have not I commanded thee?</hi> If a man ventures upon any deſign, and Gods call doth not lead him to it, when he comes to make good his ſtanding, the ground quakes under him, his heart trembles, his knees knock, his arms ſhake, and his heeles begin to run: When a man is called to do a worke by God, though the oppoſition and difficulty be never ſo great, he may encourage himſelfe here, but I am called by God, and he will carry me through.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I ſay; wherby a man being called by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> any ſervice does venture upon difficulties, either in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, or enduring evill; one would think that it were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55101:5"/>
a deſperate venture, but indeed a brave venture of the men of <hi>Jabiſh Gilead,</hi> which we read of, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> laſt, which <hi>fetcht away the dead body of</hi> Saul, <hi>out of the hands of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtimes,</hi> there being a great fight between the Iſraelites and Philiſtimes, the Philiſtimes had the beſt of it, kept the field, and buried the dead, and amongſt the dead they finde <hi>Saul,</hi>, they cut off his head, and faſtned his body to the wall of <hi>Bethſhan,</hi> and when the Inhabitants of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh Gilead</hi> heard of it, all the valiant men aroſe, and went and took the body of <hi>Saul</hi> from the wall of <hi>Bethſhan</hi>: here was valour, here was courage, wherein was it ſeen? in venturing upon difficulties in doing good, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring evill.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, I adde, all this muſt be done without feare; and therefore in Scripture theſe go together, <hi>Be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, feare not, neither be diſmayed.</hi> The more a mans fears are enlarged, the more his courage is leſſened, and the more a mans courage is enlarged, the more his fears are leſſened. <hi>Good courage,</hi> it makes a man higher by the head and ſhoulders, than the thing feared, though never ſo great; <hi>good courage</hi> lifts a man up above fear: Put alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and you have the deſcription of <hi>good courage:</hi> It is that gracious diſpoſition of heart, whereby a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called by God unto any ſervice, he does adventure upon difficulties, either in doing good, or enduring evill, and that without fear. Let us now advance to the ſecond thing, the confirmation of the Point.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Confirma. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note>In evill times, in times of danger, good courage is very requiſite: in times of danger, <hi>good courage</hi> is the ſtrength of man, it is the ſpirits of a man, it is the ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a mans heart, it is the life of ones life, ſayth <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, The ſpirit of a man ſhall ſuſtain his infirmity</hi>; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength there is no bearing of burthens; now this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55101:5"/>
is the way to be ſtrong, to ſtand under burthens in evill times: <hi>Be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, evill times are full of changes,<note place="margin">Fortis eſt que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> adverſa non frangunt forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eſt quem proſpera non alliciunt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimus eſt quem viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo rerum non deturbat.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> will keep us from the power of thoſe. It is a good ſpeech <hi>Seneca</hi> hath; He is a ſtout man whom adverſity doth not quaile, he is yet more ſtout whom proſperity doth not allure; but he is moſt ſtout of all, whom the change of things doth not diſturbe. And in another place (ſaith he) he hath no great minde, that can be bent by injuries; and evill times are full of injuries, without courage, a man will eaſily be bent by them,<note place="margin">Magnus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus eſt quem non incurvat injuria, Senec.</note> bent unto ſin, and bent unto what is evill. Had not the three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren been men of courage, how would they have beene bent to Idolatry; but being men of courage, ſay they, <hi>Our God is able to deliver us, but if not</hi>;<note place="margin">Dan. 3 17.18.</note>

            <p>Again, evill times are very expenſive, then a man ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be called to lay out much; his eſtate, his houſe, his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his body, his all; and no affection, no diſpoſition ſo ſpending as courage; good courage will make a man ſpend, and be ſpent for God: but if a man ſhould expend and lay out all upon other things, they will not be able to quit charges; good courage will make a man ſpend all on God; and be ſpent for God, as <hi>Paul</hi> was. Thus you ſee, that in evill times, good courage is very requiſite.</p>
            <p>If this be ſo, you ſee what our duty is;<note place="margin">Applica.</note> to <hi>be of good courage, and play the men.</hi> You all know into what evill times we are now falne, better than I can ſpeak; are we not berounded with many enemies, the <hi>Syrians</hi> before,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55101:6"/>
and the <hi>Ammonites</hi> behind, if <hi>Joab</hi> were alive hee could ſee the Battell before and behind. In the Prophets time he prayed <hi>that God would open the eyes of his ſervant, that he might ſee who were with him,</hi> now we had need to pray that God would open mens eyes to ſee who are againſt them: certainly enemies are amongſt us, within and without, at home and abroad, before and behind, they are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: now the people of God are in danger, now the Cities of God, and Religion is in hazard; and therefore as <hi>Joab</hi> once, ſo now I may ſpeak unto all; <hi>Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our People, and for the Cities of our God &amp; the Lord do that which ſeemeth him good. Be of good courage,</hi> that is my exhortation, notwithſtanding the times be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, yet <hi>be of good courage</hi>: good courage now if ever is requiſite, requiſite for Magiſtrates, requiſite for Miniſters, requiſite for parents, and governours of Families, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for theſe Gentlemen that have liſted their names for this great ſervice of God and their Country, requiſite for all the people.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Requiſite for Magiſtrates. <hi>Good courage</hi> is alwayes in a Magiſtrates Commiſſion, though times be never ſo peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they are to be men of <hi>courage fearing God,</hi> much more in troublous times; good courage is a vertue annexed to their place,<note place="margin">Aquin.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Miniſters, they muſt be of good courage. We read of divers valiant men, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.17, 18. who withſtood <hi>Uzziah</hi> the King, and ſaid unto him: <hi>It pertaineth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee Uziah to burn incenſe unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55101:6"/>
him, <hi>and with him fourſcore Prieſts of the Lord that were valiant men</hi>: wherein did their valour appeare? in that they withſtood the King, in doing that which was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, theſe were valiant Prieſts indeed, and it ſtands upon Record, and that for ever; in times neerer to our ſelves we read of Doctor <hi>Latimer,</hi> that when the men of his order were to ſend New-years gifts unto the King, he ſent a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with this poſie written on the outſide thereof, <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers and Adulterers God will judge:</hi> was not Mr. <hi>Dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> very bold with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who told her, <hi>that though ſhee once went, tanquam ovis ad lanienam, as a ſheep to the ſlaughter, yet now tanquam indomita juvenca, as an untam'd hiefer</hi>; in evill times, the Ordnance, and Murthering pieces are planted againſt the Houſe of the Miniſters, againſt them eſpecially, and therefore in them alſo good courage is very requiſite.</p>
            <p>Requiſite alſo in the third place for Parents and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of families. Otherwiſe if they have not good courage, they will quench the forwardneſſe, and zeal, and courage of thoſe that are under them. It is a lamentable thing that the carnall wiſdom of a wordly parent ſhould be the quench coale of the gratious devotion of a godly child. <hi>Granatenſis</hi> makes mention of a woman, that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſon run away in the Field, ſhe got ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of him, and put him to death with theſe words; <hi>Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away, thou art none of mine.</hi> And of another woman that when her ſon was ſlaine in the Battell, ſhe being at the Funerall with divers friends; ſome wept and cryed <hi>ô duram fortunam,</hi> O hard fortune, ſhe cryed, <hi>ô felicem fortunam,</hi> O happy fortune, <hi>that ever I was ſo honoured to beare a child to dye ſo bravely for his Country.</hi> Parents muſt have courage, and there are theſe three things to move parents; and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of families unto it: the danger that is now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55101:7"/>
the Proteſtation that you have taken, the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eiall opportunity that you have.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> You that are Parents and governours of Families have the greater opportunity of ſerving the Common-wealth, and Churches and people of God then others. Your children are your goods, nothing is ſo much a mans own, as his childe, your children are your beſt houſhold ſtuffe: One obſerving, that it was the manner and faſhion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpangle their cupboords with plate, when they made any feaſts; when he was to make a feaſt, he got his children and ſet them on his cupboards head, the Gueſts asking the reaſon why he did ſo? ſaith he, <hi>theſe are my plate.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, you have given your plate already to the ſervice of your Countrey; what if God will have this plate alſo to be given unto him?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Again, the danger that is now approaching; may move you unto this: you know the greatneſſe of the danger, how we are begirt with the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and ſhould the <hi>Ammonites</hi> prevaile (I mean that malignant Juſuiticall party prevaile) in the Kingdome, what a dark and blacke day would it be upon <hi>England?</hi> the Lord be thanked we know partly what a comfort it is, to ſet under our Vines and Fig-trees; but ſhould they prevaile, what would they do, yea what would they not do? the honour and ſafety of our dear Soveraign, the liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the ſecurity of the Parliament, the Peace of the three Kingdoms, the power and liberty of the Ordinances; theſe are great mercies, and much to be prized by us; and me thinks every one ſhould ſit down and think with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, what ſhall I give or do, that my perſon ſhould not be enſlaved? that my wife and daughters be not abuſed, that my poor children be not maſſacred, that my houſe be not plundred, that my Country be not betrayed? oh
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55101:7"/>
if there be any ſpirit, or valour and courage in any childe or ſervant, to ſerve God and his Countrey, go on, oh childe and proſper, do couragiouſly.</p>
            <p>Then again, beſides this; you may remember the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that you have made; you have Proteſted before the Lord, and the world (or ſhould have done) that you will maintain, and defend the Perſon of our King, the liberty of the Law and Subject, the Parliament, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion; and ſhall you not give up your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſervants, though never ſo dear and faithfull to make good your Proteſtation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But me thinkes I hear ſome ſay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
               <hi>it is a hard thing to part with my childe, my only ſonne, my onely joy; the comfort and ſtay of mine age; oh it is a hard thing to part with a childe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and wouldſt ſerve God and thy Countrey with nothing? is that childe loſt that Chriſt gains? I remember <hi>Origen</hi> obſerves, that when <hi>Abraham</hi> gave up <hi>Iſaac</hi> unto God; and put the knife to his throat to offer him up as a ſacrifice to him, then the Lord found him a Ram, another ſacrifice, and gave <hi>Iſaac</hi> again unto him; and (ſaith he) that which you give unto God, you ſhall receive from God; if you can give up your childe, and lift up your hand with a knife to offer him up unto him, the Lord will give you that childe, and that childe above others, ſhall be the father of many gracious. Me thinks I heare that ſpeech ſounding in mine ears; <hi>Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them, they ſhall not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but they ſhall ſpeak with the enemies in the gate</hi>;<note place="margin">Pſal. 127.5.</note> your children are the arrowes that the Lord hath given you into your quiver, if they be ready upon the ſtring, will you breake theſe arrowes, or the ſpirits of them? they are made a purpoſe to meet your Adverſary in the gate; and now the Adverſary is in the gate, will you not let the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55101:8"/>
arrow flie? Oh, me thinks there ſhould not be a father or Maſter that hath a childe or ſervant, but ſhould ſay, I will ſend one Voluntier; what were it for ſuch a Town as this to have two or three hundred? but I know your readines, the Lord bleſſe it; onely I leave the exhortation of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> with you, the words a little altered, <hi>Be of good courage, and if you cannot play the men your ſelves, let your children and ſervants play the men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, The exhortation looks upon them that have liſted themſelves in this great ſervice of God, and their Countrey, in theſe dangerous times: Brethren I have need for to ſpeak to you, and my commiſſion eſpecially is to ſpeak to you, I had need do it; for have not ſome freely offered themſelves to this work, yet ſhamefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted it again? I ſay ſhamefully, for what greater ſhame? <hi>Marcus Craſſus</hi> amongſt the Romans, cauſed the cowards to be let bloud, giving this reaſon; that it was fit their bloud ſhould be ſhed in diſgrace, which they would not ſhed in defence of their Countrey; and if you look <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.3. you ſhall finde, that when the hoaſt of the <hi>Midianites</hi> came againſt the <hi>Iſraelites, Gideon</hi> had gotten a good and well framed Army together, but when word came from the Lord, that the fearfull ſhould return, how many think you did return of them? ſurely, no leſſe than two parts of three, the whole Army conſiſting of 32000; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſtory tells us, That 22000 <hi>of them went back, and but</hi> 10000 <hi>left,</hi> 22000 not aſhamed to be called cowards and fearfull: ſo that I ſay, that I had need to ſpeak to you, and to you is my commiſſion, and if you pleaſe you may read my Commiſſion, and your own duty together, 20 <hi>Deu.</hi> 2.3. <hi>And it ſhall be when ye are come nigh unto the Battell, that the Priest ſhall approach and ſpeak unto the people; not the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but the Prieſt?</hi> what ſayes the Prieſt? Let not your
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55101:8"/>
hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be you terrified becauſe of them: therfore you ſee what I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſpeak unto you; well good ſirs, and beloved in the Lord Jeſus, be you alſo of good courage; and I have three words of encouragement to ſpeak unto you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, your worke and ſervice you are about, it is very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> honourable. It is obſerved to my hand, that when <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> built the Temple, he did not employ the Iſraelites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the meaner works, carrying of ſtones, and drawing of water, ſtrangers were put to that worke, but the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites were employed to be a guard about him: ſo did the moſt wiſe man in the world, <hi>Solomon</hi> count it an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing to bear arms, and to be a ſouldier: anciently ſouldiers were called <hi>Latrones,</hi> becauſe they were <hi>a Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Regis,</hi> and now the latine word <hi>miles</hi> for a ſouldier, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Knight: when the children of Iſrael went out to Battell, ſome there were that went into the Field and ſome that did ſtay at home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerning thoſe that ſtayed at home, it is ſayd, that <hi>ſhe that tarryed at home devided the ſpoile,</hi> Pſalm. 68.12. as if they were only women, and the weaker ſort that ſtayed at home, as if all that were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called men went into the Field. In the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing Pſalm of <hi>Deborah,</hi> we read, that ſome are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſome commended, thoſe that were condemned, were ſuch as came not forth, that came not forth to <hi>helpe the Lord againſt the mighty,</hi> Judges, 5.23. Thoſe that were commended, were the Voluntiers that offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves willingly amongſt the People, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. and 9. The truth is that the Volunteers of <hi>England</hi> under God, are the Bullwarks of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> under God, the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of the Proteſtant Religion: Wherefore, honoured Brethren, be ye all of good courage, for your worke and ſervice is very honorable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:55101:9"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And as your worke is honorable, ſo your worke is ſaſe. In times of war, the ſafeſt place is the Camp, and whilſt that thoſe of poor ſpirits, that love onely to be in their beds, and in their houſes, ſhall be pillaged and plundered, men of brave ſpirits that are willing to be in the Field ſhall be ſecured. A valiant and couragious minde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all thing, ſayes <hi>Seneca</hi>: he that commandeth death commandeth all things, as the valiant man doth. Now Beloved, you ſee into what times we are fallen, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity things muſt either go well or ill: if things go ill, the worſt is death, and what great matter is it to dye for your God, a little before your time, who would live when Religion is dead? who would live to out-live his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us of ſome <hi>Indians</hi> that having many wives, when the husband dyed the wifes ſtrived to be burned with him, and ſhe that was the ſtrongeſt prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be burned, and the reſt went away very ſorrowfull as having met with a great loſſe that they might not be burned with their husband; and do you deſire to live a day after the proteſtant Religion, that you have bin marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too now for many yeers together? It is no great matter to live, the beaſts, birds, and fiſhes live, this is truly great to dye well, honorably freely, wiſely, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, It is better to dye in the Field for the cauſe of God, then die in ones bed, by the hand of a ſickneſſe. It is ſtoried of one <hi>Bibulus,</hi> a great Roman, that having obtained many victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he came to <hi>Rome</hi> to ride in triumph, where a Tile fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off the houſe, ſtroke him ſo deeply and mortally into the head, as he dyed of it. Thus may you dye by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Tile as you walk in the ſtreets, or by the turning of ſome humour in your bodies; and is it not better then to dye for the truth? Can you loſe too much for Chriſt that hath loſt ſo much for you? Death is the worſt.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55101:9"/>
And if things go well, I cannot but thinke it will go with the popiſh Maligant party, as once with the Freiſlanders, when the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> had overcome them, they took up Arms to reſiſt him again; whereupon he ordered,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Nether.</note> that the doors of their houſes ſhould be made ſo low, as they ſhould alwayes ſtoop when they went in, noting their ſubjection; ſo though the mercy of thoſe that are in authority may let the houſes of Malignants ſtand, yet I make no queſtion, but the doors of their houſes ſhall be made ſo low, that they ſhall alwayes ſtoop, as a note of their ſubjection; whil'ſt you that ſtand for the cauſe, and Countrey, and <hi>Cities of your God,</hi> ſhall have the doors of your houſes enlarged; and if a good cauſe have any intereſt in Heaven, and the prayers of Gods people hath any credit there, you ſhall undoubtedly in the end prevail; wherefore be of good courage, for your work is ſafe.</p>
            <p>And as your worke is ſafe, ſo it is alſo warrantable. I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> know it is objected, <hi>They take up Arms againſt their King.</hi> I am perſwaded there is not ſuch a thought in the boſoms of any of you all, and God forbid there ſhould: but there is much difference between taking up of Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kings Perſon, and taking up of Arms for the defence of the Kingdom, without the Kings command. <hi>David</hi> though he were Gods annointed, yet he was a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto <hi>Saul</hi> his King, and he tooke up Arms to defend himſelfe; he tooke up Arms indeed, but if you looke into 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.19. you ſhall finde that <hi>David</hi> does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that unnaturall warre that <hi>Saul</hi> his King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, to thoſe wicked malignants and wicked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about him; <hi>If the Lord hath ſtirred thee up againſt mee, let him accept an offering; but if they be the children of men, curſed be they before the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> He does not ſay the King had done it, but layes it upon thoſe that were
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55101:10"/>
about him, and therefore tooke up Arms to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt the malignants; <hi>Davids</hi> example is our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: and certainly if the Parliament ſhould not have a power to ſend for thoſe by force of Arms which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed before them for their juſt tryall, they ſhould no longer be a Parliament; every Court of Juſtice have a power to ſend for by force, men accuſed to be tryed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now the Parliament as King <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, is the higheſt Court of Juſtice; therfore accrding to the known priviledge of Parliament, they do ſend Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant at Arms for thoſe that are acccuſed, to be tryed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and if they have power to ſend out one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant at Arms, then they have power alſo to ſend forth a hundred, and ſo a thouſand, and ſo ten thouſand if need require; and if the accuſed perſons gather into an Army, how can the Parliament ſend for them but by an Army? ſo that when you conſider the Law of the Land, or the Law of God; or the Law of nature, which is for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to defend it ſelfe, your way and courſe is very warrantable, your cauſe is good, for that muſt needs be good that Religion maketh ſo; your enemies are weake, for they muſt needs be weake that ſin makes weak; your victory is certain, which the Scripture promiſeth, and firſt or laſt the victory ſhall be to you. Put all together, your cauſe is good, your enemies weake, your victory certain, your ſervice honorable, ſafe, warrantable; wherefore, <hi>Be of good courage, and play the men, for your people, and the Cities of our God, and the Lord do with you what ſeemeth him good.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, This exhortation looketh upon all that heareth me this day, men, women, and children, be you all of good courage in theſe ſad times, notwithſtanding the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of the times, <hi>fear not, neither be diſmayed.</hi> Did the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55101:10"/>
Lord do his work by halfs, when he brought the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> notwithſtanding for mens unbelief ſome fell in the way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet he brought them into <hi>Canaan.</hi> Beloved, you are now again coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (for the Romiſh ſuperſtition, and that part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is called <hi>Egypt, Sodome, Babylon:</hi> you are now coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi>) marching up into the promiſed Land, and promiſed Ordinances; nothing can make you fall in the way, but unbelief: wherfore be all of good courage, and pray unto the Lord. Be all of good courage; thereby you ſhall be able to ſet upon great things for God, though never ſo great; thereby you ſhall endure great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, though never ſo heavy; thereby you ſhall be untired, and unwearyed in the ſervice of God, though the oppoſition be never ſo ſtrong; thereby you ſhall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Cauſe; thereby you ſhall conquer your enemies; thereby you ſhall encourage others, your courage ſhall beget courage; your courage will have an influence upon all the Towns round about you, and make them of good courage, as I make no queſtion but the courage and valour of <hi>London</hi> have had an influence upon your hearts, to make you couragious: ſo your courage will have upon others; what will they ſay when they come into Towns, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home again? I will tell you what, I was at ſuch a Town, and there they were working; and fortifying their Town for their Countrey and King, and I ſaw the beſt mans ſon in the Town go to the work, and the beſt mans daughter in the Town carry a basket; and father, and mother, ſhall we ſit ſtill? therefore put on, let the work ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver die for want of money; let not ſuch a Town as we are; be baſe, be poor, &amp; low, &amp; want courage? when on the one ſide ye have the Sea, on the other ſide the River, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the walls, on the other ſide I hope friends; within
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55101:11"/>
abundance of good people, and above a loving God; oh therefore put on, be all of good courage; I do but adde ſome directions, and ſo winde up all.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, be ſure of this, That you make ſure of God to be with you; I mean, not only in the generall cauſes, but in your particular, clear up your propriety to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. When <hi>David</hi> was in a great ſtraight, his enemies had broken in upon him, taken away his wives, and then plundred all he had, his own Souldiers began to mutiny, and thought of ſtoning him; what did he do? it is ſaid, <hi>he encouraged himſelfe in the Lord his God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 30.6.</note> therefore, firſt make ſure of this, cleare up this your propriety in God himſelfe. The ſight of a great God under intereſt, will encourage your ſpirits, though dangers be nere ſo great.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Never go out upon any deſigne without Gods promiſe, Gods promiſe of aſſiſtance, acceptance, and ſucceſſe: <hi>Joſhua</hi> was a valiant man, and brave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and yet we read of him, 7 <hi>Joſhua,</hi> when ſome thirty men were ſlain; and others fled, he fell down upon the earth much diſcouraged; why? the Lord had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed he would never leave him, nor forſake him, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſhould not be able to ſtand before him; but hee had loſt the promiſe that God had given to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was diſcouraged; but the Lord comes to him and ſaith, <hi>what doſt here?</hi> and brings him to the view of the promiſe again; and then a new ſpirit and new life came into him; Gods promiſe is your encouragement, keepe that alwayes in your eye.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, take heed of all thoſe things that will debaſe your ſpirits; theſe are three things eſpecially: idleneſſe, wordlineſſe,<note place="margin">otium eſt vivi hominis ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pultura.</note> falſe courage. As for idleneſſe (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) it is the burying of a living man.</p>
            <p>As for wordlineſſe (ſaith <hi>Aquinas</hi>) it doth effeminate,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55101:11"/>
and ſet a man below himſelf. And falſe courage is a true enemy to true courage, if courage be layd upon the ſenſe of the ſecond cauſe, when there is an ebbe of the ſecond cauſe, there is an ebbe of your courage.</p>
            <p>There were two ſorts of ſpyes that went into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>: as for the firſt, we do not read of any hard uſe they met withall, and yet they were much diſcouraged, and diſcouraged the people: ſaying, the men of the Country are Giants, the Cities are walled up to Heaven, and the Inhabitants ride in Charets of iron: the other ſpyes met with ill uſe, and had not <hi>Rahab</hi> hid them, they had been every man cut off, and yet they returned with good courage, and ſo encouraged the people, ſaying, <hi>the men ſhall be meat unto us, &amp;c.</hi> what is the reaſon of this? one would thinke rather that the firſt ſort ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and the laſt diſcouraged, but it was not ſo, the reaſon is this, the firſt ſpyes that were diſcouraged, looked only upon the men and walls, and iron Charets, went out in the way of ſenſe, but as for the other ſpyes, they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon God, upon his promiſe, and upon his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in delivering of them, and thereupon returned, and ſaid, <hi>the men of the Land are meat unto us,</hi> &amp;c. Would you not be diſcouraged, but encouraged, take heed how you raiſe, or how you lay your courage upon ſecond cauſes: take heed of all thoſe things that may debaſe your ſpirits, idleneſſe, wordlineſſe, and courage layd upon ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>Again, Be ſure of this that you keep your conſcience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> clear: A bad conſcience is very timerous, <hi>the righteous are as bold as a Lion,</hi> but the unrighteous that have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience left are as fearfull as a Doe, be ſure therefore that you keep your conſcience cleer.</p>
            <p>And then again, keep and improove all the experiences <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:55101:12"/>
of Gods delivering mercy. Beloved, how many delivering mercies have God wrought for us the laſt yeare, truly it may be ſaid it hath been the <hi>annus mirabilis,</hi> year of wonders; and all the year long God hath been known to <hi>England</hi> by this Name, A wonder-working God: when any temptations ariſe to diſcourage, anſwer, Surely, if the Lord had meant to deſtroy us, he would never have done all this: experienced men are moſt couragious; onely make uſe of your experience as a ſtirrup to get up your ſpirits to the promiſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Again, Actuate, refreſh, and ſtrengthen your love. True love is very valiant, ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Love ſuffers all things, it does all things,</hi> as one obſerves concerning a Sheep, though it be ſo feeble and fearfull a creature, that a little dog will make a whole flock run before it, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding you ſhall ſee, That if a great maſty comes to take away a Lamb from the Ewe, the Ewe will ſtamp, and run at him; why? love puts it on: Do you therfore love your Countrey? I know you do: Do you love the people of God? I preſume you do: Do you love the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of God? I believe you do: often actuate, refreſh, and ſtrengthen your love, this will give courage.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the laſt place, When ever any diſcouraging temptations ariſe, before ever you parly with thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and temptations, ſtep in to God by prayer: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, if you firſt parly with difficulties before you go to prayer, you will never have done; a thouſand Objections will be created in your mindes; whereas if you firſt go to prayer before you parly with them, in prayer you ſhall have the ſight of a great God; and the ſight of a great God, will make your ſpirits great. In prayer your heart ſhall be compoſed; for prayer is a ſoul-compoſing duty. In prayer you ſhall meet with the Captain of your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55101:12"/>
and he will leade up your hearts that are ready to run away. In prayer you ſhall bring your ſouls to this frame, quietly to reſign up your ſelves, and cauſe, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe unto God, and a man is never more couragious than in that frame, as <hi>Joabs</hi> courage and reſignation went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Are you preſented with any difficulty and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging temptation? then ſay within your ſelves, it is true indeed, to attain to ſuch an event; certainly it will be hard, notwithſtanding I know that my cauſe is good, my work is good, the people good; and therfore, though the difficulties and temptations be never ſo great, I will give my ſelfe to prayer, and praying courage is good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. Wherefore my beloved, in the name of the Lord pray, in theſe evill times, pray, pray, pray; and when you have done praying, then wait: <hi>wait on the Lord, and be of good courage, and again I ſay waite on the Lord:</hi> and what I ſay unto one, I deſire to ſpeake unto my own ſoule, and ſo unto you all in theſe ſad and evill times, <hi>be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the Cities of our God, and the Lord do with us what ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him good.</hi>
